The UN has repeatedly denounced the US-Israel “humanitarian” operation and called it a “distraction.”

U.S. military veteran Jake Wood has resigned from his position as executive director of the so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) just weeks after its launch, amid heavy criticism from organizations that say that the U.S.- and Israel-backed group will hinder, not help, aid delivery in the starvation-stricken enclave.

Wood cited concerns over violations of “humanitarian principles” in implementing the work of the foundation, which has been denounced by the UN and other major humanitarian groups who have fought for the right to deliver aid to Palestinians in Gaza for the past 20 months, and for years before the genocide.

“I am proud of the work I oversaw, including developing a pragmatic plan that could feed hungry people, address security concerns about diversion, and complement the work of longstanding NGOs in Gaza,” said Wood in a statement on Monday.

“However, it is clear that it is not possible to implement this plan while also strictly adhering to the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence, which I will not abandon,” the former U.S. marine went on. “I urge Israel to significantly expand the provision of aid into Gaza through all mechanisms.”

The group said in a statement after Wood's resignation that it is beginning aid delivery in Gaza despite Wood's resignation. 

The Israeli military said on Tuesday that the foundation, in collaboration with a private U.S. military company, is beginning operation of two aid centers. Shortly after they opened, reports found that shots had been fired at one of the aid points as large crowds of ailing Palestinians gathered in hopes of receiving aid.

Though Wood cited humanitarian concerns for his resignation, he perhaps ignored that the U.S.-Israel plan for GHF has been condemned since the moment it was announced as a way for Israel to further its control over Gaza and push out any entities not entirely at the whim of Israeli leaders.

Indeed, just after the plan was announced earlier this month, the UN said that the operation “does not accord with our basic principles, including those of impartiality, neutrality [and] independence.”

Still, Wood defended the plan in the media, insisting that it was the only way to ensure that Palestinians get the aid they need — without acknowledging Israel's singular role in denying aid and creating the current humanitarian catastrophe.

On Tuesday, the UN once again denounced the operation, calling it a “distraction from what is actually needed” and reiterating that no UN entities will be participating in the scheme.

Indeed, as Israel touts the opening of the distribution points, UN officials have highlighted that they still have thousands of trucks of aid that are waiting at the border for entry.

“We have over 3,000 trucks, not only of food, but also medicines that are lining up in places like Jordan, like Egypt, that are waiting for the green light to go in, and they're carrying medicines and that is expiring soon,” said UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) spokesperson ​​Juliette Touma. 

The collaboration with the GHF is yet another way that the Israeli government seeks to push the UN and established humanitarian groups out of Gaza. 

In a letter released Tuesday, UNRWA head Philippe Lazzarini again urged Israel to end its “disinformation campaign” against the agency — the central group providing and coordinating aid for Palestinians. Israel has not provided a shred of evidence for its claims against the agency, Lazzarini said, in over 20 months of accusations of criminality that the government is nonetheless using to disenfranchise the agency.

MOSCOW, May 27. /TASS/. Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev responded to US President Donald Trump's social media post that said Vladimir Putin is "playing with fire."

"Regarding Trump's words about Putin ‘playing with fire' and ‘really bad things' happening to Russia. I only know of one REALLY BAD thing — WWIII. I hope Trump understands this!" the Russian official said on X.

Trump said earlier on Tuesday that if it weren't for him "really bad things would have already happened to Russia." He said the Russian leader didn't understand that. The US president described this alleged lack of understanding as "playing with fire."

The U.S. Department of State has issued new travel advisories for American citizens visiting Italy and Belgium due to the “risk of terrorist violence,” upgrading both countries to a Level 2 warning.

“Terrorists may attack with little or no warning,” the embassy bulletin said, adding that common targets may include public areas such as transportation centers, shopping malls, markets, tourist areas, local government offices, hotels, clubs, restaurants, and other sites.

The State Department did not explain why both countries were upgraded to “Level 2 - Exercise Increased Caution.”

There are four levels of travel advisories: Level 1 – Exercise Normal Precautions, Level 2 – Exercise Increased Caution, Level 3 – Reconsider Travel, and Level 4 – Do Not Travel. The highest level is usually reserved for war zones, countries with authoritarian governments, or areas with excessive criminal activity, such as kidnappings.

It comes as some countries in Europe have issued stronger advisories on traveling to the United States in recent months, including the UK and Germany.

A criminal convicted in the United States, overstaying a visa for a short period, giving false information, or other offenses can lead to arrest, detention, and deportation, Germany's foreign office further warned.

“Any further questions concerning entry into the USA should be clarified with the relevant U.S. diplomatic mission abroad well in advance of departure,” the office said.

“You may be liable to arrest or detention if you break the rules. If you're not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the U.S. Embassy or a consulate in the UK,” the country's government said.

Doctors have kept Adriana Smith on breathing machines for three months due to the state's “heartbeat law.”

A 30-year-old Black woman in Georgia has been kept on life support for three months against her family's wishes because of the state's “fetal heartbeat” anti-abortion law. Adriana Smith was declared legally dead in February after a medical emergency caused her brain function to cease. Smith, a nurse, had been initially turned away when she first sought medical care. She was nine weeks pregnant at the time. But because her medical providers would face legal consequences including jail time if they were to end the pregnancy, Smith's body is still being kept on breathing machines despite the fact that Smith herself can no longer be resuscitated. The case demonstrates once again that “it is deadly to be Black and pregnant,” says Monica Simpson of the reproductive justice organization SisterSong.

AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.

We turn now to Georgia, where there's growing concern about the plight of a pregnant woman who's been declared brain dead but has kept on life support for three months against the wishes of her distraught family because of Georgia's abortion ban. Adriana Smith is a 30-year-old mother and nurse who suffered a medical emergency in February due to blood clots in the brain, was declared legally dead. At that point, she was about nine weeks pregnant. She's now about 22 weeks pregnant, but doctors have kept her on breathing machines because her fetus was old enough to have detectable cardiac activity. Georgia's “heartbeat law” bans abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected.

This comes as Georgia's attorney general has said Georgia's heartbeat bill does not require medical professionals to keep a woman on life support after brain death, and issued a terse statement that, quote, “Removing life support is not an action ‘with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy.'”

Georgia's maternal and infant mortality rates are among the worst in the country, with Black women dying at twice the rate of white women.

We're joined now by two guests. In Washington, D.C., Mini Timmaraju is with us, president of Reproductive Freedom for All, formerly NARAL Pro-Choice America. And in Atlanta, we're joined by Monica Simpson, executive director of SisterSong, the national women of color reproductive justice collective that's based in Georgia, has a lawsuit against Georgia, arguing its six-week abortion ban is denying people in Georgia lifesaving care.

We welcome you both back to Democracy Now! Monica Simpson, let's begin with you. Can you talk about the situation right now, what the family wants for their beloved, brain-dead loved one who is pregnant and who doctors are keeping on life support?

MONICA SIMPSON: Thank you so much for having me.

It is a dire situation that we're dealing with here in Georgia. And we are constantly having to navigate this system that keeps showing us over and over again that it is deadly to be Black and pregnant in this state, where access to care is so far out of reach for so many people, and the limitations and the criminalization that we are constantly navigating now with this abortion ban is something that Georgians did not want, and it's something that we are constantly doing all that we can to push back against.

Adriana deserved to be here. What we know about her story is that she did what she knew what to do as a nurse. When she found out and she could feel in her own body that something was wrong, she went to the doctor. She went to get the care that she needed, and she was sent home. Now, if the doctors would have been — did everything they could, maybe we would have been able to get a different outcome for Adriana. But, unfortunately, that's not what happened, because, unfortunately, that's not what happens for so many Black women in this country. They are not trusted when they are going into their doctor's offices. They're not trusted when they are saying that there's something wrong with their bodies. They're not trusted when they are saying that they need access to care. And, unfortunately, that's what happened to Adriana.

And so, now her family is battling such a hard time. They should be able to grieve. They should be able to take care of themselves and all of the family members who are having to deal with this ordeal. But, unfortunately, they're having to navigate so many unanswered questions. They're having to navigate something they shouldn't have to, which is an abortion ban that's connected to this issue, that should not even be at play at this particular moment.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And in Georgia, we're talking about one of the states that has among the worst maternal and infant mortality rates in the country, particularly for African American women and children. Could you talk about that?

MONICA SIMPSON: Absolutely. We are dealing in Georgia with maternal health deserts, right? Over half of our counties do not have access to an OB-GYN, so care is out of reach for so many. We are also a state that has yet to expand Medicaid, and we know, federally, we are still fighting for Medicaid to be something that Americans have access to, which means that there are thousands of people upon thousands of people who are falling in the cracks every single day, not having access to basic healthcare needs. So, when you add that to a state that has now put a six-week abortion ban in place, it makes it a very, very harsh environment for folks to be able to get access to what they need in terms of their reproductive healthcare.

AMY GOODMAN: I mean, it is amazing. Georgia's Attorney General Chris Carr released a statement declaring that the six-week abortion ban doesn't require medical professionals to keep women alive on life support after they've been declared brain dead, Monica.

MONICA SIMPSON: What I find very interesting about the times that we are in is that this abortion ban has created so many obstacles for people. There has been too many people who have tried to figure out what it means, when it means that, and that is the problem that we're dealing with here. It is not cut and dry. It is not black and white. It is something that we're having to constantly navigate over and over again.

At the end of last year, we lost two more Black women because of what this abortion ban put in place for them in terms of a barrier. We lost Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, right? These are two Black women who were also pregnant in our state that wanted to terminate a pregnancy and came up against the very real barriers that this abortion ban puts in place for folks.

And so, what is happening constantly, as we are getting these stories, as we're understanding what the landscape is really looking like for people in Georgia because this abortion ban is in place, is that it is not a cut and dry — we're not getting cut-and-dry answers here. We are dealing with folks who are in real time having to navigate too many questions, whenever it should be that we should have access to the real-time healthcare that we need in order for us to be able to thrive and to live our most healthy lives in Georgia. And that is not the case with this abortion ban that is currently in place.

Decision was initially announced in February by Milei following Trump's footsteps

Argentina has ratified its decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization (WHO) during a visit to Buenos Aires by the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr.

The decision to pull out of the WHO was initially announced in February by Argentina's president, Javier Milei, following in the footsteps of his US counterpart Donald Trump who had said in January the United States would withdraw.

Milei's government justified its departure from the UN agency in a statement on Monday.

“The WHO's prescriptions do not work because they are not based on science but on political interests and bureaucratic structures that refuse to review their own mistakes,” the statement said.

Buenos Aires has previously accused the agency of “disastrous” management during the Covid pandemic with its “caveman quarantine”.

The announcement came as Kennedy and the Argentinian health minister, Mario Lugones, met to define “a joint work agenda that will strengthen transparency and trust in the health system”.

“Together with Robert Kennedy, we believe in the future of collaboration in global health. We have similar visions about the path forward,” Lugones said.

Kennedy, a controversial Trump pick for health secretary given his vaccine skepticism, is also expected to meet with Milei during his visit.

In a video broadcast at the WHO's annual assembly last week, he urged other governments to withdraw from the agency and create other institutions.

In his speech, Kennedy alleged that the UN health agency was under undue influence from China, gender ideology and the pharmaceutical industry.

The Argentinian government also announced a “structural review” of national health agencies to “organize, update, and make transparent the structures and processes” of the health system “that for years operated with overlaps, outdated regulations and limited oversight”.

Former gymnast was released after posting bond

Retton won five medals at 1984 Summer Olympics

Olympic gymnastics champion Mary Lou Retton was arrested for DUI earlier this month, according to records on the West Virginia Judiciary website.

The 57-year-old was charged with “driving under influence of alcohol, controlled substances, or drugs” on 17 May after police responded to reports of someone driving a Porsche erratically. According to the records, Retton was slurring her words when police stopped her, and officers saw a container of wine on the passenger seat of her car. She refused to take a breath test, and was released after posting a $1,500 bond.

Retton became a household name in the US after she won five medals at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, including a gold in the all-around competition – the first individual Olympic gymnastics medal ever won by an American – scoring a perfect 10 on the vault in the final rotation. The West Virginia native's performance landed her on the front of Wheaties boxes and keyed the sport's explosion in popularity in the United States.

After her gymnastics career, Retton remained active in the media, appearing in a number of films and TV shows. She was inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame in 1997 and was the first woman to be selected into the Houston Sports Hall of Fame in 2020.

Retton also served on the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports under US president George W Bush.

In 2023, she fell seriously ill with pneumonia and was in ICU for a number of weeks. At the time her daughter Kelley said her mother was “fighting for her life” and started a fundraiser to cover medical costs for Retton, who did not have medical insurance. Donations to the fundraiser ended up totaling nearly $500,000. Retton recovered but said she had “faced death in the eyes” during her illness.

MOSCOW, May 27. /TASS/. The Ukraine peace process is in its early stages and is still very tenuous, making German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's statements about lifting long-range weapons restrictions on Kiev especially perilous, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.

Peskov pointed out that the German chancellor "confused everyone, and maybe was confused himself," as government officials had said the exact opposite the day before. "But, as you see, he persists and insists that such a decision has indeed been made and that Ukraine has been given permission to carry out attacks deep inside Russia with long-range missiles," the spokesman said.

"If this is true, then it is an extremely dangerous decision. It moves us several steps closer to direct confrontation and, of course, runs counter to the tenuous peace settlement efforts that have just begun," he emphasized.

Peskov added that instead of creating "uncertainty" for Russia, as it is trying to do, it will only create uncertainty for itself. "This uncertainty will become a burden for them. Let's see if they can cope with it," the spokesman noted.

Earlier, Merz said that Germany and its allies, France and the United Kingdom, had allowed Ukraine to use their long-range missiles to attack deep within Russian territory.

King Charles III used a significant speech in Canada's parliament on Tuesday to underscore the country's sovereignty following pressure from US President Donald Trump.
    


            “Today, Canada faces another critical moment. Democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, self-determination, and freedom are values which Canadians hold dear, and ones which the Government is determined to protect,” the king said from the throne in the Senate chamber as he delivered a speech, which laid out the Canadian government's legislative agenda for the year ahead.
    


            Charles, 76, is on a two-day trip to Canada, the first time he has visited the country since assuming the throne in 2022. He is the head of state in Canada and 13 other Commonwealth realms, as well as in the United Kingdom.
    


            It was the first time in nearly 50 years that a sovereign had delivered the address and was seen by many as a powerful show of support for Canada.
    


            King Charles' remarks comes as Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to annex Canada and make it the 51st state — a move which Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has repeatedly rebuffed.

            During the roughly 26-minute address, which was written by the Canadian government, Charles spoke of the several challenges the nation faced. “The system of open global trade that, while not perfect, has helped to deliver prosperity for Canadians for decades, is changing. Canada's relationships with partners are also changing.”
    


            King Charles discussed the changing relationship between Canada and the United States.
    


            “The Prime Minister and the President of the United States, for example, have begun defining a new economic and security relationship between Canada and the U.S., rooted in mutual respect and founded on common interests, to deliver transformational benefits for both sovereign nations,” he said.
    


            Charles also referenced protecting Canada's sovereignty, saying that the government would look at “rebuilding, rearming, and reinvesting in the Canadian Armed Forces.”
    


            He said the government “will boost Canada's defence industry by joining ReArm Europe, to invest in transatlantic security with Canada's European partners. And it will invest to strengthen its presence in the North, which is an integral part of Canada, as this region faces new threats.”
    


            The monarch added: “The government will discharge its duty to protect Canadians and their sovereign rights, from wherever challenges may come at home or abroad.”
    


            King Charles on Tuesday also emphasized that “the Crown has for so long been a symbol of unity for Canada,” adding that “it also represents stability and continuity from the past to the present.”
    


            Charles and his wife, Camilla, made their way to parliament by carriage through the streets of the capital.
    


            As the king formally opened a new session of parliament, he outlined some of Carney's other priorities, which also focused on domestic issues such as more affordable housing, a tax cut for the middle class and the removal of barriers to interprovincial trade — themes the prime minister promised voters during the recent election campaign.
    


            The king alternated between speaking in English and French – the two official languages of Canada – and received a standing ovation after wrapping up the speech.
    


            Jeffrey Dvorkin, journalist and senior fellow at Massey College in Toronto, described the speech as a “delicate balancing act” after the recent unwanted attention from Trump, but one that touched upon key issues and tensions in Canada.

            “What it also did — really quite deliberately — was send a message to the administration of Donald Trump that the country is going to go in a somewhat different direction than it has in the past,” he told CNN.
    


             “Geography has been the greatest uniting force. But now under Prime Minister Carney, Canadians are looking overseas for a different set of connections without necessarily separating from the best connections that Canada has with the United States,” he continued.
    


            “But it certainly was a message to the Trump administration that those days of Canada accepting everything that the United States tries to do, those days are over.”
    


            King Charles and Queen Camilla were warmly welcomed on the tarmac as the couple touched down in Ottawa on Monday afternoon by Carney and Canadian Governor General Mary Simpson, the monarch's representative in the country.
    


            On Monday, Carney – who was elected in March largely on an anti-Trump platform - praised the “historic ties” between Canada and the United Kingdom which “crises only fortify.”

The lawsuit described the order as a retaliatory infringement of First Amendment rights.

NPR sued U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday over his recent executive order aiming to end federal funding for the outlet, a move that the lawsuit calls an illegal attack that “threatens the existence of a public radio system that millions of Americans across the country rely on for vital news and information.”

Colorado Public Radio, KSUT Public Radio, and Roaring Fork Public Radio joined NPR in filing the legal challenge, which also names White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.

“The order is unlawful in multiple ways,” the lawsuit states. “It flatly contravenes statutes duly enacted by Congress and violates the Separation of Powers and the Spending Clause by disregarding Congress' express commands. It also violates the First Amendment's guarantees of freedom of speech and of the press.”

“The order aims to punish NPR for the content of news and other programming the president dislikes and chill the exercise of First Amendment rights by NPR and individual public radio stations across the country,” the suit continues. “The order is textbook retaliation and viewpoint-based discrimination in violation of the First Amendment.”

Trump's May 1 executive order instructed the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which is funded by Congress, to end both direct and indirect funding to NPR and PBS, accusing the outlets of “biased and partisan news coverage.”

The lawsuit demands court action barring the Trump administration from implementing the president's order.

Roughly 1% of NPR's funding comes directly from the federal government, and its member stations across the U.S. receive around 10% of their funds from the CPB. NPR says more than 43 million Americans consume its articles, podcasts, and other content on a weekly basis.

Katherine Maher, NPR's president and CEO, said in a statement Tuesday that Trump's order “is a clear violation of the Constitution and the First Amendment's protections for freedom of speech and association, and freedom of the press.”

“The Supreme Court has ruled numerous times over the past 80 years that the government does not have the right to determine what counts as ‘biased,'” said Maher. “NPR will never agree to this infringement of our constitutional rights, or the constitutional rights of our member stations, and NPR will not compromise our commitment to an independent free press and journalistic integrity.”

Press freedom organizations have issued dire warnings about the consequences of federal funding cuts for NPR and PBS, arguing they could result in the closure of hundreds of local radio and television stations nationwide.

“The harm of these cuts will disproportionately befall rural American communities,” a coalition of advocacy groups wrote in a letter to congressional leaders last month. “Less densely populated parts of the country tend to have fewer options for reliable news sources. These markets are often less viable for commercial media, making it unlikely that the gap left by shuttered public media stations will be adequately filled.”

The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent. Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on May 27 that Moscow would welcome a second round of peace talks with Ukraine in Istanbul, he said during a joint press conference with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan. 

"If you ask me, I would turn to our Turkish friends again — Istanbul is very good," Lavrov said, according to state-owned news agency TASS.

The proposal comes as global diplomacy searches for a venue for negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow after the May 16 talks failed to achieve the ceasefire Ukraine has pushed for.  

President Volodymyr Zelensky said on May 19 that Ukraine is open to a new round of talks in Turkey, Switzerland, or the Vatican. Lavrov, however, cast doubt on the Vatican as a host, arguing that it would be an unsuitable platform for talks between "Orthodox countries." 

The Turkish foreign minister, who met with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Kremlin negotiator Vladimir Medinsky during his visit, reaffirmed Ankara's readiness to facilitate future talks. 

Fidan is expected to travel to Ukraine later this week following his two-day trip to Moscow. 

Turkey previously hosted peace negotiations in March 2022. Since then, Ankara has maintained active contact with both Kyiv and Moscow and facilitated multiple prisoner exchanges, as well as the now-defunct Black Sea Grain Initiative. 

No official date or venue for a second round of talks has been agreed. The renewed discussion about potential locations follows a May 19 call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Putin. 

During the call, Putin rejected Ukraine's proposal for an immediate ceasefire and instead suggested preparing a "memorandum" outlining a future peace framework.

Since the call, Russia has launched one of its most intense waves of aerial attacks, including more than 600 drones and dozens of missiles over a single weekend.

Officers are arresting people after hearings and putting them into expedited proceedings that do not require a judge.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers arrested 11 people after their court hearings at the San Diego Immigration Court on Thursday as part of a nationwide operation launched this week to try to fast track deportations.

Beginning Tuesday in courts including those in Santa Ana and Las Vegas, attorneys representing the U.S. government — who are also employed by ICE — requested that immigration judges close cases of some people who had been in the U.S. for less than two years and who had shown up without attorneys. Normally a closed immigration court case would mean that the government is no longer trying to deport someone. But instead, ICE officers waited outside courtrooms to arrest those people and put them into expedited proceedings that do not require a judge.

“Going to immigration court is your chance to be heard,” said Michelle Celleri, an attorney and legal rights director of Alliance San Diego. “It is your right. It is part of due process.”

Celleri said that arresting people who show up for their hearings would discourage others from coming to immigration courts. 

ICE and the Executive Office for Immigration Review, which runs the immigration court, did not respond to requests for comment from Beyond the Border. ICE has told other news outlets that it is detaining people who are subject to a fast-track deportation authority.

That fast-track deportation process is called expedited removal. 

In expedited removal, an immigration officer, rather than a judge, gives the deportation order. In an executive order issued in January, President Donald Trump called for officers to use the process on anyone who has been in the U.S. for less than two years.

“With expedited removal, they can deport them tonight,” said Ginger Jacobs, a private immigration attorney in San Diego. “They're short-cutting the due process these folks came here to receive in immigration court.”

But not everyone detained in San Diego on Thursday had closed cases. ICE arrested several people who had received future hearings dates from the immigration judges they appeared before, according to their attorneys and friends.

Ruth, a volunteer with the grassroots group Detention Resistance who asked not to be fully identified because of concerns about potential retaliation, said she had accompanied her friend, a man from Colombia who has been in the U.S. for just under a year, to court Thursday morning. 

She said that when her friend left the courtroom to go to the bathroom, officers tried to detain him even though his hearing hadn't happened yet. During his hearing, Ruth's friend told the judge that he was afraid of being arrested when he went back outside the courtroom. 

The judge told her friend that he wasn't affiliated with ICE and couldn't control what they did, Ruth said. Her friend turned in his asylum application, and the judge gave him another hearing date. 

When her friend left his hearing, ICE officers took him into custody.

“He came in good faith keeping with his asylum process,” Ruth said. “Now we don't even know what's going to happen to him.”

Ruth said her friend has been active in the San Diego community and getting involved as a volunteer to help others in need.

Tracy Crowley, an immigration attorney with Immigrant Defenders Law Center, took on Ruth's friend's case as he was being detained. She said she was still trying to figure out the legal reason for taking him into custody.

“It's wild,” Crowley said. “The warrants are very bareboned and don't include the legal basis for detaining them.”

Crowley was among a group of lawyers who jumped in to try to represent people in their court proceedings throughout the day in an effort to avoid additional arrests. 

Jacobs, the private immigration attorney, said her office took on four cases Thursday, including that of a young woman from Turkey who seemed terrified by the officers' presence.

In the afternoon, Jacobs helped a mother and her teenage son, quickly getting to know them in the courtroom in the moments before the hearing began. Outside in the hallway, more than 10 officers waited. ICE also called in two private security guards and two Federal Protective Services officers because of the presence of journalists, attorneys and community members documenting their actions in the hallway.

After the family left the courtroom, ICE appeared to follow them to try to detain them. Jacobs followed after the officers, and she said that ICE decided to let the family go.

Jacobs said ICE let the family go because the son had accompanied his mother.

ICE officers in San Diego mistakenly attempted to arrest two additional people Thursday. The officers later acknowledged the error.

In one case, an attorney from the American Bar Association Immigration Justice Project accompanied his client out of the courtroom. When ICE moved to arrest the client, the attorney objected, asking to see a warrant.

Officers shoved themselves between the attorney and his client. Two officers took hold of the man and he ended up on the ground. Beyond the Border witnessed him begin to gasp for air and hyperventilate. The attorney asked to be allowed to help his client, but ICE officers kept him away.

“May I please see a warrant because the warrant you provided is not that person,” the attorney said after ICE showed him their documentation. “You are making an unlawful arrest.”

ICE continued to keep him away from his client, saying that the man was having a medical emergency. 

“He's having a medical emergency thanks to you,” the attorney replied. 

Another attorney in the hallway called for an ambulance, and eventually ICE backed away from the man. The attorney helped his client down the hallway to the elevator, holding the man's arm over his shoulders to support his weight so that he could move away from the officers.

“I will help my client at this point,” the attorney said as they left. “You guys have done enough.”

Several people who had accompanied family members to their hearings were left in the hallway in tears as they watched loved ones being taken away. Celleri worried about family members who weren't there and would have no way of knowing what had happened.

“For those who are unrepresented, to their family they have just disappeared, and they are not going to know where they are for 48 hours — and that's if they know how to find them,” Celleri said.

Officers told attorneys in the hallway that those arrested on Thursday would be taken to Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego.

Lindsay Toczylowski, an attorney and CEO of Immigrant Defenders Law Center who was among the first to publicly call attention to the ICE operation, called the arrests a bait and switch.

“By detaining people in courtrooms, we are discouraging people from doing what we have always asked them to do,” Toczylowski said. “We have always stressed how important it is for people to show up to court, to avail themselves of the system to follow the rules that are set out.”

She said courts in Santa Ana, Chicago, Phoenix and Miami also saw arrests this week.

Celleri said people with upcoming hearings should know that if they don't come to court, they will likely be ordered deported in their absence. 

She said that if ICE attempts to arrest someone, that person should make sure the officers have the correct name and that if that person has already paid bond to get out of immigration custody, the person should not be detained again.

Exiled Soviet-era dissident tells the Guardian that for the US to turn its back on the territory would be ‘shameful'

When Mustafa Dzhemilev read the news about Donald Trump's plan for a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, he could not believe his eyes. Part of the US administration's peace plan, say recent reports, would involve Washington recognising annexed Crimea as legitimate Russian territory, among other concessions to the Kremlin that Trump hopes might stop Russia's war on Ukraine.

“The whole world knows what happened in Crimea … It would be such a damage to the reputation of the US that it will be hard for them to recover. It would be shameful,” said Dzhemilev, a Soviet-era dissident turned Crimean Tatar political leader, in an interview at his office in Kyiv.

Back in March 2014, during the Russian annexation, Dzhemilev was asked for his public declaration of support for Moscow's takeover by Vladimir Putin himself. The Russian president spoke by telephone to Dzhemilev, promising money and support for the Crimean Tatar community in exchange for his backing. “He explained how we'll be so happy under Russian rule,” Dzhemilev said, recalling the conversation with disdain.

Dzhemilev turned down the deal, saying that after centuries of oppressing the Crimean Tatars, the Russians were unlikely to change, and telling Putin the best thing he could do was remove his troops from the peninsula. A month later, when returning to Crimea from Kyiv, he was stopped at the new Russian frontier and told he was banned from entering. He has lived in exile in Kyiv ever since.

Unlike government officials, who are required to moderate their opinions of the Trump administration for the sake of diplomatic nicety, the 81-year-old Dzhemilev pulls no punches. He talks quietly yet with a sharp turn of phrase and a dark sense of humour, pausing every few minutes to light a fresh cigarette or answer his mobile phone, set to a barking dog ringtone.

“We are in a situation where the head of the US administration, the president, is now a person who feels no emotions, in whose head there is only deal-making … To say the things he says, to say Ukraine shouldn't have started this war. Have they been keeping this man in the dark for the last years? Does he know anything? Has he read anything?”

He recalled an interview with Trump's Russia envoy, Steve Witkoff, who failed to remember the names of all the regions he believed Russia had a reasonable claim to. “That's a diplomat from the United States of America? I've seen a lot of stupid diplomats in my life, but one like him, that's a first,” he said.

This is not Dzhemilev's first exile. In May 1944, when he was six months old, Joseph Stalin had the entire Crimean Tatar population rounded up and deported to Soviet Central Asia on cattle wagons, accusing them of collaboration during the Nazi occupation. Tens of thousands died on the journey.

The Crimean Tatars had been the majority of the population in Crimea until the first Russian annexation, under Catherine the Great in the 18th century. In the intervening years, Russians had begun to dominate, and after Stalin's deportation every single Crimean Tatar was removed.

From exile, Dzhemilev and other dissidents campaigned for a return. He received the first of many jail sentences in 1966 for refusing to do his military service, saying he could not fight in the army of the country that had stolen his homeland.

It was not until 1989 that Crimean Tatars were officially allowed to return, where they found a very different Crimea and a local population that often viewed them as intruders. Many of their houses had been seized and their villages destroyed.

Dzhemilev was elected chair of the Mejlis, the informal parliament of the Crimean Tatars, in 1991. During the early years of Ukrainian rule, Crimean Tatars were often accused of being separatists, wanting their own homeland in Crimea. In the end, they turned out to be some of Ukraine's fiercest defenders in the region. Since the annexation, Russia has launched multiple waves of persecution and arrests against the community, which is estimated to number around 250,000, or about 10% of the population of Crimea.

Many Crimean Tatars have agreed to work with Russian authorities, but Dzhemilev insists that most have done so only under pressure. He conceded, however, that 11 years of Russian rule had made an impact. Children who were in kindergarten at the time of the annexation will soon be old enough to be mobilised into the Russian army, having had a decade of schooling in the Russian curriculum. “Of course, this has an effect on some people's consciousness,” he said.

Still, he believes that many Crimean Tatar families will ensure their children do not lose sight of their history, and is heartened by one of his own earliest memories, as a young schoolboy in 1953, when it was announced on the radio that Stalin had died. “Everyone was crying, but not the Crimean Tatars. The first thing my dad said was, ‘Finally, the dog has kicked it',” he remembered. A relative came by with some onions, in case crying on demand was required.

Dzhemilev spent a total of 15 years in prisons and camps during the Soviet period, after seven different court cases. “The biggest single sentence I got was three years. By today's Russian standards I guess they would have shot me 10 times. They are destroying the lives of people by giving them 17 or 20 years for some small thing that was overheard,” he said.

There was a moment, in late 2022 and 2023, when Ukraine's army was on the offensive against the Russians and anything seemed possible, including Kyiv winning back Crimea. Dzhemilev recalled how, at the end of 2023, the head of Ukraine's military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, came to visit him, suggesting he record a New Year's Eve address that Ukrainian hackers could show on television channels in Crimea, replacing Putin's. In the address, Dzhemilev announced that 2024 would be the final year of Russian rule and advised recent arrivals to return to Russia.

That did not happen. “It seems the liberation of Crimea has been postponed,” he conceded. If the US does recognise Crimea, Dzhemilev hopes international leaders will put some kind of pressure on Russia to give guarantees to the Crimean Tatars.

He has called on Turkey to push for the creation of an international monitoring group to work in Crimea, and for members of the Mejlis to be given the freedom to travel to Crimea with immunity from prosecution under Russian law. He was due to meet President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan at a diplomatic forum in Antalya in April to put the request to him in person.

The pair have met several times before, but this time Erdoğan cancelled the meeting, citing a packed schedule, and sent a deputy instead, Dzhemilev said: “One of his aides said to me that it wasn't really about time, it was because this is a person who likes to be able to fulfil people's requests. And he knew more or less what I was going to ask, and he knows he won't be able to fulfil it.”

Dzhemilev's biography has a sad symmetry to it: decades of exile culminating in a return home, only for another exile to begin. He dismissed any personal hardship, noting that his years in the gulag had made him accustomed to being far from home. “Personally, I am quite comfortable, I have no complaints. But the fact that our people fought to return home after the 1944 deportation for half a century and now are once again in a forced deportation, that is quite awful,” he said.

Canadian actor Ryan Reynolds.EMAL COUNTESS/GETTY IMAGES

Try, try again

He might be one of the world's most successful actors, but 48-year-old Reynolds has starred in plenty of dogs (see No. 2). Critics absolutely pan you? Shake it off, move on—and joke about it later. 

You can't spend your way to success

Green Lantern is generally regarded as the worst comic-book adaptation ever. But Reynolds learned some valuable lessons from his painful Hal Jordan experience: “Too much money and too much time wrecks creativity,” he has said. “And constraint is the greatest creative tool you can possibly have.” No amount of cash can save a poorly conceived idea.

Never settle

Reynolds started developing Deadpool in 2004. Due largely to studio shenanigans, he was forced to debut the character in the 2009 X-Men Origins: Wolverine but hated the portrayal that was foisted on him. So did fans. He persevered until he won absolute creative freedom, and the first foul-mouthed, critically acclaimed Deadpool film, released in 2016, grossed US$782 million worldwide. Its two sequels grossed even more, and the third installment is the highest-grossing R-rated film ever. 

Marketing is everything

Reynolds is no silent partner. He often becomes the quirky, hilarious spokesman for many of his investments, including Mint Mobile. Five years after he accrued a 25% stake, T-Mobile bought it for US$1.4 billion. He bought a majority stake in Aviation Gin in 2016; Diageo acquired the brand four years later for US$610 million, based largely on his genius as creative director. Since he took over Wrexham AFC in 2020—and created a hit docuseries about his and Rob McElhenney's adventures in Wales—tourism earnings in the town have tripled. Oh, and the team just won a third straight promotion. Next up: reversing the fortunes of Alpine, currently ranked No. 9 in F1.

Give back

The prolific philanthropist most notably uses his star power to raise money for Toronto's SickKids Hospital. And as SickKids Foundation CEO Jennifer Bernard told us, for Reynolds, it really is all about the kids. “He came for a visit on my second day... No security, regular street clothes. Drove up, went through a side door. And we always send our stars a package on the kids. He knew every kid's name. He knew their story, he knew their parents... Ryan, honestly, is a national treasure.”

I love my job and my direct manager but I hate my boss, who is the owner of the company. He's rude, brash and dismissive. I dread our weekly company-wide meetings. About once a month, I'll get assigned a task that requires one-on-one meetings with him, which is anxiety-inducing and stressful. I don't want to leave my job, but what are some strategies I can use to cope with being around the company owner? How can I tactfully request that my manager not put me on tasks that involve time with the owner?

Jivi Saran, executive business adviser, Quantum Business Growth, Vancouver

In a values and purpose-based workplace culture, we understand that every interaction – even the challenging ones – offers valuable insight into how we relate, communicate and influence one another. Your stress around the company owner is completely valid and rather than seeing it solely as a problem, it can be viewed as a meaningful signal – an opportunity to reflect on your boundaries, needs and energy. 

Rather than approaching this situation with avoidance, consider shifting how you prepare for and engage in these moments. Before your meetings, ground yourself – take a few deep breaths, remind yourself of what you bring to the table and set a clear intention to remain steady and composed. This helps you stay aligned with your values, regardless of someone else's behaviour.

When it comes to speaking with your manager, approach the conversation with honesty and professionalism. You might say something like: “I work best in calm, collaborative settings. I find it difficult to stay focused and confident when I work directly with [the owner] and it impacts my ability to deliver my best. Would it be possible to adjust how these tasks are assigned so I can continue contributing effectively?” This isn't about avoiding responsibility – it's about making intentional choices that support your well-being and performance. We know that when we make even small adjustments to how we show up, the environment often begins to shift in response.

You don't have to give up a role you care about. With clear communication and a centred mindset, you can create more peace within yourself while continuing to make a meaningful contribution. Empowerment doesn't always require dramatic action – sometimes, it comes from quiet self-awareness and conscious choices about where your energy goes.

Bruce Sandy, principal, Pathfinder Coaching & Consulting, Nanoose Bay, B.C. 

I am curious why you hate your boss/the owner of the company. There are a number of rude, brash and dismissive people in the world. Do you feel as strongly about them? How do you handle them? 

Your boss may remind you of other key figures, which may be causing your amplified reactions to him. Reflect on who that may be. If you have unresolved abuse (and/or) trauma caused by someone similar to your boss in your past, then you will want to consider speaking to a therapist or counsellor about this.

Ask your direct manager if it is possible not to have direct contact with the owner. Be curious about how this avoidance of dealing with the owner may impact you in your job and the workplace. If it is not possible to avoid contact with the owner, then ask your direct manager about how best to work with the owner. 

Does your boss/owner have any redeeming qualities that you appreciate? If so, list these and focus on them. Remember, that which you focus on grows.

If you cannot avoid the owner, then be professional, respectful and set clear boundaries with him. Indicate to the owner that you want to focus on the issue at hand and that you have a set amount of time for the meeting. Also, ask if he has any constructive feedback for you at the end of meetings. You may want to have your direct manager or someone else involved in the meetings until you become comfortable interacting with the owner by yourself. They can then provide you with feedback, recommendations and coaching on how best to work with the owner.

MOSCOW, May 27. /TASS/. Europe continues supplying arms to Kiev, thus indirectly participating in the war against Russia, Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a news briefing.

The day before, the Dutch Defense Ministry announced that a new batch of F-16 fighter jets had been sent to Kiev. In addition, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced that there were no longer any restrictions on the range of weapons supplied to Kiev by Berlin and its allies. At the briefing, Peskov was asked whether this creates additional risks for the negotiations between Russia and Ukraine.

"We see that Europe is indirectly taking part: arms deliveries continue. This is indirect participation in the war against Russia. We are all witnessing ongoing discussions about the possibility of the appearance of 'European contingents,'" the Kremlin spokesman said.

"Of course, the Europeans' behavior in no way contributes to a peace settlement," Peskov pointed out.

The executive chair of InterRent Real Estate Investment Trust IIP-UN-T, Mike McGahan, is offering to acquire the apartment owner for $2-billion with the backing of Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC. 

On Tuesday, Ottawa-based InterRent announced CLV Group, a private company owned by Mr. McGahan, and GIC are bidding $13.55 per unit for InterRent, which owns more than 12,000 apartment units in three provinces. Mr. McGahan is the REIT's former chief executive officer. 

The offer to take InterRent private comes after the REIT faced an activist campaign from Toronto-based asset manager Anson Funds, which built a 9-per-cent stake in the company. The takeover bid is priced at a 35-per-cent premium to the price of InterRent units on March 7, when media first reported on Anson's campaign. 

InterRent said the takeover offer is worth $4-billion, including the REIT's debt. InterRent is widely held, with Mr. McGahan owning 4 per cent of units. 

Anson pushed for a sale or restructuring of InterRent because its units were trading well under their net asset value, which analysts pegged at approximately $16 per unit.

A special committee of InterRent's board members hired National Bank Financial (NBF) to do a valuation of the REIT. On Tuesday, InterRent said NBF estimated the fair value of the company is between $12.75 and $14 per unit. 

InterRent's board has set up a 40-day “go-shop” period to allow the REIT to solicit a better offer. The Globe and Mail previously reported a number of real estate companies approached InterRent with potential takeover offers. The go-shop process ends on July 6. 

“While we are pleased to see the InterRent Board take a concrete step towards closing its valuation discount, we will see how the go-shop process unfolds as we believe there is potential for more value to be realized,” said a spokesperson for Anson in an e-mail. 

“We are pleased to provide immediate and certain premium value to our unitholders through this all-cash transaction with CLV Group and GIC, while also allowing InterRent to solicit superior proposals through a go-shop period of 40 days,” said Brad Cutsey, InterRent's CEO, in a press release.

“We are delighted to partner together with GIC on this transformative transaction,” said Mr. McGahan in a press release. 

InterRent will pay the buyers a $49-million fee if the transaction is terminated during the go-shop period, and a $79-million fee if the purchase is shut down after July 6. 

CLV Group and GIC will pay the REIT $89-million in a reverse break fee if their offer is terminated. The transaction is expected to close by early 2026. 

Mr. McGahan is CEO of CLV Group, which served as property manager for InterRent until 2018. He previously served as CEO of the REIT for 12 years, and was the Ottawa Business Journal's CEO of the Year in 2023. 

GIC is one of the world's largest fund managers, with approximately US$800-billion of assets under management. 

BMO Capital Markets and National Bank Financial are advising InterRent on the transaction, with law firm Norton Rose Fulbright Canada LLP advising the REIT's special committee and Gowling WLG (Canada) LLP working for InterRent.

Bank of Nova Scotia is advising the buyers, while law firm Goodmans LLP is working for CLV Group and Stikeman Elliott LLP is in GIC's corner. In addition, law firms LaBarge Weinstein LLP and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP are advising the two buyers on their joint venture.

Prime Minister Mark Carney looks on as King Charles delivers the speech from the throne on May 27.Chris Young/The Canadian Press

King Charles III has won plaudits back home for including some personal remarks in Tuesday's Throne Speech in Ottawa, which defended Canada's sovereignty without treading on relations between Britain and the United States. 

The main purpose of the Speech from the Throne was to open the 45th Parliament and outline the priorities of the recently elected Liberal government. But the King also offered his thoughts on Canada and its standing in the world. 

“Every time I come to Canada … a little more of Canada seeps into my bloodstream – and from there straight to my heart,” he said. He added that “the Crown has for so long been a symbol of unity for Canada. It also represents stability and continuity from the past to the present.”

The King made reference to Donald Trump, who has threatened to annex Canada, by saying the U.S. President and Prime Minister Mark Carney have begun “defining a new economic and security relationship” that will “deliver transformational benefits for both sovereign nations.”

And he closed the speech by quoting O Canada: “As the anthem reminds us, the True North is indeed strong and free.”

“The King has risen to the occasion,” wrote Hannah Furness, the Daily Telegraph's royal editor. “The words, delivered by the King of Canada, were carefully chosen. Not enough to antagonize Mr. Trump, they nevertheless underlined the point that the Canadian Prime Minister and government have been making.”

The King's visit was “undoubtedly seen as a symbolic sign of King Charles wanting to show solidarity with Canada, at a time when there has been such pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump,” said BBC royal correspondent Sean Coughlan. 

After the speech, Mr. Carney told reporters: “It was a very successful visit. A good reminder of the strength of Canadian institutions.”

Throne Speech from King Charles asserts Canada's sovereignty, outlines plans for investments, defence

Just how far the King would go in his remarks had been of great interest in London. 

The British government regularly touts the country's “special relationship” with the U.S, and Prime Minister Keir Starmer has been keen to exploit Mr. Trump's admiration for the King in order to curry favour with the White House. Mr. Starmer has refrained from criticizing Mr. Trump's trade war and invited him to London for a state dinner hosted by the King, making him the only U.S. President to be given that honour twice.

That's at odds with Mr. Carney and other U.S. allies, who have criticized Mr. Trump's tariffs. Mr. Carney also hoped the King's visit to Ottawa would help demonstrate Canada's sovereignty and blunt Mr. Trump's talk of annexation. 

“A great deal of tact is required to ensure that the various roles of the King do not conflict. He's King of the U.K., King of Canada and other realms, and head of the Commonwealth,” said Vernon Bogdanor, professor of government at King's College London and author of The Monarchy and the Constitution.

Daily Telegraph writer Charles Moore said in a column this week that the decision to have the King open Parliament demonstrated that the monarchy mattered and sent a strong message to Washington. “Who better than the King, whose role and character Mr. Trump admires, to administer an implied rebuke?” he wrote.

The closest the King came to giving the American President a rebuke was when he remarked, “All Canadians can give themselves far more than any foreign power on any continent can ever take away.” 

Mr. Moore warned of possible pitfalls, given that the King has different responsibilities in Britain, which is the origin of his authority. “There is the potential for a clash if, say, Canada, wants the King to do something which might not accord with British interests,” he said. 

The King's visit has been overshadowed in Britain by events in Liverpool, where a car rammed into a crowd of soccer fans on Monday during a parade to celebrate Liverpool F.C. winning the Premier League. 

Merseyside Police said on Tuesday that 65 people were injured and 11 remain in hospital in stable condition. Police said they not treating the case as terrorism and that a 53-year-old British man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, reckless driving and driving while under the influence of drugs. 

In a statement on Tuesday from Ottawa, the King and Queen Camilla offered their condolences to the victims.

King Charles III delivered the Speech from the Throne, opening the 45th Parliament of Canada on Tues. May 27 in Ottawa. The King's speech touched on Canada's unique identity, new challenges including President Trump and Canada's sovereignty.

EU officials in charge of enforcing Russia sanctions have lamented a major disconnection with Washington, following US President Donald Trump's change in policy towards Moscow.

According to a report by Süddeutsche Zeitung citing an internal document from Germany's Foreign Office, the US and EU have failed to reach an agreement on efforts to counter circumvention of restrictions. Experts have warned the EU/US divide could spell an end to the Russia sanctions regime altogether.

According to the document, the EU's sanctions envoy David O'Sullivan lamented the lack of unity between Brussels and Washington towards anti-Russia restrictions, during a bloc Foreign Affairs Council meeting last week.

Since the Ukraine conflict escalated in 2022, the US and EU have imposed sweeping sanctions to isolate Russia, including bans on seaborne oil, asset freezes, and restrictions targeting the country's economy, trade, and defense sectors.

Recent efforts have focused on alleged sanctions evasion, citing purported attempts by Russia to acquire weapons components through third parties using a so-called “shadow fleet,” a Western term for tankers operating outside recognised insurance systems. The EU has been pushing for additional measures to prevent vessels from operating, including by sanctioning Russia's trade partners, such as China.

According to the report, however, the US does not support Brussels' moves: O'Sullivan at the meeting reportedly acknowledged a total breakdown in coordination with Washington on measures targeting Russia.

“There is no more joint outreach,” he reportedly admitted, adding that G7 cooperation has also “lost momentum.”

US President Donald Trump has threatened tougher sanctions on Russia if negotiations to end the Ukraine conflict fail, without naming any concrete proposals. He has repeatedly noted that he looks forward to boosting trade and economic cooperation with Russia once the conflict is over.

Officials cited in the report believe he is looking to restore business ties sooner rather than later. A recent Bloomberg report citing EU sources also claimed the US has become “unresponsive” in working groups focused on sanctions enforcement.

The next EU sanctions package is expected to target Russia's energy and banking sectors, the report notes, but its approval is now uncertain. Hungary, which has repeatedly opposed sanctions, is reportedly blocking key elements of the proposal. Washington's fading support has further cast doubt on its passage.

German MEP Sergey Lagodinsky told Süddeutsche Zeitung that a full US withdrawal from the sanctions regime would likely bring the entire system to a halt. “The problem is that the US has been the de facto driving force behind the sanctions,” he said.

Moscow has repeatedly denounced Western sanctions as illegal and ineffective, arguing they have failed to destabilize the Russian economy and have instead backfired on the countries that imposed them.

			El Zonte was transformed after Nayib Bukele made currency legal tender — but now the bubble has burst

The road to El Zonte was, quite literally, paved by Bitcoin.

Just a few years ago, surfers sniffing out the region's world-class waves would have to drag their boards down dirt roads to reach this stretch of tropical shoreline.

But after Nayib Bukele, the self-described “world's coolest dictator”, announced in 2021 that El Salvador would become the first country to make Bitcoin a legal tender, this small seaside town of 3,000 people was transformed.

The region had already been branded “Bitcoin Beach” – ground zero of the country's cryptocurrency experiment – but Mr Bukele's controversial crypto-policies turned what had been a trickle of interest into a tsunami.

Roads were quickly laid to welcome the influx of crypto-enthusiasts descending on their decentralised fiscal mecca, with almost every sign lining the streets boasting some form of Bitcoin reference.

The letter “B” no longer exists in El Zonte – all over the town it has been usurped by the Bitcoin symbol – and everyone from the owners of tamale stands to street vendors selling jewellery are happy to accept it.

Hotels, restaurants, apartment complexes have all cropped up – with construction sites on every corner as builders struggle to keep up with demand.

But Mr Bukele's Bitcoin bubble now appears to have burst.

The populist Salvadorian leader, who has fashioned himself a Silicon Valley-style disrupter, signed a $1.4 billion-deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the bogeyman of Bitcoiners, in which he agreed to scale back the country's Bitcoin policies.

As part of the agreement, Salvadorian merchants are no longer compelled to accept the cryptocurrency as payment and Mr Bukele agreed on paper to stop buying Bitcoin with public cash – the country currently owns more than 6,000 Bitcoin – although he has since said their strategy is not stopping.

So what will this gear-change mean for “Bitcoin Beach”?

“It's gonna keep some people away, definitely,” says Ronny Avendano, who runs the Bitcoin Hardware Store, which sells all the Bitcoin bells and whistles including tech and books about the cryptocurrency.

“The IMF is definitely a governing body that you want to stay as far away from as possible... It might be detrimental to the business,” he adds.

While he does not think the IMF deal will impact life in El Zonte, where Bitcoin is already enmeshed in the community, he worries it could cause some Bitcoiners to get “cold feet”.

Mr Avendano, whose parents fled El Salvador for Canada during the civil war, gave up his six-figure job in finance in Toronto to travel Latin America in response to Justin Trudeau's vaccine mandates. His first stop was El Zonte in March 2021. He has been here ever since.

After learning about Bitcoin, he became a “Bitcoin maximalist”, investing all of his savings in the cryptocurrency. Right now, he says, he only has around $9.

When Mr Bukele announced Bitcoin would be a legal tender, he saw an “influx” of Bitcoiners from all over the world arrive.

Talking to The Telegraph after giving a short lesson on investing in the courtyard outside his shop, he adds: “From a tourist perspective, you know, I don't feel that excitement anymore... It used to be ‘I can't wait to come to El Salvador' to now ‘tell you what's going on with this deal'.”

He adds: “For me, nothing's changed. People in town still accept Bitcoin, and I still love the Bitcoin farmers market. Yesterday, I went to buy food at the grocery store in Bitcoin.

“I don't know what's gonna happen over the next six months if it were to change... I'd have to close my business down.”

Mr Avendano believes it's not just Bitcoin pulling foreigners to El Salvador, but the country's safety.

To combat gang violence, Mr Bukele enforced a “state of exception” in 2022, rounding up and imprisoning more than 80,000 people without due process. The streets are safer, but the Bukele administration has faced allegations of human rights abuses.

His administration also built the notorious Cecot mega-prison, where Donald Trump has since deported Venezuelan migrants the White House claims are gang members.

Walter Mena, a Salvadorian lawyer, was reluctant to open a business before Mr Bukele, when even El Zonte was overrun by gangs and it was not uncommon for people to be shot dead on the beach.

But now Mr Mena, 49, who returned to El Salvador in 2019 after living in France for 15 years, is in the midst of constructing apartments he hopes to rent to wealthy Bitcoiners

Mr Mena, who accepts Bitcoin payment for his legal services, does not think the IMF deal will make any difference.

“Now people know what Bitcoin is and how to use it... Bukele is pretty smart, and the IMF is full of dinosaurs,” he said.

“People probably will turn back, but the people who understand, who are already here, they're not leaving.”

For locals in El Zonte, the sudden arrival of foreign Bitcoiners has been a blessing and a curse. Wealthy foreigners have been investing in the area, buying land, building homes and starting businesses.

But prices have increased, and for each tale of one local making enough money to buy a new motorcycle with Bitcoin, there are stories of those who lost thousands in the volatile market.

Surf teacher Isaac Reyes, 28, who is from El Zonte, says there have been more positive impacts than negative on the local community. He is sometimes paid in Bitcoin but he and most of the locals transfer it straight into dollars using an app on their phone.

He said he believes the novelty of Bitcoin Beach had already reached its “peak” and is now “going back down”.

“Now the difference is the people, not the currency… less people are coming,” he said.

From speaking to the Europeans who have already moved to El Salvador in search of Bitcoin freedom, there is no hesitation – they are here to stay.

M moved to El Salvador from London in 2021 after he broke up with his girlfriend and read about Mr Bukele.

Talking to The Telegraph as he sips on a can of beer with a friend, purchased with Bitcoin, he says he did not know El Salvador existed before he read about the Salvadorian president.

M, 28, who did not want to give his full name, now lives in San Salvador. He first bought Bitcoin almost a decade ago when he was at university and now works for a hardware Bitcoin devices firm.

Asked what he likes most about the country, he said: “The fact that I can just easily use my Bitcoin everywhere.”

Danny, a retired Belgian housebuilder who also did not want to give his last name, made his fortune in Bitcoin before moving to El Zonte 20 months ago in search of a crypto haven to retire to.

You wouldn't know it by looking at him, as he sits on a stool wearing a vest and flip flops, but Danny, 59, is a Bitcoin millionaire.

He invested his life savings in 2014, when one Bitcoin was worth around $311. The value has since swelled to over $108,000.

He believes Europe is becoming a “police state” and part of the reason he has relocated to El Zonte is to provide a base for his nine grandchildren to escape to if they wish.

El Salvador, by contrast, he says is like the Wild West. “There are not many rules, or not many rules that you really need to follow... there is almost no control.”

James Bosworth, the founder of Hxagon, a firm which provides political risk analysis with a focus on Latin America, is also unconvinced the IMF deal will have much of an impact.

He puts the apparent dwindling numbers of people visiting Bitcoin Beach down to the town losing its sheen, rather than the IMF deal.

“It's probably more a function of the initial hype cycle about El Salvador's Bitcoin drawing down and global macro factors (likely recession hits all tourism),” he says.

He adds: “There are only so many people who might relocate and most of them jumped early. For anyone still considering it, the IMF agreement didn't change much.”

Dr Peter Howson, an assistant professor at Northumbria University who has written books on cryptocurrency, thinks Mr Bukele's Bitcoin experiment has been a “failure”.

In 2023, eight out of 10 Salvadorians did not use cryptocurrency, according to a survey by the University Institute of Public Opinion (Iudop) at the José Simeón Cañas Central American University (UCA).

Meanwhile, only a fraction of remittances sent back to El Salvador from relatives abroad, which accounts for 25 per cent of the country's GDP, were sent with Bitcoin.

“It might be popular with tourists that have come for the novelty of being able to do something useful with their Bitcoin, but other than that it was a failure,” Dr Howson says.

He adds: “I think just because there's this IMF deal in place, I think there's still going to be some fondness for Bitcoin and silly policies down the road.

“I don't think this is the end of the line for Bitcoin in El Salvador, by any means.”

MAKHACHKALA, May 27. /TASS/. Russia continues work on preparing a memorandum on Ukraine which will outline the principles and tentative dates of the settlement, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said at a briefing.

"Russia continues developing a draft memorandum regarding the future peace treaty, defining a number of aspects, such as the principles of the settlement, the timeline of the potential peace agreement, and the possible ceasefire for a limited time period if relevant agreements are reached," she said.

"As soon as the memorandum is ready, and I would like to note that Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is literally daily commenting on the process of its development, it will be transferred to Kiev. We hope that the Ukrainian side is doing the same and will send us their draft as they receive the Russian document," Zakharova stressed.

On May 16, the first round of talks between Russia and Ukraine was held in Istanbul.

On May 11, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Moscow is proposing to the Kiev regime to resume the talks it halted in 2022 directly and without any preconditions. Ukraine agreed to take part in the talks at US leader Donald Trump's urging. Previously, Vladimir Zelensky was saying that a 30-day ceasefire was a mandatory precondition for launching talks with Moscow.

Following the meeting, Moscow and Kiev agreed to swap the prisoners of war under a "1,000 for 1,000" formula, present their concept of the potential future ceasefire, outlining it in detail, as well as continue the negotiation process. Russian Presidential Aide Vladimir Medinsky who led the Russian delegation at the Istanbul talks said that the Russian side was satisfied with the negotiations' outcome.

MOSCOW, May 27. /TASS/. The process of restoring Russia-US relations is complicated but Moscow is open to seeking the balance of interests, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said in an interview with Komsomolskaya Pravda.

"Time will tell how the actual steps taken by the new US administration will match its declarations. The normalization process is complicated but we are always open to a genuine conversation and to the search for the balance of interests," the senior Russian diplomat emphasized.

"That said, I would like to particularly stress that developing dialogue with the US cannot and will not be carried out at the expense of our strategic relations with our partners in BRICS and other friendly countries," Ryabkov noted.

On May 19, Russian President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart Donald Trump held a more than two-hour-long phone conversation discussing primarily the ways of settling the Ukraine conflict. The Russian leader gave high marks to their dialogue and described it as constructive.

Calin Georgescu, a Moscow-friendly Romanian politician who ran for president in November 2024, announced on May 26 that he is retiring from politics.

In a video address posted online, Georgescu said he had made a personal choice to become a mere "observer of public and social life" and devote more time and energy to his family.

An ultranationalist and a staunch opponent of NATO, Georgescu came first in the initial round of the presidential election in November 2024 with 22.9% of the vote. Romania's Constitutional Court later annulled the vote due to credible evidence of foreign interference in Georgescu's favor, namely from Russia.

Georgescu was later barred from participating in a rerun in May as he faces multiple criminal charges over suspected promotion of fascist ideologies and Romania's World War II-era leader, Ion Antonescu, who oversaw the Holocaust in the country.

In his address, Georgescu said that after the presidential election, "this stage of the sovereignist movement has ended." He added he would not join any political party or seek to hold a political office.

After Georgescu was banned from running for president, far-right Eurosceptic George Simion became the leading nationalist candidate instead but was defeated in the runoff on May 18 by pro-EU centrist Nicusor Dan.

"The world is weary of conflict, war, haste, violence, and political excess," Georgescu said.

"When public attention is consumed by political infighting that has little to do with society's well-being, those in professions vital to the country's welfare are pushed to the margins."

Georgescu thanked all those who supported him, claiming they had been "harassed, humiliated, and marginalized," and extended his gratitude also to his opponents.

The largely unknown Georgescu surged in popularity shortly before the November vote thanks to what is suspected to be Russian interference and a hybrid campaign on the TikTok platform.

The former candidate has vowed to end Romania's assistance to Ukraine and once suggested that Bucharest could take part in the country's post-war partition, drawing a rebuke from Kyiv.

Highlighted by an Ivy League title and a divisional crown at the national college playdowns, Canada's Ocean Ma enjoyed a memorable first season on Harvard's squash team. 

She hopes to build on that in her sophomore year, despite the uncertainty given the latest salvos between the Trump administration and the university. 

“I don't want to have the college experience taken away from me,” Ma said. 

It has been a nervous time for Ma and the rest of the international student population at the Boston-area school. 

Last Thursday, the Department of Homeland Security decided to make Harvard ineligible for international student visas.

The decision could force as many as 6,800 foreign students – over one-quarter of the school's enrolment – to transfer or leave the country. A judge later issued a temporary restraining order that put the sanction on hold, pending a lawsuit that was filed Friday in federal court. 

The developments are the latest escalation in a fight stemming from the administration's assertions that Harvard failed to protect Jewish students from antisemitism.

A hearing is set for this Thursday to determine whether the temporary order should be extended, Harvard president Alan Garber said in an update letter on the school website.

Ma, 18, from Richmond, B.C., was one of five players with international hometowns on Harvard's 11-player women's squash team last season. 

The men's team, which includes Vancouver's Jacob Lin, had 10 international hometowns listed on its 13-player squad. Canadian Squash Hall of Famer Mike Way serves as a team coach.

“If Trump's demands went through then [over] half the team would be gone and there would be no Harvard squash,” Ma said from Dalian, China.

Over three-dozen Canadian student-athletes were listed on the school website in a variety of sports, including soccer, hockey, lacrosse, fencing and others. 

The government edict could virtually wipe out many of Harvard's 42 varsity sports teams, the most in the United States.

“I think that Harvard is not Harvard without its international students,” Ma said.

Ma, a national champion at the U15, U17 and U19 levels, helped Canada win bronze at the world junior team championship last year. She also helped Harvard to a second-place finish in the College Squash Association national team playdowns.

The school has called the government action unlawful and said it is working to provide guidance to students.

“We're standing at a moment in Harvard history that is going to be talked about later on,” Ma said. “I'm really proud that Alan Garber is able to stand up to Trump and I wish that he continues to fight back for our rights as an education institution. 

“I know that he'll be able to resolve everything.”

Despite that optimism, Ma noted the steady churn of news has left her family members “really worried” at times.

“My mom was a little bit frantic [last week] trying to see if transferring to Yale – where my twin sister is – is an option,” she said. “But I told her to just wait to see. 

“I know it will get resolved really soon because it is honestly such an insane and ridiculous situation that there's no way that it will follow through.”

Several notable Canadian student-athletes compete at the university. 

Women's soccer player Jade Rose, who represented Canada at the Paris Olympics last summer, is finishing her final semester at Harvard this spring.

Golfer Michelle Liu made her varsity team debut last fall. In 2019, Liu – who was 12 at the time – became the youngest golfer to play in the Canadian Women's Open. 

And two-time Olympian Jessica Guo helped Harvard's fencing team win the 2024 NCAA national championship. 

Ma, meanwhile, plans to return to the university in September. Squash season begins in November. 

“After spending a year at Harvard, I don't think I'd like to be at any other school,” she said.

The time has come for the United States to build a collective defense pact in Asia. For decades, such a pact was neither possible nor necessary. Today, in the face of a growing threat from China, it is both viable and essential. American allies in the region are already investing in their own defenses and forging deeper military bonds. But without a robust commitment to collective defense, the Indo-Pacific is on a path to instability and conflict.

Tactical shifts aside, Beijing's geopolitical aspirations for “the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation” remain unchanged. China seeks to seize Taiwan, control the South China Sea, weaken U.S. alliances, and ultimately dominate the region. If it succeeds, the result would be a China-led order that relegates the United States to the rank of a diminished continental power: less prosperous, less secure, and unable to fully access or lead the world's most important markets and technologies.

After decades of pouring resources into its armed forces, China could soon have the military strength to make that vision a reality. As CIA Director William Burns revealed in 2023, Chinese President Xi Jinping has instructed his military “to be ready by 2027 to invade Taiwan.” But as Burns went on to note, China's leaders “have doubts about whether they could accomplish that invasion.” To sustain those doubts—concerning Taiwan but also other potential targets in the region—should be a top priority of U.S. foreign policy. That requires convincing Beijing that any attack would ultimately come at an unacceptable cost.

With that objective in mind, the United States has invested in advanced military capabilities and developed new operational concepts. It has moved more mobile and lethal military forces to strategic locations across Asia. Crucially, it has overhauled its security partnerships in the region. In past decades, Washington's principal focus was to forge close bilateral ties. In recent years, by contrast, the United States has pursued a more networked approach that gives U.S. allies greater responsibilities and encourages closer ties not just with Washington but among the allies themselves. These changes are creating novel military and geopolitical challenges for Beijing, thereby reinforcing China's doubts about the potential success of aggression. 

The new, more multilateral approach marks a critical step toward stronger deterrence. But the defense initiatives it has produced remain too informal and rudimentary. In the face of continued Chinese military modernization, true deterrence requires the will and capability that only a collective defense arrangement can deliver. Such an alliance—call it the “Pacific Defense Pact”—would bind those countries that are currently most aligned and prepared to take on the China challenge together: Australia, Japan, the Philippines, and the United States. Additional members could join as conditions warrant.

Skeptics may argue that such an arrangement is infeasible with a Trump administration that appears to disavow the importance of the United States' alliances. But the reality is that leaders in Washington and allied capitals are still working to deepen military cooperation in the Indo-Pacific despite economic and diplomatic tensions. As far as defense matters are concerned, there has been far more continuity than disruption to date. Provided the administration avoids debilitating economic measures targeting U.S. allies, the trends pointing the way toward collective defense in the region are likely to endure. And if the Trump administration ultimately lacks the vision and ambition to grasp this opportunity, defense establishments can and should still lay the foundations for future leaders.

This is not the first time Washington has confronted the question of how to design its security partnerships in Asia. After World War II, the United States crafted a network of alliances in the region, hoping to keep Soviet expansion at bay, entrench its own military presence—particularly in East Asia—and curb internecine tensions among its partners. This network, made up of separate security arrangements with Australia and New Zealand, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand, served its constituents well. It insulated large stretches of the Indo-Pacific from great-power conflict, setting the conditions for decades of remarkable economic growth. It also proved resilient, weathering the wars in Korea and Vietnam, successive waves of decolonization and democratization, and even the end of the Cold War itself.

Notably, the network never evolved beyond a set of disparate and almost exclusively bilateral alliances. In Europe, U.S. officials embraced collective defense: an attack on one ally would be treated as an attack on all. (Such was the logic behind the founding, in 1949, of NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.) In Asia, however, similar aspirations foundered. As John Foster Dulles, one of the architects of the U.S. postwar security order, wrote in these pages in 1952, shortly before becoming secretary of state: “It is not at this time practicable to draw a line which would bring all the free peoples of the Pacific and East Asia into a formal mutual security area.”

For their part, many Asian leaders preferred strong bilateral relationships with the United States over closer links with former adversaries or historical rivals. Some worried that a collective defense arrangement would draw them into a great-power clash between Washington and Moscow. Others doubted that any such institution could overcome the legacies of conflict and mutual distrust among their neighbors and bring together members that were far apart both geographically and in terms of security concerns. The only seeming exception, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, proved the point. Founded in 1954, SEATO was a motley alliance among Australia, France, New Zealand, Pakistan, the Philippines, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It suffered from a lack of unity and quietly dissolved in 1977.

But times have changed. The conditions once preventing multilateral alignment in Asia are giving way to fresh calls for collective defense. Just before taking office last year, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba warned that “the absence of a collective self-defense system like NATO in Asia means that wars are likely to break out.” In fact, such a collective defense pact is now within reach. Three trends buttress this conclusion: a new strategic alignment centered on an advancing threat from China, a new convergence of security cooperation among U.S. allies, and the demand for a new reciprocity that gives the United States' partners a larger role in keeping the peace.

China's assertiveness throughout the Indo-Pacific is spreading a sense of insecurity, particularly as leaders in Beijing lean on the military as a central instrument in their revisionist aims. The dangerous and threatening activities of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), combined with its rapidly growing capabilities, have prompted leaders across the region to adopt new defense strategies arrayed against what they perceive as a growing threat from China. New military investments and activities have followed suit.

Nowhere is this strategic reorientation more apparent than in Tokyo. Despite deep economic interdependence between China and Japan, ties between the two countries have been frail for decades, strained by historical animus, trade tensions, and territorial disputes. Relations have only worsened in recent years, as Beijing has leveraged its budding economic and military power to ramp up pressure on its neighbor. A new law, passed in 2021, allows China's coast guard to use weapons against foreign ships sailing in what Beijing considers its sovereign waters. In the years since, Chinese incursions into the areas surrounding what Japan refers to as the Senkaku Islands—administered by Japan but also claimed by China, which refers to them as the Diaoyu Islands—have become more frequent, with greater numbers of larger and more heavily armed vessels. In March, Chinese coast guard ships entered the territorial waters around the islands and lingered for nearly 100 hours—the longest episode to date in a string of incidents that Japan's top diplomat described as “clearly escalating.”

Tokyo is responding by loosening long-standing political and legal constraints on its armed forces. As early as 2013, the country's first-ever publicly released national security strategy warned of China's “rapidly expanded and intensified” activities around Japanese territories. Not long after, the Japanese government reinterpreted the country's pacifist constitution, allowing its armed forces to work more closely with partner militaries. In recent years, it has embarked on a historic military buildup, pledging to double its military spending to roughly two percent of its gross domestic product. Tokyo has also moved beyond its erstwhile focus on defensive capabilities and now aims to acquire and deploy “counterstrike capabilities,” including hundreds of long-range Tomahawk missiles. These changes, as the political scientist and Japan expert Michael Green wrote in these pages in 2022, are establishing Tokyo as “the most important net exporter of security in the Indo-Pacific.”

The Philippines is undergoing a similar transformation. For decades, the Philippine armed forces battled insurgents in the southern reaches of the archipelago. Military investments and operations reflected that domestic focus. Today, the insurgency has weakened, but an external threat looms larger and larger: steady Chinese encroachment on Philippine maritime rights and sovereignty, primarily in the South China Sea. In the 2010s, Beijing pursued an unprecedented campaign of land reclamation and built military bases atop reefs and islets that are also claimed by the Philippines and other Southeast Asian states. China has cordoned off one of these atolls, Scarborough Shoal, denying access to Philippine fishing vessels. At another reef, Second Thomas Shoal, violent attacks by Chinese vessels have disrupted efforts to resupply Philippine military personnel. Chinese coast guard ships have even harassed vessels conducting energy exploration inside the Philippines' exclusive economic zone. 



The view from Manila has sharpened accordingly. Beginning under President Rodrigo Duterte in the late 2010s and accelerating under his successor, Ferdinand Marcos, Jr., the Philippine military has been undertaking an ambitious modernization effort. The government adopted a watershed defense strategy in 2024 to secure the country's periphery with investments in additional combat aircraft, tougher cyberdefenses, and more unmanned assets for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. There is little doubt about what is driving the overhaul: the need to better monitor and confront China's coercive activities.

In Canberra, a few thousand miles to the south, the rise of China was once considered benign and beneficial to Australian interests. A series of diplomatic and military incidents in the past decade, however, have convinced many that the opposite is true. Revelations of malign Chinese Communist Party influence in Australian elections and policymaking ignited a political firestorm. And after Australia's government called for an independent investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, China unleashed a barrage of tariffs and other restrictions on Australian exports.

In the South China Sea, Australian armed forces have suffered the same malign pattern of harassment by Chinese jets and warships. The PLA is also operating closer than ever to Australia's shores. Earlier this year, Chinese naval vessels circumnavigated Australia and disrupted commercial air traffic with live-fire exercises in the Tasman Sea. And amid intense efforts by China to make security inroads with Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and other Pacific Island countries, Australia's foreign minister said in 2024 that her country is now “in a state of permanent contest in the Pacific.”

Against this backdrop, Canberra, too, is revising its defense priorities from top to bottom. As recently as 2016, the government's official view was that a foreign military attack on its territory was “no more than a remote prospect.” By 2024, its updated national defense strategy warned that, owing to the present realities in the Indo-Pacific, “there is no longer a ten-year window of strategic warning time for conflict.” Instead of preparing for a wide variety of contingencies around the world, including counterterrorism in the Middle East, the Australian Defence Force is gearing up to fend off major threats closer to home. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has unveiled plans for record military spending, including major investments in stockpiles of critical munitions such as long-range fires, antiship missiles, and missiles for air defense. The reforms highlight a growing conviction that the country's advantageous geography no longer offers sufficient protection against the PLA. The public shares that apprehension: according to the Lowy Institute, a leading Australian think tank, the share of Australians who believed China would become a military threat to their country nearly doubled from 2012 to 2022. It now stands above 70 percent.

Japan, the Philippines, and Australia have not only come to recognize China as their primary and common threat; they also increasingly acknowledge that their fates are intertwined with the broader region. This is true even on issues as sensitive as Taiwan, once a taboo subject in the region: “A Taiwan emergency is a Japanese emergency,” former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared in 2021. “If something happens to Taiwan, inevitably we will be involved,” the Philippine military chief warned earlier this year.

The view that Chinese aggression would have massive consequences for countries throughout the Indo-Pacific has resulted in an unprecedented deepening of security partnerships among Australia, Japan, the Philippines, and other regional powers. Analysts have described defense cooperation between Australia and Japan in particular as taking on “alliance-like characteristics.” A new reciprocal access agreement allows the Australian and Japanese militaries to operate in each other's countries. August 2023 marked the first-ever visit by Japanese F-35 fighter jets to northern Australia, followed only days later by the inaugural deployment of Australian F-35s for military exercises in Japan.

Japan is finalizing a similar access agreement with the Philippines, which has emerged in recent years as the largest recipient of Japanese security assistance. In February, defense leaders from the two countries announced a spate of measures for closer security cooperation. In what could be read only as a thinly veiled reference to China, the Philippine secretary of defense explained that Manila and Tokyo's “common cause” was to resist “any unilateral attempt to reshape the global order.”

That newfound common cause has animated a series of overlapping, complementary initiatives—what, in 2024, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin called “the new convergence in the Indo-Pacific”—that build on the United States' traditional focus on bilateral ties in the region. The Biden administration in particular worked to supplement the older “hub-and-spokes” model with what it envisioned as a “latticework” of relationships in Asia. The AUKUS partnership brought together Canberra, London, and Washington to help Australia build conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines. As members of the Indo-Pacific Quad, Australia, India, Japan, and the United States joined efforts to provide maritime domain awareness throughout the region. American officials also stepped up trilateral security cooperation with Japan and South Korea.

Among the many partners involved in these efforts, Canberra, Manila, and Tokyo frequently stand out as common denominators. At a meeting of their leaders in 2024, the Japanese, Philippine, and U.S. governments expressed “serious concerns” about China's “dangerous and aggressive behavior” and announced initiatives on infrastructure investment and technology cooperation, among other measures. Later that year, Australian, Japanese, and U.S. defense leaders unveiled another set of cooperative activities, including three-way military exercises and advanced defense industrial cooperation. Perhaps most promising of all is a new grouping that brings together all four of these parties—Australia, Japan, the Philippines, and the United States. Known informally as “the Squad” (to distinguish it from the Quad), the group conducts regular naval, maritime, and air force exercises in the South China Sea. It also plans to strengthen information sharing and work together to modernize the Philippine military.

The new convergence in the Indo-Pacific represents a profound development in the security architecture of the region. But it is best viewed as an incomplete evolution—an important period of transition rather than an optimal end state. The shortcomings are significant. There are no mutual defense obligations between U.S. allies, only with the United States. There is no central headquarters to plan and conduct multilateral operations. And the unofficial nature of these groupings means that there is no regular drumbeat of planning among political and military staffs. Coordination is occurring, but only intermittently. As a result, it rarely receives the necessary urgency, attention, and resources.

A collective defense pact would deliver where the current mechanisms fall short. Getting there would not require a panregional security organization such as NATO, which grew from 12 original members to over 30. Instead, the logical starting point for Washington is to form a pact with the three partners that are most strategically aligned and have the fastest-growing and most robust combined military cooperation: Australia, Japan, and the Philippines.

Additional members could join later, circumstances allowing. As an advanced and stalwart ally in East Asia, South Korea would be an obvious candidate, and its contributions could be quite significant. But Seoul would have to decide whether it was willing to focus its defense forces more on China, partner more closely with Japan, and support a broader regional orientation for its own military and the tens of thousands of U.S. troops stationed on the peninsula. New Zealand would be another prospective partner, especially since it is already part of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing group alongside Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. But although New Zealand has recently shown greater willingness to challenge China and align more closely with the United States, it might not yet be prepared to enter a formal collective defense pact. 



Critical U.S. partners such as India and Singapore would not be expected to join at the outset but could still participate in certain activities as observers or in some other nonmember capacity, as is common in regional groupings. The inclusion of Taiwan would not be possible or advisable under current U.S. policy, nor would it be acceptable to the other members of the pact. As for the United States' European allies, they are neither politically nor militarily ready to join as full members right now, but that option could be considered in the future, under different circumstances. Larger defense budgets in Europe could produce militaries with more global reach, provided the continent itself is secure and at peace.

Given the urgency of the China challenge, the United States cannot afford to wait for a perfect alignment among all its partners. There is already a core group in place and room to consider additional members in the future. Preparations should begin now. Given that alliances with the United States already exist, a first-order task is to establish mutual obligations among Australia, Japan, and the Philippines themselves. This will demand skillful leadership and intense negotiations, but the benefits of stronger deterrence and greater security should outweigh the risks of closer alignment. Besides, for Australia and Japan in particular, the practical differences between today's defense partnership and one of mutual defense are relatively small and shrinking by the day.

From an operational perspective, collective defense could build on existing cooperative projects, including in the areas of intelligence sharing, maritime domain awareness, combined training and exercises, and command and control. One such project is the Bilateral Intelligence Analysis Cell, a new U.S.-Japanese effort at Yokota Air Base that monitors Chinese activity in the East China Sea. Japan and the United States could share the cell's intelligence with Australia and the Philippines, which could in turn contribute personnel at the air base and provide data from their own unmanned surface and aerial platforms. Likewise, the recently inaugurated U.S.-Philippine Combined Coordination Center near Manila could include Australia and Japan, providing similar functions in the South China Sea.



The U.S. military has major operating bases in Japan, access to locations in the Philippines, and regular rotations of U.S. troops throughout Australia. With sufficient legal underpinning—including reciprocal access agreements among the three Asian allies— each of these arrangements could be expanded to include forces from the other members. In fact, there are already plans to integrate Japanese forces into U.S. initiatives in Australia.

The four members could also invest in shared military facilities. Major bilateral and trilateral military exercises involving different combinations of the partners could include all four. Together, they could more readily pre-position weapons to ensure sufficient stockpiles in the event of conflict, further strengthening deterrence. Establishing a headquarters for the Pacific Defense Pact and mechanisms for command and control will be essential. Japan could serve as one potential location. In July 2024, the United States announced its intent to upgrade the U.S. military command in Japan to plan and direct more missions in the region with its Japanese counterpart. As new facilities and communications links are established to support this effort, U.S. and Japanese officials should ensure that it will be possible to include military commanders and personnel from Australia and the Philippines. Alternative locations for the headquarters could be considered in Australia or at U.S. Indo-Pacific Command in Hawaii.

The four countries should establish a series of working groups to negotiate the full range of policy and legal issues associated with more integrated planning and operations. Military and civilian staff from defense and foreign ministries could work together to develop proposals for governance and decision-making processes, including personnel structures and consultation mechanisms that form the engine rooms of day-to-day alliance management. This breadth of tasks only underscores the need to start consultations as soon as possible.

In addition to deepening their collective cooperation with one another, U.S. allies will also need to rebalance their bilateral security partnerships with Washington. In their current form, those partnerships reflect the asymmetries of a different era, when American military primacy appeared uncontested and immutable. Bilateral treaties in the region were restricted in scope to specific local geographies, and the contributions of allied militaries were limited by design. In essence, the United States promised protection in exchange for military access and political-economic comity in Asia but without demanding fully reciprocal protection for itself.

This framework was sustainable—both strategically and politically—as long as the U.S. military retained its dominance in the region, the threat from China was confined, and the potential contributions of U.S. allies were limited to their own self-defense. None of these conditions holds true today. The PLA now poses serious challenges to the U.S. military and the American homeland. And U.S. allies in Asia are now among the wealthiest and most advanced countries in the world, capable of playing a significant role in both deterrence and warfighting. To adapt to this new reality, U.S. alliances need to build on a foundation not of asymmetry but of reciprocity.

Domestic politics in the United States also makes greater reciprocity necessary. Although most Americans support military ties in principle, increasing numbers would like to see U.S. allies contribute more in practice. U.S. President Donald Trump has focused in particular on the notion that allies need to pay their “fair share,” casting doubts on whether the United States would defend NATO members that failed to meet certain levels of military spending. U.S. allies do need to spend more on defense—but reciprocity should extend far beyond bigger military budgets.



U.S. allies will also need to commit to greater degrees of mutual obligation with the United States. Washington's security treaty with Tokyo, for instance, is bound only to “the territories under the administration of Japan.” The resulting imbalance is on display at every major bilateral summit, where U.S. leaders reaffirm their commitment to defend Japan and Japanese leaders stay silent on whether their forces would assist the U.S. military elsewhere. Instead, U.S. allies should commit to supporting the United States both in crises throughout the region and in defending the U.S. homeland.

This new reciprocity would further enable collective defense. The upshot of more mutual obligation would be that U.S. allies could take on new roles and missions in crises and conflicts, especially when combined with recent investments in their own militaries. This would, in turn, open new pathways for cooperation that do not exist today in sufficient form: members of the pact could draft combined military plans, more effectively target their defense spending toward specialized and complementary capabilities, and rehearse and improve together through tailored military exercises and operations. These measures would fortify the collective power and deterrence of the United States' alliances far beyond what is possible under today's informal mechanisms.

Greater reciprocity should also entail greater clarity on what military strategists refer to as “access, basing, and overflight”—that is, the ability of the U.S. military to operate in and around allied territory. Given the vast distances involved, forward-deployed U.S. forces are essential to ensuring rapid response times and sustaining the military during a contingency. More certainty surrounding U.S. military access would strengthen deterrence in the western Pacific by ensuring that the United States would have the right forces and capabilities ready to fight in the right places. More assured access would also lead to greater infrastructure investments and the deployment of more advanced capabilities, which further enhance the potential utility of various locations. While U.S. allies should not be expected to give the U.S. military a blank check, a robust Pacific Defense Pact will require more flexible and assured access for U.S. forces.

Collective defense touches on matters of sovereignty and treaty obligations, deeply political issues that require intense negotiations and deft diplomacy. This will be all the more challenging if the Trump administration moves forward with punishing tariffs or other measures that strain Washington's alliances in the region. But even amid tense diplomatic relations, defense and military establishments can continue laying the foundations for collective defense. Short of a severe break in ties, the four partners should work as best they can to silo security cooperation from economic and diplomatic disagreements. The stakes are simply too high to do otherwise. It is also worth underscoring that the demand for more reciprocal relationships has become a political and strategic imperative that spans the partisan divide in Washington.

The evidence to date is that the United States and its Indo-Pacific allies are managing to deepen defense cooperation despite political and economic headwinds. This is largely owing to the mounting threat from China, the continued demand for a U.S. military presence in the region, and the growing trend of intra-Asian security cooperation. To be sure, the Trump administration may be too divided, distracted, or confrontational to play the winning hand it has been dealt. In that case, many of the building blocks can still be put in place for a future administration. Given the number of tasks ahead, a pact might not be finalized until the next U.S. administration anyway.

For their part, leaders in Canberra, Manila, and Tokyo will need to win the support of their respective domestic publics. Beyond strategic arguments about deterrence and national security, the United States can support these conversations by highlighting the potential benefits to its allies' domestic constituencies. These could include technology sharing, infrastructure investments, and improved disaster response. In the United States, skeptics can be assured that a defense pact in the Pacific would entail no obligations for the U.S. military beyond what is already in place—but that it would reduce threats to the U.S. homeland and to U.S. troops.



Given the historic significance of such an arrangement, Washington should also be prepared to manage reactions and concerns from others in the Indo-Pacific. U.S. officials can underscore that a Pacific Defense Pact would be but one of several components of its approach to the region. In both rhetoric and practice, Washington should remain committed to a network of overlapping and complementary institutions, including the Indo-Pacific Quad, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and trilateral cooperation with Japan and South Korea. The publicly stated objective of the pact should be the pursuit of a “free and open Indo-Pacific,” a goal shared by nearly every country in the region.

Moreover, the pact should remain focused on defense rather than subsuming or taking on the economic and diplomatic roles of other important institutions. Indeed, the pact will be most successful if complemented by a robust regional trade agenda, active diplomatic efforts, and effective foreign assistance programs.

Protests from Beijing will no doubt be as loud as they are predictable. China has long accused the United States of “Cold War thinking” and “bloc politics.” PLA officials have already warned that current U.S. efforts to bring American security partners closer together are “tying the region's countries to the U.S. war chariot.” These refrains will feature prominently in China's reaction precisely because a stronger coalition could stymie Beijing's revisionist ambitions. To push back and make potential members think twice about a new pact, Beijing will likely draw from its traditional playbook of disinformation and economic coercion. With that in mind, the United States should help its allies prepare for China's efforts to scuttle a collective defense arrangement in Asia.

None of this will be easy. But neither was the great progress that Washington's allies have already made, not only in acknowledging the threat from China but also in taking unprecedented steps to invest in their own militaries, build ties with their neighbors, and double down on their alliances with the United States. In fact, in recent years, Australia, Japan, and the Philippines have already made moves on defense and security matters that were previously deemed implausible. The conditions are now set for strong leadership to transform a collective defense pact in Asia from something once unimaginable into a defining feature of the region's future peace and prosperity.

National Public Radio and three local stations are suing President Donald Trump, arguing that an executive order aimed at cutting federal funding for the organization is illegal.

NEW YORK (AP) — National Public Radio and three of its local stations sued President Donald Trump on Tuesday, arguing that his executive order cutting funding to the 246-station network violates their free speech and relies on an authority that he does not have.

Earlier this month, Trump instructed the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and federal agencies to cease funding for NPR and PBS, either directly or indirectly. The president and his supporters argue their news reporting promotes liberal bias and shouldn't be supported by taxpayers.

Retaliation is Trump's plain purpose, the lawsuit argues. It was filed in federal court in Washington by NPR and three Colorado entities — Colorado Public Radio, Aspen Public Radio and KUTE, Inc., chosen to show the system's diversity in urban and rural areas.

“By basing its directives on the substance of NPR's programming, the executive order seeks to force NPR to adapt its journalistic standards and editorial choices to the preferences of the government if it is to continue to receive federal funding,” Katherine Maher, NPR's CEO, said Tuesday.

The lawsuit alleges that Trump is acting to contravene the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a private nonprofit corporation set up to distribute federal funding to NPR and PBS, which is intended to insulate the system from political interference. Congress has appropriated $535 million yearly to CPB for 2025, 2026 and 2027.

In response to the lawsuit, White House deputy press secretary Harrison Fields said that CPB “is creating media to support a particular political party on the taxpayers' dime,” so Trump was exercising his authority under the law. “The president was elected with a mandate to ensure efficient use of taxpayer dollars, and he will continue to use his lawful authority to achieve that objective,” Fields said.




Trump hasn't hidden his feelings about NPR, calling it a “liberal disinformation machine” in an April social media post.

The court fight seemed preordained, given that the heads of NPR and PBS both reacted to Trump's move earlier this month with statements that they believed it was illegal. The absence of PBS from Tuesday's filing indicates the two systems will challenge this separately; PBS has not yet gone to court, but is likely to soon.

“PBS is considering every option, including taking legal action, to allow our organization to continue to provide essential programming and services to member stations and all Americans,” PBS spokesman Jeremy Gaines said Tuesday.

The president's attempts to dismantle government-run news sources like Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty have also sparked court fights.

The administration has battled with the press on several fronts. The Federal Communications Commission is investigating ABC, CBS and NBC News. The Associated Press also went to court after the administration restricted access to certain events in response to the organization's decision not to rename the Gulf of Mexico as Trump decreed.

The lawsuit says 11% of Aspen Public Radio's budget is provided by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. It is 6% for the Colorado Public Radio, a network of 19 stations, and 19% of KUTE's budget. That station was founded in 1976 by the Southern Ute Indian Tribe.

NPR notes that the order attempts to prohibit individual stations in NPR's system from using any federal money to buy NPR programming, like “All Things Considered,” the most listened-to afternoon radio news program in the country, its early counterpart “Morning Edition” and cultural programming like the Tiny Desk concerts.

The order “directly interferes with editorial independence by requiring them to seek programming elsewhere,” the lawsuit said.

NPR says it also provides infrastructure services to hundreds of public radio stations and without it, their coverage area would shrink. It also provides the backbone for emergency alert systems across the country.

“Public broadcasting is an irreplaceable foundation of American civic life,” Maher said. “At its best, it reflects our nation back to itself in all our complexity, contradictions and commonalities and connects our communities across differences and divides.”

Travel expert Lee Abbamonte discusses air traffic control outages and Memorial Day travel statistics on ‘Fox News Live.'

As summer approaches and many Americans plan to jet-set across the country and world on vacation, the U.S. Department of State is warning travelers to take caution while visiting a popular destination.

On May 23, the department reissued a level 2 travel advisory for travel to Italy, urging travelers to "exercise increased caution" due to "terrorism."

"There is risk of terrorist violence, including terrorist attacks and other activity in Italy," the warning read.

The advisory warns that terrorists "may attack with little or no warning" and encourages Americans to be aware of common targets, including tourist spots, transportation centers, shopping malls and markets, local government buildings, hotels, clubs, restaurants, religious sites, parks, sports and cultural events, schools, airports and public areas.

The travel advisory also emphasized the importance of "staying alert in tourist spots" and "to check local media for breaking news." 

"Be prepared to adjust your plans and prepare a contingency plan for emergency situations," the advisory read.

The department is also encouraging travelers to enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive messages and alerts from the U.S. Embassy, stating it "makes it easier to locate you in an emergency."

The warning comes as concerns over potential attacks in popular tourist destinations and public areas heighten in Italy, which remains one of the top European destinations for American tourists.

In May, the State Department issued travel advisories for 21 countries worldwide, ranging from the lowest level 1, which alerts travelers to "Exercise Normal Precautions," to the highest advisory at level 4, which means "Do Not Travel."

Italy has been under a level 2 advisory since April 2022, according to the State Department. 

France, Germany, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom also currently have level 2 advisories from the State Department.

The State Department said they review travel advisories on a regular basis and would update alerts "any time conditions change substantially."

Level 1 and 2 advisories are reviewed every 12 months, while levels 3 and 4 are reviewed at least every six months, the department added. 

A State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital that there is "no higher priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas."

"We take seriously our commitment to provide U.S. citizens with clear, timely, and reliable information about every country in the world so they can make informed travel decisions," a State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital. "The Department of State routinely updates our Travel Advisories and destination information pages based on a comprehensive review of all available safety information and ongoing developments."

You'll never guess which institutions are polling lower than almost any other right now. 

Television news, newspapers, and the Democratic Party.

Per Gallup's latest polling asking which institution voters trust most, small businesses rank highest at 65%, with the military and police coming in second and third, respectively. But at the bottom of the list, the big losers include Congress at 8%, television news at 14%, and newspapers at 18%. And per separate polling from Quinnipiac, the Democratic Party is clocking in at 21% approval. 

So, how did we get here? Let's list the five biggest examples of how the Blue Team and the media fell to being as trusted as gas station sushi. 

Yes, this was a dominant story that lasted several years during President Donald Trump's first term. It hampered his agenda while keeping his poll numbers in the high 30s to low 40s. 

“Do you still believe the president could be a Russian asset?” Anderson Cooper asked during an interview with disgraced former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe on CNN. 

“I think it's possible. I think that's why we started our investigation, and I'm really anxious to see where Mueller concludes that,” McCabe, who was fired from the FBI for leaking sensitive information to the press, replied without a hint of self-awareness.

MSNBC's Rachel Maddow went even further. In March 2017, she feared that Russia had not just stolen the election but also the U.S. government: “We are also starting to see what may be signs of continuing influence in our country. Not just during the campaign but during the administration. Basically signs what could be a continuing operation.”

It wasn't just cable news but broadcast entities such as ABC News as well:

“Breaking news: ABC News's Brian Ross is reporting Michael Flynn promised full cooperation to the Mueller team and is prepared to testify that as a candidate, Donald Trump directed him to make contact with the Russians!” Joy Behar exclaimed on ABC's The View. 

The examples from the New York Times, Washington Post, and basically almost every newspaper are endless. And even after the Robert Mueller report exonerated Trump, many of these outlets pushed the “Trump is owned by the Russians” narrative to this very day as he attempted to broker a peace between Ukraine and Russia. 

In the 2020 election year, Democrats and the media somehow blamed Trump for a pandemic that originated in Wuhan, China. He was called insensitive for calling COVID the “China virus,” which was appropriate considering its origin. 

May 11, 2020: Trump touts increased testing for COVID, which essentially shut down the country two months prior. But CBS reporter Weijia Jiang decided to be hostile in her line of questioning.  

“Why does that matter?” she asked Trump. “Why is this a global competition to you if every day, Americans are still losing their lives, and we're still seeing more cases every day?” 

“Well, they're losing their lives everywhere in the world. And maybe that's a question you should ask China,” Trump responded. “Don't ask me. Ask China that question, OK? When you ask them that question, you may get a very unusual answer.”

“Sir, why are you saying that to me specifically?” an offended Jiang shot back. 

“I'm not saying it specifically to anybody,” Trump calmly replied before moving on. 

After the press conference, Jiang continued to take exception and play the victim. Why? Because she was born in China. And on cue, the media played the race card from the bottom of the deck. 

Washington Post: “Trump's ‘ask China' response to CBS's Weijia Jiang shocked the room — and was part of a pattern.”

Vogue: “'Go Ask China': Trump's Latest Attack on a Female Reporter Sparks Outrage.” 

It turns out Trump was right about asking China after being called a conspiracy theorist for months after he, along with Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), correctly speculated that coronavirus didn't come from a rogue bat in a Wuhan seafood market but from a nearby lab that studies coronaviruses. A 2025 CIA report concluded that was indeed the case, as did a congressional report in December 2024. 

During the 2020 riots that resulted in billions of dollars in damage and scores of innocents injured or killed, supporters of Black Lives Matter donated $90 million to the organization that year. But according to tax documents, only $30 million of the $90 million went to charitable organizations. 

BLM co-founder Patrisse Cullors, however, allocated $1.6 million to her father for “security services,” while $2.1 million went to BLM board member Shalomyah Bowers for “consulting.” And per NPR in April 2022, $6 million was spent on a luxury home in California for BLM's top brass. 

So, after being heralded by professional sports leagues and legacy media, BLM has since seen its donations dry up and its relevance shattered. Even Black Lives Matter Plaza in Washington, D.C., was recently dismantled. Good riddance. 

“Hunter Biden story is Russian disinfo, dozens of former intel officials say.”

That was the headline of a Politico story in October 2020 touting that “more than 50 former intelligence officials signed a letter casting doubt on the provenance of a New York Post story on the former vice president's son.” 

It turns out the New York Post story was 100% correct. Hunter Biden's laptop detailed shady business dealings overseas through influence peddling. He made close to $1 million as a board member of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma without having any experience in the energy sector. 

Compensation from companies in China was also funneled through shell companies to various members of the Biden family, with emails citing “the big guy” receiving a 10% cut. According to Hunter Biden's business partner, Tony Bobulinski, the big guy was then-Vice President Joe Biden. 

But with the 2020 election coming, legacy media circled the wagons to dismiss and discredit the New York Post's reporting, while social media locked the New York Post out of its Twitter account. 

Years later, the media did a mea culpa on the laptop, but it was far too late. 

“Start your tape right now because I'm about to tell you the truth. And f*** you if you can't handle the truth. This version of Biden, intellectually, analytically, is the best Biden ever. Not a close second. And I have known him for years.” 

That was Joe Scarborough on MSNBC on March 6, 2024. The host made this comment despite seeing then-President Joe Biden repeatedly forget the names of his Cabinet members, call only on handpicked reporters during rare press conferences, wander off during photo shoots, fall up the stairs on Air Force One, claim to have conversations with dead people, and spend long weekends at his homes in Delaware. 

“So, I said that this was Biden at his best. That's what I saw,” Scarborough admitted last week with a limp apology before adding, “That's what other people saw. I was obviously wrong, so I'm not sure what my takeaway is here, the next time.”

Scarborough wasn't alone in his laughable assessment at the time. CNN's Jake Tapper lambasted Lara Trump in an interview when she accurately observed that Biden was experiencing a cognitive decline. The “anchor” simply blamed a “stutter” for Biden's lapses. Tapper, because he has a book to sell, is now looking back on his coverage with “humility.”

In 2024, before Biden dropped out of the presidential race, the White House blamed “cheap fake” videos produced by conservatives for Biden's decline. The media, showing there is no bottom, echoed this sentiment. 

Washington Post: “How Republicans used misleading videos to attack Biden in a 24-hour period.”

NBC News: “Misleading GOP videos of Biden are going viral. The fact-checks have trouble keeping up.”

It's beyond parody to look at these comments and headlines. It's also beyond pathetic that the media sunk this low to defend the indefensible with clear evidence to the contrary. 

DEMOCRATS SHIELDED TRUTH ABOUT BIDEN NOT TO HELP TRUMP

Can trust in the media and the Democratic Party ever return? 

After looking at these examples, the only answer to this question is, “Not on your life.”

President Donald Trump threatened to withhold federal funding from California on Tuesday after a transgender athlete competed in the female track and field state qualifiers.

Trump said he would speak to Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) on Tuesday and mentioned that the California governor recently said allowing biological males to compete in female sports was “unfair.”

In a Truth Social post, Trump said it was “totally demeaning to women and girls” that officials allowed the 16-year-old transgender athlete to compete in the state track event.

“California, under the leadership of Radical Left Democrat Gavin Newscum, continues to ILLEGALLY allow ‘MEN TO PLAY IN WOMEN'S SPORTS,” Trump posted. “This week a transitioned Male athlete, at a major event, won ‘everything,' and is now qualified to compete in the ‘State Finals' next weekend. As a Male, he was a less than average competitor. As a Female, this transitioned person is practically unbeatable.”

Criticism over the transgender athlete competing in the female event came after Newsom called it “deeply unfair” to allow biological males to compete in female sports on his podcast in March.

“The Governor, himself, said it is ‘UNFAIR,'” Trump posted. 

Trump signed an executive order in February prohibiting biological males from competing in female sports. His administration has been enforcing Title IX civil rights protections on the basis of biological sex, as opposed to gender identity. The government is interpreting policies that require females to compete against transgender athletes, instead of having female-exclusive sports, as Title IX violations.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MOVES TO PULL MAINE K-12 FUNDING AS JUDGE PAUSES USDA SCHOOL LUNCH CUTS

The Trump administration has been in a legal battle with Maine over its allowance of biological males to compete in female sports. 

The government has withheld funding from Maine and frozen millions of dollars in funding from the University of Pennsylvania due to similar practices.

            Forget marching in the streets with creative signs. For President Donald Trump's second term, in the face of steep funding cuts for climate and weather research and forecasting, scientists have a new way of engaging the public: livestreamed presentations.
    


            Starting Wednesday at 1 p.m. ET and lasting for 100 straight hours, climate and weather specialists will spend 15 minutes each talking about their work and why it is so valuable for the American people.
    


            Their goal is to call attention to the impacts of cuts to federal agencies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NASA and the Department of Energy, along with the Trump administration's withholding of research funding to academia.
    


            The livestream marathon is billed as nonpartisan, according to Marc Alessi of the environmental group Union of Concerned Scientists, who is one of about a dozen organizers.
    


            But while speakers may not denounce the Trump administration head-on, the effort is a response to policy moves that have left the National Weather Service short-staffed at the start of hurricane season and climate science research in the budgetary crosshairs, and it is seen among the community as a form of so-called resistance to the administration's changes.
    


            It is also timed to mark the end of NASA's longstanding lease at Columbia University, which housed the agency's top climate lab, known as the Goddard Institute for Space Studies. The Trump administration canceled that lease in April, and the facility's scientists, who study Earth's climate and track global average temperatures, will be forced to work remotely.
    


            “We think that this livestream is basically an opportunity for scientists to show how these cuts to our research really damage our ability to do climate science and weather prediction,” Alessi said. “If the American public tunes in, they watch our science talks, they will see how our science benefits the public,” he said.
    


            Climate scientist Kate Marvel, who will be participating in the livestream event in her personal capacity, said the series of talks may be “The scientist-iest thing we could do,” but it makes sense given the expertise of those who are taking part.
    


            “This is really speaking to the public and saying, ‘Look, look at all of the amazing stuff you get for pennies on the dollar,'” she said, referring to publicly-funded weather and climate research.
    


            As for the event's potential political overtones, she said the event is being organized by many early-career researchers interested in shoring up the viability of their field of study and sharing the relevance of their work.
    


            “Nobody wants to hear me complain about the administration,” Marvel said.

Live Updates


            • The latest: Capricorn Clark, a former employee of Sean “Diddy” Combs, is testifying in his criminal sex-trafficking trial.
    


            • Previous testimony: Rapper Kid Cudi — who had a brief relationship with Cassie Ventura — testified last week about his interactions with Combs. Ventura testified earlier in the trial that she endured physical and sexual abuse from Combs and detailed how he orchestrated drug-fueled sex performances called “Freak Offs.”
    


            • Federal charges: Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that include racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. If convicted on all counts, he could face up to life in prison.
    


            • Editor's Note: If you or someone you know is struggling with intimate partner violence, there are resources available, including the National Domestic Violence Hotline.



            Capricorn Clark, a former employee of Sean “Diddy” Combs, is back on the stand following a lunch break, and the jury is returning.
    


            Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo is continuing cross-examination.
    


            Judge Arun Subramanian is back on the bench following the lunch break. Lawyers are discussing upcoming exhibits before the jury is brought in.
    


            Prosecutors said that they are so far ahead of schedule, their case is likely shaping up to last five weeks instead of the six weeks they originally estimated.
    


            The jury has been dismissed for a lunch break until 1:15 p.m. ET.
    


            Capricorn Clark, Sean “Diddy” Combs' former employee, testified she texted Combs in June 2021, “Did you ever know that I had the biggest crush on you before I started to work for you?”
    


            “We hung out all the time, I played it super cool,” she said. “I don't think you knew. I just knew for sure that you liked to have me around.”
    


            Clark testified she doesn't remember saying this to Combs but recalled reaching out to him in 2021.
    


            It's unclear how Combs responded to the texts.
    


            Capricorn Clark, a former employee for Sean “Diddy” Combs, testified that she met Combs around 2002 through a mutual friend shortly after she moved to New York City.
    


            She said her relationship with Combs was “1,000%” platonic.
    


            Clark said Combs took ecstasy in the early stages of their friendship, and his drug use increased over time.
    


            Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo began by confirming with Capricorn Clark, a former employee of Sean “Diddy” Combs, that they had met before.
    


            Agnifilo, Teny Geragos, and another attorney for Sean Combs, Jonathan Davis, met with Clark, who brought an attorney and a friend with her on April 10, 2024.
    


            Agnifilo asked Clark to confirm that she told the lawyers at the meeting that Combs “wouldn't be in this mess if he had kept (her) around.”
    


            She acknowledged she probably said something like that as they discussed the possibility of her returning to work for him as his chief of staff.
    


            She also told the lawyers at the meeting that Cassie Ventura wasn't good for Combs.
    


            The attorney who accompanied Clark to that meeting was Bryan Freedman, the well-known entertainment lawyer representing Justin Baldoni in the ongoing litigation with Blake Lively.
    


            Returning to that meeting in April 2024, Agnifilo suggested that she was told it would be impossible to hire her amid the ongoing criminal investigation into Combs. She said she didn't remember that being said.
    


            Capricorn Clark, a former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs and a former employee of his Sean John fashion company, is back on the stand after a short break. The jury is entering.
    


            Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo has begun cross-examination.
    


            Since Sean “Diddy” Combs federal criminal trial began earlier this month, three of the music mogul's former assistants have been called to testify about their experience working for him, with patterns starting to emerge.
    


            On the stand today is Capricorn Clark, a former personal assistant to Combs and former marketing executive for his clothing brand Sean Jean.
    


            So far, Clark testified that she was subjected to taking a lie detector test, threats and intimidation, and witnessed Combs be violent with Cassie Ventura. She also described an encounter where she saw Combs enter rapper Kid Cudi's home after he found out about his relationship with Ventura, an incident that Kid Cudi testified about last week.
    


            Clark is the third former Combs assistant to testify, joining David James and George Kaplan. Her testimony continues this afternoon.
    


            James was an assistant for Combs from 2007 to 2009 and worked for Combs during the early part of his relationship with Ventura. He testified he did not personally observe physical violence between the two.
    


            James described witnessing Combs use drugs and testified about his role in stocking hotel rooms for him when he traveled. He also testified about being subjected to lie detector tests and intimidation.
    


            Kaplan testified last week that he left the company because he was not “comfortable or aligned with the physical behavior” that he observed over several months, and recounted instances in which he saw Combs be violent with Ventura and another former girlfriend.
    


            Kaplan also said part of his job as Combs' assistant was to clean up the hotel rooms Combs stayed in and, at one point, he said he picked up drugs for him.
    


            Another high-ranking executive on Combs' team, Kristina Khorram, Combs' former chief of staff, has been mentioned several times during testimony throughout the trial, but there is no indication yet whether she will be called to testify.
    


Remember: Combs is facing charges of sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and transportation to engage in prostitution. The government alleges that between 2004 and 2024, Combs created a criminal enterprise using his business empire where he engaged in sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery and obstruction of justice.
    


            Jurors in the Sean “Diddy” Combs' federal racketeering and sex-trafficking trial have heard from 17 witnesses so far.
    


Here's a recap of what was said:



Capricorn Clark, former employee of Sean “Diddy” Combs and Cassie Ventura:



            Sean “Diddy” Combs' mother and sister are inside the courtroom today. After court recessed for a short break, Combs' mother kissed defense lawyer Nicole Westmoreland on the cheek.
    


            Combs' sister Keisha, who has been a constant presence at the trial, is also present today.
    


            None of Combs' children are in the courtroom. Combs' mother was overheard saying she attended her granddaughters' graduation and prom.
    


            During Capricorn Clark's emotional testimony, she often patted her eyes with a tissue. She seemed to avert her eyes from Combs but as she was leaving the courtroom during the break, she looked over toward his direction, clenched her jaw and nodded.
    


            Prosecutors' direct-examination of Capricorn Clark is over.
    


            Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo will begin cross-examination after court takes a short break.
    


            Capricorn Clark, Sean “Diddy” Combs' former employee, testified that she retained attorneys in 2023 after Cassie Ventura filed her lawsuit against Combs. The lawsuit “traumatized” Clark, she said.
    


            Clark met with attorneys for Combs in April 2024, and they spoke about the possibility of her working for one of Combs' companies again. She said she wanted her life back. Clark never heard from Combs' attorneys after that.
    


            Clark testified that she hasn't spoken to Ventura since 2018.
    


            The prosecution needs to show a pattern of “criminal activity” by Sean “Diddy” Combs and his associates to reinforce the racketeering conspiracy charge, CNN legal analyst and criminal defense attorney Joey Jackson said.
    


            “We're talking about the prosecution saying it was a criminal racketeering enterprise, a conspiracy, and so in order to do that you have to get people in your inner circle –– as we see the assistants who have testified so far –– that would establish that over a period of time there was illegal things happening in this business. That he was agreeing with his confederates who were acting as, really, as underbosses, to carry out his lawless activities,” Jackson told CNN's Wolf Blitzer.
    


            Jackson added the prosecutors will have to make sure their witnesses help their case by establishing a pattern of criminality.
    


                    “A pattern of threat, a pattern of guns, a pattern of drugs, a pattern of all this lawlessness that would go to show that this was a criminal enterprise that was designed to engage in such behavior over (a) continuous period of time … will be very significant if prosecutors want to get through the threshold of proving that it was indeed a criminal racketeering conspiracy,” Jackson noted.
                





            Though she was fired in 2012, Capricorn Clark returned to work for Sean “Diddy” Combs as Cassie Ventura's creative director in 2016, Clark testified.
    


            Clark hadn't been able to find other work, and she “wanted to try to get (her) life back,” Clark testified. Clark reported to Combs, and he approved all of Ventura's projects, Clark said.
    


            Clark testified she noticed an increase in Ventura's drug use during this time.
    


            Clark left the position in 2018, and that was the last time she worked for Ventura, she testified.
    


            Capricorn Clark, Sean “Diddy” Combs' former employee, said after she was terminated, Combs told her, “That I would never work again, that he would show me that all these people weren't my friends, that he would make me kill myself.”
    


            Clark testified that she received a settlement through Combs' attorneys over wrongful termination allegations in the fall of 2012.
    


            She did not disclose the amount on the stand.
    


            Capricorn Clark said she was fired in August 2012.
    


            She said she was still being sent work while she was on vacation, so she told an HR employee that Sean “Diddy” Combs was mad at her because she “didn't tell him his girlfriend was cheating on him.”
    


            She was terminated shortly after, she said, accused of improperly taking vacation.
    


            After the December 2011 incident, Sean “Diddy” Combs told Capricorn Clark she couldn't be friends with Cassie Ventura; they could only see each other for work.
    


            Clark testified that her relationship with Ventura changed after that.
    


            Clark also said that in early 2012, she informed someone in human resources and Harve Pierre, the former president of Bad Boy Records, about the kidnapping incident and how Combs wanted to kill Kid Cudi and beat Ventura.
    


            Pierre just told her, “That's crazy, but it's going to be OK.”
    


            After the events of late 2011, Sean “Diddy” Combs would angrily ask Capricorn Clark why she didn't tell him about Cassie Ventura's brief relationship with Kid Cudi, Clark testified.
    


            One time, Combs told her, “I should kill you b*tches, and I should cut her face,” Clark testified.
    


            Clark estimated Combs threatened her about 50 times between December 2011 and the following summer.
    


            Capricorn Clark, a former employee of Sean “Diddy” Combs, said arson investigators reached out to her in 2012, asking her to make a statement about an arson incident involving Kid Cudi's vehicle.
    


            Clark said she hung up the phone and did not provide a statement.
    


            “I wanted this whole thing to be over,” she testified.
    


            Clark added that she never discussed an arson incident involving Cudi with Combs.
    


Remember: Cudi testified last week that one morning in January 2012, his dog watcher called him from his home to tell him that his car was on fire. Looking at photos, Cudi explained that it looked “like the top of my Porsche was cut open, and that's where the Molotov cocktail was put in,” causing further damage that couldn't be salvaged,
    


            The jury again saw the email Cassie Ventura sent Capricorn Clark and her mother on December 23, 2011, under the alias “Veronica Bang,” referencing the threats from Sean “Diddy” Combs to Ventura and Kid Cudi.
    


            Clark testified she can't remember if she responded to the email.
    


            Capricorn Clark said that after Sean “Diddy” Combs allegedly broke into Kid Cudi's home, she approached Cassie Ventura, who was still with Kid Cudi.
    


            Clark told them, “If you tell on him, he's going to hurt us all.”
    


            According to Clark, Ventura responded by asking her, “Do you really think he will?”
    


            Clark said Ventura then went with Clark to Combs' Los Angeles rental home. Combs in a robe and underwear and “immediately began kicking Cassie,” Clark testified.
    


            Clark said she and a security guard stood by as Combs repeatedly kicked Ventura. Clark said Combs threatened to hurt her, too, if she tried to stop him from hurting Ventura.
    


            Clark said she left after the security guard told her to leave, and Ventura was still on the ground while Combs continued to kick her.
    


            Clark said that she called Ventura's mom, Regina Ventura, as she left the property.
    


                    “Please help her. I can't call the police but you can,” Clark recalled telling Ventura's mother.
                





            Regina Ventura said she would handle it and hung up, Clark said.
    


            Former Sean “Diddy” Combs employee Capricorn Clark is now testifying about what happened directly after the episode in which she says Combs and a security guard were at Kid Cudi's home in December 2011.
    


            Clark, Combs, and his security guard went to a nearby nightclub, she said. Combs directed Clark to call Cassie Ventura and tell her that “he has me, and he's not going to let me go until I come get her,” Clark testified
    


            On the phone, Ventura responded that Clark should come get her, Clark testified.
    


            Combs then said she and Ventura needed to convince Kid Cudi to not tell police that Combs was involved in the break-in at Kid Cudi's home, Clark testified.
    


            Combs told her, “If you guys don't convince him of that, I'll kill all you,” according to Clark.
    


            Capricorn Clark, a former employee of Sean “Diddy” Combs, warned Cassie Ventura that Kid Cudi shouldn't face off against Combs.
    


            Clark testified she told Ventura, “Cassie, stop him, he's going to come get himself killed.” Ventura said she couldn't stop him. Clark testified she understood Kid Cudi was on his way to the house.
    


            When Combs got back in the car, he asked who Clark had been talking to. He called Ventura's burner phone, which was the last record in Clark's call log. Combs, furious, said, “B*tch what the f**k is this number.”
    


            A short time later, Kid Cudi pulled up next to Combs' Escalade outside his home and then accelerated away. Combs' vehicle followed in pursuit. “It felt like forever, but couldn't have been longer than a minute,” Clark testified about the pursuit.
    


            Capricorn Clark is giving more details about what happened after Sean “Diddy” Combs' showed up at her home in December 2011.
    


            She said she and Combs got into the backseat of a car that one of his security guards was driving. There gun was in Combs' lap, Clark testified.
    


            They drove to Kid Cudi's house, where Combs and the security guard entered the home, Clark said.
    


            Clark said she stayed in the car and called Cassie Ventura — Combs' former girlfriend who was dating Kid Cudi at the time — on a burner phone. She testified that she told Ventura that Combs had come to her house with a gun and then gone to Kid Cudi's house to kill him.
    


            She said she then changed Ventura's contact name in the phone to the name “Stormy” so Combs wouldn't know she called Ventura.
    


            Clark said she could hear someone yelling, “He's in my house?” in the background when they were on the phone, and Ventura told her she was with Kid Cudi.
    


            One day in December 2011, Sean “Diddy” Combs showed up at Capricorn Clark's home, banging on her door. According to Clark, she could see through the peephole that Combs' pants were split up the inseam from the knee upward, exposing his underwear.
    


            When she opened the door, Clark saw that he was holding a gun and was furious.
    


            Combs, entering her home, said, “Why didn't you tell me?” and asked her about Kid Cudi.
    


            Clark testified that Combs, still holding the gun, told her, “Get dressed, we're going to go kill” him.
    


            When she tried to protest, Combs said, “I don't give a f**k what you want to do, go get dressed.”
    


            Clark said she was afraid, and this was the first time Combs had been to her home in Los Angeles.
    


            Clark said Combs was “livid, furious, mad at me.”
    


            “I had never seen him with a weapon, I had never seen him making me do something like this,” she said.
    


            Capricorn Clark's voice has been quivering through much of her testimony Tuesday morning.
    


            Clark, a former employee for Sean “Diddy” Combs, has been describing what it was like to work for the rapper.
    


            Capricorn Clark, former employee for Sean “Diddy” Combs and his Sean Jean fashion company, has started testifying about Cassie Ventura dating  the rapper Kid Cudi in December 2011.
    


            Clark, Ventura and Kid Cudi sometimes would hang out, she said. One time, Ventura texted her, asking if they could pick up Kid Cudi, and Clark told Ventura to delete the text because Combs paid for both of their phones, Clark testified.
    


            Clark said she was “very concerned” about Combs finding out about the relationship between Ventura and Kid Cudi. Clark then took Ventura to Best Buy to buy a burner phone, she testified.
    


Remember: Ventura dated Combs from around 2007 to 2018. Kid Cudi testified last week that when he dated Ventura in December 2011, he believed at the time that Ventura was not romantically involved with Combs anymore.
    


            In 2011, Capricorn Clark, a former employee of Sean “Diddy” Combs, was also managing Cassie Ventura as her creative director.
    


            Clark said Combs had final approval over everything, including Ventura's physical appearance and every opportunity Ventura could or couldn't take.
    


            Capricorn Clark, a former employee for Sean “Diddy” Combs, said she returned to work for the hip-hop mogul after a 2006 incident at his Miami home, but not directly under him.
    


            Clark testified that she accepted the director of marketing position for “Sean John” women's line because she didn't have to work directly with him.
    


            “I didn't want that close proximity in his personal orbit like that,” she said.
    


            Capricorn Clark, a former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs, recounted a time she was at Combs' Miami home in the summer of 2006. She said when she arrived, Combs told her, “I don't care what goes on this weekend, you are not to leave this house.”
    


            Combs later directed Clark to escort a guest to another location in Miami, and she said she stayed for about an hour before receiving a call from Combs asking where she was.
    


            Clark said when she returned to Combs' home, he told her, “See, your problem is you want a life, and you can't have that here,” and again told her not to leave the house.
    


            The following day, Clark said she told Combs' chef, “I hate it here,” and the chef relayed that to Combs.
    


                    “He immediately looked at me and said, ‘You hate it here?' and he charged me,” Clark testified.
                





            She said Combs began pushing her and demanding she get out of his house. Clark said Combs pushed her about 30 yards using about 75% of his force, she said.
    


            Eventually, one of Combs' security guards intervened by telling Combs to stop and telling Clark to go pack her belongings. Clark testified she left her job after this incident because “it was crossing my boundary.”
    


            Capricorn Clark, Sean “Diddy” Combs' former employee, recalled a time when Combs had 100,000 euros that he made from club bookings in Europe.
    


            Clark said she personally counted the cash and believed Combs kept it in his personal safe in his bedroom.
    


            Capricorn Clark saw Sean “Diddy” Combs doing ecstasy and molly about once a week, in addition to prescription medication, she testified.
    


            Combs' drug use increased over time, she said. A man called “One Stop” usually provided the drugs when they were in Los Angeles, and the drugs usually were delivered to her or to Combs directly, she said. Combs asked her to get him ecstasy fewer than 10 times, she said.
    


            Clark saw Combs offer drugs to his friends and girlfriends, she said.
    


            During a trip to France in 2006, Combs asked her to get cocaine, and when she asked Combs who it was for, Combs responded that it wasn't for him, she testified. Clark then had the security guards obtain the drugs, she testified.
    


            Clark also would get prescription drugs for Combs, she said. Sometimes the prescriptions were made out to her, and other times they were made out to Combs, she testified.
    


            The testimony of Capricorn Clark, a former employee of Sean “Diddy” Combs, should help corroborate both Kid Cudi and Cassie Ventura's testimonies, but the prosecution still has a lot to prove in other areas of the case, according to CNN legal analyst and former prosecutor Jennifer Rodgers.
    


            “It seems to me that (prosecutors) have decided to start with this bucket: Cassie Ventura, her testimony, and then all of the testimony that corroborates her,” Rodgers told CNN. “But I think the jury is thinking about this conspiracy… . You need two people to criminally conspire for this racketeering conspiracy to work.”
    


            Rodgers added she thinks prosecutors need to answer more questions for the jury related to the racketeering conspiracy charge.
    


            Those other questions include laying out “where are the other conspirators – not only who did things for him, like any employee would, but who had a meeting of the minds, a criminal meeting of the minds that they were all together in this enterprise,” Rodgers said.
    


            As for how the prosecution may go about proving the alleged criminal acts Combs committed within his business empire, Rodgers said they need to “identify” people within his business who may have been “involved in the criminality of what they were doing.”
    


            Rodgers said they can also show that “through testimony,” with witnesses saying they were directly “criminally involved” or by naming others who “knew what was going on.”
    


            When Sean “Diddy” Combs traveled, his rooms were usually reserved under the names Frank Black or Frank White, Capricorn Clark, Combs' former assistant, testified.
    


            The name Frank Black was a reference to the late rapper and Bad Boy Records artist Notorious B.I.G., who had a nickname of Frank White.
    


            “I would unpack all of his clothes and shoes and personal belongings and put them in their place,” she said.
    


            Combs traveled with a toiletry bag containing drugs and a camera box, which had four cameras along with a small bottle of baby oil and a small bottle of lube, according to Clark.
    


            Clark said she would also bring candles to provide lighting in the rooms.
    


            After Combs' stay, Clark said she would sweep the room for anything left behind. She said she sometimes saw damage to the rooms, including “handprints left in oil.”
    


            Capricorn Clark continues to testify about her early employment under Sean “Diddy” Combs, when she was his personal assistant around 2004 to 2006.
    


            At one point, a human resources representative from Bad Boy presented Combs with a sheet that calculated what Clark was owed for overtime, $80,000, for a three-month period, she said.
    


            “He ripped up the paper,” Clark said. She was never compensated for the overtime, Clark testified.
    


            Capricorn Clark, the former director of marketing for Sean “Diddy” Combs, typically worked from 9 a.m. until 4 a.m. as Combs' personal assistant without breaks for meals.
    


            Combs told her that if she failed to complete any tasks, she would lose her job, she testified.
    


            She said that on a good night, she got four hours of sleep and developed stress-induced alopecia.
    


            Clark made $65,000 annually at the time, she said.
    


            Capricorn Clark, a former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs, said that after he accused her of stealing diamond jewelry from him, she was given a lie detector test.
    


                    “I was petrified,” Clark said.
                





            At one point, the man administering the test told her she needed to calm down because the results were inconclusive.
    


            “I'm not getting a good reading, you need to you're going to be in the East River if I cant get a reading on this,” Clark recalled the man saying.
    


            “I couldn't calm down,” she said.
    


            Eventually, one of Combs' security guard took her home and picked her up the next day to repeat the same process. Clark testified she was taken to the same vacant office building for questioning with the lie detector for five straight days.
    


            She said she didn't want to do it but thought the lie detector was the only way to prove her innocence.
    


            Clark said she didn't report the incident to the police because she worked under a non-disclosure agreement. Judge Arun Subramanian sustained a defense objection to the testimony about the NDA and told the jury to disregard it.
    


            After the five days for tests, Combs' security told Clark she could return to work, she said. Clark testified that Combs never asked her where she was during those five days and he never mentioned the lie detector tests to her. She said she didn't know if the jewelry was ever found.
    


            One time, Sean “Diddy” Combs accused Capricorn Clark of stealing diamond jewelry that was on loan to him from a jeweler, the former assistant testified.
    


            Clark had been assigned to hold the jewelry as they traveled from New York to Miami. She realized the bag holding the jewelry was missing before they got to the airport, Clark testified.
    


            Combs went on to Miami, leaving Clark with a security guard who questioned her for hours and then searched her apartment.
    


            The next day, the security guard picked her up from her home and left her in a locked vacant office space with another man who administered a lie detector test on her.
    


            Clark testified that the man told her at the time that if she failed the test, “they're going to throw you into the East River.” She described him as “very wide” but never learned his name.
    


            When Capricorn Clark was Sean “Diddy” Combs' personal assistant, she heard him discuss guns once, she testified.
    


            Clark, Combs and his then-manager got into an elevator after Combs did an MTV event that also involved rapper 50 Cent, she said.
    


            Combs told his elevator companions he had an issue with 50 Cent, and after further conversation, Combs said, “I don't do that; I like guns,” Clark testified. Combs' demeanor was very serious, she said.
    


            On her first day working for Sean “Diddy” Combs in 2004, Capricorn Clark said he took her to Central Park with his security guard some time after 9 p.m. ET. There, he brought up her former employment with Death Row Records, which was founded by Combs' rival Marion “Suge” Knight.
    


            “He told me that he didn't know that I had anything to do with Suge Knight and if anything happened, he would have to kill me,” Clark testified.
    


            The security guard stood by silently while Combs threatened her, Clark said. She said she told Combs at the time, “we'll just have to see.”
    


            She testified that she felt she couldn't convince him that she was trustworthy at the time and said could've been more transparent about her employment background.
    


            Capricorn Clark, the former director of marketing for Sean “Diddy” Combs, said she has been involved in the music industry since shortly after graduating from high school, when she landed an internship with Def Jam Records.
    


            She said both of her parents died shortly after that, which meant she had to “start life a lot earlier.”
    


            After Def Jam, she worked for Death Row Records, which Suge Knight then managed. Around 2004, she started working for Combs at Bad Boy Entertainment as his personal assistant, she said.
    


            After briefly leaving in 2006, she returned to work for Combs in 2007 as the director of marketing for Sean John Women's.
    


            She said she became a global brand director in 2008 before being terminated in 2012. She then worked as Cassie Ventura's creative director from 2016 to 2018.
    


            The jury has entered, and prosecutors have called Capricorn Clark, a former director of marketing for Sean “Diddy” Combs, to the stand.
    


            Clark is the 17th witness called by the prosecution. Assistant US Attorney Mitzi Steiner will question her.
    


            Clark came up in last week's testimony by rapper Kid Cudi.
    


            As jurors head into a third week of testimony in the Sean “Diddy” Combs federal criminal case, prosecutors are still working to prove Combs was involved in a criminal enterprise, engaged in arson, kidnapping and other illegal acts.
    


            But have they done enough? Not yet, according to CNN legal analyst and criminal defense attorney, Joey Jackson.
    


            Prosecutors are attempting to lay the foundation for the racketeering conspiracy charge Combs faces through witnesses who spoke about Combs' alleged involvement with arson and extortion, Jackson told CNN's Sara Sidner.
    


            Rapper Kid Cudi, who dated Combs' ex-girlfriend and key witness in trial, Cassie Ventura, testified and accused Combs of setting his Porsche on fire with a Molotov cocktail while he was dating Ventura.
    


            Last week, Ventura's mother testified about taking a home equity loan to get $20,000 to pay Combs, asked for to “recoup money he had spent” on her daughter “because he was angry that she had been in a relationship” with Kid Cudi.
    


            In order to further prove the racketeering charge, prosecutors need to establish “continuous use of the enterprise over a significant period of time, not just these one-off activities, and sexual exploitation and trafficking would lead to that.”
    


            Prosecutors “have to show more coercion and forced activity,” Jackson said.
    


            The Los Angeles Fire Department investigator who led the investigation into the fire set to Kid Cudi's Porsche at his home in January 2012 is expected to testify today.
    


            The investigator is expected to say that he concluded that the fire was deliberately set and caused by a Molotov cocktail dropped into the Porsche.
    


            Over an objection from prosecutors, Judge Arun Subramanian said the defense can ask the investigator about his report that says partial female DNA was recovered from the glass bottle used to create the explosive.
    


            Court has resumed in the sex-trafficking trial of Sean “Diddy” Combs as it enters its third week of testimony.
    


             Judge Arun Subramanian is on the bench. Prosecutors and defense attorneys are discussing some issues before the jury enters.
    


            Former Combs' employee Capricorn Clark is expected to testify today followed by witnesses from the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles Fire Department, according to prosecutor Maurene Comey.
    


            The jury has already heard from two other former assistants for Combs, George Kaplan, and David James.
    


            The government has called sixteen witnesses so far.
    


            Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that include racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. If convicted on all counts, he could face up to life in prison.
    


This post has been updated with additional information.



            A woman identified as Victim-3 in Sean “Diddy” Combs' federal criminal case is not expected to take the stand in the trial, according to a source familiar with the case.
    


            “She didn't want to testify,” the source said, not providing any further details.
    


            Victim-3 was referenced in the government's superseding indictment as part of the racketeering conspiracy count. The indictment states that Combs and his associates wielded his power through his business empire to “intimidate, threaten and lure” at least three female victims – “Victim-1,” “Victim-2” and “Victim-3” – under the pretense of a romantic relationship and coerced them into engaging in commercial sex acts. Prosecutors allege some of these sex acts, known as “Freak Offs,” involved male sex workers who were transported across state lines.
    


            Three sources familiar with the case told CNN that Victim-3 is the woman who has been referred to as “Gina” throughout the trial. Gina has been described in testimony as an ex-girlfriend of Combs.
    


            CNN has reached out directly to Victim-3, regarding her participation in the case.
    


            Last week, Combs' former assistant George Kaplan testified that he once witnessed Combs throwing apples at Gina at his home in Miami. Cassie Ventura, the case's star witness and another former girlfriend of Combs, testified that Combs was unfaithful to her by continuously dating Gina during their 11-year relationship. And Ventura's former best friend, Kerry Morgan, corroborated Ventura's account in her own testimony, saying on the stand that Gina was a problem in Ventura and Combs' relationship.
    


            Prior to the start of testimony at the trial, prosecutors indicated in early May that they may not call Victim-3 as a part of their case. Assistant US Attorney Maurene Comey said they “may” try to call her, but said that while she's under subpoena to testify, “she may not show up.” Comey noted that it's been difficult to get in touch with Victim 3's lawyer.
    


            In court on Wednesday, outside the presence of the jury, defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said that Gina “is out of the case. Gina is not coming.”
    


            Assistant US Attorney Christy Slavik said that Gina was “very much a part of this case,” adding that she was identified in the indictment.
    


            CNN has reached out to the prosecutor's office for comment.
    


                    “My point is not an indictment issue. The government can call Gina if it wants to,” Agnifilo responded. “It might be difficult. It might be hard to do. They are the United States of America. They can get Gina into this courtroom if that is what they want to do.”
                





            CNN has reached out to a representative for Combs for comment.
    


CNN's Kara Scannell and Nicki Brown contributed to this post. 



            The trial of Sean “Diddy” Combs resumes today after court took a break for the Memorial Day holiday weekend.
    


            As the second week of Sean “Diddy” Combs' racketeering trial wrapped up on Thursday, all eyes turned to another entertainer, Scott “Kid Cudi” Mescudi, whose explosive testimony about Combs included allegations of a burned-out Porsche and a frightened dog.
    


            CNN entertainment correspondent Elizabeth Wagmeister joined Laura Coates to break it all down on the latest episode of the “Trial By Jury: Diddy” podcast. You can listen to it here. 



            Prosecutor Maurene Comey on Thursday said the first witness they'll call today will be former Sean “Diddy” Combs' employee Capricorn Clark.
    


            After Clark, prosecutors plan to have witnesses from the Los Angeles Police Department and Los Angeles Fire Department. Comey said the prosecution's case is running on time.
    


            The jury has already heard from two other former assistants for Combs, George Kaplan and David James.
    


            The third week of testimony in Sean “Diddy” Combs' criminal sex trafficking trial begins today.
    


            Over the past two weeks, the jury has heard from 16 witnesses, including Cassie Ventura — the prosecution's star witness who testified for several days about the abuse she said she endured during her relationship with Combs.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Tuesday to halt a judge's order allowing migrants to challenge their deportations to South Sudan.

The emergency appeal came after a judge found the White House violated a court order with a deportation flight to the chaotic African nation carrying people from other countries who had been convicted of crimes in the U.S.

Judge Brian E. Murphy in Boston found that the White House had “unquestionably” violated his earlier order that people must be given a chance to raise objections before being sent to another country that would put them in danger, even if they've otherwise exhausted their legal appeals.

The U.S. says the order has wrongly stalled its efforts to carry out deportations of migrants who can't be returned to their home countries.

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge suggested the Trump administration was “manufacturing” chaos and said he hoped that “reason can get the better of rhetoric” in a scathing order in a case about government efforts to deport a handful of migrants from various countries to South Sudan.

In the order published Monday evening, Judge Brian Murphy wrote that he had given the Trump administration “remarkable flexibility with minimal oversight” in the case and emphasized the numerous times he attempted to work with the government.




“From the course of conduct, it is hard to come to any conclusion other than that Defendants invite a lack of clarity as a means of evasion,” the Boston-based Murphy wrote in the 17-page order. 

Murphy oversees a case in which immigration advocates are attempting to prevent the Trump administration from sending migrants they're trying to deport from the U.S. to countries that they're not from without giving them a meaningful chance to protest their removal. 

In a hearing last week called to address reports that eight immigrants had been sent to South Sudan, Murphy said the men hadn't been able to argue that the deportation could put them in danger.

But instead of ordering the government to return the men to the U.S. for hearings — as the plaintiffs wanted — he gave the government the option of holding the hearings in Djibouti where the plane had flown on its way to South Sudan as long as the men remained in U.S. government custody. Days later, the Trump administration filed another motion saying that Murphy was requiring them to hold “dangerous criminals in a sensitive location.” 

But in his order Monday he emphasized repeatedly that it was the government's “own suggestion” that they be allowed to process the men's claims while they were still abroad. 

“It turns out that having immigration proceedings on another continent is harder and more logistically cumbersome than Defendants anticipated,” Murphy wrote.

The government has argued that the men had a history with the immigration system, giving them prior opportunities to express a fear of being deported to a country outside their homeland. And they've said that the men's home — Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, Vietnam and South Sudan — would not take them back.

The administration has also repeatedly emphasized the men's criminal histories in the U.S. and portrayed them as national security threats. 

The Trump administration has increasingly relied on third countries to take immigrants who cannot be sent to their home countries for various reasons. Some countries simply refuse to take back their citizens being deported while others take back some but not all of their citizens. And some cannot be sent to their home countries because of concerns they'll be tortured or harmed.

Historically that has meant that immigration enforcement officials have had to release people into the U.S. that it wants to deport but can't.

But the Trump administration has leaned on other countries to take them. In the Western Hemisphere, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Panama have all agreed to take some people being removed from the U.S., with El Salvador being the most controversial example because it is holding people deported from the U.S. in a notorious prison. 

The Trump administration has said it's exploring other third countries for deportations.

Murphy said in his order that the eight men were initially told May 19 they'd be going to South Africa and then later that same day were told they were going to South Sudan. He noted that the U.S. government “has issued stark warnings regarding South Sudan.”

He said the men had fewer than 16 hours between being told they were going to be removed and going to the airport “most of which were non-waking hours” and “limited, if any” ability to talk to family or a lawyer. “Given the totality of the circumstances, it is hard to take seriously the idea that Defendants intended these individuals to have any real opportunity to make a valid claim,” the judge wrote.

A Texas oil executive from Elon Musk's government efficiency team has been given sweeping powers to overhaul the federal department that manages vast tracts of resource-rich public lands, but he hasn't divested his energy investments or filed an ethics commitment to break ties with companies that pose a conflict of interest, records show.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum recently directed Tyler Hassen, who lacks Senate confirmation and has no public administration experience, to reorganize the Interior Department, which oversees some 70,000 employees in 11 agencies including the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Geological Survey and the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

Before joining DOGE, Hassen spent nearly two decades as an executive at Basin Holdings, an enterprise involved in the manufacture, sale and servicing of oil rigs worldwide. A financial disclosure report obtained by AP shows Hassen made millions annually from these companies, owned by John Fitzgibbons — an industry giant who is well-connected in Russia.

These and other potential conflicts of interest are compounding the concerns of Democratic lawmakers, conservation groups and environmental advocates, who say Hassen's appointment appears designed to evade Senate confirmation and oversight while testing the limits of congressional authority.

“It's a dereliction of duty to offload decisions about staffing and funding at the Interior Department to someone who hasn't even been confirmed by the Senate,” said Kate Groetzinger, with the Center for Western Priorities, a nonpartisan conservation group.




Interior officials didn't respond to requests to interview Hassen.

Do you have a confidential tip for an AP reporter? Here's how to reach us securely. 

Department spokesperson Katie Martin said in an email that Hassen is helping achieve the president's vision for major changes, and Interior will “continue to prioritize retaining first responders, parks services and energy production employees.”

Once inside Interior in January, Hassen reviewed “every single contract, every single grant,” and sent action items to Burgum, he told FOX News in an April interview. Burgum praised Hassen and DOGE on X, saying they “have identified massive amounts of waste, fraud, and abuse already!”

A draft copy of Interior's new strategic plan includes increasing “clean coal, oil, and gas production through faster permitting” while reducing regulations to “generate more revenue from lands and resources for the U.S. Treasury.”

Hassen also has twice filed a notice in the Federal Register extending Trump's freeze on regulations — which stops agencies from proposing or issuing new rules — and removed the opportunity for public comment as “contrary to the public interest.” The latest extension pushes it to June 4.

It's unclear how Hassen became involved with Musk. There's little information about him online. He told FOX News that before DOGE, he was “running five businesses in Houston.” He said this work “is me giving back to the country.”

Hassen was an executive at Fitzgibbons-owned Basin Holdings — the privately held parent company for Basin Energy and Basin Industries — since 2008. An old Facebook page for Tyler Hassen includes a 2010 photo of him at the “Samotlor Field, Western Siberia - largest oilfield in Russia.”

Hassen's brother, Todd, is also a Texas energy executive. He's been CEO of Red Wolfpack Resources since 2024 and was with Tellurian, a natural gas company, and EagleStone Resources before that, according to his LinkedIn page.

Burgum named Hassen his assistant secretary for policy, management and budget in March, but changed his title in April to “principal deputy assistant secretary.” An assistant secretary requires Senate approval and an ethics commitment to resign positions that would create a conflict of interest. A principal deputy does not.

Kathleen Clark, a government ethics expert at Washington University in St. Louis, said Interior officials are committing fraud “by calling someone by a different name so that they don't have to file a really important document where they explain how they're going to comply with ethics standards.”

Hassen sought to fire a top department lawyer in April for refusing to give him and other DOGE officials access to a highly sensitive personnel database as he pushed for massive department-wide staff reductions through buyouts, early retirements and layoffs. Hassen wrote that Tony Irish, an associate solicitor, was “subverting, obstructing and delaying the process” and should be removed for misconduct.

Irish is on leave while appealing the firing and is represented by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility. “In seeking to remove Tony Irish, Tyler Hassen has demonstrated his own unfitness for federal service,” PEER executive director Tim Whitehouse said in a press release. “This type of corporate bullying is not how the people's business is supposed to be conducted.”

Jacob Malcom, a former Interior Department executive, said Burgum's order directing Hassen to make “appropriate funding decisions” for administrative changes and ensure “the appropriate transfer of funds, programs, records and property” is unconstitutional — Congress appropriates funds, not assistant secretaries.

“Unless Congress has explicitly authorized those funds to be moved, they can't actually transfer the funds,” Malcom said. “That's just flat out illegal.”

Although Hassen didn't file a divestment commitment, he did file a financial disclosure in February — revised five times, the most recent dated April 21 — revealing he made almost $4 million annually from Fitzgibbon's oilfield services companies. Hassen said he sold his equity in these companies and is being paid in installments through June 2026.

Hassen reported that he holds $50,001 to $100,000 worth of stock in Fitzgibbon's company Block Harvest, a cryptocurrency mining business that uses flared natural gas to run data centers. He reported owning $250,000 to $500,000 worth of stock in Fitzgibbon's Global Guardian, a security company.

Hassen also declared 254 stock holdings, including cryptocurrency, tobacco, foreign banking and between $1,001 and $15,000 worth of stock each in Archrock, a Houston company that specializes in natural gas compression services; WEC Energy Group, which holds electric and natural gas companies and Quanta Services, which is involved in pipelines and pumping.

He's got a similar stake in Albemarle Corp., which owns the Silver Peak lithium mine in Nevada — the nation's only active lithium source. It's currently seeking authorization from Interior's Bureau of Land Management to expand its operations.

Hassen's potential conflicts of interest have raised concerns among environmental groups and some U.S. lawmakers.

He's attempting to remove regulations constraining the fossil fuel industries, said Josh Axelrod, a senior policy advocate with the Natural Resources Defense Council. “As a member of those industries, he's uniquely qualified to flag the ones they don't like.”

Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine, the ranking Democrats on Interior's Senate and House oversight subcommittees, have demanded a stop to Hassen's large-scale reorganization.

Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico told Burgum in a May 7 letter that “delegating sweeping authorities and responsibilities to a non-Senate confirmed person in violation of the Vacancies Reform Act is baffling and extremely troubling.”

Fox News Digital spoke to Alabama State Auditor Andrew Sorrell about his personal experience being debanked and what states can do to stop it in the future

EXCLUSIVE: Protecting Americans from being "debanked" has been a top priority for the State Financial Officers Foundation, and Fox News Digital spoke to a member of that organization, who said he was targeted himself, about the importance of that pursuit. 

"When I was initially debanked, I didn't realize I was getting debanked," Alabama Republican State Auditor Andrew Sorrell told Fox News Digital at the State Financial Officers Foundation conference in Orlando, Florida.

"What happened was I just get a letter one day from our credit card company, from my gun store, Gold Guns and Guitars, and we get this curious letter in the mail, and it says that in 30 days, we're closing your account. And it didn't tell us why at all."

Sorrell, 39, explained that at first he thought that his company had simply forgotten to pay their bills, but when he realized he was up-to-date, he switched credit card companies and did not think anything of it until he got another letter from his credit card processor notifying him he was being dropped.

"So we're doing about 2 million dollars in revenue, about a million and a half of that is done by credit card or debit card transactions, and I was really confused this time, because why would a credit card processor drop us?" Sorrell explained. 

After that, Sorrell was told by his insurance company he was being dropped with "no explanation." 

"I called my insurance broker, and he said, ‘Oh yeah, this is happening to all gun stores,'" Sorrell said. "He said insurance companies are dropping all gun stores. And then it hit me. Oh my goodness, I'm a victim of political debanking. I didn't even realize that that's what was happening to me."

Debanking is the phenomenon in which a bank customer has their accounts canceled, often with no explanation. Conservatives have long alleged that banks were unfairly targeting them in the practice, with banks specifically going after companies with conservative messaging or principles, including gun stores.

In an interview with "Sunday Morning Futures" anchor Maria Bartiromo, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., said he had seen "numerous" examples of conservatives being debanked during the Biden administration. 

"Especially people that were involved in different energy-type businesses and things like that, as well as very well-spoken and outspoken conservative activists," Comer said in the interview. "So there are numerous instances, enough to open an investigation again. Is this [environmental, social and governance (ESG)] policy, which is discriminatory?"

Sorrell told Fox News Digital he is "convinced this is happening to other people in Alabama," and that the problem doesn't stem from local community banks but from large national banks who were "pushed" by the Obama and Biden administrations. 

"I actually have some sympathy for these large banks, and I think passing debanking legislation at the state level might actually help some of these large banks, because they can go back, and they can say, I'm sorry, Alabama has now passed debanking legislation. We're just following the law, we don't wanna debank people anymore," Sorrell said. 

"This is un-American, and it has to be stopped."

Since the Trump administration took office in January, pushing back against political debanking has become a more prevalent conversation in government, including in the form of a bill from GOP Sen. Tim Scott to address regulatory language that has prompted financial institutions to debank those involved in certain industries.

"It's clear that federal regulators have abused reputational risk by carrying out a political agenda against federally legal businesses," Scott said. "This legislation, which eliminates references to reputational risk in regulatory supervision, is the first step once and for all."

Pastor and Project H.O.O.D. founder Corey Brooks calls out locals in Chicago for betraying their 'common sense' and voting for Mayor Brandon Johnson based on 'identity politics' instead of policy.

Chicago was plagued by violence over Memorial Day weekend when 22 people were shot, including two fatally, ABC7 reported.

One fatal shooting reportedly occurred when an argument erupted inside a vehicle on the city's Northwest Side in the Logan Square neighborhood on Saturday afternoon. The 35-year-old victim was attempting to exit the vehicle when he was shot and killed by someone else inside the vehicle. 

The shooter then fled the scene and remains at large.

The second fatal shooting took place in the same area of the city, also on Saturday afternoon, according to the report. A 46-year-old man on the Northwest Side was shot in the head while inside his vehicle near Humboldt Park. The vehicle then crashed into another car and a pole. 

The victim was transported to the hospital and later pronounced dead. The suspect in that shooting also remains at large. 

Two other people were also shot near a Humboldt Park homeless encampment, and one was critically injured. The shooter remains unidentified.

On the city's South Side, two people were sitting inside their home when they were shot. The assailant in that incident also fled the scene and remains at large.

According to the Chicago Tribune, which keeps a running tally of the number of homicides in the city each year, 139 people have been slain in the troubled city so far in 2025, based on data through May 17. The same outlet reported that 573 people were killed in Chicago in 2024. 

Last week, two Venezuelans living illegally in Chicago were arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in connection with a deadly mass shooting.

FAIRMONT, W.Va. (AP) — American gymnastics icon Mary Lou Retton faces a misdemeanor charge of driving under the influence following her arrest in her West Virginia hometown.

Fairmont police stopped Retton on May 17 following a report about a person in a Porsche driving erratically. According to the criminal complaint, Retton smelled of alcohol and was slurring her words, and she failed a field sobriety test. Officers also reported observing a container of wine in the passenger seat.

Retton, 57, refused a roadside breath test and a blood test. She was released from custody after paying a $1,500 personal recognizance bond.

Her attorney listed in court records, Edmund J. Rollo of Morgantown, did not immediately respond to phone and email requests from The Associated Press seeking comment.

Retton was 16 when she became the first American female gymnast to win the all-around at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. She also won two silver and two bronze medals to help bring gymnastics into the mainstream in the United States.

In 2023, Retton's family disclosed she was recuperating from a rare form of pneumonia that landed her in intensive care. Doctors found her oxygen levels dangerously low. Her medical team considered putting her on a ventilator as her conditioned worsened. Retton went on oxygen treatment and, after weeks in the hospital, improved enough to be sent home.

Former Michigan gubernatorial candidate Tudor Dixon sounds off on Democrats' reported $20 million plan to connect with American men, warnings against lenient grading systems in public schools and Gen Zers finding happiness in religion and family.

More than six months after the Democratic Party suffered major setbacks in the 2024 elections, the party is seeking a path to escape the political wilderness.

Part of that effort includes a recent gathering by top party consultants and donors trying to figure out how Democrats can improve outreach to male and working-class voters.

President Donald Trump won back control of the White House while Republicans flipped the Senate and defended their fragile House majority in November, and the GOP made gains among Black and Hispanic voters, as well as younger voters – all traditional members of the Democratic Party's base.

"Everything we've done up to this point has resulted in re-electing Donald Trump," longtime Democratic strategist and communicator Joe Caiazzo told Fox News Digital.

OPINION: WHAT DEMOCRATS NEED TO DO TO WIN AGAIN

"If anyone tells you that we don't have to course correct, they don't know what they're talking about," added Caiazzo, a veteran of Sen. Bernie Sanders 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns.

In the face of Trump's sweeping and controversial moves since his return to the White House in January, an increasingly angered and energized base of Democrats is pushing for party leaders to take a stronger stand in leading the resistance to the president and Republicans.

The anger directed not only at Trump and Republicans, but also at fellow Democrats, appears to be a factor in the party's polling woes, with Democratic Party favorable ratings sinking to historic lows.

WATCH: DEMOCRATS' PARTY CHAIR MAKES CASE IN ‘FOX NEWS SUNDAY' APPEARANCE

Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chair Ken Martin vows the party will compete in all 50 states going forward. 

In an interview earlier this month on "Fox News Sunday," Martin highlighted that the party's focus right now is "squarely on making sure that we stand up for hardworking Americans who are being left behind in this Trump economy."

A 2024 election DNC postmortem is currently underway, with the findings expected to be issued later this year. However, grabbing the spotlight in recent days was a gathering hosted by the Democrat-aligned super PAC Future Forward at a luxury resort along the California coast.

Among the strategy discussions at the gathering was a $20 million effort titled, "Speaking with American Men: A Strategic Plan."

The recommendations of the effort, which is code-named SAM, included having Democrats drop what is described as a "moralizing tone" toward male voters, changing the party's language used toward men and purchasing more ads on video games as part of male outreach.

Some former key staffers on the 2024 campaign of former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris, who replaced Biden as the party's nominee last summer, heavily criticized the effort, which was first reported by the New York Times and later confirmed by Fox News.

"Instead of studying working-class voters and men, why doesn't the Democratic Party donor class go out and meet some? What the hell is this?" James Singer, a spokesman for the 2024 campaign, wrote in a social media post. "As a Democrat, it's embarrassing."

It was a similar message from Ammar Moussa, another veteran Democratic strategist and communicator who worked on the Biden and Harris campaigns.

"This is embarrassing. Truly," Moussa wrote on X.

Democrats have long had a problem attracting male voters in presidential elections. Trump won the male vote by 12 points over Harris in the 2024 presidential election, and according to the Fox News Voter Analysis, that margin ballooned to 15 points among men 45 and older.

Fast-forward to this spring, and the Democrats' ratings stood underwater in the latest Fox News national poll at 41% favorable and 56% unfavorable in a survey conducted April 18-21.

That is an all-time low for the Democrats in Fox News polling, and for the first time in a decade, the party's standing was lower than that of the GOP, which stood at 44% favorable and 54% unfavorable.

The figures were reversed last summer, when Fox News last asked the party favorability question in one of its surveys.

HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLING

The Fox News poll was far from an outlier.

The Democratic Party's favorable ratings were well in negative territory in a Pew Research national survey - 38% favorable, 60% unfavorable - conducted in early April and at 36% favorable, 60% unfavorable in a Wall Street Journal poll in the field a couple of weeks earlier.

Additionally, national polls conducted in February by Quinnipiac University and March by CNN and by NBC News also indicated the favorable ratings for the Democratic Party sinking to all-time lows.

However, there is more.

Confidence in the Democratic Party's congressional leadership also sunk to an all-time low, according to a Gallup poll conducted early last month.

The confidence rating for Democrats' leadership in Congress stood at 25% in the survey, which was nine points below the previous low of 34% recorded in 2023.

The semi-annual Harvard Youth Poll, which was released late last month, indicated that approval ratings for Democrats in Congress among Americans aged 18-29 nosedived.

An ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll conducted in mid-April indicated that more respondents trusted Trump (40%) than Democrats in Congress (32%) to handle the nation's main problems.

Additionally, a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted late last month suggested Republicans hold a significant advantage over Democrats on two top issues: the economy and immigration.

"If Democrats want to be competitive in this country and build lasting majorities in both chambers and be competitive for the White House, we've got to broaden the tent," Caiazzo insisted.

He lamented that Democrats have "become hyper-focused on a certain set of issues that only speak to a certain set of people while letting the most important issues of the day fall by the wayside. Every single day, Democrats should be focused on how we make things better for working people. And the way we deliver that message has got to meet people where they are."

            The Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to hear an appeal from a Massachusetts middle school student who was forced to remove a T-shirt that claimed “there are only two genders.”
    


            Two conservative justices — Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas — dissented from the decision to not hear the case.
    


            So long as the appeals court's decision remains on the books, Alito wrote, “thousands of students will attend school without the full panoply of First Amendment rights. That alone is worth this court's attention.”

            The student, Liam Morrison, wore the shirt to Nichols Middle School in Middleborough, Massachusetts, in 2023 to “share his view that gender and sex are identical.” School administrators asked him to remove it and, when he declined, sent him home for the day. Weeks later, he wore the same shirt but covered the words “only two” with a piece of tape on which he wrote “censored.”
    


            The case arrived at the Supreme Court at a moment when transgender rights have become a political and cultural flashpoint. The high court is already considering other cases dealing with LGBTQ+ rights, including a major challenge to Tennessee's ban on gender-affirming care for minors.
    


            David Cortman, senior counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom, which represented Morrison, called the Supreme Court's decision disappointing.
    


            “Schools can't suppress students' views they disagree with. Here, the school actively promotes its view about gender through posters and ‘Pride' events, and it encourages students to wear clothing with messages on the same topic,” Cortman said. “Our legal system is built on the truth that the government cannot silence any speaker just because it disapproves of what they say.”
    


            Morrison and his family sued the district in federal court, asserting a violation of his First Amendment rights. The district court ruled against him, and the Boston-based 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that decision.
    


            “We should reaffirm the bedrock principle that a school may not engage in viewpoint discrimination when it regulates student speech,” Alito wrote in his dissent. “By limiting the application of our viewpoint-discrimination cases, the decision below robs a great many students of that core First Amendment protection.”

            In a landmark 1969 decision, Tinker v. Des Moines, the Supreme Court affirmed students' First Amendment rights at school, but the court qualified those rights, allowing school administrators to regulate the speech if it “materially disrupts” instruction. The Vietnam-era case permitted a group of students to wear black armbands in protest of the war.
    


            The appeals court in the T-shirt case held that schools can regulate a student's speech under Tinker if it “assertedly demeans characteristics of personal identity” of other students because the message is “reasonably forecasted” to poison the “educational atmosphere.” Morrison argued that decision “sidelined” Tinker and “gave near-total deference to the school's determination of what speech demeans protected characteristics and substantially disrupts its operations.”
    


            In their written response to the Supreme Court, school officials noted they are aware of transgender and gender-nonconforming students “who had experienced serious mental health struggles, including suicidal ideation, related to their treatment by other students based on their gender identities” and that those struggles could impact the students' ability to learn.

NEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street's roller-coaster ride created by President Donald Trump's trade policies is whipping back upward on Tuesday, this time because of a delay for his tariffs on the European Union.

The S&P 500 leaped 2% in its first trading since Trump said Sunday that the United States will delay a 50% tariff on goods coming from the European Union until July 9 from June 1. The European Union's chief trade negotiator later said on Monday that he had “good calls” with Trump officials and the EU was “fully committed” to reaching a trade deal by July 9.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 724 points, or 1.7%, with less than an hour remaining in trading, and the Nasdaq composite was 2.3% higher. They're on track to more than recover their losses from Friday, when Wall Street's roller coaster dropped  after Trump announced the tariffs on France, Germany and the other 25 countries represented by the European Union. 

Such talks give hopes that the United States can reach a deal with one of its largest trading partners that would keep global commerce moving and avoid a possible recession. Trump declared a similar pause on his stiff tariffs for products coming from China earlier this month, which launched an even bigger rally on Wall Street at the time.

“We focus on actions over words,” Jean Boivin and other strategists at BlackRock Investment Institute said, “as economic constraints spur policy rollbacks.” 




Caution still remains on Wall Street, of course, even if the S&P 500 has climbed back within 3.7% of its record after falling roughly 20% below the mark last month. A worry is that all the uncertainty caused by on-again-off-again tariffs could damage the economy by pushing U.S. households and businesses to freeze their spending and investments. Surveys have already shown U.S. consumers are feeling worse about the economy's prospects and where inflation may be heading because of tariffs.

On Tuesday, though, optimism ruled. The stock market's gains accelerated after a report released by the Conference Board said confidence among U.S. consumers improved by more in May than economists expected. 

It was the first increase in six months, and consumers' expectations for income, business and the job market in the short term jumped sharply, though it still remains below the level that typically signals a recession ahead. About half the survey results came after Trump paused some of his tariffs on China. 

The rise in confidence was widespread, covering different age and income groups, according to the Conference Board.

On Wall Street, Nvidia rallied 3.2% and was the strongest single force driving the S&P 500 higher ahead of its profit report coming on Wednesday. It's the last to report this quarter among the “Magnificent Seven” Big Tech companies that have grown so large that their stock movements dominate the rest of the market. 

Nvidia has been riding a tidal wave of growth created by the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology, but it is also facing criticism that its stock price has shot too high. 

Informatica climbed 6.2% after Salesforce said it would buy the AI-powered cloud data management company in an all-stock deal valuing it at about $8 billion. Salesforce rose 1.8%.

They were part of widespread gains across the U.S. stock market, and 95% of the stocks within the S&P 500 were rising. 

One of the outliers was AutoZone, which fell 4.1% following a mixed report on its performance for the three months through May 10. Its profit fell short of analysts' expectations, though its growth in revenue was stronger than expected. 

CEO Phil Daniele said both its DIY and commercial businesses did well domestically, but shifting moves in foreign-currency values put pressure on the retailer's operations outside the United States. The U.S. dollar's value has been swerving against other currencies because of uncertainty around Trump's trade policies. And when the dollar rises, it can mean each peso of sales made in Mexico is worth fewer dollars. 

In the bond market, Treasury yields eased to take some of the pressure off the stock market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.42% from 4.51% late Friday. It had been rising last week, in part because of worries about the U.S. government's rapidly increasing debt. 

Yields have been climbing for bond markets around the developed world, particularly in Japan, where a recent auction of longer-term bonds found relatively few buyers. But analysts said worries eased a bit after Japan's finance ministry sent a questionnaire to bond investors that they took as a signal of efforts to calm the market. 

In stock markets abroad, European indexes mostly rose, while Asian indexes were mixed.

This story has been corrected to show that a rise in the dollar against the Mexican peso, not a decline, results in smaller proceeds in dollars from sales abroad.

 Attorney General Pam Bondi details a DEA operation where 11.5 kilos of fentanyl, including approximately 3 million pills, were seized.

A Los Angeles County woman, who served on a presidential advisory committee under the Biden administration and has an extensive history of donating to Democrats, reached a plea agreement with the Department of Justice (DOJ) for making tens of thousands of dollars in illegal campaign contributions to reportedly secure a seat on the Kennedy Center Board of Trustees, the DOJ announced Wednesday.

Teena Maria Hostovich, 66, was charged Wednesday with making contributions in the name of another aggregating to more than $10,000 in a year, which is a felony, the DOJ reported. 

She revealed in her plea agreement that she carried out the scheme in part to secure a spot on the Kennedy Center's Board of Trustees, the DOJ stated in the press release. The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts serves as the national cultural center of the U.S. and is located in Washington, D.C.

Hostovich is an insurance broker who used the identities of 11 other people, including co-workers and family members of co-workers, to illegally contribute more than $75,000 to political candidates between 2020 and 2023, the DOJ stated in a press release.

"According to her plea agreement, from May 2020 through 2023, Hostovich knowingly and willfully made a total of $75,700 in contributions to federal candidates' principal campaign committees and federal joint fundraising committees in the names of other people," the DOJ said in a press release. "For the calendar years 2021 through 2023, Hostovich's conduit contributions aggregated to more than $10,000 during each of those years." 

Hostovich agreed in a court filing Wednesday to plead guilty to the federal criminal charge and pay a $43,500 fine. 

Her scheme included contacting co-workers, their family members and other people "who performed personal services for Hostovich and her family" to ask them to make a donation to a political campaign or fundraising committee, according to the press release. She would then use PayPal to reimburse the individual for the contribution or pay them up front before the contribution was made, the Justice Department explained.

"To execute these conduit contributions, Hostovich sometimes explicitly stated that she would advance the money for the contribution or pay the person back for that contribution," the press release outlined. "Other times, the person had an implicit understanding that Hostovich would advance the money or reimburse them based on her history of advancements and reimbursements of political contributions. Hostovich generally advanced or reimbursed these individuals in amounts that exceeded the exact contribution amount but often the amounts were very close to the contribution amount."

Fox News Digital reviewed a website promoting a book Hostovich wrote in 2024 on climbing America's corporate ladder, which also touted Hostovich as a member of the Clinton Global Initiative, and that former President Joe Biden appointed her to serve on the President's Advisory Committee on the Arts. 

"She is a member of the Clinton Global Initiative and the White House Historical Association. President Biden recently appointed her to the President's Advisory Committee for the Arts, and she is the Co-Chair of the Advisory Council to the Kennedy Center's President and Chairman," the bio states, which is accompanied by photos of Hostovich with high-profile Democrats such as Hillary Clinton, former President Bill Clinton and Biden.  

Fox News Digital reached out to the Clinton Foundation for comment but did not immediately receive a reply. 

An archived official White House press release from 2023 under the Biden administration detailed Hostovich's position on the President's Advisory Committee on the Arts, including touting her "corporate governance responsibility, political activism, and philanthropic work."

"She has combined her lifelong passion for the arts, history, and education with her corporate governance responsibility, political activism, and philanthropic work," the bio states. "In addition to serving on the Board of the Los Angeles Philharmonic for over a decade, she has been one of the Chairs (along with her husband and son) of Hollywood Bowl Opening Night many times (including 2023) honoring significant artists and showcasing the LA music community while raising money for Music Matters benefitting music/arts programs in public schools." 

It is unclear how donations made in other people's names would bolster her reported efforts to secure a spot on the Kennedy Center Board of Trustees. The president appoints general trustees to the board, while other members are appointed by Congress. 

CALIFORNIA WOMAN AND MAN CHARGED WITH ALLEGEDLY STEALING OVER $2 MILLION IN ILLEGAL COVID RELIEF FUNDS

A representative for Hostovich told Fox News Digital in an emailed statement Tuesday morning that "Teena Hostovich has agreed to plead guilty to one count of making contributions in the name of another, involving five donations of $2,900 each in 2021. In doing so, she is accepting responsibility for her conduct early and swiftly."

The statement continued that Hostovich's "mistakes are out of character," arguing that her "career, accomplishments, and numerous charitable deeds reflect a lifetime of hard work and generosity."

"Her generosity and commitment to her community led to her involvement in donating and fundraising for causes and candidates that she believed would champion fairness, equality, and improve society," the spokesperson continued. "She deeply regrets that her ardent support of some candidates led to lapses in judgment in a fraction of the donations she helped to raise and make. She is even more remorseful for the shadow that this investigation may cast on the candidates to whom the donations were made, as they had no knowledge of any wrongdoing." 

"Throughout this process, Ms. Hostovich has cooperated fully and worked transparently with law enforcement authorities. She is committed to making the appropriate amends."

The DOJ did not identify in its press release which political party Hostovich favored, though Federal Election Commission (FEC) records reviewed by Fox News show Hostovich made hundreds of donations across the years to Democrat politicians, the Democratic Party and left-wing political action committees. 

Hostovich has nearly 1,000 entries on the FEC's database regarding donations she made under her own name stretching back to 2008 through the 2024 election cycle. 

The FEC data shows she donated to campaigns and groups such as the Obama Victory Fund, Democratic Party of Virginia, Pasadena, California, area United Democratic Headquarters and Chris Coons for Delaware during the 2008–2012 period.

More recent data from the 2024 election cycle shows she donated to groups such as the North Carolina Democratic Party – Federal, the Wyoming Democratic State Central Committee, the Pennsylvania Democratic Party and the Democratic State Committee (Delaware). Searching for donations made to groups or campaigns containing the name "Republican" or "GOP" yielded zero results, Fox News Digital found.

The FBI carried out an investigation into Hostovich before she was charged and reached a plea agreement, the DOJ said. The DOJ told Fox Digital on Tuesday that Hostovich is scheduled to appear in court on June 13 in Los Angeles.

            The bucolic, vineyard-dotted Eastern Townships region of southern Quebec has a message for Americans: come hug it out.
    


            The region's tourist board released a promotional video on May 26 portraying an English-speaking tourist who bashfully admits to being American — then gets a big hug from a French-speaking hotel receptionist.
    


            It's part of a CA$150,000 (US$109,000) ad campaign timed for the start of the summer travel season and aimed at US vacationers. Isabelle Charlebois, general director of Tourism Eastern Townships, said the video is meant to reassure American visitors that “they are not only expected this summer, but truly welcome.”
    


            If travelers need that encouragement, perhaps it's because amid a trade war and rising tensions some are wondering if it's the right time to visit Canada.
    


            “When our administration starts talking about making Canada the 51st state, I could understand if Canadian border patrol might be giving extra scrutiny to Americans,” said Brian Kirchhoff of Middlebury, Vermont.
    


            While he still plans to visit Montreal for next month's Canadian Grand Prix, Kirchhoff worries escalating rhetoric from the White House will have repercussions for Americans traveling abroad. “I just don't know what attitudes are going to be as the situation continues to unfold,” he said.
    


            Melissa Curtin McDavitt, a Fora Travel adviser in Los Angeles, California, was taken aback when clients cited concerns about politics and cancelled a planned girls getaway to Quebec City, a provincial capital that's among the safest cities in Canada.
    


            “I was shocked,” she said. “Like, ‘are you sure?'”
    


            Other US travelers have been taking to social media forums to ask Canadians to weigh in directly. “We don't want to stir up trouble,” wrote one American on Reddit. “Is it appropriate for us to visit?”
    


            Andrew Siegwart, president and CEO of the Tourism Industry Association of Ontario (TIAO), said Canadians working at hotels, resorts and other travel destinations are hearing similar concerns from Americans wondering if they should call off their plans.
    


            “Our members and operators across the province are fielding these types of questions,” Siegwart said. “Is it going to be seamless to cross the border? Are we really going to be welcome?”
    


            Such hesitations could have a big economic impact in Canada, where Americans made up nearly 79% of international visits in the third quarter of last year. US travelers spent $6.6 billion in the same period, according to Canada's national statistics office.
    


            “The US market is a really strong part of the economy,” Siegwart said, noting that as the peak travel season nears, he's concerned by slowing cross-border travel. US resident trips to Canada sagged in both February and March, the first year-over-year monthly decreases since 2021.
    


            About a third of TIAO members have reported lower summer-season bookings from American travelers when compared with the same period in 2024, Siegwart said.
    


            “We're concerned about the impacts of the trade dispute on travel plans by our US neighbors,” he said.
    


            Like their counterparts in the Eastern Townships, members of the Ontario tourism industry are inviting Americans to visit — and telling them that they'll meet with a warm reception.
    


            “We really are ‘arms open' to the world and our US visitors,” Siegwart said, using a tagline that riffs on the “elbows up” slogan that's a rallying cry for Canadian resistance to Trump's tariffs. “I've heard of a number of destinations in Ontario planning to really roll out the welcome mat.”
    


            In western Canada, a group of tour operators specializing in grizzly bear viewing is launching a “Hey, Neighbor!” campaign this month, featuring small business owners speaking directly to Americans.
    


            “We've been hearing your questions up here in British Columbia. You're wondering if you're still welcome,” the video begins. “Come on up. You're always welcome.”
    


            Other destinations in Canada are beckoning US travelers with reminders that their budgets go further north of the border. On April 28, Tourisme Montreal launched a “stretch your dollar” campaign with a real-time ticker tracking the exchange rate between US and Canadian currencies, which is currently very favorable to Americans.
    


            “In Montreal, we're privileged to have ties with the United States that are historical, cultural and geographical. This is just a way to encourage that to continue,” said Tourisme Montreal spokesperson Aurélie de Blois. “Montrealers are known for being warm, welcoming and open-spirited, which is not going to change.”

‘Am I now a walking target?': The Canadians boycotting travel to the United States because of Trump



            A skeptic might point out that tourism representatives have a vested interest in convincing Americans that Canadians still want them around. Ad campaigns don't always mirror popular sentiment — and it's clear that events on the national level have sparked widespread anger in Canada.
    


            Nearly two-thirds of Canadians now see the United States as an “unfriendly” or “enemy” country, according to a YouGov poll last month; the same poll found that 61% are boycotting American companies. This winter, Canadian fans at NHL and NBA games took to booing the US national anthem.
    


            But surging Canadian pride really isn't hostile to Americans themselves, said Jessica Langer Kapalka, who co-owns Toronto's Canada-themed Grizzly Bar. (Tagline: Canada's most Canadian bar and grill.)
    


            “We welcome Americans as long as they are respectful of our sovereignty and our culture. We aren't anti-American, we're pro-Canadian,” Kapalka said.
    


            At Grizzly Bar, visitors of all nationalities can enjoy Molson lager and elk-topped poutine in a space decked with portraits of Canadian greats from Celine Dion to David Suzuki.
    


            Plenty of everyday Canadians say they have no intention of taking out political frustrations on visitors — and some are going the extra mile to be neighborly.
    


            In February, Canadian TikToker Tod Maffin posted an open invitation for Americans supportive of Canada to visit his Vancouver Island hometown of Nanaimo. On April 26, some 500 people took him up on it, gathering for group photos with the mayor in Maffeo Sutton Park and nibbling the town's namesake dessert: Nanaimo bars.
    


            “It filled my heart,” Maffin said. “When it comes to rank-and-file Americans, nothing has changed with the relationship and love and kinship that Canadians feel with the people across the border.”
    


            Responses to Americans' anxious social media queries have been largely friendly, too. Echoing a recurrent theme, one poster suggested that Americans come, but be sensitive: “Lay off the 51st state ‘jokes' and you are welcome with open arms. Have fun, enjoy this beautiful country.”
    


            In response to the American who asked, on Reddit, if it's “appropriate” to visit, Blake Smith of Kitchener, Ontario, replied that even Canadians frustrated with US politics don't have a problem with Americans as people. On a recent phone call, he underscored that perspective.
    


            “I think your average person in Canada likes to judge individuals by themselves, on their own merit … not as a deep red MAGA Republican or a blue Democrat,” he said, then weighed in with an invitation of his own.
    


            He said he hopes Americans who do decide to vacation in Canada can treat it as a break from current events. In Canada, he noted, it's still considered a bit impolite to talk too much about politics.
    


            “Leave your troubles at home. Turn off the part of your brain that's doom scrolling,” he said. “Most people here just want to get along.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected the appeal of a Massachusetts student who was barred from wearing a T-shirt to school proclaiming there are only two genders.

The justices left in place a federal appeals court ruling that said it would not second-guess the decision of educators in Middleborough, Massachusetts, to not allow the T-shirt to be worn in a school environment because of a negative impact on transgender and gender-nonconforming students.

Educators at the John T. Nichols Middle School barred the student from wearing the T-shirt and an altered version with the words “two genders” covered up by tape with the word “censored” written on it.

Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas dissented.

The court should have heard the case, Alito wrote, noting that “the school permitted and indeed encouraged student expression endorsing the view that there are many genders,” but censored an opposing view.

“This case presents an issue of great importance for our Nation's youth: whether public schools may suppress student speech either because it expresses a viewpoint that the school disfavors or because of vague concerns about the likely effect of the speech on the school atmosphere or on students who find the speech offensive,” Alito wrote.

The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said it was reasonable to predict that the T-shirt will “poison the educational atmosphere” and disrupt the learning environment.




The school district's decision was in line with a landmark Supreme Court ruling from 1969, Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, that upheld the right of public school students to wear black armbands to protest the Vietnam War when it did not create a substantial disruption to education.

Seventh-grader Liam Morrison and his attorney Tyson Langhofer joined 'Fox & Friends' to discuss why his family took legal action and how they believe the school violated his First Amendment rights. 

The Supreme Court declined to hear a case involving a Massachusetts student who was banned from school for wearing a shirt criticizing the transgender movement on Tuesday.

The student, Liam Morrison, brought the case through his father and stepmother, Christopher and Susan Morrison. The plaintiffs argue Nichols Middle School violated his free speech rights when it banned him from wearing two T-shirts to school with the words "There are only two genders" and "There are [censored] genders" on the front.

Liam was sent home both times after he refused to change shirts. The school argued the shirts made his classmates feel unsafe, and a federal court agreed, saying the message was demeaning for transgender students.

Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito both issued separate dissents, arguing the court should have taken up the case.

The decision comes nearly a year after the First Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against Liam and his parents in June 2024, finding that the school was justified in asking him to remove the shirt and sending him home when he refused.

Morrison, who was in seventh grade at the time, was sent home with his father in May 2023 after he refused to take off the shirt, according to court documents. He later wore the same shirt with the words "only two" covered with a piece of tape on which "censored" was written. The school also told him to take this shirt off.

In a 2023 interview with Fox News Digital, Liam stressed that his T-shirt was not directed toward anyone, specifically people who are "lesbian or gay or transgender or anything like that."

"I'm just voicing my opinion about a statement that I believe to be true," he said at the time. "And I feel like some people may think that I'm imposing hate speech, even though it's not directed towards anyone."

The Morrison family was represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom and the Massachusetts Family Institute.

National Public Radio filed suit against the Trump administration on Tuesday for its move to withhold funds approved by Congress.

NPR filed the suit along with three Colorado public radio stations in response to President Donald Trump's executive order to end funding for NPR and PBS, the Public Broadcasting Service. The lawsuit states the Trump administration has gone around congressional duties to direct how federal money is spent.

“It is not always obvious when the government has acted with a retaliatory purpose in violation of the First Amendment. ‘But this wolf comes as a wolf,'” the lawsuit said. “The Order targets NPR and PBS expressly because, in the President's view, their news and other content is not ‘fair, accurate, or unbiased.'”

The lawsuit states the order “also threatens the existence of a public radio system that millions of Americans across the country rely on for vital news and information” and that it “expressly aims to punish and control Plaintiffs' news coverage and other speech the Administration deems ‘biased.'” 

Attorneys for the news outlets wrote that the order “cannot stand.”

The lawsuit names Trump, Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and Maria Rosario Jackson, the chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Arts, as defendants. Trump and his allies have called the public broadcasters “left-wing propaganda.”

“The Executive Order is a clear violation of the Constitution and the First Amendment's protections for freedom of speech and association, and freedom of the press,” NPR President and CEO Katherine Maher said in a statement.

Every two years, Congress allocates funds for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The CPB is also suing Trump over an earlier move, in which he attempted to fire three of the five members of CPB's board of directors.

Earlier this year, the Republican-led Congress passed a stopgap budget measure to fund CPB through the end of September 2027.

FEC DISMISSES COMPLAINT AGAINST NPR ACCUSING IT OF ADVOCATING FOR HARRIS

In response to Trump's order, in which he said he was withholding CPB funding to NPR and PBS, the corporation's chief executive said the president did not have the authority to carry out such a move.

“CPB is not a federal executive agency subject to the President's authority,” CPB chief Patricia Harrison, a former Republican National Committee co-chairwoman, said in a statement. “Congress directly authorized and funded CPB to be a private nonprofit corporation wholly independent of the federal government.”

Fox News correspondent David Spunt and ‘Sunday Night in America with Trey Gowdy' host Trey Gowdy discuss further investigations into three unsolved DC cases on ‘America's Newsroom.' 

The FBI is taking another look at the cocaine found inside the Biden administration White House in 2023, according to Deputy Director Dan Bongino. 

"Shortly after swearing in, the Director and I evaluated a number of cases of potential public corruption that, understandably, have garnered public interest. We made the decision to either re-open, or push additional resources and investigative attention, to these cases," Bongino said in a post on X. 

"These cases are the DC pipe bombing investigation, the cocaine discovery at the prior administration's White House, and the leak of the Supreme Court Dobbs case. I receive requested briefings on these cases weekly and we are making progress. If you have any investigative tips on these matters that may assist us, then please contact the FBI," he added. 

The FBI did not immediately respond Tuesday to a request for further comment from Fox News Digital.

Earlier this year, President Donald Trump said in an interview he believes former President Joe Biden or his son, Hunter Biden, left behind the infamous bag of cocaine at the White House. 

"So … who actually left the cocaine in the White House?" The Spectator's Ben Domenech asked Trump. 

"Well, either Joe or Hunter," Trump responded. "Could be Joe, too."  

The bag of cocaine was discovered on July 2, 2023, in a storage locker near the entrance to the White House's West Wing.

The Secret Service discovered the cocaine and launched an investigation, which turned up inconclusive for a suspect. 

"On July 12, the Secret Service received the FBI's laboratory results, which did not develop latent fingerprints and insufficient DNA was present for investigative comparisons," it said in 2023. "Therefore, the Secret Service is not able to compare evidence against the known pool of individuals. The FBl's evaluation of the substance also confirmed that it was cocaine."

"That was such a terrible thing because, you know, those bins are very loaded up with … they're not clean, and they have hundreds and even thousands of fingerprints," Trump also said in the interview. "And when they went to look at it, it was absolutely stone cold, wiped dry. You know that, right?" 

The Biden family, including the former president and Hunter, were not staying at the White House when the cocaine was discovered. Instead, the family was staying at presidential retreat Camp David in Maryland.

Hunter Biden has a long and well-documented history with substance abuse, and he detailed his hourly need for crack cocaine in his 2021 memoir, "Beautiful Things." He has since gone through recovery efforts and has been sober since 2019, according to sworn testimony in federal court in 2023.

Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought addresses Democrats' criticism that DOGE is a big scam and lays out his goals for the department's cuts on "The Story."

FIRST ON FOX: The Department of Labor announced on Tuesday that it has terminated $400 million dollars in spending it has deemed wasteful through its Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) efforts by rolling back diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI)-related grants from the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA). 

The department said DOGE had terminated all of its Unemployment Insurance (UI) ARPA grants, totaling around $400 million in savings, which it said addresses an unemployment system that has been in an "infrastructure crisis riddled with fraud, waste, and abuse."

Some of the cuts from the $2 trillion piece of legislation signed into law by then-President Joe Biden in 2021, included creating an "Office of the Unemployed Workers' Advocate" and funding an "Equitable Access Director."

Other cuts included initiatives to "conduct a business process analysis for equity," developing an "equity analytics dashboard," studying the "equity of the unemployment system," conducting a "DEIA assessment" and funding "equity monitor staff."

"America's unemployment benefits system is facing an infrastructure crisis, riddled with waste, fraud, and abuse," Labor Department spokesperson Courtney Parella told Fox News Digital. "The Biden administration was given a historic opportunity by Congress to fix it but instead squandered it on bureaucratic and wasteful projects that focused on equitable access rather than advancing access for all Americans in need."

Parella added that the department will continue working with state workforce agencies nationwide to focus on ways to improve the UI system to better "meet the needs of the American worker" and cut down on fraud, which has been prevalent in recent years, according to several news reports. 

Earlier this year, DOGE announced that it had discovered tens of thousands of unemployment claims for improbably old and young claimants that were approved in the years after 2020.

"This is another incredible discovery by the DOGE team, finding nearly $400 million in fraudulent unemployment payments," Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer told FOX Business in April. "The Labor Department is committed to recovering Americans' stolen tax dollars. We will catch these thieves and keep working to root out egregious fraud – accountability is here."

The Labor Department announcement on Tuesday comes after Fox News Digital first reported in April that the department revealed $1.4 billion of unspent COVID funding would be "returned to taxpayers through the U.S. Department of Treasury's General Fund," and added that "action" was "being taken to recover the remaining $2.9 billion."

According to the department leaderboard on the DOGE website, last updated on May 11, the Department of Labor ranks in the top 5 of departments that have made DOGE-related cuts, and DOGE overall says it has saved each American taxpayer $1,055.90.

LONDON (AP) — Liverpool is no stranger to triumph on the sports field, or tragedy off it.

The northwest English port city experienced both joy and anguish on Monday: As fans lined the streets to celebrate Liverpool Football Club winning the Premier League title this season, a minivan crashed into the crowd. Police said more than 60 people were hurt, with 11 still hospitalized Tuesday. Police arrested the 53-year-old driver on suspicion of attempted murder but said they are not treating it as an act of terrorism.

Euphoria – at least for those who support Liverpool FC over its local rival Everton – turned in an instant to chaos and grief. Within hours, came pledges of resilience and unity for a city that has weathered so much before — including deadly disasters at two stadiums hosting Liverpool games in the 1980s.

“It's supposed to be celebrations and instead the day is always going to be remembered for this now, instead of the trophy parade like it was supposed to,” said Aaron Jones, a 28-year-old fan who was nearby and saw the emergency response.

“Because of disasters we've had in the past, everyone's just connecting it to the same sort of group of disasters, you know what I mean? It should have been happy times, but (it's) been tainted.”




Liverpool was one of the world's busiest ports in the 18th and 19th centuries, but endured decades of hardship in the 20th. It weathered World War II bombing, the decline of its once-bustling docks and mass unemployment in the 1980s.

Those tough years reinforced the city's underdog self-image, as a northern, heavily Irish-influenced city far from British centers of power in London.

Renewal for the city that gave birth to The Beatles has come in recent decades through reinventing Liverpool as a magnet for tourists seeking culture, nightlife — and soccer.

Both the city's Premier League teams have legions of fans around the world. Liverpool FC, in particular, is one of the most decorated teams in global soccer, with dozens of British and international trophies to its name.

But the success has come alongside tragedy for a club whose anthem is “You'll Never Walk Alone.”

On Tuesday, Liverpool FC's homepage offered thoughts to those affected by the crash and referenced the disasters at Heysel and Hillsborough stadiums that had a profound impact on the club and its identity.

On May 29, 1985, Liverpool played Italian team Juventus in the European Cup final at Heysel Stadium in Brussels.

Crowd disorder before kickoff culminated in a surge by Liverpool fans into an adjacent stand containing mostly Juventus supporters. In the ensuing chaos, some were trampled or suffocated to death as they tried to flee the violence and others died when a retaining wall collapsed.

A total of 39 people — 32 from Italy, four from Belgium, two from France and one from Northern Ireland — died and around 600 were injured.

Liverpool fans were largely blamed for the violence. Twenty-six were arrested, and 14 of them convicted of involuntary manslaughter.

Many also attributed the disorder to the dilapidated condition of Heysel, a 55,000-capacity structure with outdated standing-room only stands, flimsy fences and crumbling walls inside and outside, as well as poor organization from police and UEFA, European soccer's governing body.

The 40th anniversary of the disaster is on Thursday.

Four years later, a crush during a game against Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield ultimately left 97 Liverpool fans dead.

The catastrophe unfolded when more than 2,000 Liverpool fans were allowed to flood into a standing-room section behind a goal with the stadium already nearly full for the game. The victims were crushed against metal anti-riot fences or trampled underfoot, and many suffocated.

The tragedy of Britain's deadliest sports disaster was compounded by a coverup into the cause and missteps by police. 

With hooliganism rife in English soccer throughout the 1980s and memories of Heysel still fresh, a false narrative that blamed drunken, ticketless and rowdy Liverpool fans was created by police and spread by sections of the media.

Bereaved families campaigned for years to correct the record, finally securing an inquest jury's 2016 verdict that police and emergency services were to blame for the disaster and the victims were “unlawfully killed.”

The city has a long memory. To this day many Liverpudlians refuse to read tabloid newspaper The Sun, which ran stories alleging that fans had attacked police and robbed the dead.

Many Liverpudlians — whether Liverpool or Everton fans — pledged that the city would come together after the latest tragedy.

Everton FC issued a statement of condolence, setting aside rivalry to say: “As a city we stand together.”

Steve Rotheram, mayor of the Liverpool City Region, said he'd heard multiple accounts of people opening their doors so distraught strangers could take shelter in their homes amid Monday's chaos.

“There were offers of lifts in cars so that people could get to their destinations,” he said. “This is the true humanity of the great people of this city.”

Fox News Digital reached out to Retton's reps for comment.

Retton, 57, was diagnosed with a "rare form of pneumonia" in 2023, with her family raising the alarm that she was "fighting for her life." She was placed in the intensive care unit for a period of time as doctors helped her fight the illness.

"This is serious, and this is life, and I'm so grateful to be here," she said on NBC's "Today" in 2024. "I am blessed to be here because there was a time when they were about to put me on life support."

Retton was nicknamed "America's sweetheart" during her gold medal-winning performance at the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles. She was just 16 when she scored perfect 10s in the floor exercise and vault in the final two rotations to become the first American woman to win the Olympic all-around title.

She earned five medals that year – one gold, two silver and two bronze.

After she retired from gymnastics, Retton became a motivational speaker and frequently shared messages about the benefits of proper nutrition and exercise.

China may have met an important climate goal — ahead of schedule.

by  Umair Irfan

China is the world's largest single greenhouse gas emitter, spewing more than double the amount of heat-trapping chemicals as the next biggest climate polluter, the United States.

For decades, China's emissions soared ever higher as its economy grew, burning extraordinary volumes of coal, oil, and natural gas to light up cities, power factories, and fuel cars. The trend seemed unstoppable: At one point, China was approving two new coal power plants per week.

It was an alarming prospect for the whole world. “Eighty-five percent of emissions for the remainder of the century are projected to occur outside the EU and the US,” said Michael Greenstone, an economist at the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago. “If we're going to make real progress on climate change, that will require reductions from that 85 percent.” And since China is the single-largest emitter, there's no feasible way to meet international climate change targets without them on board. 

But now, for the first time, there's been a shift: China's greenhouse gas emissions have actually fallen even as energy demand went up. 

According to a new report at Carbon Brief by Lauri Myllyvirta, an analyst at Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air, China's overall greenhouse gas emissions have dropped for the first time, thanks largely to the country's aggressive build-out of clean energy. Looking at official statistics and commercial data, the analysis shows greenhouse gas output fell 1 percent over the past year, even as China's overall energy use and economic activity increased. 

It's not a massive shift, but the fact that the curve has bent at all is a major development for the global effort against climate change. 

The growth rate of humanity's greenhouse gas emissions has begun to level off, but it has yet to decline. In order to eventually halt human-caused warming, that rate has to effectively reach zero, and in order to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement, that has to happen roughly within the next three decades. 

The decline of emissions in China is a big step toward this international goal, and the timing puts it on course for its own climate targets, too. China had previously committed to peaking its greenhouse gas emissions before 2030. 

“This is a little ahead of schedule,” Greenstone said. “The planet is happy about that.”

In large part, the decline in emissions came from clean electricity production. China deployed vastly more wind, solar, and nuclear power — sources that don't emit carbon dioxide — at a pace faster than its electricity demand growth. Meanwhile, its coal and gas electricity production dropped. China's emissions have dipped before due to economic slowdowns, so the fact that its economy grew while emissions declined is a significant turning point, putting China in a league with more than 30 countries, including the US, that have already done the same. 

China has established itself as the world's largest producer of solar panels, wind turbines, electric vehicles, and batteries, driving down prices for the global market. It's deploying these technologies within its own borders, as well as exporting them en masse, and some of its biggest customers are developing countries. That means China's investments in clean energy redound to the rest of the world. Renewables accounted for 90 percent of new power capacity installed worldwide last year. 

Later this year, countries will gather in Brazil for the COP30 climate conference, where world leaders will hash out how to bring new, stronger commitments to cut their contributions to climate change by 2035. China's President Xi Jinping pledged that his country will come to the table with a comprehensive plan to further reduce its emissions across its economy, while the US may not show up at all. One his first day of his second term, President Donald Trump began the process of pulling the country out of the Paris climate agreement altogether. Again. 

However, in the Carbon Brief report, Myllyvirta noted that China's small drop in emissions could easily go back up. If its economy grows even faster, demand for fossil fuels could rise again. Whether that happens depends, in part, on how the dust settles on the tariff fight between the US and China. High trade barriers would slow China's economy. Losing the US as a customer could push China to try to compensate by installing more clean energy domestically. 

China also emits greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide. In particular, China is releasing high levels of HFC-23, a byproduct of making nonstick coatings and a pollutant that is thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide when it comes to trapping heat in the atmosphere. China committed to halting HFC-23 pollution entirely when it signed the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol in 2021. 

To make China's emissions reductions durable, there needs to be more stringent policies and enforcement to curb climate pollution within the country. Otherwise, current clean energy technologies would need to get cheaper, and new ones would have to be invented. “Given the tepid appetite for aggressive carbon policy around the world, I think the most important thing the world could do is invest in early stage R&D on new energy technologies,” Greenstone said. 

Meanwhile, US emissions are also seeing a slight downward trend. But the Trump administration's push to extract more fossil fuels, cut incentives for clean energy, and roll back efforts to curb greenhouse gases mean that the US could become a larger climate polluter. That could offset some of the progress in China and slow the overall global endeavor to limit climate change.

            Dozens of people, including four children, were injured when a driver plowed a car into a parade in northwest England celebrating Liverpool Football Club's latest Premier League win on Monday evening.
    


            A 53-year-old white British man from the Liverpool area, believed to be the driver, was arrested at the scene, according to Merseyside Police. Describing the collision as an “isolated incident,” police said they were not looking for any other suspects and were not treating the incident as terrorism.
    


            Police will reveal the findings of an investigation into the collision so that “all the facts are known,” according to Liverpool's mayor, Steve Rotheram.
    


            “It's not for people on social media to be speculating what happened,” the mayor told CNN on Tuesday, describing the “terrible event” late Monday. “The police are the only people who have all of that information to hand – and they are the people we should trust.”
    


            Footage from Reuters news agency on Tuesday morning shows the scene littered with debris and closed off with police tape. A police van is parked across the street, blocking the road.
    


            Hundreds of thousands of jubilant soccer fans had lined the streets in the heart of Liverpool on Monday, waving flags and flares of red smoke, to watch an open-top bus victory parade to celebrate the iconic club's 20th top-flight league title.
    


            As the parade was winding down, those scenes of joy turned to chaos. Video from social media appears to show a gray minivan plowing into red-clad supporters. The angry crowd can then be seen surrounding and rocking the stopped vehicle.
    


            A total of 27 people were taken to hospital, the head of service at North West Ambulance Service NHS Trust David Kitchin told a news conference. Four of those were “very ill in hospital,” according to Rotheram.
    


            Four people – three adults and one child – had to be removed because they were trapped underneath the vehicle, according to Chief Fire Officer of Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service Nick Searle. A further 20 people were treated at the scene for minor injuries, he added.
    


            “This gray people carrier just pulled up from the right and just rammed into all the people at the side of us … It was extremely fast. Initially, we just heard the pop, pop, pop of people just being knocked off the bonnet of a car,” one fan, Harry Rashid, told the UK's PA Media news agency.
    


            Rashid, who attended the parade with his wife and two young daughters, said crowds of people ran over and started to smash the car's windows. “It was horrible. And you could hear the bumps as he was going over the people … I saw people lying on the ground, people unconscious. It was horrendous. So horrendous,” he said.
    


            Video posted on social media appears to show a confrontation between the driver and the crowd at one point during the incident. The car is seen stopped and some in the crowd can be seen kicking and punching the car, which then quickly reverses before driving off.
    


            Onlooker Matthew O'Carroll told Britain's PA news agency that he saw the car approaching the top of Water Street. He said the vehicle drove past a parked police van at a “decent” speed and that the driver was beeping as he went through the crowd.
    


            Footage shared by Reuters news agency showed emergency services tending to people, some being carried into ambulances on stretchers. Photos from the scene also showed authorities cordoning off the heavily littered roads. Police set up a tent where the crash occurred.
    


            “We heard a frantic beeping ahead, a car flew past me and my mate, people were chasing it and trying to stop him, windows smashed at the back,” Peter Jones, who had traveled to Liverpool to attend the parade, told the Associated Press. “He then drove into people, police and medics ran past us, and people were being treated on the side of the road.”
    


            The local police force said they were contacted just after 6 p.m. local time (1 p.m. ET) “following reports a car had been in collision with a number of pedestrians” in the city center.
    


            Merseyside Police said it had been working with the organizers of the parade and a “robust traffic management” plan was put in place before the incident unfolded.
    


            “Extensive enquiries are ongoing to establish the circumstances leading up to the collision and it is vital that people do not speculate or spread misinformation on social media,” Merseyside Police's Assistant Chief Constable Jenny Sims said in a statement.
    


            The parade on Monday – which coincided with a separate May public holiday in the UK – involved players from the Liverpool squad being driven around the city center in an open-top bus and gleeful fans had joined the festivities along the 10-mile (16 kilometers) route.
    


            Figures from across the sporting world paid tribute to those who were injured by the attack, which survivors say left the city reeling after the celebrations.
    


            Former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, who attended the parade, said he was “shocked and devastated.” “Our thoughts and prayers are with all those who are injured and affected,” he posted on Instagram. “You'll never walk alone,” he added, in reference to the club's anthem. A titan of world soccer, the German notably led Liverpool to its first league title in 30 years, in 2020.
    


            Longtime opponents Manchester United and, Everton Football Club, the local rival team to Liverpool FC, offered their condolences online – as did the Premier League.
    


            UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the whole country “stands with Liverpool” on Tuesday. “My thoughts and the thoughts of the whole country are with all of those that are affected, those injured, which of course includes children, their families, their friends… Liverpool fans everywhere,” the prime minister added, thanking emergency services “who did a fantastic job and continue to do so.”

            Hong Kong's first locally born giant pandas have finally been named and introduced as Jia Jia and De De.
    


            The names of the cubs, affectionately known as “Elder Sister” and “Little Brother,” were announced Tuesday in a ceremony at Ocean Park, the theme park housing them, their parents and two other giant pandas that arrived from mainland China last year.
    


            The names were the winning suggestions from residents in a naming contest that drew more than 35,700 entries.
    


            The Chinese character “Jia,” from the female cub's name “Jia Jia,” carries a message of support and features an element of family and a sense of auspicious grace. The name embodies the prosperity of families and the nation and the happiness of the people, the park said.
    


            The Chinese character “De,” from the male cub's name, means to succeed, carrying the connotation that Hong Kong is successful in everything. De also has the same pronunciation as the Chinese character for virtue, the park said, suggesting giant pandas possess virtues cherished by Chinese people.
    


            Ocean Park chairman Paulo Pong said they followed tradition by using Mandarin pronunciation for the pandas' English names. He said “Jia” sounds like a word in the Cantonese term for elder sister, while “De De” sounds a bit like the Cantonese phrase for little brother. Cantonese is the mother language of many Hong Kongers.
    


            “It's a very positive pair of names,” he said. “We have to be a bit creative here with the names.”

China is more in love with its pandas than ever. That's complicated matters for Beijing



            The twins' birth in August made their mother, Ying Ying, the world's oldest first-time panda mom. Their popularity among residents, visitors and on social media raised hopes for a tourism boost in the city, where politicians touted the commercial opportunities as the “panda economy.”
    


            Observers are watching whether housing six pandas helps the park revive its business, especially when caring for the animals in captivity is expensive. Ocean Park recorded a deficit of 71.6 million Hong Kong dollars ($9.2 million) last financial year.
    


            The park recorded a nearly 40% growth in visitor flow and 40% increase in overall income during a five-day holiday beginning May 1 in mainland China, said Pong, who hopes the growth momentum will continue through summer, Halloween and Christmas seasons.
    


            Pandas are considered China's unofficial national mascot. The country's giant panda loan program with overseas zoos has long been seen as a tool of Beijing's soft-power diplomacy.

The left-wing advocacy organization Southern Poverty Law Center listed the conservative Republican activist group Turning Point USA in its “2024 Year in Hate and Extremism Report.”

Under the subsection “Dismantling White Supremacy,” the SPLC included a report titled “Turning Point USA: A case study of the hard right in 2024.” 

Describing Turning Point Action as a “well-funded, hard-right organization with links to Southern Poverty Law Center-identified hard-right extremists and a tremendous amount of influence in conservative politics,” the SPLC provided multiple examples to justify its classification of Turning Point Action in its report. The organization was particularly critical of Turning Point Founder Charlie Kirk. 

“Kirk accused Democrats of embracing immigration as part of their plot to secure voters, permit crime and enact the ‘great replacement,'” read the report. “He warned his hundreds of thousands of listeners, ‘We native born Americans are being replaced by foreigners.' He then promised Trump will ‘liberate' the country from ‘the enemy occupation of the foreigner hordes.'”

Kirk blasted the SPLC's report in a post on X. 

The SPLC has added Turning Point to their ridiculous “hate group” list, right next to the KKK and neo-Nazis, a cheap smear from a washed-up org that's been fleecing scared grandmas for decades. They somehow still rake in over $100 million a year peddling their “hate map”…

“The SPLC has added Turning Point to their ridiculous ‘hate group' list, right next to the KKK and neo-Nazis, a cheap smear from a washed-up org that's been fleecing scared grandmas for decades,” Kirk said. “They somehow still rake in over $100 million a year peddling their ‘hate map' nonsense, sitting pretty in their Montgomery ‘Poverty Palace' while crying about ‘hate' to line their pockets. Even former staffers called their racket a ‘con.'”

“But it's 2025, and nobody with a functioning brain buys their garbage anymore,” Kirk added. “The SPLC is a laughingstock, a hollowed-out husk of an organization that's been exposed as a grift time and time again. They're not just irrelevant — they're a cautionary tale of how to torch your own credibility. Maybe someone should take a hard look at where all that ‘nonprofit' money's really going?”

Presidential adviser and SpaceX founder Elon Musk also chimed in, criticizing the SPLC.

SPLC is a scam organization

“SPLC is a scam organization,” Musk posted.

The left-wing organization also claimed that Kirk's organization is at the “forefront” of promoting “Christian nationalism” in its explanation for adding TPUSA to the list. The specific list the SPLC placed Turning Point USA on includes chapters of the Ku Klux Klan, as Tyler O'Neil, senior editor of the Daily Signal, pointed out.

🚨BREAKINGThe Southern Poverty Law Center, which trades on its history bankrupting the KKK to smear conservatives as secret supporters of "white supremacy," has put the largest conservative youth org—@TPUSA—on the "hate map" with Klan chapters.🧵1/15https://t.co/1wIU6FX0m6 pic.twitter.com/pCc3vIm55A

“TPUSA is at the forefront of the movement to promote Christian nationalism, the theocratic worldview that the U.S. is a fundamentally Christian country and that Christian values and beliefs should inform the government and wider culture,” read the SPLC's report.

THE SINISTER PLOT TO PUNISH POLITICAL FREE SPEECH

Kirk dismissed the SPLC's categorization of his organization and, like Musk, called the SPLC a “scam.”

“Being on their list is a badge of honor,” Kirk said. “It means they're terrified that we're so effective. Keep crying, SPLC—America's done with your scam.”

You'd be forgiven for looking around Andrei Kozlov's studio, dotted with paintings inspired by his eight months as a hostage of Hamas, and seeing only darkness — canvases splashed with grey and ochre, guns tucked into waistbands or resting against a wall, moments of angst and disbelief and pain.

Andrei Kozlov, an artist who was taken hostage by Hamas during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, speaks with The Associated Press during an interview Monday, May 19, 2025, at his studio in New York.

Andrei Kozlov, an artist who was taken hostage by Hamas during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, speaks with The Associated Press during an interview Monday, May 19, 2025, at his studio in New York.























NEW YORK (AP) — You'd be forgiven for looking around Andrei Kozlov's studio, dotted with paintings inspired by his eight months as a hostage of Hamas, and seeing only darkness — canvases splashed with gray and ocher, guns tucked into waistbands or resting against a wall, moments of angst and disbelief and pain.

He is a free man now, who often lets a wide smile spread across his face, who can't believe his luck of surviving it all, and who urges you to look further.

A painting of a blackened street his captors led him down is drowned in darkness, but in the distance is a sliver of cerulean sky. A screaming man's reflection is caught, but it's in a mirror on a bubblegum-pink wall. A house beside barren trees is seen in the desolation of night, but its windows glow with lamplight.

“When you're surrounded by something dark,” the 28-year-old Kozlov says, standing in a shared art studio he works at in the Hudson Yards neighborhood of New York, “there always can be light inside.”

Nearly a year after his release from captivity, Kozlov is familiar with juxtapositions.

He is mostly happy and well-adjusted, able to matter-of-factly describe his ordeal, but sometimes returns in his mind to what he went through. He is alive and filled with gratitude but feels the weight of those not yet free. He is no longer a hostage but knows the world may always see him as one.




“I will be a former hostage forever,” he says. “It will forever be a part of my life.”

Kozlov grew up in St. Petersburg, Russia, but had long felt a sense of wanderlust. After serving a mandatory year in the military, he decided he wanted to live in Israel, arriving in August 2022 and taking part in Masa, a gap-year program that included an internship in motion design at a Tel Aviv company. His life was carefree, reflected in Instagram posts of beaches, biking, surfing, road-tripping and otherwise enjoying the days of a relaxed, unemployed 20-something.

That ended on Oct. 7, 2023, the deadliest day in Israel's history. Kozlov had picked up a job working security at the Tribe of Nova music festival in southern Israel close to the Gaza border, barely sleeping in two nights keeping watch for ticketless intruders. On his third morning, daybreak unleashed hours of chaos and confusion, the sound of gunfire, mad dashes for escape, scaling down a cliff and ultimately being led to a vehicle that Kozlov believed would bring him to safety. He hadn't been killed, he rationalized, so he would be rescued. He never considered kidnapping.

He sent no messages to his family. He was sure he would survive. He'd be home by night, he thought.

Soon, though, Kozlov was in Gaza, tied with rope. Reality set in. Guns were aimed and blows were delivered. He was certain he knew what would come next.

“You are sure that you will spend the last moments of your life like that,” he says, “and maybe tomorrow they will kill you.”

Those first days of Kozlov's captivity were a “disgusting, terrible hell.” Over eight months, he says he was held in eight different houses, guarded by a rotating cast of two dozen militants who lived beside him.

Some, he said, feigned compassion; others treated their captives as animals. In some holding sites, he slept on a wet, sticky mattress that stunk of mold; others had far better conditions. Ropes were replaced by chains until restraints were removed altogether. He knows it could have been far worse.

“They didn't pull out my nails,” he says. “They didn't torture me with electroshock.”

In time, a weird normalcy set in. He spent time picking up Arabic from his captors and Hebrew from fellow hostages. They'd talk of music and women and life before. Days passed in endless hands of cards or invented games like listing 10 Will Smith movies or 100 songs with the word ‘love' in the title. 

He'd muse about escaping, but knew he'd never make it out alive. Sometimes, he wondered if he could telekinetically send a message to his parents. At others, this agnostic found himself trying to talk to God.

After a few months, his captors provided a small mercy: A pencil and a thin notebook.

Kozlov knew he had artistic talent from childhood, but it was a pastime that came and went. Sometimes, years went by without drawing. Now, with nothing but time, he drew daily — cartoonish aliens and Don Corleone of “The Godfather” and the summer home in Russia where he spent his happiest days of youth.

He wrote out goals, too. To go home the same person, or maybe better. To use his skills. To be free.

Andrei Kozlov, an artist who was taken hostage by Hamas during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, speaks with The Associated Press during an interview Monday, May 19, 2025, at his studio in New York.



And, on the 247th day, it came. Israeli Defense Forces burst into the house in the Nuseirat refugee camp where Kozlov was held — a dramatic operation that rescued him and three other hostages, and killed at least 274 Palestinians caught in the cross-fire and an Israeli commando. In a moment, he was outside, feeling sun on his face for the first time in months, a Coke in his hand and a cigarette at his lips. A helicopter whirred him to safety.

“Euphoria,” he says. “You're able to feel fresh air, to see a sea, beach, sand, sky without any clouds.”

He calls it the best day of his life.

In the days that followed, he'd be reunited with his family, crumpling and bawling at his mother's feet at a hospital outside Tel Aviv, and recognized by passersby as that hostage on the news. Some nights, he'd wake up thinking he was back on that sticky mattress. Some days he had to pinch himself to believe he was truly free.

“Sometimes I feel what it means to have a war and sometimes I feel the pain of every hostage,” he says. “I feel pain of families who don't know where their loved ones are right now. ... I feel pain of people who left their houses in the south. I feel the pain of all the people who lost their houses. I feel pain.”

He says the vast majority of the time, he feels fine, but a day or so a month, the darkness returns. He spent his first few months of freedom in Israel, then traveling in the U.S. He was back in Israel for a time earlier this year, but found too many triggers, so he returned to the U.S. 

Along the way, he's made good on his goal, working on his art.

In his studio space a block from the Hudson River, he's finalizing a planned exhibition of his work — a series of mostly acrylic paintings showing his capture, captivity and release. He wants to finish a few more pieces influenced by his time as a hostage before pivoting to new inspirations.

Maybe he'll flit off to New Zealand, he says. Maybe he'll write a book. So many doors are open to him. Maybe art will become his life and his work will be filled with color and happiness.

He sees that joy even in the paintings others might insist are dark.

“It's not dark,” he says. “It's about hope.”

The Israeli military says 170 trucks with food, medicine and medical supplies crossed into the Gaza Strip on Monday. It says the trucks belonging to the United Nations and other aid groups came in through the Kerem Shalom crossing after a rigorous security inspection.

The Abu Jarad family is homeless once again. For the 10th time during Israel's nearly 20-month campaign in Gaza, they have been forced to uproot themselves and flee. This time was the most painful of all.

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — A new aid system in Gaza opened its first distribution hubs Monday, according to a U.S.-backed group that said it began delivering food to Palestinians who face growing hunger after Israel's nearly three-month blockade to pressure Hamas.

The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is taking over the handling of aid despite objections from United Nations. The desperately needed supplies started flowing on a day that saw Israeli strikes kill at least 52 people in Gaza.

The group said truckloads of food -- it did not say how many -- had been delivered to its hubs, and distribution to Palestinians had begun. It was not clear where the hubs were located or how those receiving supplies were chosen.

“More trucks with aid will be delivered tomorrow, with the flow of aid increasing each day,” the foundation said in a statement.

The U.N. and aid groups have pushed back against the new system, which is backed by Israel and the United States. They assert that Israel is trying to use food as a weapon and say a new system won't be effective.

Israel has pushed for an alternative aid delivery plan because it says it must stop Hamas from seizing aid. The U.N. has denied that the militant group has diverted large amounts.




The foundation began operations a day after the resignation of its executive director. Jake Wood, an American, said it had become clear the foundation would not be allowed to operate independently. It's not clear who is funding the group, which said it had appointed an interim leader, John Acree, to replace Wood,

The organization is made up of former humanitarian, government and military officials. It has said its distribution points will be guarded by private security firms and that the aid would reach a million Palestinians — around half of Gaza's population — by the end of the week. 

Under pressure from allies, Israel began allowing a trickle of humanitarian aid into Gaza last week after blocking all food, medicine, fuel or other goods from entering since early March. Aid groups have warned of famine and say the aid that has come in is nowhere near enough to meeting mounting needs.

Hamas warned Palestinians on Monday not to cooperate with the new aid system, saying it is part of Israel's plans to transfer much of Gaza's population to other countries.

Israel says it plans to facilitate what it describes as the voluntary migration of much of Gaza's population of 2 million, a plan rejected by Palestinians and much of the international community. 

Israel's military campaign has destroyed vast areas of Gaza and internally displaced some 90% of its population. Many have fled multiple times.

The Israeli airstrikes killed at least 36 people in a school-turned-shelter that was hit as people slept, setting their belongings ablaze, according to local health officials. The military said it targeted militants operating from the school.

Israel renewed its offensive in March after ending a ceasefire with Hamas. It has vowed to seize control of Gaza and keep fighting until Hamas is destroyed or disarmed, and until it returns the remaining 58 hostages, a third of them believed to be alive, from the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war.

Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 people in the 2023 attack. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed around 54,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. It says more than half the dead are women and children but does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count.

The strike on the school in the Daraj neighborhood of Gaza City also wounded dozens of people, said Fahmy Awad, head of the ministry's emergency service. He said a father and his five children were among the dead. The Shifa and al-Ahli hospitals in Gaza City confirmed the overall toll.

Awad said the school was hit three times while people slept, setting fire to their belongings. Footage circulating online showed rescuers struggling to extinguish fires and recovering charred remains.

The military said it targeted a militant command and control center inside the school that Hamas and Islamic Jihad used to gather intelligence for attacks. Israel blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it operates in residential areas.

A separate strike on a home in Jabalya in northern Gaza killed 16 members of the same family, including five women and two children, according to Shifa Hospital, which received the bodies.

Palestinian militants meanwhile fired three projectiles from Gaza, two of which fell short within the territory and a third that was intercepted, according to the Israeli military.

Ultranationalist Israelis gathered Monday in Jerusalem for an annual procession marking Israel's 1967 conquest of the city's eastern sector. Some protesters chanted “Death to Arabs” and harassed Palestinian residents. 

Police kept a close watch as demonstrators jumped, danced and sang. The event threatened to inflame tensions that are rife in the restive city amid nearly 600 days of war in Gaza.

Hours earlier, a small group of protesters, including an Israeli member of parliament, stormed a compound in east Jerusalem belonging to the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, which Israel has banned. The compound has been mostly empty since January, when staff were asked to stay away for security reasons. The U.N. says the compound is protected under international law.

            When it comes to ending the war in Ukraine, President Donald Trump's statements and social media posts have become meaningless.
    


            Receding chances for a ceasefire and peace deal soon will depend instead on whether he finally finds the steel to reinforce his rhetorical lashing of President Vladimir Putin over the weekend with action.
    


            The Kremlin is betting he won't.
    


            It dismissed Trump's frustration with the most intense Russian drone attacks on Ukraine as a symptom of “emotional overload.” And experience suggests Putin can get away with calling the US president's bluff. After all, Trump's Truth Social critique of the Russian leader as “crazy” on Monday was leavened with a characteristic rebuke of the victim — Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelensky.
    


            Still, the intensifying Russian attacks on Ukrainian civilians appear to be a deliberate Russian test for Trump, a week after his hyped call with Putin, which made no progress toward peace despite the White House spin.
    


            There are two routes Trump can take, assuming he's ready to abandon the embarrassing position of being constantly played by Putin.



            He could impose new sanctions against Russia, which he previously argued would hamper diplomacy. He told reporters in New Jersey on Sunday this was “absolutely” a consideration. Trump could also save lives in Ukraine by emulating his predecessor Joe Biden and asking Congress to approve new shipments of arms and ammunition to the country.
    


            But this option would mean a massive turnaround that would be embarrassing politically, since Trump's opposition to spending billions of dollars in Ukraine is a foundation of his second presidency. And it would mean the president accepting that, as was the case for many of his recent predecessors, his belief that he could manage Putin was flawed.



            There is another possibility — one that Ukraine and its European allies fear. Trump could throw up his hands and argue that neither side wants peace and it's time for the US to walk away. Russia would then press on with its war of attrition and attacks on civilians. Its land grab would be validated, creating a disastrous precedent for European security and US disengagement.
    


            This isn't an academic prospect. An isolationist streak running through the MAGA movement meant that recent hints by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance that the US could step back seem like more than a mere negotiating tactic.
    


            And one way to read Trump's Truth Social post on Monday was as a smokescreen for a US withdrawal. “This is a War that would never have started if I were President. This is Zelenskyy's, Putin's, and Biden's War, not ‘Trump's,'” the president wrote.
    


            There's one good reason why Trump might change his mind: His credibility is on the line after his bold predictions that he could end the war in 24 hours were exposed as a fantasy.
    


            One option would be for Trump to introduce the secondary sanctions on Russia he has sometimes floated. These would target financial institutions, companies and other entities that continue to do business with Moscow.
    


            Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham and Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal have a new bill that would impose stiff sanctions on nations that still engage with Russia. This could hurt US adversaries such as China. But it could also disrupt Trump's relations with allies like India — a big customer of Russian cut-price oil. The senators already have 81 co-sponsors, meaning the bill could be quickly passed if Trump wanted, sending a tough message to Russia.
    


            Trump could also boost Ukraine's air defenses by donating or selling to Kyiv more Patriot missiles to combat cruise missiles that are complementing the murderous nightly drone barrage.
    


            The dangers of escalating the war into a more direct confrontation between Russia and the West should not be dismissed. This was a major consideration for Biden, too, and the ex-president's slow testing of Russian red lines was a constant frustration for his critics. But Trump's caution makes Biden look like a hawk.
    


            Still, perhaps Putin has finally pushed Trump into a long-delayed epiphany.
    


            “There have been statements and expressions of irritation and frustration coming from President Trump and others in the administration before, even threats of sanctions, but so far nothing,” former US Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor told Isa Soares on CNN International on Monday. “So, the question will be, is this time enough to have these sanctions imposed? And not just the sanctions; there has to be support for the Ukrainian military as well.”
    


            Retired US Army Major Mike Lyons thinks Trump may be creating political space for himself.
    


            “Who's that (Truth Social) message for? (He is) obviously saying that to Vladimir Putin, but I think he's selling that to the American public to gauge whether or not it would be popular for him to get more involved and have the country more involved inside Ukraine right now,” Lyons told CNN's Brianna Keilar. “I'd like to think that what he thought was as simple equation back when he first took over … he's seeing now it's a very difficult one to solve.”
    


            America's European allies are closely watching to see whether Trump follows through.
    


            French President Emmanuel Macron said during a trip to Vietnam on Monday that after recently talking with Trump, he believes the US leader now understands that while “President Putin told him by telephone he was ready for peace” — and said the same to US envoys — “he was lying to them.”
    


            German Chancellor Friedrich Merz also sharpened his tone. He said there are now no limits on the range Ukraine could fire European weapons — meaning they could now strike deep into Russia. It was not immediately clear, however, whether he was referring to a new operational shift.



            The allies seem to sense a moment when Trump's mind could be changed after months of seeing him undermine their own efforts to force Putin to accept an immediate ceasefire.
    


            But as usual, no one can be sure which way he'll jump. One European diplomat said it was still difficult to say if the president's condemnations of Putin really signaled a new approach but noted that Europe was obviously interested in more sanctions.
    


            There are two problems with the notion that Trump has finally seen the light about the Russian leader.
    


            First, he's never been keen to criticize Putin.
    


            Second, the Russian leader's ruthlessness in waging war is hardly new, three years after an unprovoked and illegal invasion that has killed tens of thousands of civilians and sparked international war crimes arrest warrants.
    


            This is why it's risky to take Trump's weekend rhetoric at face value. His comments served a political purpose in deflecting questions from journalists about his views on the latest atrocity in Ukraine. And he got good headlines on Memorial Day for getting tough on Putin. But recent history shows that once the moment passes, the president often moves onto something else.
    


            “Talk is cheap, and we have been waiting for action,” former senior US national intelligence official Beth Sanner told CNN's Phil Mattingly on Monday. “You have to pressure the party that's a problem.”
    


            “Putin doesn't believe that Trump is going to follow through,” Sanner said.

Walmart agreed to pay a small fine and promised to ensure its third-party resellers are unable to sell realistic looking toy guns to buyers in New York, after state Attorney General Letitia James said Tuesday that the retail giant's online store shipped them to the state.

The settlement comes nearly a decade after Walmart, Amazon, Sears and other retailers entered into a consent order and judgment with New York's previous attorney general, in which they agreed to keep toy guns that resemble actual deadly weapons off their shelves statewide and they paid civil penalties that topped $300,000.

The 2015 order was part of a nationwide reckoning over realistic looking toy guns in the wake of the fatal shooting of Tamir Rice, a 12 year-old Cleveland boy who was killed by police in November 2014 while holding a pellet gun.

The New York law bans retailers from selling or shipping toy guns of certain colors — black, dark blue, silver, or aluminum — that look like real weapons.

Toy guns sold in the state must be "made in bright colors or made entirely of transparent or translucent materials," with businesses subject to a fine of $1,000 per violation, according to James' office.

James said on Tuesday that an investigation by her office found that Walmart's online store had shipped at least nine realistic looking toy guns sold by third-party sellers to New York City, Westchester County and Western New York.

But the investigation also found that between March 2020 and November 2023, at least 46 imitation weapons that violate New York state law were purchased by consumers in the state through the Walmart.com platform, the settlement revealed.

"Realistic-looking toy guns can put communities in serious danger and that is why they are banned in New York," James said in a statement.

"Walmart failed to prevent its third-party sellers from selling realistic-looking toy guns to New York addresses, violating our laws and putting people at risk," she said.

"The ban on realistic-looking toy guns is meant to keep New Yorkers safe and my office will not hesitate to hold any business that violates that law accountable."

Walmart must pay $14,000 in penalties and $2,000 in fees under the settlement, the AG's office said.

CNBC has requested comment from Walmart, which neither admitted nor denied the findings by James' office in its investigation.

As part of the settlement, Walmart is required to prohibit third parties from offering for sale or selling any of the imitation guns covered by the state law to buyers in New York.

"Walmart shall terminate the ability of a third party from being able to list and sell toy guns and imitation weapons on Walmart.com when it has determined that a third party has engaged in conduct" that violates that restriction on three separate occasions, the settlement said.

And "Walmart shall implement and maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent such third parties from offering for sale, exposing for sale, or selling Prohibited Items on Walmart.com for importation, holding for sale, or distribution to New York," the settlement says.

The Blackstone headquarters in New York.

Blackstone Inc. agreed to buy $5 billion of private equity holdings from the New York City pension system, one of the largest sales of its kind. 

The transaction, which represented 450 individual commitments in 125 funds from 75 different managers, is for “portfolio strategic realignment” purposes, according to a statement from the New York City Comptroller's office, not liquidity needs.

Circle, the issuer of the popular USDC stablecoin, has begun its long-awaited initial public offering process, looking to raise about $624 million at a valuation around $6 billion.

The company, led by CEO Jeremy Allaire, said Thursday in a filing that it plans to sell 24 million shares of Class A common stock in total – 9.6 million to be sold by the company and another another 14.4 million by existing shareholders – at an expected price range of $24 to $26 apiece, which values the company at around $5.65 billion. Circle also said it will grant the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 3.6 million additional shares.

Cathie Wood's ARK Investment Management has indicated interest in purchasing up to $150 million of the shares, per the filing.

Shares will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker CRCL. Circle's IPO prospectus was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission at the beginning of April.

Circle's USD Coin (USDC) has roughly $62 billion in circulation and makes up about 27% of the total market cap for stablecoins, behind Tether's 67% dominance, according to CryptoQuant. Its market cap has grown 40% this year, however, compared with Tether's 10% growth.

The stablecoin sector specifically has been ramping up as the industry gains confidence that the crypto market will get its first piece of U.S. legislation passed and implemented this year, focusing on stablecoins. Last week, the Senate voted to advance the first crypto legislation, which would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins. Trump has said he wants to see crypto regulation on his desk and ready to sign by August before Congress goes into recess.

Circle's IPO could have investment implications for Coinbase, a cofounder of USDC and major distribution vehicle for the stablecoin. The crypto services company and exchange has a 50% revenue sharing agreement with Circle and also makes 100% of the interest earned by USDC products on the Coinbase platform. 

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has said Coinbase has a "stretch goal" to make USDC the number 1 stablecoin in the world.

Historically, stablecoins have been used primarily for trading and as collateral in decentralized finance (DeFi), and crypto investors watch them closely for evidence of demand, liquidity and activity in the market. More recently, their ability to move dollars quickly and cheaply across borders has become more popular with banks and fintech companies.

Additionally, rhetoric around their ability to help preserve U.S. dollar dominance – by exporting dollar utility internationally and ensuring demand for U.S. government debt, which backs nearly all dollar-denominated stablecoins – has grown louder.

A federal judge's recent order may foil President Donald Trump's plans to transfer the country's more than $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio from the U.S. Department of Education to the Small Business Administration.

Judge Myong J. Joun of U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts wrote in his May 22 preliminary injunction that the Trump administration was required to reinstate more than 1,300 Education Department employees and was blocked from carrying out Trump's directive "to transfer management of federal student loans and special education functions out of the Department."

In other words, federal student loans will stay with the Department of Education, for now.

Trump had announced on March 21 a plan to transfer more than 40 million student loan accounts to the SBA.

"They're all set for it," the president said of the SBA at the time. "They're waiting for it."

Madi Biedermann, deputy assistant secretary for communications at the Education Department, slammed the judge's decision.

"Once again, a far-left Judge has dramatically overstepped his authority, based on a complaint from biased plaintiffs, and issued an injunction against the obviously lawful efforts to make the Department of Education more efficient and functional for the American people," Biedermann wrote in a statement to CNBC on Thursday.

The Trump administration requested the order be stayed pending an appeal of the decision.

The development that student loans will remain in the Education Dept. for now is good news for borrowers, said Sarah Sattelmeyer, a project director at New America and senior advisor under the Biden administration.

"Instead of increasing efficiency, the movement of the Department's core functions would have increased confusion and decreased the effectiveness of programs that students depend on to access education," Sattelmeyer said.

Consumer advocates are worried that a mass transfer of accounts between federal agencies could trigger errors, or compromise federal student loan borrowers' privacy. Those problems have occurred during much smaller transfers between loan servicers.

Advocates also raise concerns about how a change in agency might affect borrower protections and programs such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness.

The Small Business Administration has no experience relevant to the management of federal student loans, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.  

It would ultimately require an act of Congress to move the loan portfolio to the SBA, Kantrowitz said. The Higher Education Act of 1965 spells out that the Education Department's Federal Student Aid office is responsible for the debt, he said.

Adding to advocates' criticism over Trump's proposed transfer was his administration's announcement in March that the SBA's workforce would be reduced by 43% — leaving fewer people to manage this new responsibility.

Japan's Nippon Steel is expected to close its acquisition of U.S. Steel for $55 per share, sources familiar with the matter told CNBC's David Faber.

President Donald Trump cleared Nippon's bid for U.S. Steel on Friday, referring to the deal as a "partnership." Trump said Nippon will invest $14 billion over the next 14 months. U.S. Steel's headquarters will remain in Pittsburgh, the president said.

U.S. Steel shares were up more than 1% on Tuesday. The $55 per share bid for U.S. Steel is the offer that Nippon originally made for the company before the deal was blocked in January.

President Joe Biden had blocked Nippon's bid for U.S. Steel on national security grounds, arguing that the deal will potentially jeopardize critical supply chains. But Trump ordered a new review of the proposed acquisition in April, despite his previous opposition to Nippon acquiring U.S. Steel.

The United Steelworkers union had opposed Nippon's bid to acquire U.S. Steel. USW President David McCall said Friday that the union "cannot speculate about the impact" of Trump's announcement "without more information."

"Our concern remains that Nippon, a foreign corporation with a long and proven track record of violating our trade laws, will further erode domestic steelmaking capacity and jeopardize thousands of good, union jobs," McCall said in a statement.

Trump told reporters on Sunday that the deal is an "investment, it's a partial ownership, but it will be controlled by the USA." Pennsylvania Senator Dave McCormick told CNBC on Tuesday that U.S. Steel will have an American CEO and a majority of its board members will be from the U.S.

"It's a national security agreement that will be signed with the U.S. government," McCormick told CNBC's "Squawk Box." "There'll be a golden share that will essentially require U.S. government approval of a number of the board members and that will allow the United States to ensure production levels aren't cut."

The $14 billion that Nippon will invest includes $2.4 billion that will go to U.S. Steel's operations at Mon Valley outside Pittsburgh, McCormick said. The deal will save 10,000 jobs in Pennsylvania and add another 10,000 jobs in the building trades to add another arc furnace, the senator said.

When asked what Nippon gets from the deal, McCormick said the Japanese steelmaker will "have certainly members of the board and this will be part of their overall corporate structure."

"They wanted an opportunity to get access to the U.S. market — this allowed them to do so and get the economic benefit of that," McCormick said of Nippon. "They've negotiated it, it was their proposal."

Trump said Friday he will hold a rally at U.S. Steel in Pittsburgh on May 30.

National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Tuesday that the Trump administration does not want to "harm Apple" with tariffs.

"Everybody is trying to make it seem like it's a catastrophe if there's a tiny little tariff on them right now, to try to negotiate down the tariffs," Hassett told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Tuesday. "In the end, we'll see what happens, we'll see what the update is, but we don't want to harm Apple."

Hassett's comments come after President Donald Trump said in a social media post that Apple will have to pay a tariff of 25% or more for iPhones made outside the U.S. Apple has historically manufactured its products in foreign countries including China, India and Vietnam.

"I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else," Trump wrote in the post. "If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S. Thank your for your attention to this matter!"

By some estimates, a U.S.-made iPhone could cost as much as $3,500.

"If you think that Apple has a factory some place that's got a set number of iPhones that it produces and it needs to sell them no matter what, then Apple will bear those tariffs, not consumers, because it's an elastic supply," Hassett said.

Hasset's comments continue the administration's push to pressure companies to shoulder the cost burden of Trump's tariffs, instead of raising prices for consumers.

Earlier this month, Trump told retail giant Walmart to "EAT THE TARIFFS" after the company warned it would have to pass those added costs on.

Shares of Apple were up more than 1% on Tuesday.

Apple did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

US Supreme Court:

The US Supreme Court in Washington, DC.

The US Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal from a public middle school student who said his free speech rights were violated when his principal barred him from wearing a T-shirt saying “there are only two genders.”

Over the dissents of two conservative justices, the court left intact a federal appeals court decision that said the Massachusetts principal and school district were on solid ground in concluding the shirt carried a demeaning message that could disrupt the learning environment.

TUNE IN: The 2025 CNBC Disruptor 50 list will be revealed Tuesday, June 10 at 6am ET

Artificial intelligence startup Ambience Healthcare on Tuesday announced a new medical coding model that outperforms doctors by 27%.

Ambience uses AI to draft clinical notes in real-time as doctors consensually record their visits with patients. The company used tools from OpenAI to build the new model.

The startup is part of a fiercely competitive market that has taken off as health-care executives search for solutions to help reduce staff burnout and daunting administrative workloads. 

The company's new model can listen to patient encounters and identify ICD-10 codes, which are internationally standardized classifications for different diseases and conditions. There are about 70,000 ICD-10 codes that are regularly updated and used to facilitate billing and other reporting processes in health care. 

Ambience said its new ICD-10 model can reduce billing mistakes and help clinicians and professional coders work more efficiently. The model notched a "27% relative improvement over physician benchmarks," according to a release on Tuesday.  

"We're not replacing doctors or coders," Brendan Fortuner, Ambience's head of engineering, told CNBC in an interview. "What we're doing is we're liberating them from administration, and we're fixing mistakes that help make health care better, safer, more cost-effective."

Documenting ICD-10 codes has traditionally been a labor-intensive task in health care, but it's a crucial way to track outcomes, mortalities and morbidities in a standardized way, said Dr. Will Morris, the chief medical officer of Ambience.

"If you think about it from a data perspective, it's how you can compare and contrast clinician A to B, or health system A to B," Morris said in an interview. "It's the cornerstone for quality."

Ambience's technology is used at more than 40 health-care organizations, like Cleveland Clinic and UCSF Health. It has raised more than $100 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Kleiner Perkins, Andreessen Horowitz and the OpenAI Startup Fund. 

The company is reportedly seeking fresh capital at a valuation of over $1 billion, according to a report from The Information. Ambience declined to comment on the report. 

Ambience trained its new AI model using OpenAI's reinforcement fine-tuning technology. This technology allows companies to tune OpenAI's best reasoning models for very specific domains, like health care. 

To validate the model, Ambience tested it against a "gold panel" set of labels, the company said. The labels were established by a group of expert clinicians who evaluated complex clinical cases and came to an agreement on what the right codes were. 

The company then recruited 18 different board-certified doctors and compared their performance on ICD-10 coding accuracy to the model's performance. That comparison showed the Ambience technology performed 27% better than the physician baseline. 

"It shows for the first time that an AI system can actually surpass clinician experts at a very, very important administrative task, especially in coding," Fortuner said. 

Ambience already has similar capabilities available for other medical codes like Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes, and Fortuner said it's exploring how to tackle other areas like prior authorizations, utilization management and clinical trial matching. 

The company's new ICD-10 model will roll out to customers over the summer.

"Getting it right at the point of care is a fundamental change," Morris said.

Salesforce said Tuesday that it's buying cloud data management company Informatica in an $8 billion deal to bolster the software vendor's push into artificial intelligence.

Shares of Salesforce were up 1% on Tuesday. Informatica stock climbed more than 5%.

"Truly autonomous, trustworthy AI agents need the most comprehensive understanding of their data," said Steve Fisher, Salesforce president and chief technology officer, in a release announcing the deal. "The combination of Informatica's advanced catalog and metadata capabilities with our Agentforce platform delivers exactly this."

Under the terms of the deal, holders of Informatica's Class A and Class B-1 common stock will receive $25 in cash per share, according to the release.

Bloomberg reported Friday that the companies were in talks about a deal. The report sent shares of Informatica up more than 17%.

Salesforce, which specializes in customer relationship management software, said it would look to combine Informatica's data catalog, integration, governance, privacy and data management services with its agentic AI solution, dubbed Agentforce.

The deal will be funded through a combination of cash on Salesforce's and new debt, the company said.

The acquisition adds to a slew of deals Salesforce has made over the years as the company has sought to expand its product portfolio and gain market share. It bought Slack in 2021 for $27.7 billion, Tableau in 2019 for $15.7 billion and MuleSoft in 2018 for $6.5 billion.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said Tuesday that the company would look to use Informatica alongside its Data Cloud, MuleSoft and Tableau products to "enable autonomous agents to deliver smarter, safer, and more scalable outcomes for every company."

A European-wide shift to nuclear power appears to be gathering momentum as countries hedge their bets in pursuit of more energy independence.

In just the last few weeks, Denmark announced plans to reconsider a 40-year ban on nuclear power as part of a major policy shift, Spain reportedly signaled an openness to review a shutdown of its nuclear plants and Germany dropped its long-held opposition to atomic power.

The renewed European interest in nuclear shows how some countries are hedging their bets in pursuit of more energy independence.

The burgeoning trend appears to be driven, at least in part, by some of the costs associated with renewables, notably solar and wind technologies.

"Solar and wind are still the cheapest and fastest way to drive the green transition, and that remains our focus. But we also need to understand whether new nuclear technologies can play a supporting role," Lars Aagaard, Denmark's minister for climate, energy and utilities, told CNBC via email.

The renewables-heavy Scandinavian country said in mid-May that it plans to analyze the potential benefits and risks of new advanced nuclear technologies, such as small modular reactors, to complement solar and wind technologies.

Denmark's government, which banned the use of atomic energy in 1985, added that it does not plan a return to traditional nuclear power plants.

"We have no recent experience with nuclear power, and we lack the necessary knowledge regarding safety and waste management. That's why we must begin a serious analysis — not to replace solar and wind, but to see whether new nuclear can complement our energy system in the future," Aagaard said.

Georg Zachmann, senior fellow at Bruegel, a Brussels-based think tank, said nuclear power remains the most divisive electricity generation technology in Europe.

"Thereby, the renaissance of nuclear in the political discourse is somewhat surprising, given that the cost of main competing technologies, new wind and solar plants, have dropped by more than 80 percent, while those of nuclear plants have rather increased," Zachmann said.

The so-called "hidden cost" of balancing and transporting electricity from renewables has been increasing with rising shares of wind and solar generation, Zachmann said, noting that this theme has recently become more apparent.

Spain signaled its openness to atomic energy late last month. In an interview reported by Bloomberg, Spanish Environmental Transition Minister Sara Aagesen said that while the government is proceeding with plans to retire nuclear energy reactors over the next decade, extensions beyond 2035 could not be ruled out.

Aagsen said at the time that the government was not considering anything, and no specific proposals had yet been tabled.

Widely regarded as anti-nuclear power, the southern European country has been mired in a blackout blame game over green energy in recent weeks. It follows a catastrophic power outage affecting much of Spain, Portugal and the south of France.

Some external observers have flagged renewables and net-zero emissions targets as possible reasons for the outage, particularly given Spain and Portugal both rely on high levels of wind and solar for their electricity grid.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and the country's grid operator Red Electrica de Espana (REE), however, have both said record levels of renewable energy were not at fault for the blackout.

Germany, which closed the last of its three remaining nuclear plants in 2023, recently scrapped its opposition to nuclear power in what marked a rapprochement with France.

Led by Chancellor Friedrich Merz, the newly elected government was said to have dropped its objection to French efforts to ensure that nuclear power is treated on a par with renewables in EU legislation, the Financial Times reported on May 19, citing French and German officials.

Spokespeople for France and Germany's respective governments were not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC.

As it is low-carbon, advocates argue that nuclear power has the potential to play a significant role in helping countries generate electricity while slashing emissions and reducing their reliance on fossil fuels.

Some environmental groups, however, say the nuclear industry is an expensive and harmful distraction to cheaper and cleaner alternatives.

Bruegel's Zachmann said the ability of fully depreciated nuclear power plants to continue operating much beyond their lifetime, as well as the "highly uncertain" hope that next-generation small modular reactors "can be built very cheaply captures the imagination of industry and policymakers."

In all likelihood, Zachmann said "new nuclear power plants will remain difficult to finance and will at very best only pay off in decades. In the meantime, the discussion whether to prefer nuclear or renewables only helps natural gas — that continues to be burnt as long as investments in clean electricity do not happen at scale."

Data published by energy think tank Ember found that the EU's electricity system continued a rapid shift toward renewables in the first half of last year. Indeed, wind and solar power rose to record highs over the six-month period, reaching a share of 30% of the bloc's electricity generation and overtaking fossil fuels for the first time.

Alongside renewables growth, Ember said at the time that nuclear generation across the EU increased by 3.1%.

A WEG electric-motor factory in Jaragua do Sul, Brazil.

Brazilian firm WEG has created $21.1 billion in wealth for the descendants of its founders. Now it's facing what may be its biggest challenge yet. 

It's said that “dividend days” are the best days of the year in the remote Brazilian town of Jaragua do Sul, population 180,000.

That payment, together with a profit-sharing program from electric-motor maker WEG SA, helps to support some 20% of the city's residents, spanning current workers to family members and retirees. The 64-year-old company, founded by an electrician, an accountant and a mechanic, says its own health clinics treat nearly as many patients a year as the city's health system.

Shipments of iPhones from India to the U.S. rose 76% in April year on year, estimates from a technology market analyst firm shows. The surge comes as Apple accelerates its "made in India" plans, which analysts say will meet pushback from President Donald Trump and Beijing.

The data from Canalys, now part of Omdia, showed that U.S. iPhones shipped from India in April reached roughly 3,000,000. That's a stark contrast to shipments from China over the same period, which fell about 76% from last year to just 900,000. 

According to Le Xuan Chiew, a research manager at Omdia, the April numbers show the aggressive measures Apple has taken to adapt to Washington's tariffs against China, where Apple manufactures most of its iPhones.

"This latest trade war with China, is the type of disturbance that Apple has long been trying to prepare itself for," he said, adding that the country had first started investing heavily into supply chains in India during the Covid-19 pandemic. 

India also surpassed China in iPhone shipments to the United States in March, according to Omdia's estimates. The uptick came ahead of Trump's first iteration of "reciprocal tariffs" on April 2. The amount of shipments that month was unusually high and appeared to be the result of the company's stockpiling, according to Chiew.

The Trump administration's decision to exempt iPhones and other consumer electronics from his reciprocal tariffs on April 11 did not reverse those trends, with Apple CEO Tim Cook in early may reiterating plans for most iPhone's sold in the U.S. to be manufactured in India. 

IPhones imported from China under Trump's current term tariffs still face an additional 30% of duties, while the baseline tariff rate is currently 10% for most other countries, including India. 

While the jump in India's iPhone shipments in March and April showed the adaptability of Apple's supply chains, that growth is expected to slow down for the rest of the year, according to Omdia's Chiew.

"India's manufacturing capacity isn't expected to grow fast enough to take the entirety of U.S. demand. It's still too early," he said, noting that the company recently began shipments of Apple's most cutting-edge iPhone 16 Pro.

Omdia estimates that U.S. iPhone demand is about 20 million a quarter, with India expected to be able to match that level only by 2026. 

Meanwhile, Daniel Newman, CEO and principal analyst at research firm Futurum Group, noted that shipment numbers reflect final assembly, but are not representative of the entire supply chain and manufacturing process. 

"It was actually a very low lift for them to migrate more and more of the final assembly from China to India," he said, adding that a vast majority of the sub-assemblies are all still in China.

Analysts said India's ability to expand its iPhone capacity could be curbed by protectionist measures from Washington and Beijing, which both have issues with Apple's reaction against tariffs.

According to Newman, while this is the smart thing for Apple to do, it's also playing a "dangerous game" with Trump, as it doesn't meet the objectives of his administration's tariffs. 

On Friday, Trump threatened to slap a 25% tariff on all iPhone shipments in a social media post, reiterating that he expects iPhones sold in the U.S. to be manufactured and built domestically, "not India, or anyplace else."

China, for its part, is not expected to make it easy for Apple to diversify out of the country, Newman said, adding that the company has served as trade leverage for Beijing.

According to reports from local outlets in India, Beijing has tried to make it harder for the country to access the high-tech machinery and talent from China needed to further support Apple's suppliers in India. 

Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, told CNBC that Apple's India plans will pose some challenges regarding logistics, distribution and navigating complex supply chains in the country. However, India is nevertheless expected to remain a "life raft" for Apple under the tariff situation.

"Producing iPhones in the U.S. is a fairy tale in our view and Apple will continue to plow ahead on the India path. Cook will look to negotiate with Trump but India is the focus and not changing."

Elon Musk's brand catastrophe in Europe is only getting worse.

Tesla's sales collapsed 49% in Europe last month, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA), as the automaker continues to battle a brand crisis in its third-largest market.

The slump came even as sales of battery electric vehicles in Europe rose by nearly 28%, per ACEA data.

It also suggests that the refreshed version of Tesla's best-selling Model Y, which began rolling off production lines earlier this year, has so far failed to turn things around.

The backlash against CEO Elon Musk's role in the Trump administration has depressed Tesla's sales across the globe and turned the automaker into a target for protests and vandalism.

The resulting brand crisis has been exacerbated in Europe by Musk's support of the German far-right party AfD, which has seen the billionaire draw criticism from German politicians and other industry figures.

In an interview at the Qatar Economic Forum last week, Musk rebuffed suggestions that Tesla was struggling to shift its EVs, saying that other companies were also struggling in Europe and that Tesla was seeing no issues with demand.

While some of Tesla's rivals have struggled, none have seen as great a drop in sales. What's more, BMW, Renault, and VW — which overtook Tesla to become the biggest EV seller in Europe in March — have all seen their sales grow so far this year, per ACEA data.

To make matters worse for Tesla, several of the company's Chinese rivals have recorded surging sales in Europe so far this year.

State-owned auto conglomerate SAIC Motor saw its sales jump nearly 25% in April, while Tesla nemesis BYD sold more electric vehicles than Tesla in Europe for the first time last month, as it puts the automaker under pressure across the globe.

Waymo recently demonstrated why the company believes it's necessary to have lidar and other sensors beyond cameras in order to deliver a safer robotaxi service.

During a presentation at Google I/O on Wednesday, co-CEO Dmitri Dolgov showed a few situations in which Waymo's proprietary lidar and imaging radar system can detect pedestrians before cameras pick them up.

Waymo's current fifth-generation autonomous car is equipped with five lidars, six radar sensors, and 29 cameras.

One scenario involved a Waymo driving through a dust storm in Phoenix, which can occur during Arizona's monsoon season.

In one slide, Dolgov showed two frames of the same image — one of which was taken by Waymo's "high-resolution, high dynamic range camera," and the other from Waymo's lidar.

The image on the right shows how Waymo's lidar can detect the presence of a pedestrian better than the robotaxi's camera. Dolgov called it the Waymo Driver's "superhuman sensing ability."

"You can much more clearly see there's a pedestrian standing on the side of the road," he said. "So imagine they were to step onto our path. This early detection can make a really big difference in how this situation plays out."

Another scenario Waymo showed took place in San Francisco, one of the first cities in which the company made their robotaxis publicly available.

The video shown above demonstrated how Waymo's imaging radar can detect a crossing pedestrian whose view from the robotaxi's camera feed was blocked by a bus.

Because the imaging radar relies on radio waves to detect objects and people on the road, Waymo was able to detect the presence of a pedestrian before they showed up on the cameras. The yellow dot is the imaging radar's radio waves detecting the activity of the object — in this case a human pedestrian.

The footage showed the Waymo stopping as the pedestrian walked into the middle of the road to cross the street.

The sensors "complement each other very nicely and give us redundancy," Dolgov said at the presentation.

Waymo's sensors are an identifiable feature on its white Jaguar robotaxis that now hum through the thoroughfares of several major US cities. The lidars, sensors, and cameras noticeably protrude off the vehicle's exterior, including the lidar that sits on Waymo's roof like a hat.

The company, including its cofounder Sebastian Thrun, as well as many industry experts, says lidar is essential for a safe self-driving experience.

Tesla is one of the leading voices going against this conventional wisdom. The company has used lidar for limited purposes, including data collection, but for scaling robotaxis, CEO Elon Musk has characterized lidar as an expensive "crutch."

"The issue with Waymo's cars is it costs Waymo money," Musk said during Tesla's Q1 earnings call in April.

Tesla is set to compete with Waymo in June when it is set to deploy 10 to 20 robotaxis in Austin. A spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

Dolgov said at the Google I/O conference that sensors merely provide "raw, sometimes noisy measurements of the world around you."

"It all comes down to our AI to interpret all of that data and make good driving decisions," he said.

A second suspect connected to the alleged kidnapping and torture of an Italian man in a plot to steal his digital currency has turned himself in to authorities.

William Duplessie, accompanied by his lawyers, surrendered to the NYPD's Major Case Squad detectives. 

Officials identified Duplessie as a business partner of John Woeltz, 37, who is known by some as the "Crypto King of Kentucky."

The victim, an Italian citizen and another business associate of the two men, was reportedly held captive inside a townhome for over two weeks. Authorities allege the victim was tortured after refusing to hand over his Bitcoin password to Woeltz. 

When the 28-year-old refused, police said Woeltz and the other person pistol-whipped the victim, held a gun to his head, used a chainsaw on his leg, urinated on him, tied his wrists, dangled him out of a building and threatened his family in various attempts to get him to comply.

The victim finally escaped captivity on Friday morning, more than two weeks after first being taken captive. He immediately went to police, who arrested Woeltz the same day.

Upon searching the townhouse, police say they recovered multiple Polaroid pictures depicting the victim being tied up and tortured. A gun and several torture implements consistent with the man's allegations were also found within.

According to NBC News New York, Woeltz's neighbors reported hearing "loud partying" at all hours of the night coming from the home, but said they had no idea of the alleged torture going on within.

Officials say that Woeltz is a big-name cryptocurrency trader from Kentucky with an estimated net worth of around $100 million.

Authorities did not say what part of Kentucky Woeltz is from.

Woeltz is facing multiple charges, including kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment, and assault. He is currently being held without bond.

Duplessie's specific role in the case remains unclear as the investigation continues.

Publicly traded company SharpLink Gaming has raked in $425 million in a private investment in public equity, or PIPE, offering to establish an Ethereum treasury—a move that has boosted its stock price more than 400% so far Tuesday.

The online gambling marketer's raise was led by blockchain technology firm Consensys, with participation from Galaxy Digital, ParaFi Capital, Ondo, and Pantera Capital, among other investors, SharpLink Gaming said Tuesday in a statement. The group bought 69,100,313 of the firm's shares at $6.15 each. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.)

The newly raised funds will go toward acquiring Ethereum, which will serve as the company's primary treasury asset—a move that emulates the playbook of Michael Saylor's software company, Strategy, which has amassed $64 billion worth of Bitcoin since 2020 and inspired a growing list of crypto-stashing followers.

SharpLink Gaming's private equity deal is expected to close on May 29. Consensys CEO and Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin will serve as chairman of SharpLink Gaming's board of directors.

“This is a significant milestone in SharpLink's journey and marks an expansion beyond our core business. On closing, we look forward to working with Consensys and welcoming Joseph to the Board,” said Rob Phythian, founder and CEO of SharpLink, in a statement. 

SharpLink Gaming shares are trading at $35 as of writing time, soaring 420% in the past day. The price of the Nasdaq-listed SBET rose as high as $53.45 earlier Tuesday.

SharpLink Gaming did not disclose how much Ethereum it aims to acquire. The firm did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for comment on the matter. 

Consensys told Decrypt that it cannot speak about the deal until it is finalized.

The marketing company's corporate strategy overhaul comes as a growing number of companies have taken after Strategy's cryptocurrency-centered playbook over the past few years. Medical device company Semler Scientific and Japanese investment firm Metaplanet began employing aggressive Bitcoin-based strategies in 2024, for example, with many other firms similarly following the Strategy model.

Meanwhile, Upexi and DeFi Development Corp. (formerly Janover) have raised millions of dollars for acquiring Solana for their respective corporate treasuries over the past few months, and Canadian firm Spirit is gunning to become the “Strategy of Dogecoin.”

The announcement comes after a recent surge in Ethereum's price following months of declines, with ETH even falling as Bitcoin continued to push to new highs earlier this year. Ethereum has faced an identity crisis amid other concerns from developers and community members, with the Ethereum Foundation recently undergoing leadership changes as a result.

The layer-1 network's token was trading at $2,700 as of writing time, up over 6% on the day and 50% over the past month—though it's down 31% over the past 12 months.

Ethereum (ETH) is up 4% on Tuesday following Sharplink Gaming's plan to raise $425 million in a private placement, led by Consensys, to purchase ETH as its primary treasury reserve asset.

Sharplink Gaming is set to incorporate Ether as its reserve asset, according to a press release on Tuesday. The firm announced it has entered a private investment in public equity (PIPE) agreement for the issuance and sale of 69.1 million of its shares to investors.

Consensys will function as the lead investor for the sales offering, with venture capital firms such as Pantera Capital, ParaFi Capital, Galaxy Digital and Ondo also participating. The sale is expected to generate proceeds of $425 million, which Sharplink intends to use in purchasing Ether as part of its new treasury strategy.

The ETH treasury will take effect upon the closing of the private placement on Thursday, after which Consensys CEO and co-founder of Ethereum Joseph Lubin will join Sharplink's Board of Directors as Chairman.

"On close, Consensys looks forward to partnering with SharpLink to explore and develop an Ethereum Treasury Strategy and to work with them in their core business as a strategic advisor," said Lubin in the press release.

Notably, Sharplink is not the first company to adopt an Ethereum treasury plan. Healthcare firm BioNexus Gene Lab (BGLC) announced in March that it would be adding ETH as its treasury asset. Nasdaq-listed blockchain-based firm BTCS also announced it purchased $8.42 million worth of ETH last week, boosting its total holdings to 12,500 ETH.

The development comes as more corporate firms are veering towards a digital asset treasury strategy, particularly for Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL).

These tokens have seen increased institutional exposure in the past few months, with companies like Strategy and DeFi Development Corp consistently purchasing BTC and SOL, thereby boosting their market demand. As a result, both tokens largely outperformed ETH in the past year.

However, ETH's status quo could be set for a boost with Sharplink's $425 million buying pressure.

Additionally, Etherealize, co-founded by Vivek Raman, is working to demonstrate the advantages of the Ethereum ecosystem to traditional finance institutions, ETF issuers and the public. The company prioritizes developing tools that promote the application of Ethereum in financial markets, with a focus on tokenization and secure asset trading.

Ethereum experienced $68.43 million in futures liquidations over the past 24 hours, according to Coinglass data. The total amount of long and short liquidations is $22.53 million and $45.89 million, respectively.

Since recovering the lower boundary of a symmetrical triangle on the weekly chart, ETH has struggled near the resistance range between $2,750 and $2,850, a key level where bears have historically mounted selling pressure.

If ETH can sustain a high-volume bullish move to flip $2,850 into a support level, it could rally to test the symmetrical triangle's upper boundary. However, it first has to clear the $3,250 resistance to pull off such a move.

On the downside, ETH could find support near the $2,500 level or the lower boundary of the triangle. A decline below this level could bring the support range between $2,250 and $2,100 into focus.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram bars are above their neutral levels, indicating dominant bullish momentum. Meanwhile, the Stochastic Oscillator (Stoch) has slightly tilted into its overbought region, signaling rising chances of a short-term pullback.

In this article

LAS VEGAS — Jack Dorsey's latest bitcoin vision is hitting the checkout counter — starting with a merch truck parked just off the casino floor inside The Venetian.

This week at Bitcoin 2025, Square is piloting real-time bitcoin payments, letting attendees scan and spend crypto for T-shirts, hoodies, and hats at the BTC Inc. pop-up store. The system runs on Lightning, which settles transactions off the main blockchain and is faster and cheaper than traditional processing methods.

When customers scan the QR code at checkout, Square handles things behind the scenes, including real-time exchange rates and confirmation.

The Tuesday launch marks the public debut of Block's most ambitious move yet to make bitcoin "everyday money" — a pilot that's expected to expand from the Vegas Strip to millions of merchants around the world.

Behind it all is Miles Suter, a longtime product leader at Block, who flew in early to oversee setup with his team.

Suter joined the company in 2017, when Cash App's bitcoin integration was still a hackweek experiment.

"They needed someone with deep familiarity with bitcoin and the community," he said, calling himself "an early evangelist."

Eight years later, he's helping "connect the Blocks" — working across Cash App, Spiral, Bitkey, and Square to embed bitcoin into every layer of the company's ecosystem. The Square rollout, he says, is a natural next step.

Block expects to begin offering bitcoin payments to eligible Square sellers later this year, with full availability targeted for 2026, pending regulatory approval.

The launch comes as bitcoin trades near all-time highs, a surge driven largely by the "digital gold" narrative that positions it as a long-term store of value rather than a day-to-day medium of exchange.

At the same time, stablecoin legislation is advancing in Congress, and more fintech giants are aligning behind tokenized dollars. 

Block is taking a different path — one that centers on bitcoin.

Suter said the company's strategy is rooted in the belief that a decentralized, permissionless currency remains critical to the future of the internet — and that bitcoin is still the best candidate to fill that role.

Asked about the lingering perception that bitcoin is better suited for holding than spending, Suter pointed to a familiar pattern. When Cash App first introduced bitcoin trading, he said, it was met with hesitation and doubt.

"But again, somebody's got to be first," he said. "And we feel like we have the right DNA to push things forward."

He called the new Square rollout "a really significant milestone" in Block's broader mission to make bitcoin more accessible and usable.

The product builds on Square's "Bitcoin Conversions" tool, launched last year, which lets merchants automatically convert a portion of their daily sales into bitcoin. Block says it has rolled out the feature to more than 1,000 sellers so far — and those who opted in have seen their bitcoin holdings grow by roughly 70% over the past year.

This latest feature goes a step further, enabling sellers to accept bitcoin directly at the point of sale.

For businesses that don't want to hold bitcoin, there's no exposure risk. Payments can be instantly converted to dollars.

"If you just want to have it as another payment method — like Amex, MasterCard, or Visa — bitcoin is now potentially another option for you," Suter said.

For those that do want to hold it, Block is building out what Suter calls a "Bitcoin for Business" stack — a full suite of tools to accept, convert, manage, and self-custody bitcoin.

"If you do want to accept it as bitcoin," he said, "we give you a full suite of products to manage that as you see fit. That means being able to convert your daily sales, buy and sell from your U.S. dollar balance into bitcoin, and withdraw to self-custody at any time. It's about giving our merchants more options and making sure they never miss a sale."

The announcement comes amid renewed attention on corporate bitcoin strategy, as some publicly traded firms adopt the cryptocurrency as a treasury reserve asset. But Block is targeting a different segment of the market.

"There's a lot of talk about corporate bitcoin right now," Suter said. "But like we did on Cash App — which is very much about the little guy and bringing accessibility to everyone — we want small and medium-sized merchants to also be able to get the benefits of bitcoin."

While Block hasn't released specific metrics yet, Suter said merchants who participated in the Bitcoin Conversions pilot have all profited. "Every single seller is in the money and has made money based on converting a certain percentage of their daily sales," he said.

Square's bitcoin push joins a broader ecosystem at Block that includes Bitkey, its self-custody wallet; Proto, a line of bitcoin mining hardware and software; Spiral, its open-source development arm; and Cash App's bitcoin trading functionality.

"We're focused on making bitcoin everyday currency," Suter said. "We believe that the internet needs a native currency, and that's where all our focus has been today."

              Highlights            



                        Circle, the issuer of USDC, has filed for an IPO with hopes of a $5.65 billion valuation, aiming to boost institutional trust through transparency and U.S. regulatory compliance.                      


                        Circle earned $1.68 billion in 2024, with 99% from interest on USDC reserves, and a potential 1% drop in interest rates could reduce its income by $441 million.                      


                        To evolve beyond a stablecoin issuer, Circle launched the Circle Payments Network (CPN) to support cross-border payments and diversify its business as it navigates regulatory uncertainty.                      

Each week, the evolution of the ongoing cryptocurrency-FinTech convergence seems to get another headline to hang its hat on.

Last week, it was the news Thursday (May 22) that J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup are exploring the launch of a jointly operated stablecoin.

This week, it is the news Tuesday (May 27) that Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, filed for an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “CRCL.” Circle is hoping for a valuation of $5.65 billion with an offering price target of $24 to $26 per share. The lead underwriters are J.P. Morgan, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs.

Circle is betting that the credibility conferred by becoming a public company will help the company in a financial environment skeptical of opaque crypto firms. Transparency is a key pillar of Circle's pitch to institutional clients as outlined in its S-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. By going public, Circle will subject itself to the scrutiny of U.S. securities laws, quarterly earnings reports and regulatory disclosures, all elements designed to engender trust from risk-averse enterprises, banks and governments.

Circle's goal for its IPO is to position itself favorably to become the financial utility layer of the internet. Think Amazon Web Services (AWS) for money movement or a SWIFT network reimagined for digital assets.

To get there, Circle may need to evolve beyond being a stablecoin issuer. Elements such as programmable money services, secure identity layers, robust compliance automation and user-friendly APIs could be crucial since institutional trust is hard-won and easily lost.

The stablecoin arena is no longer the wild frontier it once was. Circle must now contend with legacy finance and FinTech upstarts. PayPal launched PYUSD, and traditional banking consortia are mulling their own. Tether remains the volume leader globally, especially outside the United States.

Circle's edge lies in its U.S.-compliant stance and focus on transparency and fiat backing. But whether that will be enough to ward off better capitalized or more broadly distributed competitors is uncertain. The potential IPO valuation and capital war chest may help, but only if Circle is able to move quickly to entrench itself as the preferred partner for enterprises.

Circle's S-1 offers insight into its revenue model, revealing an interest-sensitive business. In 2024, the company earned $1.68 billion in total revenue, with 99% of that coming from interest income on reserves backing USDC. That figure underscores how tightly Circle's fortunes could be tied to interest rate policy.

As a practical matter, Circle earns this income by parking USDC reserves in short-term U.S. Treasury securities and overnight reverse repurchase agreements. The downside is that if interest rates fall, so too does Circle's revenue. According to its filing, a 1% drop in rates could slash income by as much as $441 million.

Stablecoins have started to decouple themselves from crypto exchanges and position themselves as a component of real-world financial infrastructure, PYMNTS reported in March. Additionally, stablecoin market capitalization reached an all-time high amid strong performance across crypto sectors in April.

Circle's IPO plans can also be seen as a part of a broader movement among other major crypto firms seeking to capitalize on a more pro-crypto, pro-business regulatory climate under the President Donald Trump administration.

The SEC, for example, said it is eying regulatory changes to accommodate on-chain securities and other crypto assets. Meanwhile, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins of 2025 (GENIUS) Act, the country's first stablecoin legislation, is proceeding through the Senate amid recognition in Washington that stablecoins are too big to ignore.

Still, the GENIUS Act could include a provision prohibiting interest-bearing stablecoins. The Circle S-1 flags multiple legal risks, but chief among them is the uncertain U.S. regulatory environment for stablecoins.

To diversify its business model, Circle this month brought the Circle Payments Network (CPN) live. Designed to facilitate the use of stablecoins for mainstream cross-border payments, the network and coordination protocol enables financial institutions to exchange payment instructions and settle transactions on open, public blockchains.

Early adopters of CPN include Alfred Pay, which is using the network to enable stablecoin-to-fiat offramps via PIX and SPEI; Tazapay, which is using it to support compliant fiat disbursements into Hong Kong; RedotPay, which is using the network to initiate USDC-based payments into Brazil; and Conduit, which is using it to onramp fiat into USDC in the U.S. and Europe to support B2B flows into Mexico.

Ethereum ETH$2,673.58 has staged an impressive recovery in the past 24 hours, climbing 3.8% amid significant market volatility. The second-largest cryptocurrency found solid support at $2,530, where exceptional trading volume (242,521 ETH) created a clear bottoming pattern. 

This was followed by a decisive breakout during the early trading hours, supported by massive volume surges exceeding 550,000 ETH that pushed prices above key resistance levels. 

The recent price action confirms a short-term trend reversal, with ETH now trading above $2,575 after establishing new local highs. Institutional interest remains robust, with spot Ethereum ETFs recording $248 million in total net inflows over the past week, suggesting growing confidence from larger investors despite relatively subdued retail participation. 

Market analysts point to the $2,800 level as a critical resistance zone where many investors who previously bought at that level may look to exit at break-even. However, with ETH breaking out of its recent consolidation pattern and the broader crypto market showing signs of strength, bulls are now targeting the $2,650-$2,745 range as the next significant hurdle.

 As part of its 24 million-share IPO, Circle will be offering 9.6 million shares of Class A common stock, while selling stockholders will offer the remaining 14.4 million shares. 

Circle, the issuer of USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, has launched an initial public offering (IPO) of 24 million shares of its Class A common stock, the company said on May 27.

The firm has applied to list its Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol CRCL. As part of the offering, Circle is issuing 9.6 million shares of Class A common stock, the company said in a news release.

The remaining 14.4 million shares of Class A common stock will be offered by selling stockholders. Circle is also expected to grant the underwriters a 30-day option to buy up to an additional 3.6 million shares of Class A common stock to cover over-allotments.

The IPO involves participation from several major US investment banks, with JPMorgan, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs acting as joint lead active bookrunners, the announcement added.

The offering will also feature European banks, including Barclays, Deutsche Bank Securities and Societe Generale acting as bookrunners.

The IPO's co-managers include BNY Capital Markets, Canaccord Genuity, Needham, Oppenheimer and Santander, while junior co-managers are AmeriVet Securities, Drexel Hamilton, Mischler Financial Group and Roberts and Ryan.

Circle currently expects to offer IPO shares at a price ranging from $24 to $26 per share, potentially raising between $576 million and $624 million.

In its Form S-1 filing on Tuesday, Circle said it will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of Class A common stock by the selling stockholders.

“The offering is subject to market conditions, and there can be no assurance as to whether or when the offering may be completed, or as to the actual size or terms of the offering,” Circle noted.

The company said the shares may not be sold prior to the time the registration statement becomes effective. Crypto-focused investors like Cathie Wood's ARK Invest have indicated an interest in purchasing up to $150 million of IPO shares, Circle noted in the filing, adding:

According to a report by Reuters, Circle targeted a valuation of up to $6.71 billion on a fully diluted basis in its IPO offering.

The firm previously attempted to go public through a blank-check deal with the special purpose acquisition company Concord in 2021. Initially targeting a preliminary valuation of $4.5 billion, the deal was amended to place Circle at a $9 billion valuation, with the firm eventually terminating the deal by late 2022.

Cointelegraph approached Circle for a comment regarding the company's valuation in the IPO, but had not received a response at the time of publication.

“For Circle, becoming a publicly traded corporation on the New York Stock Exchange is a continuation of our desire to operate with the greatest transparency and accountability possible,” Circle co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire wrote in a letter accompanying the Form S-1.

“Operating as a US-listed public company represents our continued dedication to transparency and accountability, as we will become subject to the reporting, corporate governance, and other requirements,” he added.

Founded in 2013, Circle is a major company in the crypto industry, known as the issuer of USDC (USDC), the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization after Tether's USDt (USDT).

At the time of writing, USDC has a market cap of $61.5 billion, while its main competitor, USDT, has a $152.7 billion market cap, according to CoinGecko.

Though a significantly bigger player than Circle, El Salvador-based Tether is apparently not looking to launch an IPO.

“Tether doesn't need to go public,” Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said in an X post in April.

 SharpLink Gaming announced a $425 million private equity deal to launch an Ether treasury and appointed Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin as board chairman. 

Betting platform SharpLink Gaming has launched an Ethereum-based corporate treasury strategy and nominated Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin as chairman of its board of directors, the company announced May 27.

According to the announcement, SharpLink Gaming, a publicly traded company on Nasdaq, entered into a securities purchase agreement for a private investment in public equity worth $425 million. Ethereum infrastructure firm Consensys was among the investors.

“On close, Consensys looks forward to partnering with SharpLink to explore and develop an Ethereum Treasury Strategy and to work with them in their core business as a strategic advisor,” Consensys founder and CEO Lubin said.

SharpLink Gaming's stock is up approximately 400% at the time of writing, changing hands at nearly $33.50. Trading today started at over $30 after closing under $7 the day before.

A Consensys representative told Cointelegraph that the company will not comment further until the deal is closed. Still, they confirmed Consensys' investment in SharpLink Gaming.

Alongside Consensys, the investors include venture capital firms ParaFi Capital, Electric Capital, Pantera Capital, Arrington Capital, Galaxy Digital, Ondo, White Star Capital, GSR, Hivemind Capital, Hypersphere and Primitive Ventures. SharpLink CEO Rob Phythian and the firm's CEO Robert DeLucia also participated.

The deal is expected to close “on or about May 29” if the customary closing conditions are satisfied. SharpLink Gaming intends to use the newly raised funds to jumpstart its Ether (ETH) treasury and for other general corporate purposes:

Corporate crypto treasuries are on the rise, but most of them are focused on Bitcoin (BTC). One exception was Meitu, the developer of popular Photoshop-like apps, but the company liquidated its 940 Bitcoin and 31,000 Ether at the end of last year.

Other notable examples include the Canadian subsidiary of Big Four auditor KPMG adding Ether to its treasury alongside Bitcoin in February 2022. Also, Hong Kong-based gaming firm Boyaa Interactive International held ETH, but at the end of 2024, it replaced Ether with Bitcoin.

Social media giant Reddit also acquired both Bitcoin and Ethereum, but the company was reported to have offloaded most of its holdings in late 2024. Publicly traded company BTCS also announced a $57.8 million financing agreement to purchase Ether earlier this month.

New York, NY, May 27th, 2025, Chainwire

Sonic SVM, the first SVM chain extension on Solana, today announced its expanding ecosystem of native projects spanning multiple verticals. Following its successful mainnet launch and Mobius Hackathon, where they received over 250 unique project submissions – Sonic has attracted a diverse set of innovative protocols leveraging its high-performance infrastructure to build next-generation Web3 applications.

“The rapid development of our ecosystem demonstrates the versatility and performance advantages of Sonic SVM,” said Chris Zhu, CEO and co-founder at Sonic. “These projects represent the beginning of a vibrant, interconnected ecosystem that's building critical infrastructure across DeFi, NFTs, and social applications.”

SEGA has emerged as the leading DEX on Sonic SVM, pioneering the ve(3,3) model and redefining attention capital markets through its innovative launchpad. With over $1.18 million in TVL and $9 million in cumulative trading volume, SEGA has quickly established itself as the backbone of Sonic's DeFi ecosystem.

Key metrics:

“SEGA is built to capitalize on Sonic's superior performance, allowing us to create trading experiences that weren't possible on other chains,” said a SEGA representative. “Our ve(3,3) model creates stronger alignment between liquidity providers and token holders, while our launchpad is designed specifically for the attention economy.”

Chaos Finance has launched the first liquid staking protocol designed specifically for Sonic SVM, enabling users to participate in network security while maintaining liquidity. Built on StaFi LSaaS technology, Chaos offers seamless staking with deep DeFi integrations.

Now, there are over 765k+ SONIC staked through chaos, and 754k+ sSONIC circulating in the market. FoMoney, the fully onchain game has teamed up with Chaos, and integrated sSONIC as an in-game currency.

“Liquid staking is critical infrastructure for any blockchain ecosystem,” noted a Chaos Finance representative. “Our protocol allows users to simultaneously secure the network and participate in DeFi opportunities, maximizing capital efficiency while supporting Sonic's decentralization.”

Originally launched as Sonic SVM's first meme token launchpad, Goodr is evolving into the world's first UGC IP token platform for anime fans. The platform will enable fans to mint tokens inspired by official anime content through partnerships with Japanese IP holders.

“Goodr transforms attention into on-chain activity and liquidity,” explained a Goodr representative. “We're not just launching meme tokens – we're building a bridge between anime fandom and Web3, starting with our beta release on May 20th.”

Goodr will also release the SonicSVM Meme Kit (SDK), enabling builders to easily launch meme tokens within the ecosystem. Additionally, a strategic partnership between SEGA and Goodr will strengthen user acquisition and retention across the ecosystem.

Chillonic has launched the first NFT collection on Sonic SVM, featuring the groundbreaking Chill-404 Protocol that bridges the gap between NFTs and memecoins. This innovative technology allows users to seamlessly convert between NFTs and fungible tokens, solving liquidity challenges while preserving digital collectibles' unique identity and rarity.

“Our protocol represents a paradigm shift in how digital assets function,” said a Chillonic representative. “By allowing seamless conversion between NFTs and tokens, we're creating a new asset class that combines the best of both worlds.”

FoMoney: The First Fully-onchain game on Sonic SVM

FoMoney is a fully on-chain game on Sonic SVM that merges the 2048 game with Fomo3D. It aims to build a Game Asset Layer, enabling holders of SONIC 's LST(sSONIC) to generate yields while also engaging in immersive gameplays.

Since launching on Sonic testnet, FoMoney have onboarded 1 million+ on-chain players and created 200+ millions transactions. FoMoney envisions the creation of an On-chain Playground capable of generating economic value for Sonic's Attention Capital Market.

These flagship projects form the foundation of a rapidly expanding ecosystem on Sonic SVM. With complementary functionalities spanning trading, staking, meme culture, and digital collectibles, they demonstrate the versatility of Sonic's infrastructure for supporting diverse Web3 applications.

“What's particularly exciting is how these projects are already beginning to integrate with each other,” added Freiheit, Head of DeFi from Sonic. “The partnership between SEGA and Chillonic, Chaos and FoMoney are just the first examples of the network effects we're seeing within our ecosystem.”

Sonic SVM is the first chain extension SVM to launch on Solana – developing a groundbreaking blockchain protocol that serves as a programmable attention settlement layer. Built on the HSSN network, it offers consensus-level validation of attention-related transactions, granular on-chain access to user activity across dApps, and composable primitives that eliminate the need for each project to build bespoke attention infrastructure.

Sati, a Bitcoin payments app and Lightning infrastructure provider, today announced the launch of its Lightning integration with Xverse, a Bitcoin wallet used by over 1.5 million people worldwide. Thanks to the integration, Xverse users can now send and receive sats (Bitcoin's smallest denomination) instantly over the Lightning Network with no setup, no app switching, and no custodial risk.

Initially designed in 2017, the Lightning Network has grown to become Bitcoin's leading layer-2, with a current BTC capacity of over $465M. Sati is now leveraging this technology to bring the world's favorite digital currency into the pockets of almost 3 billion users worldwide, thanks to its powerful API integration with WhatsApp.

“Bitcoin was not meant to be an asset for Wall Street—it was built for peer-to-peer money, borderless and accessible,” said Felipe Servin, Founder and CEO of Sati. “Integrating Lightning natively into Xverse brings that vision back to life, making Bitcoin usable at scale for billions.”

Thanks to the integration, every Xverse user now gets a Lightning Address instantly. That means they can receive tips, pay invoices, and use Bitcoin for microtransactions—all without having to manage channels or switch between different apps. Sati expects USDT on Lightning to be supported as early as Q3 for the Xverse wallet and in July 2025for users accessing Sati through WhatsApp.

This integration positions Sati's role as a Lightning infrastructure provider, not just a consumer app. By leveraging its API-based solution, the company provides plug-and-play backend services to wallets and platforms looking to add Bitcoin payments without compromising on security or UX.

The Xverse launch follows the debut of Parasite Pool, a new mining pool leveraging Sati and Xverse's tech stack and focused on democratizing Bitcoin mining. Parasite Pool charges 0% fees and pays out instantly over Lightning, making it ideal for small-scale miners, especially those running ultra-low-power hardware like Bitaxe.

With over 500 users joining Parasite Pool within weeks of launch and an average pool hashrate of 5 PH/s, Parasite Pool is steadily growing its presence in the home mining space. Thanks to the Lightning integration, Parasite Pool supports the smallest Lightning payouts in the industry (a fraction of a cent), lowering the barrier to entry for anyone interested in mining.

Sati recently closed a $600K pre-seed round backed by Bitcoin-focused investors, including Draper Associates, BitcoinFi, Arcanum, BoostVC, and Ricardo Salinas. The funding is being used to support global expansion, stablecoin integration, Lightning infrastructure growth, and broader access to Bitcoin in emerging markets.

Sati will be conducting live product demos at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas on May 27-29. To learn more about Sati, visit sati.pro

Chapter 9 introduced Soulbound NFTs, non-transferable assets that ensure authenticity and prevent identity spoofing among participants. Unlike the tradable NFTs from Chapters 1 through 8, which are listed on Magic Eden, these Soulbound NFTs are locked to users' wallets, symbolizing their commitment to the Monadverse ecosystem.

Monadverse operates on the Monad blockchain, a layer-1 network known for its high performance, boasting 10,000 transactions per second and 1-second block times.

Monad's mainnet is expected in Q3 2025, following a successful testnet phase that demonstrated its scalability. The mainnet launch could make MON one of 2025's most talked-about crypto assets, especially with a lean token supply and growing developer interest.

 Shares in Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) tumbled Tuesday as the company behind President Donald Trump's Truth Social app said it is planning to raise $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin.


 Trump Media stock is down 8% in intraday trading Tuesday and has lost almost a quarter of its value so far this year entering Tuesday.


 Trump Media said it would sell around $1.5 billion in shares and $1 billion in zero-coupon convertible bonds to approximately 50 institutional investors in a private placement.


 “We view Bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom, and now Trump Media will hold cryptocurrency as a crucial part of our assets," Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said. The $2.5 billion offering is expected to close on Thursday, the company said, and will "place Bitcoin on Trump Media's balance sheet alongside existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaling $759.0 million as of the end of the first quarter of 2025."


 The Financial Times earlier Tuesday reported the plan by Trump Media to sell stock and convertible bonds to buy bitcoin.


 Trump has said he wants to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet” and has been a proponent of the industry since resuming the presidency in 2025. 


 Business intelligence and bitcoin treasury company Strategy (MSTR), formerly known as MicroStrategy, has acquired billions of dollars in the digital currency in the past year by selling stock and convertible bonds. Strategy shares are up almost 30% so far this year entering Tuesday.


 UPDATE—May 27, 2025: This article has been updated to include the confirmation by Trump Media of its plan to raise funds to buy bitcoin. 


Globe Newswire. “Trump Media Announces Approximately $2.5 Billion Bitcoin Treasury Deal.”

Consensys Software mène l'investissement, rejoint par des fonds de capital-risque crypto renommés tels que ParaFi Capital, Electric Capital et Pantera Capital.

La société prévoit d'utiliser les fonds pour acquérir Ethereum (ETH) comme principal actif de réserve de trésorerie. À la clôture de l'offre, prévue aux alentours du 29 mai 2025, Joseph Lubin, cofondateur d'Ethereum et PDG de Consensys, deviendra président du conseil d'administration de SharpLink. Le placement privé est réalisé sous les exemptions de la Securities Act, avec A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners en tant qu'agent unique de placement.

SharpLink Gaming (NASDAQ:SBET) hat eine bedeutende Private Placement in Höhe von 425 Millionen US-Dollar im Rahmen eines PIPE-Angebots angekündigt und verkauft etwa 69,1 Millionen Aktien zu je 6,15 US-Dollar (für das Management 6,72 US-Dollar). Consensys Software führt die Investition an, unterstützt von namhaften Krypto-Venture-Firmen wie ParaFi Capital, Electric Capital und Pantera Capital.

Das Unternehmen plant, die Erlöse zur Anschaffung von Ethereum (ETH) als Hauptreservevermögen der Treasury zu verwenden. Nach dem voraussichtlichen Abschluss des Angebots um den 29. Mai 2025 wird Joseph Lubin, Mitgründer von Ethereum und CEO von Consensys, Vorsitzender des Vorstands von SharpLink. Die Privatplatzierung erfolgt unter Ausnahmen des Securities Act, wobei A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners als alleiniger Platzierungsagent fungiert.

SharpLink's $425M fundraise to adopt Ethereum as treasury reserve represents a significant strategic pivot with major crypto industry backing.

SharpLink Gaming's announcement of a $425 million private placement represents a dramatic strategic shift for this online performance-based marketing company. The company is effectively implementing a Bitcoin-style treasury strategy but with Ethereum instead, positioning ETH as its "primary treasury reserve asset." This is a significant capital allocation decision that far exceeds the typical operational needs of a marketing services company.

What makes this particularly notable is the investment consortium. The round is led by Consensys Software (founded by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin) and includes participation from nearly every major cryptocurrency venture capital firm including ParaFi, Electric Capital, Pantera, Galaxy Digital and others. This level of participation signals strong crypto industry confidence in this strategy.

The $6.15 per share pricing ($6.72 for management) represents a specific valuation decision point that the crypto investment community has deemed appropriate. More importantly, Joseph Lubin joining as Chairman creates a direct connection to Ethereum's founding team, suggesting this isn't merely a passive investment strategy but potentially a deeper strategic integration.

This treasury strategy essentially transforms SharpLink into a publicly-traded vehicle with significant Ethereum exposure. While the company states it will continue its core business serving sports betting and iGaming industries, this move effectively creates a new investment thesis for the stock as an Ethereum proxy on public markets - similar to how MicroStrategy has become a Bitcoin proxy. The distinction is that SharpLink appears to have attracted significant backing from Ethereum ecosystem insiders, suggesting possible additional strategic developments beyond simply holding ETH in treasury.

SharpLink continues its online performance-based marketing company serving the U.S. sports betting and global iGaming industries

Earlier this month, CoinDesk highlighted the rising demand for the Deribit-listed $300,000 bitcoin BTC$110,024.93 call option, noting it as one of the most popular bullish plays for the all-important June quarter expiry.

Now, this bet has become the most popular in the impending quarterly expiry, reinforcing its appeal as a "lottery ticket" for traders anticipating a bitcoin price rally above $300,000 by the end of the next month.

At press time, the $300,000 call option was the most popular bet in the June 27 expiry, with a notional open interest of over $600 million, up from $484 million three weeks ago, according to data source Deribit. Notional open interest represents the dollar value of the number of active or open contracts at a given time. On Deribit, one options contract represents one BTC.

"The June $300K BTC call options have emerged as the strike with the highest open interest [in June expiry], reflecting aggressive speculative positioning by traders anticipating continued upside," Deribit's Asia Business Development Head Lin Chen told CoinDesk.

"The combination of record-breaking volumes and concentrated options bets signals elevated market confidence—and the potential for heightened volatility ahead," Chen added. 

Deribit's notional options open interest hit a record high of $42.5 billion last week. The momentum is mirrored in the platform's newly launched block RFQ (Request for Quote) system, registering a historic record of nearly $1 billion in daily volume.

A call option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset, BTC, at a predefined price on or before a specific date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market.

The $300,000 call expiring on June 27 represents a bet that bitcoin's price will rise three times from the present $110,000 to over $300,000 by the end of the first half.

The bet sounds outlandish, as the first half will end in roughly four weeks. But that's been the case lately on Deribit, with traders increasingly targeting upside potential through short-term options.

That is evidenced by front-end risk reversals, measuring the demand for calls relative to puts over short-term, being pricier than those with longer maturities.

The chart by Amberdata shows risk reversals are positive across the board, indicating a bias for bullish call options. However, short-duration calls are pricer than longer-duration ones. Usually, the opposite is the case.

The trend indicates a heightened appetite for quick-paced bullish bets among market participants.

"The three-day Bitcoin Conference 2025 is all set to start in Las Vegas today, and so people are speculating on what new bullish announcements will be released at the event," Chen explained.

The growing demand for short-duration calls could be a contrarian signal suggesting that speculative excess is often seen near market tops, according to Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research.

Thielen said the options market is flashing a warning, with the seven-day calls trading at a 10% premium to puts.

"The options market is flashing a warning: Bitcoin's skew, measuring the difference in implied volatility between puts and calls, has dropped to nearly -10%, indicating calls are pricing in significantly more volatility than puts," Thielen said in a note to clients.

"This suggests traders are aggressively chasing upside rather than hedging downside risk. In our experience, such extreme skew levels often reflect peak bullish sentiment, a classic contrarian signal," Thielen added.

A new research paper by Google Quantum AI researcher Craig Gidney shows that breaking widely used RSA encryption may require 20 times fewer quantum resources than previously believed.

The finding did not specifically mention bitcoin BTC$110,024.93 or other cryptocurrencies, but took aim at the encryption methods that form the technical backbone used to secure crypto wallets and, in some cases, transactions.

RSA is a public-key encryption algorithm used to encrypt and decrypt data. It relies on two different but linked keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.

Bitcoin doesn't use RSA, but relies on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). However, ECC can also be broken by Shor's algorithm, a quantum algorithm designed to factor large numbers or solve logarithm problems — which form the heart of public key cryptography.

ECC is a way to lock and unlock digital data using mathematical calculations called curves (which compute only in one direction) instead of big numbers. Think of it as a smaller key that's just as strong as a larger one.

While 256-bit ECC keys are significantly more secure than 2048-bit RSA keys, quantum threats scale nonlinearly, and research like Gidney's compresses the timeline by which such attacks become feasible.

“I estimate that a 2048-bit RSA integer could be factored in under a week by a quantum computer with fewer than one million noisy qubits,” Gidney wrote. This was a stark revision from his 2019 paper, which estimated such a feat would require 20 million qubits and take eight hours.

To be clear: no such machine exists yet. IBM's most powerful quantum processor to date, Condor, clocks in at just over 1,100 qubits, and Google's Sycamore has 53.

Quantum computing leverages the principles of quantum mechanics, using quantum bits or qubits instead of traditional bits.

Unlike bits, which represent either a 0 or a 1, qubits can represent both 0 and 1 simultaneously due to quantum phenomena like superposition and entanglement. This allows quantum computers to perform multiple calculations at once, potentially solving problems that are currently intractable for classical computers.

“This is a 20-fold decrease in the number of qubits from our previous estimate,” Gidney said in a post.A 20x efficiency boost in quantum cost estimation for RSA may reflect algorithmic trends that could eventually apply to ECC too. RSA is still very widely used in TLS, email encryption, and certificate authorities, which are all vital to the infrastructure crypto often piggybacks on.

Researchers, such as the quantum research group Project 11, are actively exploring whether even weakened versions of Bitcoin's encryption can be broken by today's quantum hardware.

The group earlier this year launched a public bounty offering 1 BTC (~$85,000) to anyone able to break tiny ECC key sizes — between 1 and 25 bits — using a quantum computer.

The goal isn't to break Bitcoin today, but to measure how close current systems can be.

A widely followed crypto analyst says that meme asset Dogecoin (DOGE) is facing a crucial turning point while updating his outlook on a handful of other altcoins.

In a new thread, crypto trader Ali Martinez tells his 138,500 followers on the social media platform X that resistance around the $0.26 level is key for the dog-themed digital asset.

The trader shares a chart suggesting that $0.26 is a price area that appears to be a trend shift level for DOGE.

“This level remains the most important resistance wall for Dogecoin.”

Dogecoin is trading for $0.22 at time of writing, a 3.3% decrease during the last 24 hours.

Moving on to smart contract platform Solana (SOL), Martinez says that a breakout past $186 could trigger an exponential rally that sends the asset shooting past a $3,000 price tag.

“A breakout here could trigger a parabolic bull run for Solana!”

Solana is trading for $172 at time of writing, a 2.6% decrease on the day.

Turning his attention to the payments platform Stellar (XLM), Martinez says that it could witness a correction after moving below a diagonal support.

“XLM could be breaking out of an ascending channel, potentially targeting $0.26!”

XLM is trading for $0.28 at time of writing, a 1.5% decrease on the day.

Concluding his analysis with the native asset of the layer-1 platform Toncoin (TON), the analyst notes that it too looks to be on the cusp of breaking down of a symmetrical triangle pattern.

In technical analysis, a move below the diagonal trendline of a triangle pattern suggests that an asset is primed for corrective moves.

“Watch out! Toncoin could be breaking out of a symmetrical triangle.”

TON is trading for $3.00 at time of writing, a fractional increase on the day.

Researchers at the University of Eastern Finland conducted a systematic review of 99 scientific publications that compared the flora or fauna of old-growth forests, managed forests and clearcut sites in boreal Europe. The reviewed studies showed large differences in the species communities inhabiting these forest types.

The studies analysed for the systematic review show that the species richness of full-canopy forests increases as the forest gets older. Clearcut sites are also species-rich, but they are inhabited by a distinct set of species in comparison to full-canopy forests.

The studies had examined several species groups that cover a large part of the flora and fauna inhabiting forests, including birds, epiphytes (i.e., lichens and bryophytes growing on tree trunks), fungi and insects inhabiting deadwood, soil fungi, ground-dwelling invertebrates, other insects and understory vegetation.

Birds, epiphytes and fungi and insects in deadwood were more diverse in older forests. Understory vegetation and insects other than those inhabiting deadwood were more diverse in younger forests, especially clearcut sites. There were few studies on soil fungi.

The flora and fauna characteristic of old-growth forests are associated with old or dead trees. Such species are rare or absent in forests in commercial use.

"In managed forests, trees are cut down before they grow old or die, and thus old and dead trees are scanty in them. Leaving a portion of the trees standing during clearcutting would be an effective solution, but only very few of these so-called retention trees are left in harvests," says Doctoral Researcher Aleksi Nirhamo from the University of Eastern Finland.

Clearcut sites are inhabited by species associated with open habitats and young forests. Conditions on clearcut sites are very different from full-canopy forests, and thus they are inhabited largely by distinct sets of species.

Even though the flora and fauna of clearcut sites are rich in certain species groups, they are degraded habitats.

"Early stages of forest succession would be formed without clearcuts by disturbances such as storms. These kinds of habitats differ from clearcut sites for example by having huge amounts of deadwood that is missing from clearcut sites," Nirhamo points out.

"Additionally, the treeless stage of succession is cut short by the planting of conifers, which also homogenises the tree species composition of the regenerating stand," he continues.

At the moment, there is a great abundance of habitat in the Nordic countries for species inhabiting clearcut sites. For the species of old-growth forests, the situation is worse.

"Forest habitats are modified widely in order to enhance wood production, which homogenises and degrades them," Nirhamo says.

"Especially old and dead trees are abundant and versatile only in forests that have remained unharvested for long, and thus there is little space for species dependent on those resources."

A research team led by Prof. Si-Young Choi from the Department of Materials Science and Engineering and the Department of Semiconductor Engineering at POSTECH (Pohang University of Science and Technology) has discovered ferroelectric phenomena occurring at a subatomic scale in the natural mineral Brownmillerite, in collaboration with Prof. Jae-Kwang Lee's team from Pusan National University as well as Prof. Woo-Seok Choi's team from Sungkyunkwan University. The research was published on May 20 in Nature Materials.

Electronic devices store data in memory units called 'domains,' whose minimum size limits the density of stored information. However, ferroelectric-based memory has been facing challenges in minimizing domain size due to the collective nature of atomic vibrations. The research team found inspiration to overcome these limitations in nature. They focused on Brownmillerite, a naturally occurring mineral characterized by its unique alternating layers of tetrahedral (FeO4) and octahedral (FeO6) iron-oxygen structures, resembling a sandwich with alternating layers of bread and ham.

Strikingly, Brownmillerite exhibits a special phenomenon known as 'phonon decoupling.' Phonons represent atomic vibrations; normally, when atoms vibrate, nearby atoms are also influenced, due to collective vibrations. However, in Brownmillerite, when the tetrahedral layers vibrate, the adjacent octahedral layers remain mostly unaffected. This unique property enables the selective formation of domains within the tetrahedral layers when an electric field is applied.

This phenomenon was confirmed in various types of Brownmillerite, such as thin films of SrFeO2.5 and CaFeO2.5. and a single crystalline CaFeO2.5. Their experiments demonstrated that the electric field influenced only the tetrahedral layers, altering the atomic positions while leaving the octahedral layers unchanged. The team further demonstrated the practicality of this phenomenon by successfully developing ferroelectric capacitors and thin-film transistor devices based on this structure.

If commercialized, this technology is expected to enable the development of memory devices that are tens of times smaller and faster than current models. Consequently, the storage capacity and processing speed of smartphones and computers could be significantly improved, accelerating advancements in high-speed data processing technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomous vehicles.

Prof. Si-Young Choi of POSTECH remarked, "This study exemplifies how wisdom derived from nature can provide critical solutions to technological limitations. Unlocking the secrets of still-unexplained natural phenomena could further enhance the applicability of various advanced technologies."

This research was supported by the Core Facility Center Project (Materials Imaging and Analysis Center), the Researcher Program of the Ministry of Science and ICT, the Nano and Materials Technology Development Program, and the Next-generation Intelligent Semiconductor Technology Development Program.

Metrics details

Reconstructing how prehistoric humans used the products obtained from large cetaceans is challenging, but key to understand the history of early human coastal adaptations. Here we report the multiproxy analysis (ZooMS, radiocarbon, stable isotopes) of worked objects made of whale bone, and unworked whale bone fragments, found at Upper Paleolithic sites (Magdalenian) around the Bay of Biscay. Taxonomic identification using ZooMS reveals at least five species of large whales, expanding the range of known taxa whose products were utilized by humans in this period. Radiocarbon places the use of whale products ca. 20–14 ka cal BP, with a maximum diffusion and diversity at 17.5–16 ka cal BP, making it the oldest evidence of whale-bone working to our knowledge. δ13C and δ15N stable isotope values reflect taxon-specific differences in foraging behavior. The diversity and chronology of these cetacean populations attest to the richness of the marine ecosystem of the Bay of Biscay in the late Paleolithic, broadening our understanding of coastal adaptations at that time.

Whales are the largest living animals on Earth and the current populations of many species are a mere fraction of their abundance in the past1. Before intensive whaling depleted the populations of most species, whales were a valuable source of food and other resources (e.g., oil, bone, baleen2). They were thus a key part of subsistence for many coastal human groups worldwide, including hunter-gatherers and Neolithic farmers, with acquisition methods that included scavenging freshly beached animals, opportunistic killing and organized whaling2,3,4,5,6,7,8. However, reconstructing the beginning of whale utilization is challenging because prehistoric coastal sites are an especially fragile part of the archeological record, many of them having been lost to marine erosion or flooded by the last marine transgressions9. In most cases, the only available evidence is indirect, in the form of materials of coastal origin transported by people into inland sites. In Europe, a number of sites attributed to the Middle and Upper Magdalenian culture (ca. 19-14 ka cal BP, or 19-14 millennia before present, at the end of MIS2) in southwestern France and in Atlantic Iberia have yielded an invaluable record of this type of evidence10: whale barnacles attesting to the transport of whale skin, blubber and meat11; unworked whale bones transported and processed at the habitation site12; worked whale teeth13; and, especially, more than 150 tools and projectile heads made of whale bone presumably of Atlantic origin, mostly found scattered from Asturias to the central part of the northern Pyrenean range14. This record, mostly identified within the last ten years, represents (to our knowledge) the oldest evidence of a regular utilization of whale products by humans, for dietary needs and raw materials10.

Understanding this Magdalenian utilization of whale products is of crucial importance, not only because it opens a window into early human interactions with whales, but more broadly because of the light it sheds onto the history of human coastal adaptations. Indeed, even though the earliest evidence of the use of coastal resources in Europe dates back to the Middle Paleolithic (older than 40 ka cal BP, and up to ca. 150 ka BP15,16,17), and similar evidence exists for the Early Upper Paleolithic18, the richness and diversity of evidence related to seashore exploitation increases dramatically in association with the Magdalenian culture. Despite a sea level rise of ca. 120 m since that period making the Magdalenian shoreline inaccessible to today's archeologists, depictions of marine animals, remains of seals, dolphins, marine fish and birds, the use of marine mollusks as food and the use of their shells as raw material for ornaments, are all attested with unprecedented frequency and wide diffusion in the Middle and Upper Magdalenian, especially in Iberia and in the Pyrenees10,19,20. This combined evidence points to a stronger link with the seashore compared to the earlier part of the European Upper Paleolithic, suggesting the inception of a settled coastal economy in certain parts of Europe at this time. Understanding the role that whale products played in this process is thus key to the ongoing investigations into the existence, chronology and organization of hunter-gatherer early coastal adaptations, a subject that is today considered central in prehistoric research21,22,23. However, the information provided by the whale remains found in Magdalenian assemblages is limited for several reasons. First, it is unknown to which whale species they correspond. Indeed, these remains were identified only through visual macroscopic criteria and most of them are small, fragmented and/or worked, thus precluding any precise anatomical or taxonomic identification beyond the cetacean category. Furthermore, although these morphological criteria are robust, they have a margin of uncertainty, meaning that some of the remains are classified only as “likely” made of cetacean bone14,24. Since different whale species have different ecologies and feeding behavior, this generic (and sometimes uncertain) identification as cetacean gives only low resolution insight into the range of interactions that foragers could have had with these animals, and deprives us of the environmental information that the presence of certain particular whale species could indicate25. Finally, there is substantial uncertainty regarding the dating of these whale remains. Because of their typology, their stratigraphic context, and the characteristics of the archeological assemblages they were found in, they can be attributed to the Magdalenian period in the broad sense of the term. But since the majority are from ancient excavations with poor chrono-stratigraphic resolution, they can only be collectively ascribed to a broad time span of several millennia, precluding a precise reconstruction of the chronology, rhythm and evolution of the utilization of whale products.

Here we analyze a large sample of worked bone objects (n = 83) from 26 Magdalenian cave and rockshelter sites in the Cantabrian region and southwestern France, all visually identified as made of whale bone (Supplementary Data 1 and 2, Supplementary Figs. 1 through 64). We also analyze 90 unworked bone fragments from the single assemblage of Santa Catalina cave (Biscay), also ascribed to whale on a visual basis, found among the faunal remains of the site's Upper Magdalenian occupation and showing traces of anthropic processing (notably percussion notches: Supplementary Figs. 65 through 90). We sampled these for taxonomic identification through collagen peptide mass fingerprinting (ZooMS, or Zooarcheology by Mass Spectrometry26,27). Thirty-seven of the worked objects and 31 of the unworked bone fragments were also sampled for radiocarbon dating using the compact AMS ECHoMICADAS, and for carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis (δ13C and δ15N).

In this work, we assess the range of whale taxa whose products were utilized by the Magdalenian foragers and the chronology of this utilization, showing that these groups availed themselves of the carcasses of at least five species starting ca. 20-19 ka cal BP, with a peak time ca. 17.5-16 ka cal BP. The results of the stable isotope analysis, placed in the context of patterns of isotopic niche partitioning among contemporary whales, contribute to reconstructing whales' relative foraging behavior and past ocean ecology, showing that the distribution of the stable isotope ratios in Paleolithic whales is structured by taxa and overlaps to some extent with those of their modern counterparts, suggesting broadly similar feeding strategies and analogies with today's arctic water communities. Even though the Paleolithic seashore itself is no longer accessible, and the range of taxa identified here might not reflect the full range of species present in the Bay of Biscay at that period, the analysis of these whale bones brought inland by the hunter-gatherers opens a unique window into whale ecology and the marine environments in the northeastern Atlantic at that period, and on the timing and nature of their utilization by human groups.

Of the 173 bone specimens (83 worked objects and 90 bone fragments) analyzed with ZooMS, all but four yielded a taxonomic identification, demonstrating the power of this approach to identify taxa on highly transformed and/or fragmented remains of late Pleistocene age. Of the 83 worked objects, 71 were confirmed as cetaceans, while 8 were identified as large terrestrial mammals and 4 did not yield a ZooMS identification, indicating that the macroscopic visual attribution was correct in 90% of the cases (71/79). The visual misidentification of 8 objects made of bone from large terrestrial mammals was due to their thoroughly porous aspect, normally a diagnostic feature of whale bones, but also present in some anatomical elements of certain terrestrial species (in this case mammoth, rhinoceros, reindeer and equids), and that can be misleading when dealing with small, fragmented objects. Of the 90 unworked bone fragments, the attribution as cetacean was confirmed for 60 bones (67%), with the other 30 being identified mostly as large land mammals, but also one seal. The higher error rate for Santa Catalina (33% vs. 10%) is a consequence of the fact that the visual selection of putative whale-bone fragments was more inclusive at this site (see “Methods” below).

Overall, ZooMS analyses of 131 cetacean specimens reveal the presence of at least six cetacean taxa in the northeastern Atlantic during the Magdalenian (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 3): fin whale, Balaenoptera physalus (n = 65); sperm whale, Physeter macrocephalus (n = 32); gray whale, Eschrichtius robustus (n = 11); blue whale, Balaenoptera musculus (n = 2); one species of porpoise (harbor porpoise or Dall's porpoise, Phocoenidae, n = 1); and at least one species of Balaenid whale (Balaenidae), with 13 samples that can be attributed either to the North Atlantic right whale, Eubalaena glacialis, or to the bowhead whale, Balaena mysticetus (two species that are indistinguishable using ZooMS), both present in the North Atlantic. The remaining 7 samples yielded ZooMS spectra that could not be attributed to a precise cetacean taxon. Among the six cetacean taxa, only the sperm whale had previously been unambiguously documented in the Magdalenian record, through the presence of two carved teeth and several depictions on other portable objects from the Bay of Biscay region28. The other taxa—fin whale, gray whale, blue whale, right and/or bowhead whale and porpoise—had (to our knowledge) previously not been identified in this archeological context.

Of the 37 worked objects sampled for radiocarbon dating, 5 failed as a result of poor collagen preservation, while the remaining 32 yielded results (Fig. 2, and see “Methods” below for calibration and caveats). The two earliest dates are from the Cantabrian sites of Rascaño and El Juyo, ca. 20.2-19.6 and 19.6-19 ka cal BP, respectively. The two artifacts were found among assemblages attributed to the Cantabrian Lower Magdalenian (Rascaño IVb and El Juyo 8), and our results confirm this archeological association.

All circles correspond to worked objects except site 8, which is the assemblage of unworked fragments of whale bone from Santa Catalina. The size of the circles is proportional to the numbers of remains per site, except in Santa Catalina, where all the unworked remains are considered as a single one so as not to overwrite the representation. Bathymetric data are from Natural Earth (www.naturalearthdata.com).

Only four worked objects, from three sites in the western Pyrenees and Cantabria (Duruthy, Isturitz and El Pendo), yielded dates in the 19-17.5 ka cal BP time range. The chronological distribution of the dates then shows a sharp rise to the 17.5-16 ka cal BP time range, with 26 objects from 12 sites (from west to east, 2 from La Paloma, 1 from Las Caldas, 3 from Ermittia, 1 from Urtiaga, 1 from Iruroin, 5 from Isturitz, 1 from Bourrouilla, 2 from Duruthy, 3 from Brassempouy, 2 from Saint-Michel, 3 from Mas d'Azil and 2 from La Vache), accompanied by a wide geographic extension from Asturias (Las Caldas) to the central Pyrenees (La Vache, Le Mas d'Azil) and a maximal diversity of taxa used. The distribution of the dates ends abruptly after ca. 16 ka cal BP.

At Santa Catalina, from the 31 fragments of unworked whale bone sampled for radiocarbon dating, all but one yielded reliable results (Fig. 2). The two fragments attributed to the North Atlantic right whale or bowhead whale (one of which was dated three times) yielded identical 14C dates and might come from a single individual that died ca. 16.5-16 ka cal BP. The 28 other dates are all from fragments of fin whale bone and, with one exception, cluster between ca. 16-14.5 ka cal BP (thus after the 17.5-16 ka cal BP time range that yielded most of the dates on worked objects). The number of acquisition events represented by these 27 dates remains undetermined, and the degree of fragmentation of the bones precludes the calculation of an anatomical Minimum Number of Individuals; but the distribution of the dates appears compatible with a minimum of two individuals, one ca. 15.5 and one ca. 15 ka cal BP. A single date ca. 13.6–13.2 ka cal BP is the only possible evidence of a later episode of bone acquisition on a fin whale individual.

Carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) stable isotope ratios were successfully measured in 55 whale bone samples and ranged from −16.8‰ to −11.6‰ in δ13C ratios and from 9.1‰ to 17.5‰ in δ15N ratios (Fig. 3). In total, 8 samples failed collagen extraction, 2 samples failed IRMS analysis and for 7 samples the atomic C:N ratio was too high (ranging between 3.77 and 6.28) or the N peak was below 700 mV (Supplementary Data 1).

The open circle indicates the position of the one sample where ZooMS failed to distinguish between right/bowhead/fin whale. See Supplementary Data 4, tab “PaleoCet material”, for source data, and Supplementary Data 1 for more details on samples.

The distribution of the stable isotope ratios is structured by taxa: fin whale samples are clustered at low δ15N values and (with one exception) intermediate values of δ13C; the single blue whale sample is nested among the fin whales; right/bowhead whale samples show low δ13C ratios and intermediate values of δ15N; gray whales display high δ13C ratios and intermediate values of δ15N; and sperm whales show elevated values both of δ15N values and δ13C (Table 1). The one sample where ZooMS failed to distinguish between right/bowhead and fin whales—due to the overall poor quality of the spectra and specifically the absence of a clear peptide marker at P2_ɑ2 292—is nested within the fin whale samples, strongly suggesting it might have corresponded to a fin whale (Fig. 3). We found no evidence that these patterns of stable isotopic signatures across taxa are driven by differences in the radiocarbon age of samples: there was no significant relationship between conventional 14C age and the δ13C values (see Methods below, and Supplementary Fig. 98).

A comparison between the stable isotopic signatures of Paleolithic whale samples with modern counterparts shows in most cases an overlap (at least partial) between the two. The large majority of modern samples used for this comparison originate from the same oceanic basin (Atlantic) as our samples, except for gray whale (Pacific) (Supplementary Data 4). Still, on average we found higher δ13C and δ15N ratios in ancient fin whales, higher δ15N ratios in ancient sperm whales, and higher δ13C ratios in bowhead/right whales and in gray whales when compared with modern whales (Supplementary Discussion, and Supplementary Figs. 99 through 102).

A previous study of whale-bone objects from the Cantabrian coast suggested that, according to contextual evidence (both archeological and radiocarbon), the utilization of whale bone might have appeared in this region and in this archeological context ca. 18–17.5 ka cal BP14. Our results confirm this archeological association and the earlier evidence of whale-bone working the Cantabrian region, and push back the chronology of its inception by at least one millennium (with the caveat of radiocarbon dating uncertainty; see Methods below). The whale bones used for tool manufacture do not necessarily come from fresh carcasses, but they are unlikely to have been more than a few decades old, given the hazards of bone preservation in the open air on the seashore29, and given that the low density of cetacean bones30 suggests that they will be particularly susceptible to density-mediated attrition31. Accordingly, at our level of chronological resolution, the date of the material is essentially the same as the date of the bone working activity. Therefore, according to our results, the manufacturing of implements made of whale bone began ca. 20-19 ka cal BP on the southern shores of the Bay of Biscay. Since the visual identification of whale-bone objects from more ancient (Gravettian) archeological contexts remains uncertain32,33, these 20-19 ka cal BP dates represent to our knowledge the oldest evidence for the working of whale bone by hunter-gatherers. They place the inception of this industry at the beginning of the Late Glacial, when the sea level began to rise again after the LGM lowstand34. Between ca. 17.5 and 16 ka cal BP, the amount of archeological evidence increases sharply and the geographic distribution of the objects expands, encompassing an area between Asturias and the central Pyrenees, perhaps with an extension to the north and east of the Aquitaine Basin (given their archeological context, the objects found at La Madeleine, Dordogne, and Courbet, Tarn, might indeed date to the same period35,36,37). This period, which archeologically corresponds to the Middle Magdalenian in the Cantabrian region and the Late Middle Magdalenian in southwest France38, thus appears as the peak time for the production and diffusion of objects made of whale bone. No chronological trend appears regarding the type of objects manufactured or the taxa used, and this period in general can be considered as representing the maximum diffusion and diversity of this whale-bone industry. This is in accordance with other categories of archeological evidence showing the existence of active exchange/diffusion networks between the Cantabrian coast and the central Pyrenees at that time (lithic raw materials, art, and types of tools14).

Most of the objects made of whale bone are weapon elements (projectile points and foreshafts) typologically similar to the antler points that make up a large part of the Magdalenian hunting equipment39. From what can be observed on the finished objects, and on the few pieces of manufacturing waste documented37, the manufacturing techniques used to work whale bone into objects do not differ from those used for working antler. The choice of using whale bone to make one part of the weapon tips might be linked to the dimensions of the raw material, that make it possible to manufacture very long implements, and perhaps the specific mechanical properties of whale bone as compared to antler and to terrestrial bone14,24,40.

The chronological distribution of the whale-bone objects ends abruptly after ca. 16 ka cal BP. The only worked object that might be attributed to a later date is the whale-bone foreshaft from the Upper Magdalenian site of Andernach, in Rhineland—an object that was found to be made of gray whale bone in this study, and that can be attributed to ca. 16–15.5 ka cal BP according to the AMS dates from the context in which it was discovered40. Compared to the rest of the samples, this object is thus both the most geographically outlying and the most recent. Only tentative explanations can be put forth to explain this rarefaction. The period ca. 16–14 ka cal BP corresponds archeologically to the Upper Magdalenian—a cultural phase that, like the preceding one, yielded evidence for the exploitation of a number of coastal resources (such as mollusks10). The acquisition of fin whale carcasses at Santa Catalina after 16 ka cal BP, and the presence of a foreshaft made of gray whale bone at Andernach with contextual dates younger than 16 ka cal BP, both show that hunter-gatherer groups still had access to whale bone at that period. Therefore, the nearly complete lack of evidence for whale-bone working after 16 ka cal BP is not linked to an abandonment of coastal resources, or to a lack of suitable raw material or of technical skill. It could thus be either a purely cultural and technical choice (a disregard for whale bone as a raw material for tool making), or a question of archeological visibility linked to the interruption of the whale-bone diffusion networks. Indeed, since the whale-bone objects were probably manufactured on the seashore14,24, all objects of this type found at inland sites are imports. If the exchange and circulation dynamics that are responsible for the diffusion of these objects ceased to function, the whale-bone objects likely remained at the coastal sites, which are now submerged. There is currently no way to discriminate between those two hypotheses.

The taxa identified in this study provide a picture of the rich biodiversity of cetaceans in the northeastern Atlantic during the Magdalenian period that may have been accessible to hunter-gatherers. With its highly productive waters and complex bathymetry, the Bay of Biscay remains today an area of high diversity and abundance of cetacean species41, but it may have been even more so in the past, given that multiple species were subsequently subject to intensive exploitation1. In addition, the climate in the Bay of Biscay was substantially cooler during the Magdalenian period, with sea ice likely present at least seasonally42, which means that the cetacean community may have more closely resembled that of today's arctic waters. Given the role large cetaceans play in marine ecosystem functionality, these differences in cetacean composition and abundance may have translated into non-negligible effects on local primary productivity, with cascading effects across the broader ecosystem43,44,45.

Fin whales, sperm whales, blue whales and harbor porpoises are still present in the Bay of Biscay today41. Given their wide distribution, including cold waters46, it is not surprising that they were also present during the Magdalenian period, but they may have been more abundant prior to human exploitation1. Our results show that at least one balaenid species was found in the Bay of Biscay at the time, although the imprecision of the ZooMS ID does not allow for a distinction between right and bowhead whales; DNA analysis would be required to verify the species identities for these specimens (analyses which fell outside the scope of this study). Both species were heavily exploited in the western North Atlantic, with right whales now extirpated47 and bowheads nearly so48. Right whales were present in the Bay of Biscay until relatively recent times, where a coastal calving ground formed the basis of a Basque whaling industry from the 11th–18th centuries47. In the cooler Magdalenian waters42, it is more likely that right whales, if present, were using the area as summer feeding grounds. The sea-ice bound bowhead whales could have been a more likely species, with stable isotope data also providing some support in this direction (Supplementary Fig. 101). It is not impossible that both species could have been present, in different seasons.

The case of gray whales is more specific. Gray whales today have a strictly North Pacific distribution: they do not seem to have survived in the North Atlantic after the eighteenth century, having likely disappeared due to whaling despite the circumstances of their disappearance remaining poorly understood7,49. Previous evidence of their past presence in the North Atlantic dates either to the Holocene (10 to 0.25 ka cal BP) or to the middle of the Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS3), before 40 ka cal BP; with the absence of gray whales in the intervening period attributed to a drastic reduction or even extirpation of Atlantic gray whale50,51,52. Furthermore, molecular analyses revealed little genetic continuity between the late Pleistocene and the Holocene populations: most Atlantic Holocene specimens analyzed by Alter et al.50 are genetically closer to Holocene Pacific gray whales than to Pleistocene Atlantic specimens. This led these authors to suggest that the majority of the Atlantic Holocene population were the result of a second colonization event from the Pacific, after warming temperatures, sea-level rise, and decreases in sea ice permitted passage through the Bering Strait50. The 11 artifacts made of bones from gray whales presented here are evidence of the presence of this species in Atlantic waters at the end of MIS2, thus supporting a continuity between the Pleistocene and the Holocene populations.

The stable isotope composition of marine vertebrates is controlled by their diet and habitat preferences53,54 and thus the stable isotope dataset presented in this study sheds light onto past whale ecology. In general, the stable isotopic signatures of Paleolithic whales overlap to some extent with those of their modern counterparts, suggesting broadly similar feeding strategies, while existing differences can be ascribed to variation in stable isotope baseline values, feeding ground locations and possibly trophic level (Supplementary Discussion). As in modern whales, ancient fin whales and blue whale samples have relatively low nitrogen stable isotope ratios in comparison with the other whale samples, consistent with these species' reliance on krill55,56, whereas gray whales display higher δ13C ratios, characteristic for their feeding behavior in benthic environments57, while sperm whales (the only toothed whale species in this dataset) show the most elevated δ15N values, reflecting a diet at a higher trophic level including large squid58 (Fig. 3). The fact that bowhead/right whales (which feed mostly on copepods) have higher δ15N values than fin whales (again, also found in modern whales) is less straightforward to explain, but likely explained by feeding in different water masses, highlighting the complexity of interpreting isotopic signatures (Supplementary Discussion). This said, in most cases the overlap in stable isotope signatures between modern and ancient whale samples is only partial, with ancient whales tending to exhibit higher δ15N and/or δ13C values. These differences may reflect a shift in whale feeding preferences (e.g., if modern whales now target prey at lower trophic levels or warmer waters), large scale temporal changes in the stable isotope baseline59, environmental change, or a combination. Indeed, previous studies found rapid changes in whale feeding behavior (and in corresponding stable isotope signatures) as a result of environmental changes: for example, Jory et al.60 found that a reduction in biomass of artic krill coincided with a dietary niche widening in fin whales in Canadian waters, with 60% of individuals changing their foraging strategy from specialist to generalist feeders in order to reduce intraspecific competition. Given the magnitude of the environmental change from the Late Pleistocene to the present, the changes in whale foraging strategies may well have been even stronger.

The stable isotope analysis complements the ZooMS results in showing a clear differentiation between whale species, and furthermore allowed us to identify as likely fin whale one specimen for which identification through ZooMS was imprecise (Fig. 3). It also suggests a higher likelihood that the Balaenidae samples correspond to bowhead whales rather than right whales (Supplementary Fig. 101) although this is less certain. While the arctic conditions in the region would favor the bowhead hypothesis, the region could similarly have functioned as a northerly feeding ground for right whales. These results highlight the added value of combining multiple analytical methods to maximize the information obtained from archeological records of human-whale interactions2,53.

With the exception of the object from Andernach, all our specimens come from karstic environments (cave and rockshelter sites) with good preservation of osseous material, including small elements. The relative abundance of the different whale taxa in our sample is thus unlikely to be affected by taphonomic factors such as differential preservation of bone tissues. However, these proportions cannot be used to infer the relative frequency of the whale taxa in the past, because they are biased by the anthropic choices of the Magdalenian hunter-gatherers and by our sampling strategy. For example, the scarcity of the harbor porpoise remains might reflect a lower value of the bones of this smaller species for tool manufacture. Conversely, the large proportion of fin whales in our sample is biased by our decision to systematically analyze the whale bones from Santa Catalina, where this taxon dominates.

The taxonomic composition of the whale-bone assemblage gives nonetheless an indication of the way hunter-gatherers acquired the whale resources. The worked objects and unworked bone fragments we analyzed are mainly large cetaceans that predominantly forage offshore or in areas with deep water close to shore like the Bay of Biscay—namely fin whale, sperm whale and blue whale. It is extremely unlikely that these species would have been accessible to hunter-gatherers from the European Pleistocene other than through passive acquisition methods, such as the opportunistic acquisition of natural strandings or drift whales. In addition, the list of identified taxa also includes species whose ecology brings them substantially closer to the coast, namely gray whales, right/bowhead whales and harbor porpoises46. Bowhead whales and gray whales are the large cetaceans with the longest recorded history of active whaling, going back at least three millennia in arctic ecosystems53,61. However, there is no evidence that European Pleistocene hunter-gatherers had the necessary technologies for hunting these species, such as seafaring62, or multibarbed points that could have been used as harpoons heads (barbed points appear in the local archeological record only after 16 ka cal BP39). Overall, then, the archeological evidence points towards an opportunistic acquisition of whale resources in the Bay of Biscay during the Magdalenian period, unlike in more recent periods where this same region became an area of active whaling7,47.

Whales were likely familiar to coastal communities, and as such may well have played an important role in the Magdalenian cultural world. The Bay of Biscay's highly productive waters make it a cetacean hotspot today41, and it was likely already the case during the Pleistocene. Along the Spanish coast in particular, water depth increases dramatically just a few kilometers from the coastline, bringing species that are typically found offshore, such as fin whales63, unusually close. These species could have been observed from high points along the coastline spouting at a distance, and irregularly closer to shore as dead or moribund individuals. The more coastal right/bowhead whales, gray whales and harbor porpoise were likely even better known. Gray whales in particular are the most coastal of the whale species46, spending summer at low-depth high-latitude feeding grounds, then migrate hugging the coastline to warmer lower-latitude calving areas in sheltered low-depth lagoons. Whereas in today's climate the Bay of Biscay and the Mediterranean would more likely correspond to calving grounds, it is possible that during the cooler Upper Paleolithic climate they would have corresponded to feeding grounds49,64—habitat reconstructions indicate that adequate shallow shelf habitat was available there during the last glaciation50. In any case, they would have been conspicuously present at predictable seasons, and they are likely to have been part of the range of animals whose ecology would have been well known to Paleolithic hunter-gatherers.

The whale remains analyzed in this study attest to two different utilization behaviors. The first one is the use of whale bones as raw material for the manufacture of implements; as suggested in previous studies, the choice of this raw material might have been motivated by the large dimensions of these bones, enabling the manufacture of longer implements, and maybe their specific mechanical properties14,24. The two main types of objects manufactured are projectile points and foreshafts, both relating to hunting equipment. Thirty-three projectile points were analyzed with ZooMS, and the results show that the range of species used for their manufacture is varied, with a relative majority of sperm whale (13 of the 31 points whose species could be identified, i.e., 42%; vs. 3-23% for each of the 5 other species identified). For the 11 foreshafts analyzed, the dominance of sperm whale is even more pronounced (8 of 11: 73%). It is uncertain whether this higher frequency compared to the other taxa reflects the relative abundance of sperm whales among stranded individuals or if it testifies to a preference for this species on the part of the Magdalenian carvers. The second hypothesis might be supported by the fact that, among the large cetaceans present in our sample, sperm whales are the only toothed species, displaying a highly characteristic, long, straight, toothed jawbone that may have been considered as a particularly desirable block of raw material. An interest in sperm whale teeth in the Magdalenian is also evidenced by the two carved specimens found at Las Caldas and Mas d'Azil10. Nevertheless, since the precise anatomical parts used for tool-making are so far indeterminate, this supposition remains speculative.

The second utilization behavior, evidenced at Santa Catalina, is the transportation of unworked whale bones to habitation sites. The bones were found in the form of fragments, most of which are too small and fragmented to be identified anatomically; still, some of them can be attributed to ribs and to vertebrae (cf. fragments of vertebral disks), evidencing the presence of portions from the trunk, and several display percussion notches indicating anthropic breakage carried out at or outside the site. The transportation of these elements requires explanation, as the species involved (fin whale and right/bowhead whale) are large, and the site was by then 4-5 km from the coast and 70 m up a steep cliff65. Indeed, bones of large whales are bulky elements, usually abandoned on the spot where the whale is processed rather than carried as riders attached to the meat and blubber. Their use as implements at the site (ribs for building huts, vertebrae as stools or anvils, etc.) is implausible given their degree of fragmentation, and evidence for their use as raw material for toolmaking is very scarce. Only one fragment shows traces of scraping, and most of the elements are very spongy, while the whale-bone objects known from other sites show a denser osseous tissue indicating the use of denser parts of the skeleton. An alternative explanation is their use as bone fuel for hearths. The use of the bones of terrestrial mammals as fuel is frequently documented in Paleolithic contexts66, and activities linked to fire, including bone fuel, are intensive in level III of Santa Catalina (presence of charcoal, hearth-like structures, etc.67). However, at Santa Catalina the whale bones we analyzed are not specifically affected by burning, nor concentrated near the hearths; if the collecting of whale bone at this site has to do with fire, it could only be as a reserve for later use. Alternatively, since living animal whale bones are very rich in fat, these large spongy bones might have been brought to collect the oil by letting them drip, or by crushing them2. This hypothesis would explain the fragmentation of the bones. It is consistent with the strong interest of Paleolithic groups for fat (e.g., the nearly systematic breakage of the bones for marrow68), and with the fact that bone grease rendering is evidenced in the level III of Santa Catalina on the bones of ungulates69.

Finally, although our archeological sample includes only bones and bone objects, their presence shows that hunter-gatherers also had access to other whale resources2. Whale skin, blubber and meat found numerous dietary and technical uses among populations of the past, and the transportation of (at least) whale skin to the habitat was already evidenced among European hunter-gatherers through the discovery of right whale barnacles at the sites of Las Caldas, Nerja and Cueva Victoria11. Furthermore, the identification of several species of mysticetes in our sample proves that Magdalenian hunter-gatherers also had access to baleen plates. The baleen of right and bowhead whales in particular have long been appreciated as a strong and flexible material with many practical uses in several populations2. In this case, the osseous material acts as a proxy for other resources with more rapid rates of degradation.

This study provided a chronological and taxonomic characterization of Late Paleolithic whale-bone industry. Its inception on the southern shores of the Bay of Biscay takes place within a more general trend towards the intensification of the exploitation of coastal resources at that period and in that region. The acquisition of whale products seems limited to the opportunistic utilization of beached or drift whales, but likely included the use of many resources besides bones—including baleen, the availability of which is now demonstrated, and whale oil, as possibly evidenced by the presence of unworked and fragmented bones at Santa Catalina. For this reason, stranding events certainly affected the groups' mobility patterns by acting as attractive spots. In this perspective, although whales might not have been the primary impulse for the increased interest in the seashore during the Magdalenian, their presence undoubtedly contributed to this evolution and strengthened it, as was suggested for other regions70. Furthermore, the taxonomic diversity and chronological depth of the cetacean populations identified in this study—both previously undocumented for this region at this time period—attest to the richness of the marine and coastal ecosystem of the Bay of Biscay at the end of the Paleolithic, showing how much it represented a favorable milieu for human settlement.

The archeological specimens analyzed in this study are curated in 10 museums in France, 7 museums in Spain, 1 museum in the United Kingdom, 1 museum in Germany, and 3 curatorial repositories in France, under the responsibility of the Ministry of Culture, for collections from sites with excavations in progress. The location of each analyzed specimen can be found in Supplementary Data 1. Permission to access, study, borrow or export (when relevant), and sample the specimens was obtained from each institution, curator and/or excavation director following each local procedure (see detailed list in Acknowledgements section).

A total of 185 worked objects visually identified as made of whale bone are known from 31 Magdalenian sites (Supplementary Data 2: 165 objects from previous studies14,24,40,71, plus 20 recently discovered through excavations or the reassessment of ancient collections). Minimally-invasive ZooMS analysis was tested on a subset of the samples, but proved to be unsuccessful (see below). In order to maintain the morphological integrity of the worked bone assemblage, a destructive ZooMS approach was applied to 83 of the 185 objects (i.e., 45%), with samples selected to ensure a representative selection of sites (n = 26) and of the objects' typology (these 83 objects include 3 ZooMS results previously published36,37). In addition, at Santa Catalina, 41 unworked bone fragments had previously (i.e., before this study) been attributed to cetaceans on a visual basis12. In this study, the bone assemblage of Santa Catalina was reassessed and sampled to include all fragments that could potentially be whale bone, even if the morphological identification remained somewhat uncertain. A total of 90 unworked bone fragments from Santa Catalina (the 41 previously identified + 49 new specimens) were subjected to ZooMS analysis, mostly from archeological level III.

Half of the elements whose identification as whale bone was confirmed by ZooMS were subject to additional sampling for radiocarbon dating and stable isotope analysis: 37 of the 71 worked objects (52%), and 31 of the 60 bones from Santa Catalina (52%). The single object identified as made of porpoise bone through ZooMS analysis was a thin fragment of point, and permission was not granted to sample material sufficient for both ZooMS and 14C dating.

Before any sampling, photogrammetry was used to produce a 3D model of each worked object and each unworked bone fragment in its entirety. This was done for conservation reasons, in order to preserve a digital copy of the specimens before they were morphologically altered by the sampling. Each bone selected for sampling was photographed using a Nikon reflex with 40 or 60 mm lens, a portable light tent with different lights to provide diffuse light, and a turntable with markers for metric projection and angular notations. The Adobe® Photoshop® software was used for post-processing (color adjustment and background masking) and the Agisoft® Metashape® software was used for the photogrammetric process. For each artifact, both a dense cloud (for accuracy studies) and a textured mesh (for exports and measurements) were produced.

Depending on the shape of each element, sampling was done either: by cutting a piece from one of the extremities of the bone (using either a Stanley® mini hacksaw or a Dremel® rotary tool); by drilling with a Proxxon® Colt 2 pocket drill; or by coring using homemade diamond-coated core drills, 4–6 mm in diameter, mounted on a Moviluty® Minyflex® rotary tool. On average, 75.7 mg of bone was extracted from each specimen for ZooMS, with no significant difference between the worked objects and the unworked bone fragments. For radiocarbon dating only, the average mass of the sample was 95.3 mg on the worked objects, and 340.6 mg on the unworked fragments from Santa Catalina.

ZooMS was first developed as a destructive analytical technique, requiring ~10–30 mg of bone or bone powder for analysis26. This project aimed to limit the destructive testing of unique, Magdalenian modified bone objects in order to preserve their morphology. As a result, for the bone objects, a minimally-invasive collagen sampling method was attempted which had been developed for analysis of historic parchments72, and which had previously proved successful on ca. 500 years old modified bone objects from Quebec, Canada73. The 90 unworked cetacean bone samples, and 83 modified bone objects, also underwent a destructive ZooMS protocol to achieve accurate taxonomic identifications (see results above). The bone samples were analyzed using the destructive ZooMS methods listed below, based on a modified protocol as described in Buckley et al.26.

The bone objects were gently rubbed with a clean piece of PVC eraser; collagen is transferred from the object to the eraser crumbs through the triboelectric effect72. The collected eraser crumbs from each sample were incubated for four hours at 37 °C in 75 µL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution (NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, AmBic) and 0.4 µg of trypsin. Trypsin activity was terminated using 1 µL of 5% TFA solution, and peptides were purified using C18 ZipTip® pipette tips and eluted with 50 µL of conditioning solution (50% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA). 1 µL of eluted peptides was then spotted onto a Bruker ground steel target plate, to which 1 µL of matrix (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) was added. Each sample was spotted in triplicate along with calibration standards, and run on a Bruker Ultraflex III MALDI-ToF-MS. Triplicate spectra were averaged and analyzed using mMass software74 and compared to a database of known collagen peptide masses (Supplementary Data 3)75,76,77,78.

The minimally-invasive sampling technique proved unsuccessful for the majority of the tested samples. This was likely due to a combination of factors, including cetacean bone morphology and sample contamination. Due to the physical requirements of cetaceans, their bones often take on one of two forms depending on the element—either very dense and highly mineralized, or very porous and friable. Both bone conditions are problematic for minimally-invasive sampling methods as they result in reduced availability of surface collagen. Other studies applying the minimally-invasive eraser method also found limited success compared with destructive approaches73,79,80; as a result, a destructive and/or double extraction was performed on the samples.

Subsamples of bone or bone powder, sometimes several per specimen and ranging from 20 to 70 mg, were demineralized in 250 µL of 0.6 M HCl (4 °C). The acid was removed and samples were rinsed three times in 200 µL of 50 mM AmBic. Samples were incubated in 100 µL of AmBic for one hour at 65 °C to gelatinize the collagen; then 0.4 µg of trypsin was added to 50 µL of supernatant and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Trypsin activity was terminated using 1 µL of 5% TFA solution, and peptides were purified using C18 ZipTip® pipette tips and eluted with 50 µL of conditioning solution. MALDI-TOF-MS was conducted as described above.

Several samples analyzed using the minimally-invasive sampling method returned results that suggested sample contamination, likely as a result of a consolidant that had been added to the specimens post-excavation. This contamination particularly affected specimens from the Saint-Périer excavations (during the 1930's) at the site of Isturitz. While there is no mention in the reports for these excavations of the artifacts having been conserved with any type of consolidant, both minimally-invasive and destructive analyses of a number of these specimens consistently returned collagen identifications of cattle (Bos genus). Upon further inspection of the spectra, peptide markers that appeared to match those of various cetaceans could also be observed, however at a much lower intensity than the cattle fingerprint (Supplementary Fig. 91). This mixed signal in the collagen spectra led us to believe that consolidant contamination was a likely issue, as collagen-based glues made from cattle (and other animals) were known to have been used in conservation practices during the early 1900's.

A double extraction method was developed in an attempt to remove or reduce the signal from the contaminating consolidant (Supplementary Fig. 91)81. In this method, bone or bone powder was immersed in 250 µL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution (NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, AmBic) and placed on a shaker at room temperature for 3 h. Samples were then centrifuged briefly then incubated at 65 °C for one hour to gelatinize. After incubation, the samples were centrifuged for one minute and the AmBic was transferred to a new eppendorf as the first extraction. Subsequently, 250 µL of 0.6 M HCl (4 °C) was added to each of the original eppendorfs containing the bone chips/powder, then vortexed and left to demineralize at room temperature for four hours. The acid was removed and samples were rinsed three times in 200 µL of 50 mM AmBic. 100 µL of AmBic was then added to the samples, followed by incubation for one hour at 65 °C to gelatinize the collagen for the second extraction. Both the first and second extraction underwent digestion, purification and MALDI-TOF-MS analysis as described above. While this modified protocol resulted in lower peptide recovery, it enabled us to enhance the collagen signal from the actual ‘host' animal (in most cases, cetacean collagen peptide markers) while also confirming our suspicions regarding the use of a cattle-based consolidant (Supplementary Fig. 91).

With the exception of 7 samples (Hum-1 to Hum-18) for which collagen extraction was carried out at the EvoAdapta facility and MALDI-TOF-MS analysis at the University of York, all samples were analyzed for ZooMS at the Institute of Environmental Science and Technology (ICTA-UAB) of the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona.

All glassware was cleaned using the following procedure: submerged in Decon 90 at 90 °C and cooled overnight, washed three times with DI water, submerged overnight in 10% HCl, washed three times with Milli-Q. After drying, the glassware was wrapped in aluminum foil to prevent dust contamination during storage and finally baked out in the oven at 450 °C for 5 h.

The bone collagen extraction protocol based on Longin82 followed the following steps: Bone samples were first demineralized in 0.2 M HCl for several days, with mechanical and visual checks. The acid was renewed several times during this step. The samples were then rinsed three times with Milli-Q, submerged for 20 min in 0.1 M NaOH (with new NaOH being added for another 20 min if discoloration appeared), before being rinsed again three times with Milli-Q, submerged into 0.1 M HCl for 10 min, then rinsed again three times with Milli-Q. In the next steps, the samples were gelatinized in weak (pH 3) HCl at 90 °C until dissolution, filtered with glass filter units (mesh size 10–20 μm), frozen with liquid nitrogen and lyophilized in clean (baked out) vials.

As anomalous peaks were observed in FTIR-ATR spectra of several samples, most likely indicating the presence of glue or consolidant, the XAD resin approach was applied to eliminate this type of contamination. This approach was developed by Stafford et al.83,84,85, is also described in van der Sluis et al.86. Lyophilized collagen samples were dissolved in 1 mL of (sub boiling distilled) 6 M HCl in 10 mL borosilicate tubes with PTFE lines caps before being hydrolyzed at 110 °C for 24 h. The hydrolysate was then passed through pre-conditioned XAD columns fitted with a filter frit at the bottom, filled with ±100 μl (circa 1 cm) of XAD 2 resin slurry and covered with the top filter frit. The latter was pushed down in order to remove air bubbles. The columns were then washed with 20 mL of 1 M HCl and preconditioned with 10 mL of 6 M HCl. After the sample hydrolysate had passed through, the column was washed with 1 bed volume of 6 M HCl in order to collect any amino acids in the void space and added to the collected sample. Samples were dried in small open beakers on the hotplate in the fume hood and were rinsed with Milli-Q to remove any leftover HCl by evaporation. The samples were then transferred in 200 μl (7-8 drops) of Milli-Q to combustion tubes using glass Pasteur pipettes, frozen and lyophilized.

Samples were connected to the CO2 extraction line in the radiocarbon laboratory of the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle. After adding 900 mbar pure O2, samples were combusted at 900 °C for a duration of 10 to 20 minutes in the presence of a baked out silver strip (10 mg) to remove contaminants, cleaned on the CO2 extraction line (water trap, NOx oven fitted with copper and silver fiber wool), then volume calculated. The vacuum on the line reached 10-6 mbars. The CO2 gas sample was transferred to a fully-automated H2 reduction line using iron as a catalyst, where the vacuum reached 10-7 mbars.

Samples were run alongside standards of oxalic acid and phthalic acid. Graphite targets were pressed and analyzed on the same day with the ECHo-MICADAS at the Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l'Environnement (LSCE) in Gif-sur-Yvette, France. Data reduction was performed using the BATS software (version 47)87. The first scans were discarded to eliminate possible contamination of the target with ambient atmosphere between target pressing and AMS measurement. Radiocarbon ages were calculated from F14C88, which is corrected for background and isotopic fractionation. Measurement parameters such as 12C current and 13CH current were monitored during 14C measurement. Time, current and isobar corrections were made before validation. For each individual run, normalization, correction for fractionation and background corrections were applied by measuring the oxalic acid II NIST standard, its 13C/12C ratio and the chemical blanks. The standard deviation of the blanks is generally less than 10% but an overestimated 30% is imposed to the blank value in order to take into account a potential variability of the contaminant which could be added during the sample preparation.

Six samples (Hum4, Hum5, Hum8, Hum9, Hum14 and Hum18) were chemically pretreated and prepared at the Higham Lab, University of Vienna, Austria. Sample pretreatment for these samples follows collagen extraction outlined in Brock et al.89. Three samples (Hum9, Hum14 and Hum18) were combusted offline, graphitized using an AGE graphitization unit, and measured at the VERA (Vienna Environmental Research Accelerator) AMS facility, University of Vienna. For details on aspects of target preparation and AMS measurement see Steier et al.90 and Golser & Kutschera91. Three other samples (Hum4, Hum5 and Hum8) were measured at the Keck AMS facility, University of California at Irvine. For details on aspects of target preparation and AMS measurement see Santos et al.92 and Beverly et al.93. These six samples have R-numbers and VERA or UCIAMS numbers instead of MUSE-numbers.

As diagenetic alteration can affect stable isotope values as well as radiocarbon ages, only results from good quality collagen with an atomic C:N ratio between 2.9 and 3.6 ought to be used94. However, studies by van Klinken95 on archeological bones and Guiry and Szpak96 on modern bones have suggested that values outside the 3.0-3.3 range for mammals may result in distorted isotopic compositions due to contamination by non-collagenous carbon. We compared the values for whale species that agree with different atomic C:N ratio ranges (2.9–3.3 and 3.3–3.6) (Supplementary Fig. 96). In these figures there is considerable overlap between samples with an atomic C:N ratio up to 3.3 and 3.6, only the gray whale samples show lower carbon stable isotope values (circa 1‰), although this could also be due to the small sample size. We believe most of the variation visible here is due to individual variation between the whales, rather than diagenetic alteration. Whales are exceptionally large (marine) mammals, thus resulting in a larger variation in stable isotope ratios in their bone collagen due to their longevity and slow bone turnover time. Samples with atomic C:N ratios between 2.9–3.6 were included in the discussion of the stable isotopes results. Additionally, stable isotope analysis was done on collagen, while 14C dating was performed on collagen after XAD resin treatment, which would have removed any, if present, remaining contamination. When examining the 14C ages against atomic C:N ratios from a single site (Santa Catalina) (Supplementary Fig. 97), there is no evidence of a correlation that might indicate contamination.

Dating of marine animals needs to take into account the marine reservoir effect: given that oceans are depleted in 14C in relation to the atmosphere, conventional radiocarbon dates for marine organisms appear older than for coeval terrestrial individuals97. Some studies use sample pairing between coeval terrestrial and marine taxa to aid interpretations of reservoir ages at archeological sites98. This was not possible in our case, because our samples are all from Pleistocene cave and rockshelter sites with complex stratigraphy (in which each excavated layer is the result of an accumulation of multiple occupation episodes) and most of our samples are from ancient excavations with poor stratigraphic resolution. We thus relied on the correction for the reservoir effect implemented for marine samples in OxCal 4.4, which is based on the Marine20 calibration curve99.

In addition, dating of marine organisms can be further refined by taking into account the fact that the marine reservoir effect varies across oceanic masses, being for example stronger (i.e., leading to seemingly older organisms) at higher latitudes and in deeper waters100. This deviation from the standard (globally averaged) marine reservoir effect is expressed as a DeltaR term. In the case of our whale specimens, however, it is not the coastal waters adjacent to the archeological sites that matter, but the water mass (or masses) where whales fed. The whale species identified in this dataset are very diverse in terms of their feeding ground locations and feeding depths. For example, previous studies estimated DeltaR values: between −168 and 504 ± 60 years for sperm whales (that feed in deep waters but can be found in either high latitudes or sub-tropical seas101); at 24 ± 58 years for bowhead whales (that forage in polar/sub-polar waters close to the sea surface102); and about 350 years for a fin whale (a species that forages at depths up to 400 meters and migrates vast distances103). Intra-specific variability in DeltaR values renders it difficult to obtain meaningful values per species. We have not found published estimates of DeltaR for gray whales, but the foraging strategy of this species (which feeds on invertebrates found in shallow sedimentary environments and migrates over very long distances) renders it particularly susceptible to intraspecific variation in DeltaR, especially as it will be dependent on the type of sediment (molluscs feeding on calcareous sediments appear over 2000 years older than suspension-feeding ones104).

In addition to these difficulties, DeltaR values published in the literature from modern (Holocene) whales need to be approached with caution when applied to Pleistocene samples. Indeed, the spatial variation in the reservoir effect of water masses likely varied over time, in response to changes in ocean circulation. The foraging grounds of whales are also likely to have been different, given that in the Late Pleistocene, the study region was substantially cooler. For these reasons, we have opted for not attempting to apply a species-specific DeltaR based on information from modern whales, and instead use a single DeltaR as suitable as possible to the period and region of our samples.

Choosing the most suitable reservoir correction required careful consideration of various parameters. Foote et al.105 used a DeltaR = 0 to correct for the reservoir effect in bowhead whales during the Pleistocene. However, this no longer seems suitable since the update of the Marine20 calibration curve, as there are large fluctuations in pre-Holocene reservoir ages97. Monge Soares et al.106 published a DeltaR = −117 ± 70 yr for the Late Pleistocene based on three samples pairs (shells and bones/charred wood) from the Cantabrian coast. Mangerud et al.107 showed that there is little difference between the DeltaR from whales and mollusks found at the same location. However, since the update of the Marine20 calibration curve, the DeltaR from Monge Soares et al. needs updating as well. Monge Soares et al. used three paired 14C ages for the calculation of their Late Pleistocene DeltaR (terrestrial 14C ages: 15 656 ± 75, 19 710 ± 120 and 23 040 ± 50 yr BP). Considering the ages of our samples, we decided it would be most suitable to use the two youngest paired 14C ages for an updated DeltaR, because the third sample pair was considerably older. These two paired Late Pleistocene 14C dates from Monge Soares et al. were used in the online application108 to calculate updated DeltaR values. These new DeltaR values are statistically the same (0.037 (χ2:0.05 = 3.84)). The weighted mean of these DeltaR and standard deviation are calculated according to: http://calib.org/marine/AverageDeltaR.html, which gives a new Delta R of -448 ± 39 yr. The calibration was done in OxCal 4.4 (Supplementary Figs. 92 through 95, and Supplementary Code 1)99.

Additionally, using all North Atlantic whales (various species) in the Marine Reservoir Correction Database we get a DeltaR of −168 ± 53, compared with the DeltaR of −117 ± 70 from Monge Soares et al. for the Holocene. This means that the latter slightly overestimate the reservoir age, making samples slightly younger. This may not be the case for the Late Pleistocene samples but it does strengthen our idea that the material used for paired dating in this region by Monge Soares et al. is not that far off from whales themselves. However, the DeltaR used here is not optimal for two species in this dataset, namely sperm whales due to their large variation in ΔR (between –168 and 504 ( ± 60) 14C yr101) and gray whales due to feeding in shallow waters where they might ingest calcareous sediment with different 14C ages104.

Heaton et al.100 propose a specific calibration of marine samples from polar regions, essentially calculating a range between a minimum and maximum DeltaR. The minimum is based on the Marine20 curve and the maximum is based on the latitude of the sample and the Large Scale Geostrophic Ocean General Circulation Model (LSG OGCM), which is suggested to use for samples from outside ∼40°S–40°N during glacial periods. Our samples are found between of 43–44 °N, although the whales could of course have been feeding at higher latitudes. However, we do not have the exact location.

We state that our results provide evidence of whale bone working from 20ka BP, which is based on two fin whales. If the absolute max DeltaR would be applied, these 2 fin whales would be between 2000-1500-1000 years younger (Fig. 3 in Heaton et al.100, although there is a substantial variation between 71 °N, 88 °N and 53 degrees °N, and again we do not know where these animals were feeding). It would be more realistic to assume sea ice most likely covered a large part of the North Atlantic waters, extending much further south than it does today. If so, most whales would not have been feeding too far north due to sea ice coverage (unlikely reaching the 71 and 88 °N, except for beluga's and bowheads). Additionally, modern fin whales feed in various locations, have summer and winter feeding grounds, and can also adapt their feeding strategy to minimize interspecific competition, suggesting that the maximum value would not be a realistic assumption. Combining all of these assumptions, it is plausible that the maximum DeltaR was ~800 yr, although its value remains extremely uncertain.

Given that the results we present here reconstruct the chronology of whale acquisition using very broad time slices of 1.5 millennia (Fig. 2), it is unlikely that our conclusions are significantly affected by an uncertainty on DeltaR in the range of a few centuries. It does however mean that caution is needed when interpreting individual radiocarbon dating results. These can be improved in the future as more information becomes available regarding suitable corrections for the marine reservoir effect.

Bone collagen samples (320–380 μg) were weighed into tin capsules (5 × 8 mm) and analyzed with a Thermo Scientific EA Flash 2000 coupled to a Delta V Advantage isotopic mass spectrometer in the Service de Spectrométrie de Masse Isotopique (SSMIM) in the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle, Paris, France. Isotopic values of all samples were measured relative to the laboratory standard alanine, which has a reproducibility of 0.3 wt% for N and 0.6 wt% for C. The δ13C and δ15N values are reported relative to the VPDB and AIR, respectively. Three primary standards were used to calibrate the Alanine for δ15N air: IAEA USGS-25 (ammonium sulfate), IAEA N1 (ammonium sulfate) and IAEA N2 (ammonium sulfate), while one primary standard (from IAEA) was used to calibrate the Alanine for δ13C V-PDB: IAEA 600 (caffeine). Analytical precision is ± 0.2‰ for both δ13C and δ15N values. Five samples were run in duplicate and the difference fell between 0-0.3‰ for δ13C ratios, and 0–0.34‰ for δ15N ratios.

Subsamples (0.2–0.3 mg) of extracted bone collagen from six samples (Hum4, Hum5, Hum8, Hum9, Hum14 and Hum18) were taken for the analysis of isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen by elemental analyzer-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (EA-IRMS; Thermo Scientific EA-Isolink with a Flash 2000 coupled to a Delta V Advantage isotope ratio mass spectrometer) in the Silver Laboratory (Large-Instrument Facility for Advanced Isotope Research) at the Center of Microbiology and Environmental Systems Science of the University of Vienna. Stable isotope values of all samples are measured relative to the laboratory standard alanine, which has a reproducibility of 0.07 wt% for N and 0.1 wt% for C. δ13C and δ15N values are reported relative to the VPDB and AIR standard, respectively, and are measured with an analytical precision of ± 0.1‰ for both δ13C and δ15N values. Acceptable stable isotope ratios have an atomic C:N ratio that falls between 2.9–3.694.

The difference in δ13C ratios between the balaenidae, fin and gray whales suggests these whales were feeding in different bodies of water, which in turn may have affected their radiocarbon ages. To investigate this, we plotted the conventional 14C age against the δ13C ratio from these whale bones (Supplementary Fig. 98). We found no correlation between these two variables (R2 = 8 × 10−5). The ages of the three whale groups studied broadly overlap: balaenidae (right/bowhead whales; n = 8) are dated from 16–16.5ka to 17.1–17.8ka cal BP; fin whales (n = 31) are dated from 13.2–13.5ka to 19.5–20ka cal BP; gray whales (n = 4) are dated from 16.3–16.9ka to 17.4–18ka cal BP.

Metrics details

There is limited evidence supporting the feasibility of using omics and functional technologies to inform treatment decisions. Here we present results from a cohort of 116 melanoma patients in the prospective, multicentric observational Tumor Profiler (TuPro) precision oncology project. Nine independent technologies, mostly at single-cell level, were used to analyze 126 patient samples, generating up to 500 Gb of data per sample (40,000 potential markers) within 4 weeks. Among established and experimental markers, the molecular tumor board selected 54 to inform its treatment recommendations. In 75% of cases, TuPro-based data were judged to be useful in informing recommendations. Patients received either standard of care (SOC) treatments or highly individualized, polybiomarker-driven treatments (beyond SOC). The objective response rate in difficult-to-treat palliative, beyond SOC patients (n = 37) was 38%, with a disease control rate of 54%. Progression-free survival of patients with TuPro-informed therapy decisions was 6.04 months, (95% confidence interval, 3.75–12.06) and 5.35 months (95% confidence interval, 2.89–12.06) in ≥third therapy lines. The proof-of-concept TuPro project demonstrated the feasibility and relevance of omics-based tumor profiling to support data-guided clinical decision-making. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT06463509.

Clinical decision-making in oncology is based on data derived from clinical trials that provide standardized measures of efficacy and safety. These data are evaluated by expert panels and incorporated into clinical practice guidelines of the main medical societies, which define the evidence-based standard of care (SOC) and guide diagnostic and treatment procedures through a process of shared decision-making between physicians and patients1,2. Adhering to these guidelines has been shown to improve survival rates and other outcome measures in patients with cancer3,4,5. In the case of malignant melanoma, prognosis has improved dramatically over the past decades due to implementation of efficacious SOC treatments6,7. However, many melanoma patients experience recurrence or progression of their disease. Evidence-based treatment options for these patients are limited and clinical management presents a major challenge that often falls outside the scope of clinical guidelines.

The advent of reliable and affordable functional and omics technologies, including analyses at single-cell resolution, has rapidly transformed the field of oncology8,9,10,11. Clinical trials and practice guidelines are increasingly incorporating multidimensional data that enable an unprecedented characterization of molecular drivers and therapeutic vulnerabilities specific to the individual patient's cancer, paving the way for personalized precision treatments12,13. Moreover, omics-based patient data can guide enrollment of patients in suitable clinical trials14. To integrate molecular and functional data into clinical decision-making, institutional and national multidisciplinary molecular tumor boards (MTBs) have been established15. Previously, we and others have reported on the development of pipelines that enable the use of molecular data by MTBs10,16,17. Despite the promise of precision medicine, there is limited evidence supporting feasibility and utility of using multiomics and single-cell technologies to guide selection of treatments for patients with cancer.

The Tumor Profiler (TuPro) project is a multicentric, prospective, nonrandomized observational project designed to assess the relevance of functional, single-cell and bulk omics readouts to MTB decisions18. The goal of the TuPro project is to inform both guideline-based decision-making for patients in the SOC setting, and data-driven decision-making to provide information on the status of additional, potentially relevant biomarkers beyond SOC. Here we present the outcomes for 116 melanoma patients enrolled in the TuPro project.

A fast diagnostic loop was implemented, enabling an overall turnaround time of 4 weeks from biopsy to reporting in the MTB with single-cell genomics (scDNA-seq)19 and transcriptomics (scRNA-seq)20, targeted proteomics (imaging mass cytometry (IMC)21, cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF)22), proteotyping (using data-independent acquisition (DIA)23,24,25), drug phenotyping (Pharmacoscopy11,26, iterative indirect immunofluorescence imaging (4iDRP)27), targeted next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) and digital pathology (DigiPath). The selection of these technologies was based on their capability to provide a comprehensive molecular portrait of each tumor with potential clinical relevance. As a result, up to 500 Gb of data were generated and evaluated for each sample, corresponding to over 40,000 potential markers for therapy decisions. The molecular data were integrated with additional clinical and diagnostic information available for each patient during the MTB evaluation. Markers used for treatment recommendations, administered therapies, objective responses and outcomes were captured and analyzed within the project framework.

A total of 116 patients with any subtype of melanoma participated in the project, contributing 126 biopsies (including ten longitudinal samples) (Fig. 1). The enrollment period spanned 21 months from January 2019 to November 2020. The demographical, clinical and pathological features of eligible patients were recorded in a good-clinical-practice-compliant database (Extended Data Table 1). Among all biopsy specimens, 62% were obtained from patients who had been treated with at least one therapeutic regime; 43% of these patients had undergone two or more lines of treatment (Extended Data Table 1). Biopsies from ten patients were used for the project ramp-up phase, whereas 106 underwent the analysis and the discussion at the MTB (Fig. 1). Thirteen patients were excluded from further analysis; of those, seven transitioned to best supportive care (BSC) due to deteriorating clinical condition and six early-stage patients opted against the recommended therapy in the adjuvant setting. The remaining 93 patients (103 biopsy samples, 99 treatment lines) were subject to the analysis in this paper and correspond to the TuPro application population. Cases were discussed at the MTB, including guideline-based treatment options, as well as molecular and functional profiles obtained through tumor profiling, according to three patient groups:

a, Project description showing principal aspects for feasibility testing, patient populations included and information utilization. b, CONSORT flow diagram of the TuPro project. A total of 116 patients were included in the TuPro melanoma project. Part I included ten patients to establish the TuPro workflow and analysis/reporting pipeline. Part II included the remaining 106 patients in the diagnostic cohort. Thirteen patients either received BSC (n = 7) or did not receive adjuvant treatment based on shared decision-making (n = 6). The remaining 93 patients formed the TuPro application cohort, which was categorized into three groups: (1) adjuvant therapy, (2) SOC palliative therapy and (3) palliative therapy beyond SOC. In both palliative SOC and beyond SOC groups, more than one sample was evaluated for four patients. Two additional patients are both in the SOC and beyond SOC at different treatment lines. Illustrations in a created using BioRender.com.

Group 1—adjuvant setting: 13 patients with early-stage disease who underwent adjuvant treatment. These patients were administered targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy for BRAF-mutant tumors or immunotherapy involving anti-PD1 agents. One patient received anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD1 antibodies in the framework of an interventional trial.

Group 2—palliative SOC: 45 patients with metastatic disease who received palliative SOC therapy. These treatment regimens included immunotherapy, targeted therapy, talimogene laherparepvec and chemotherapy.

Group 3—palliative beyond SOC (henceforth referred to as beyond SOC): 37 patients with metastatic disease who underwent palliative treatments beyond SOC. These interventions comprised participation in interventional trials during any time of disease course, or the application of individualized treatments (that is, off-label drug use, or the off-label reintroduction of approved therapies following confirmed progression upon initial treatment with these agents).

The median follow-up time was 20.5 months (range 0.6–46.5 months). As of 31 May 2023, 62.4% (58 of 93) of the patients had died due to melanoma or nonmelanoma related events.

The successful integration of high-throughput analytical technologies into routine clinical practice requires a turnaround time that aligns with clinical decision-making. To meet this need, the TuPro project established a fast diagnostic loop workflow (Fig. 2a). The workflow mandates that each technology platform delivers a comprehensive sample-specific report for discussion at the pre-tumor board (pre-TB, see below) and subsequently at the MTB, which takes place within 4 weeks of biopsy. For each sample, data were generated and analyzed through a previously described process and information technology pipeline developed specifically for the TuPro project18. The data were discussed by a pre-TB expert panel and translated into marker-based treatment recommendations that were summarized in a molecular summary report (MSR). The MSR was communicated to the MTB, along with the supporting clinical and molecular data (Fig. 2a). The MTB then provided a formal treatment recommendation for the patient. Due to limitations of fresh tissue sample abundance or quality, predefined sample access priorities were assigned to individual technologies and sample processing within clinical routine practice (Fig. 2b,c). Technologies performing measurements on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue prepared for routine diagnostics (for example, IMC, NGS), were generally unaffected by limited sample abundance. IMC, targeted NGS and DigiPath received the most samples (n = 103), followed by CyTOF (n = 102), Pharmacoscopy (n = 91) and 4iDRP, (n = 79). scRNA-seq, scDNA-seq and proteotyping each received 68 samples. Most technology nodes successfully analyzed and reported results on the received samples if they passed node-specific quality requirements (Fig. 2b). Out of all samples (n = 103), 41 were analyzed successfully by all nine nodes (Fig. 2c). Considering each datapoint, over 40,000 measurements were assessed per sample as potential markers, of which 544 were analyzed using targeted technologies (Supplementary Table M1). Overall, the TuPro framework successfully established a robust multiomics and functional analysis pipeline that yielded rich individual tumor profiles, providing additional and timely insights for clinical decision-making.

a, The TuPro workflow consists of a sample acquisition and processing phase, followed by an analysis and reporting phase, with a turnaround time of ≤4 weeks. The analysis phase involved nine technological nodes, although not all samples were analyzed by each node. Data processing integrated the outputs from different technologies and enabled the generation of the MSR, which encapsulates the essential findings and actionable insights for clinicians and researchers. b, Number of samples (n = 103) analyzed per technology node (n = 9) within the fast diagnostic loop (4-week turnaround time). Given limited sample material in some cases, the assays were prioritized as indicated by color. c, UpSet plot showing the number of samples analyzed by one or more technology nodes (n = 9). d, Concordance (percentage in light blue) between the recommendations agreed upon by the MTB and those inferred from information provided by diagnostic levels level 1 (detailed clinical data, routine molecular testing data in melanoma (BRAF, NRAS and c-KIT mutations) and DigiPath data), level 2 (level 1 plus large panel NGS), or level 3 (all TuPro technology nodes, n = 9), and fraction of actual TuPro-driven therapy decisions (i.e., ≥50% of the applied drugs are supported by markers measured by TuPro). Illustrations in a created using BioRender.com.

Marker data provided in the MSR was condensed into diagnostic levels that build on each other to facilitate accessibility (Methods): level 1 incorporated detailed clinical data, routine molecular testing data plus routine pathology and DigiPath data. Level 2 additionally included results of a broad targeted NGS panel. Level 3 included level 2 data, and data provided by the seven TuPro technology nodes. Final MTB recommendations were in line with data provided by levels 1, 2 and 3 in 36%, 42% and 75% of samples, respectively. The lower percentage of MTB agreement with level 1 and 2 results mainly from a frequent lack of identifying new options for targeted therapy with standard technologies. The percentage of TuPro-driven actual treatments administered to patients (that is, treatments decided by patients and their physicians after MTB recommendations, with ≥50% of the applied drugs supported by markers measured by TuPro) reached 87% (Fig. 2d). In summary, whereas the addition of extended targeted NGS (level 2) to standard clinical workup provided only a modest impact to the MTB, functional and multiomics TuPro data (level 3) provided substantial added value to clinical decision-making compared to current diagnostic standards (NGS and DigiPath). This is reflected by the increased concordance of TuPro-informed recommendations with those of the MTB by 39% (compared to diagnostic level 1) and 33% (compared to diagnostic level 2) of cases, respectively (Fig. 2d).

Out of all available measurements, the pre-TB and the MTB participants decided on those deemed to be most useful to inform decisions. For actual treatment decisions (that is, treatments prescribed by the treating physician and supported by TuPro measurements), a total of 54 individual markers (recorded as part of the pre-TB discussions) were used (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 1a). These 54 markers correspond to 399 individual, validated measurements, including assessment of the same target by different technologies (for example, pERK level was measured by IMC, CyTOF and 4iDRP). The distribution of individual measurements that informed treatment decisions was as follows: adjuvant setting, 50 marker measurements in 13 of 13 samples (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c); palliative SOC group, 153 marker measurements in 38 of 49 samples (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 1d) and beyond SOC group, 196 marker measurements in 39 of 41 samples (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 1e). For the remaining 13 samples, no treatments driven by markers measured with TuPro technologies were administered to the patients. The average number of markers used for individual TuPro-based treatment recommendations was four in both the adjuvant and the palliative SOC cohort, and five in the beyond SOC cohort. Markers used for decision-making in the MTB with a cutoff at >2% amongst all patients, along with the specific technologies used for their assessment, are shown in Fig. 3a. The markers that most often informed the TuPro recommendations in the adjuvant setting (n = 13) were TMB (n = 9, 69%), T cell infiltration (n = 7, 54%), HLA-ABC (n = 5, 38%) and PD-L1 (n = 3, 23%) (Extended Data Fig. 1b). In the palliative SOC group (n = 39), the markers adopted most frequently were TMB (n = 15, 38%), BRAF mutations (n = 14 samples, 36%), HLA-ABC (n = 13, 33%), PD-L1 (n = 12, 31%), pERK (n = 11, 28%), T cell infiltration (n = 10, 26%), PD1 expression (n = 5, 13%) and proliferation (n = 4, 10%) (Fig. 3b). In the beyond SOC group (n = 39) they were pERK (n = 18, 46%), HLA-ABC (n = 14, 36%), TMB (n = 11, 28%), T cell infiltration (n = 9, 23%), PD-L1 (n = 8, 21%), proliferation, apoptosis, BRAF and KIT alterations (n = 7, 18% each) (Fig. 3c). Whereas DNA alterations (for example, TMB, mutations in RAS, KIT and BRAF) included United States Food and Drug Administration-recognized biomarkers (according to OncoKB12) measurable via level 2 diagnostics, the TuPro diagnostic level 3 provided markers additional to genetic markers (for example, phosphorylation, expression and drug response). Together, these findings show that multiomics marker data generated via TuPro technologies were readily accepted and implemented by the study physicians. In all three groups, both established as well as experimental markers were considered for clinical decision-making.

Data on the technology node used to measure each marker, the cohort and class of treatment received (chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy) are provided. b, Markers (n = 26) used for treatment decision-making in the palliative SOC cohort. c, Markers (n = 44) used for treatment decision-making in the beyond SOC cohort.

An important question was whether similar results can be achieved with a smaller subset of technologies and markers, resulting in significantly lower profiling costs. In many instances, one marker can be measured by several technologies. A small subset of these technologies could cover all markers relevant to most patients. We performed an analysis considering all possible subsets of technologies, taking into account assumed equivalences between markers from different technologies (Supplementary Table M2a–c). For each patient, we recorded markers deemed relevant for treatment recommendations per cohort (adjuvant, SOC, beyond SOC), assuming the same recommendations would be made if all relevant markers were available. Extended Data Fig. 2 shows the number of samples (y axis) that had all relevant markers available for a specific combination of technologies. The x axis shows the cumulative cost for the combination of technologies. A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed considering all possible subsets of technologies and the fraction of patients likely to have had the same treatment recommendation (Extended Data Fig. 2a–c). Of note, only Pharmacoscopy and 4iDRP provide information for several treatment conditions, whereas the other technologies provide information only for untreated samples. We found that information provided by three technologies (NGS, Pharmacoscopy, IMC) (adjuvant and palliative SOC) and four technologies (NGS, Pharmacoscopy, IMC, scRNA-seq) (beyond SOC) would cover all markers used for pre-TB treatment recommendation (Extended Data Fig. 2a–c). This would reduce the cost per samples to 4,602 Swiss francs in the adjuvant and palliative SOC cohort, or 7,336 Swiss francs in the beyond SOC. These costs are 1.15-fold higher than the clinical-setting costs for standard NGS analysis (up to 4,000 Swiss francs in Switzerland) for adjuvant or palliative SOC, and 1.8-fold higher for beyond SOC setting.

During the project period, approximately 180 Swissmedic-approved anti-cancer agents and 20 investigational drugs within 25 active trials in the participating centers were available. The TuPro workflow generated 510 treatment recommendations (including several recommendations per patient) encompassing 76 individual drugs. In the adjuvant group, 13 of 13 patients (100%) received treatment supported by markers measured with TuPro technologies. Three different systemic therapy regimens were administered (Fig. 4a). After a median observation time of 37.7 months, eight patients remained in remission and five patients had relapsed. In the palliative SOC group, 45 patients received 47 treatments considered SOC (two patients were serially biopsied and received two different treatments) (Fig. 4b). In 38 of 49 samples analyzed (77.5%), patients received a treatment supported by markers measured with TuPro technologies, and six different approved systemic treatment regimens were administered (Fig. 4b). The top three recommended treatment options were: (1) combination immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) (anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD1 antibodies), (2) TKI combination therapy (BRAF/MEK inhibitors) and (3) chemotherapy (Fig. 4b)1. In the beyond SOC group, 37 patients received 39 treatments (two patients received serial samplings and two sequential but different treatment recommendations), either through participation in an interventional clinical trial or through off-label use of approved oncological drugs. In 39 of 41 samples analyzed, (95%) treatment decisions were informed by TuPro (Fig. 4c and Table 1). Recommendations were highly individualized and 22 different therapy regimens were used for patients in the beyond SOC group. Excluding treatment recommendations based exclusively on SOC diagnostics, TuPro level 3 data informed clinical decision-making in 9 of 13 samples from patients in the adjuvant (69.2%), 30 of 49 samples of patients in the palliative SOC (61.2%) and 35 of 41 samples of patients in the palliative beyond SOC setting (85.3%).

Violin plots: solid lines, median; dotted lines, first (upper) and third (lower) quartiles. e,f, Alluvial plots showing the association between types of treatment received, line in which the treatment was received and disease control rate for the palliative SOC (e) and beyond SOC (f) groups. Brackets indicate at three or more treatment lines and disease control rate. g,h, Swimmers plots showing PFS and best response to treatment for palliative SOC (g) and beyond SOC (h) groups. Two patients serially received two different treatments; another two patients received serial samplings resulting in the same treatments.

Ten patients had serial biopsies (two per patient). Two of these patients did not receive TuPro-informed recommendation and were excluded from the analysis (Supplementary Table M3). Of the remaining eight patients, two received different treatment recommendation in the SOC cohort (patient 2 and 3), one in the beyond SOC cohort (patient 6) and one patient received different recommendations leading to a switch in cohort classification (patient 1) (Supplementary Table M3 and Extended Data Fig. 3). In summary, a total of four out of eight (50%) patients with serial biopsies included in the analysis received different treatment recommendations.

For patients in the palliative SOC group, the objective response rate (ORR) was 60% and the disease control rate, which included those with complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD), was 62% (Fig. 4d). The median number of previous therapy lines in the palliative SOC group was one, ranging from zero to five; in the beyond SOC group, it was two, ranging from zero to six (Fig. 4d). With a median follow-up of 17.5 months, the median duration of response was 6.5 months, ranging from 0.6 to 46.5 months. For patients in the beyond SOC group, the ORR was 38% and the disease control rate was 54% (Fig. 4d). With a median follow-up period of 16.9 months, the median duration of response was 4.8 months, ranging from 0.2 to 46.4 months (Fig. 4g,h). Analysis of disease control rate for each treatment showed that both palliative SOC and beyond SOC groups benefited from treatments administered in third and further lines (Fig. 4e,f) (brackets indicate at least three lines of treatment and disease control rate).

The palliative SOC and beyond SOC TuPro participants (n = 86 lines of treatment) achieved a combined disease control rate (CR, PR or SD) of 61.0% (50 of 82, 4 not evaluable) (Fig. 5a). For the subgroups of patients who had already received at least three treatment lines, the disease control rate reached 56.8% (21 of 37) (Fig. 5b). Survival analysis showed a median progression-free survival (PFS) for patients in the palliative (both SOC and beyond SOC) of 6.04 months, (95% confidence interval (CI), 3.75–12.06) (Fig. 5c) and of 5.35 months (95% CI, 2.89–12.06) for subjects who were given at least three lines of treatment (n = 37) (Fig. 5d).

To further evaluate clinical benefit of the TuPro diagnostic pipeline, we retrospectively, in an exploratory way, compared outcomes of patients in the TuPro melanoma cohort with patients with melanoma from the same centers and period who were not part of the TuPro project (non-TuPro patients) (Extended Data Figs. 4 and 5, Extended Data Table 1 and Extended Data Table 2). To minimize potential bias, we performed a combined exact (treatment line, intention of treatment, clinical stage, brain metastases status) and propensity score matching (Methods), which resulted in comparable subgroups of 12 adjuvant treatments, 59 palliative treatments and 17 treatments with at least three treatment lines for TuPro and non-TuPro patients each (Supplementary Figure M1 and Extended Data Table 2).

The matched analysis of adjuvant patients (n = 12 matched treatments) showed no significant differences in relapse-free survival (RFS) (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.46 (95% CI, 0.06–3.32) (Extended Data Fig. 4 and Extended Data Table 2). For the matched palliative groups (n = 59 matched treatments), median PFS in TuPro subjects reached 9.59 months (95% CI, 3.75–17.74) and 3.55 months (95% CI, 2.56–9.17) for non-TuPro subjects (adjusted HR of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.43–1.42), adjusted P = 0.4156) (Extended Data Fig. 5g). Within these matched groups, the disease control rate was 63.6% (35 of 55, 4 not evaluable) in the TuPro cohort compared to 51.7% (30 of 58, 1 not evaluable) in the non-TuPro cohort (Extended Data Fig. 5c). For subjects who had received at least three treatment lines (n = 17 matched treatments) the median PFS in the TuPro cohort was 8.34 months (95% CI, 2.76–NR) compared to 2.0 months (95% CI, 1.08–3.06) in the non-TuPro cohort (adjusted HR of 0.23 (95% CI, 0.07–0.79), adjusted P = 0.0201) and a disease control rate of 64.7% (11 of 17) compared to 23.5% (4 of 17) (Extended Data Fig. 5d,h and Extended Data Table 2). Overall, our exploratory analysis suggests an added value for heavily pretreated patients.

The TuPro project is a pioneering, prospective, multicohort precision oncology project, integrating cutting-edge technologies for the detailed and comprehensive investigation of tumor biopsies at an unprecedented level18. Here we report several clinical-translational endpoints of the project. First, we successfully generated high-quality molecular datasets from melanoma tumor biopsies using two standard (DigiPath and NGS) and seven experimental, mostly single-cell, high-throughput technologies (Pharmacoscopy, 4iDRP, IMC, CyTOF, proteotyping, scRNA-seq and scDNA-seq), which offer distinct and complementary perspectives on tumor biology. Second, we achieved a clinically meaningful turnaround time from sample acquisition to analysis and recommendation to the MTB of 4 weeks. This fast diagnostic loop supports the notion that incorporation of multiomics technologies into clinical oncology is feasible. Third, we successfully established a data-to-treatment pipeline that presented actionable insights gained from multimodal analysis to the MTB, facilitating actual clinical decision-making. Notably, the integration of MTBs into clinical decision-making correlates with improvements in various outcome measures28. Nevertheless, randomized controlled trials that formally assess these results need to be conducted in the future.

The treatment landscape for advanced melanoma has changed considerably over the past decade. The introduction of ICIs targeting PD1, CTLA-4 and LAG-3, as well as therapies addressing dysregulated and oncogenic MAPK pathway alterations (for example, BRAF and MEK mutations), has led to an unprecedented improvement in overall survival. Landmark clinical trials have demonstrated in first line striking ORRs of up to 58% and 68% for ICIs29,30 and BRAF and MEK inhibitors31, respectively. The 60% ORR observed in the TuPro palliative SOC group of first and further line patients compares favorably with published data. Notably, BRAF class I mutations currently are the only predictive biomarker used to determine eligibility for targeted therapy options1,2. However, single biomarker strategies have limitations, which are reflected by (1) a considerable number of patients with poor responses; (2) several negative high-profile clinical trials employing this strategy7,32,33; (3) genotype-matched trials (for example, MatchMel, SHIVA, MOSCATO, IMPACT/COMPACT) resulting in low target-drug matching rates (5–30%) or limited availability of interventional trials, and overall poor outcomes (ORR, 11–19%)34,35,36,37,38,39, and (4) single genetic alterations capturing only a fraction of the vastly complex biology of tumors. Both the successes and limitations outlined above form a strong rational for an expanded biomarker and/or assay panel to enable an in-depth mechanism-based therapy prediction for individual patients.

The TuPro project integrated various layers of molecular and cellular information, encompassing phosphorylation, cell–cell interactions, characteristics of the tumor microenvironment, inflammatory/immune markers, and ex vivo drug response. These factors are anticipated to play an important role in advanced and personalized predictive decision-making processes40,41,42. In the beyond SOC group, individual therapy recommendations were generated based on a larger number of individual markers compared to the palliative SOC group (average five versus four, respectively). For both groups of patients, this multimarker approach resulted in clinical meaningful responses in 38% of patients beyond SOC compared to 60% in the palliative SOC group. Although markers used to inform clinical decision-making within the TuPro project are biased toward known mechanisms and available drugs, the swift adoption of the expanded marker panel shows that clinicians rapidly acquire confidence in new readouts to support therapy. The project incorporated drugs that are not traditionally used in clinical care for melanoma patients. Therefore, the response rates in the beyond SOC TuPro cohort compare favorably when viewed from the perspective of other tumor-agnostic or phase I/II clinical trials, where substantial variations in ORR rates of 2–53% and median PFS of 5–7 months have been observed43,44,45,46.

Our analysis comparing the TuPro cohort with a synchronous non-TuPro melanoma cohort suggests that omics-guided treatments, such as in the TuPro project, result in comparable or better outcomes in terms of disease control rates and PFS, thus providing a rationale to further explore the analysis of -omics data as a means of therapy prediction in patients with melanoma. These data advocate that the expanded marker assessment via multiomics and functional technologies may contribute to address an unmet clinical need for difficult-to-treat patient populations. The ever-expanding range of therapeutic options necessitates a comprehensive understanding of tumor biology and individual patient characteristics. The TuPro project is uniquely positioned to achieve both immediate patient benefits and biological discoveries at the cohort level, which are currently under investigation.

We recognize several limitations of the analyses described and opportunities to improve future study designs. The current approach of selecting markers for treatment decisions by human experts cannot capture all potentially relevant information. The poor response in several patients treated with individualized therapies may reflect this shortcoming. The advent and rapid evolution of artificial intelligence and machine learning methods will probably need to be leveraged to translate the extensive complexity of TuPro datasets into enhanced clinical benefit. Further process optimization and efficacy improvements will facilitate the full implementation of all available technologies. Interpretations regarding clinical utility of serial biopsies are limited by heterogenous results and small sample size. The retrospective comparison of TuPro and non-TuPro patient limits extrapolation and generalizability. Although we attempted to provide comparable results using matched cohorts, the project was first and foremost a feasibility study. One main goal was to identify patients with melanoma most likely to benefit from extended TuPro analysis. To this end, patient inclusion was broad, leading to a heterogenous population. Benefit was seen mostly in the beyond SOC cohort in patients failing several lines of treatment. Given key uncertainties (patients who are most likely to benefit, expected effect size, technology performance, feasibility of clinical translation of findings by the MTB) a randomized trial would not have been feasible at the time the project was designed. Clearly blinded, randomized trials are needed to confirm our findings in a next step.

Based on our calculations, the per patient cost of analysis in the beyond SOC setting is above the current coverage limits by health insurance for a NGS panel (up to 4,000 Swiss francs in Switzerland) yet only exceeds this limit by a factor of 1.8 when using a limited number of technologies that would possibly deliver the same answers. In addition, we demonstrate that at costs comparable to those covered by insurance (4602 Swiss francs), we were able to successfully profile 38 out of 39 patients (97%) within the SOC setting. The current cost estimates fall within a range that allows for evaluation of potential benefits through a randomized trial. In conclusion, TuPro has successfully pioneered the integration of predictive polymarker assessment with marker-driven, highly individualized treatments, demonstrating the feasibility of complex and comprehensive data-driven approaches to improve patient care.

TuPro was conducted as a multicentric precision oncology project according to the Swiss Act and Ordinance on Human Research (HFG and HFV) with approval of, and in compliance with, regulatory authorities (ethics committees of northwestern Switzerland, EKNZ, and of Zurich, KEK). Adult patients diagnosed with any subtype of melanoma, both treatment-naive and those treated either in the adjuvant or palliative setting were eligible for inclusion. The project was conducted at the Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Zurich, at the Department of Oncology, University Hospital Basel and at the Department of Oncology and Hematology, Kantonsspital Baselland, Switzerland, from January 2019 until November 2020 (EC-ID, 2018-02050, 2021-01584) in accordance with the applicable legal and institutional standards. The project was registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT06463509). For each specific (single agent or combined) off-label treatment, regardless of whether the Tumor Board decision was based on routine patient data or the MSR, the project allowed inclusion of up to five patients. If the same off-label treatment was proposed to a sixth patient, the patient had to be referred to an interventional trial. Due to the diversity of tumor board recommendations, the number of more than five identical off-label treatments was not reached in the cohort we report here. Treatments were not given as part of the study. Separate consents were required for any selected treatment regimens. All decisions regarding treatment regimens were made by the treating physician and, although it could be influenced by the TuPro data, the final treatment selection for each patient was at the sole discretion of the treating physician based on their experience and expertise. The demographical, clinical and pathological features of eligible patients, including age range, sex, melanoma subtype, stage (according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer, eighth edition), together with previous treatments and treatments after biopsy collection, were obtained from our institutional database (Klinikinformationssystem (KISIM)) and entered in the good-clinical-practice-compliant database secuTrial v.6.1.2.5, 2021 (Extended Data Table 1). Sex- and gender-based analyses were not conducted due to the small sample size and the feasibility-focused nature of the study, which did not include sex- or gender-specific stratification. Eligible female and male patients (n = 116), age range 20–89 years, underwent tissue biopsies as part of their diagnostic workup. Leftover tissue samples from routine diagnostics were used in this study, with participants providing project-specific written informed consent. Participants did not receive compensation for their involvement in the study. Experienced pathologists evaluated the biopsy samples for viability and tumor cell content (requiring a minimum of 20% viable tumor cells). Samples meeting these quality criteria were further processed in a central laboratory and underwent paraffin embedding or single-cell dissociation. On average, 2,000,000 viable single tumor cells per sample were recovered. Samples were transferred to the following analytical platforms (referred to as technology nodes) for further processing and analysis: CyTOF22, IMC21, scRNA-seq20, scDNA-seq19, mass spectrometry proteotyping23,24,25, Pharmacoscopy11,26 or 4iDRP27. To establish technical feasibility, robustness, and reproducibility of sample and data handling logistics, ten (n = 10) samples were initially analyzed and results were not discussed at the MTB. The remaining samples (n = 116) were analyzed within the TuPro framework and were reported to the MTB via an MSR.

As a feasibility project, outcomes were broadly defined as follows:

Feasibility outcomes: types of molecular information and combinations of molecular information from the biotechnology domain that the pre-TB considers as useful for making a treatment recommendation beyond routine diagnostics (including routine pathology and panel NGS testing).

Classification of proposed treatment options based on TuPro measurements: (a) on-label treatment with molecular matched treatment (label of the Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products, SwissMedic, as a reference) ± radiotherapy or chemotherapy; (b) treatment with classical chemotherapy ± radiotherapy (on label if label available); (c) referral to a suitable clinical trial; (d) off-label treatment (SwissMedic label as a reference) with molecular matched treatment or immunotherapy ± radiotherapy or chemotherapy; (e) off-label treatment (authorization in countries with comparable approval and control systems for medicinal products as defined by SwissMedic) with molecular matched treatment or immunotherapy ± radiotherapy or chemotherapy; (f) immunotherapy; (g) no active anti-tumor treatment (BSC).

Clinical outcomes: (a) best response to treatment, assessed radiologically after treatment initiation, classified according to RECIST criteria; (b) PFS as the duration in months between the date of treatment initiation (first medication intake) and the date of the first radiologically confirmed progression, if progression occurred.

The TuPro protocol is available upon request to the Tumor Profiler Center (TPC) (nicola.miglino@usz.ch). To comply with applicable laws and regulations (the Swiss Human Research Act), all deidentified clinical data relevant to this publication are provided as supporting information to the paper. Access to the patient-level clinical and biological data presented at the MTBs will be granted to registered users listed on the data access agreement with the TPC within 4 weeks of receipt of the Data Access Agreement, provided that the applicant submits all necessary ethics committee approvals and supporting documents needed to meet the requirements of the agreement. Data access can be requested by contacting the TPC (nicola.miglino@usz.ch). The user institution agrees to destroy or discard the data once it is no longer used for the project, and in cases where data must be archived, they must be deleted within 10 years of the project's completion. If data have not been archived, they must be deleted no later than 2 years following the completion of the project. An extension to this period can be provided upon request to the TPC leadership. Data sharing is subject to honoring patient privacy and data integrity.

The readouts obtained from the clinical standard technologies and the TuPro experimental technologies generated up to 500 Gb of data for each tumor sample. The goal was to analyze and summarize this vast amount of data in a clinically meaningful manner. We aimed to identify datapoints that were valuable for decision-making and determine the necessary steps to ensure the usability and reliability of therapy predictions to enhance patient outcomes. To this end, detailed discussions between members from various technology nodes, data scientists, molecular pathologists and clinicians in the pre-TB condensed this information into the MSR. The report summarized all drugs recommended by NGS, Pharmacoscopy or 4iDRP, plus the supporting or counter-indicating evidence from the other technologies (CyTOF, IMC, scRNA-seq, scDNA-seq, proteotyping, DigiPath). Recommendations were based on associations between drugs and markers, including drug–gene, drug–signaling and drug–immune environment pairs. These associations were supported by varying levels of evidence (for example, OncoKB, clinical guidelines, preclinical evidence). For instance, response to MEK inhibitors (for example, trametinib) was associated with mutated NRAS, BRAF, GNAQ/GNA11, NF1 and/or an activated MAPK pathway, indicated by pERK. ICIs (for example, nivolumab) response was linked to HLA expression, an inflammatory tumor phenotype and checkpoint expression. The TuPro protocol did not stipulate how the MSR should be used by the MTB. However, clinicians adhered to available and applicable guidelines such as from the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), which included recommendations on off-label medication use and the regulatory standards for patient allocation to clinical projects or trials.

To assess the additional value of TuPro data in conjunction with standard technologies such as NGS and digital pathology, a stepwise evaluation process at the pre-TB was established. Level 1 included detailed clinical information, patient history, genetic tumor data (BRAF, NRAS, c-KIT) and insights from DigiPath. For level 2, the results of a large NGS panel of 324 genes (FoundationOne CDx) were incorporated into the assessment of level 1. Level 2 was considered the most comprehensive SOC evaluation at the time for patients with advanced melanoma. Level 3 additionally implemented data provided by the seven experimental TuPro technology nodes (CyTOF, IMC, scRNA-seq, scDNA-seq, proteotyping, Pharmacoscopy, 4iDRP). Findings for level 3 were summarized by the TuPro reporting and clinical teams within the framework of the pre-TB. Only medications approved by SwissMedic (on or off label, around 180 at the time of the project) or drugs under investigation in clinical trials at one of the TuPro centers (n = 20) were considered. The complete MSR for each participant was communicated to the MTB to inform treatment recommendations.

The assessment of clinical usefulness for each marker and technology was carried out in the TuPro application cohort (n = 93 patients and 99 lines of therapy) (Fig. 1). This population consists of patients who were discussed in both pre-TB and MTB, had all levels of treatment recommendations recorded, received anti-cancer treatment and had available outcome assessments. The TuPro application cohort was categorized into three groups: (1) adjuvant therapy (decision between two standards, TKI therapy for BRAF-mutant tumors versus immunotherapy, and one trial-associated therapy, anti-CTLA-4 + anti-PD1), (2) palliative therapy within the SOC (that is, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, talimogene laherparepvec, chemotherapy) and (3) palliative therapy beyond the SOC (interventional trials, off-label use, or off-label reintroduction of approved therapies after confirmed progression upon treatment with these agents). Two patients were sequentially included first in the SOC and later in the beyond SOC group. Of note, in this diagnostic proof-of-concept project, patients were not preselected to allow for TuPro-directed treatment, that is, there was no inclusion criterion regarding life expectancy.

Treatment decisions were considered TuPro-driven if ≥50% of the drugs administered were selected based on markers reported by a TuPro technology node15. This also applied to patients who were already undergoing treatment, when alterations reported by TuPro technologies confirmed ≥50% of the drugs in the ongoing treatment regimen.

The costs for multiomics profiling were assessed as marginal costs of production, that is, the cost of one additional analysis on an otherwise fully funded analysis platform running at full capacity. The market price was used for the cost of the NGS genomic marker test. For experimental technologies, costs were assessed using Swiss research prices (Swiss Personalized Oncology program costs, DigiPath) accounting for personnel costs (analysis time and full-time-equivalent salary costs) as well as costs of reagents.

All patients receiving therapy in the TuPro project underwent regular assessments following standard operating procedures at the participating institutions. Response assessment was conducted every 2–3 months using medical imaging scored via RECIST v.1.1 criteria. Full patient follow-up extended for the duration of the project and an additional 6 months after the project's conclusion. PFS was calculated from the date of therapy initiation to documented disease progression or until the last follow-up for nonprogressed patients with a cutoff date on 31 May 2023. Clinical endpoints were defined in the project protocol and included the number of cases in which the MTB deemed the MSR useful, number of cases in which treating physicians found the MTB recommendations beneficial, specific information (markers) considered relevant by the MTB for treatment recommendations beyond routine diagnostics (DigiPath, NGS), classification of proposed treatment options (in-label, off-label, trial, BSC or no therapy), ORR (which included CR and PR), disease control rate (CR, PR, SD), duration of response, time to next therapy or BSC and the proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to toxicity.

In an exploratory, retrospective analysis, outcomes in the TuPro cohort were compared to those of melanoma patients who were not recruited into TuPro but received diagnostic assessment and subsequent systemic therapy at the TuPro centers over a comparable period (1 February 2019 to 1 July 2021) (Extended Data Figs. 4 and 5, Extended Data Table 2 and Supplementary Table M4). The comparison cohort included 141 patients followed until 31 May 2023, who received 216 therapies (6 neoadjuvant, 75 adjuvant, 96 palliative SOC, 39 beyond SOC). In addition to comparing unmatched RFS, PFS and response rates, a matched analysis was performed to establish comparable subgroups and reduce bias.

The TuPro treatments were matched (1:1) to the non-TuPro treatments using a genetic matching algorithm (MatchIt package47) without replacement with propensity scores estimated with a multivariate logistic regression model including the following pretreatment variables: Charlson Comorbidity index, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score (0–5), histologic subtype, lactate dehydrogenase levels at baseline, tumor mutational burden and pathogenic mutational status of BRAF (yes/no). Treatments with missing matching variables were excluded before the matching (n = 14 non-TuPro treatments). To optimize cohort comparability, we combined propensity score matching with exact matching for all palliative comparisons with the following variables: clinical stage (I–IV), intention of treatment (SOC, beyond SOC), treatment line (1–8) and presence of brain metastases (yes/no). In the adjuvant group, exact matching was performed based solely on clinical stage, as treatment intention, treatment line and brain metastases are not applicable in this setting. This led to 59 palliative treatments matched (leaving 27 TuPro and 76 non-TuPro treatments unmatched), 17 palliative at least three treatment lines matched (leaving 20 TuPro and 9 non-TuPro treatments unmatched) and 12 adjuvant treatments matched (leaving 1 TuPro and 63 non-TuPro treatments unmatched).

Unadjusted rates and adjusted odds ratios were calculated for the binary outcome of either disease control (CR, PR, SD) or progression (PD). Mixed-effects adjusted logistic regression models were used to explore the association between disease control and TuPro participation. The models for the unmatched analysis included the following variables as covariates: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (binary variable, ≥2), lactate dehydrogenase at baseline, presence of brain metastases (yes/no), age, clinical stage (III or IV), intention of treatment (adjuvant, SOC, beyond SOC) and treatment line (< or ≥ third line). In the subanalysis of treatments for subjects treated with three or more lines of therapy, the treatment line and clinical stage was excluded as a covariate. In the models for the matched cohorts, the propensity score served as a covariate. Median RFS and PFS were estimated using a Cox model with frailty to account for patients receiving several treatments. A mixed-effects Cox proportional-hazards regression model was used to calculate adjusted HRs and P values comparing RFS and PFS between TuPro versus non-TuPro treatments with random effects accounting for patients with several included treatments. The unmatched analysis utilized the same covariates as the corresponding best treatment response models, and the matched analysis included the propensity score as a covariate. In the unmatched adjuvant analysis, presence of brain metastases, intention of treatment and treatment line were excluded as covariates. The proportional hazard assumption was tested with the Schoenfeld residual test, for which variables with a P value > 0.05, were considered to fulfill the assumption. All analyses tested the null hypothesis using a two-sided 0.05 significance level and included 95% CI calculations. R (R Core Team, v.4.4.1) was used for all statistical analyses.

The x-axis shows the marginal costs in Swiss francs (CHF) of production, representing the cost of one additional analysis using a combination of technology nodes running at full capacity. The y-axis shows the number of patients that would have all relevant information available with the corresponding subset of technologies when compared to using all technologies. The labels on each data node indicate the individual technology nodes and combined cost per sample. Each dot corresponds to a different combination of technologies associated with a total cost for that combination. Only the best combinations are shown, as other combinations have a higher cost or a smaller number of samples with available relevant information. This analysis provides a better understanding of the cost-effectiveness of various diagnostic approaches and the trade-offs between the generated information and associated expenses.

Metrics details

The multicancer early detection (MCED) test has the potential to enhance current cancer-screening methods. We evaluated a new MCED test that analyzes plasma cell-free DNA using genetic- and fragmentomics-based features from whole-genome sequencing. The present study included an internal validation cohort of 3,021 patients with cancer and 3,370 noncancer controls, and an independent cohort of 677 patients with cancer and 687 noncancer individuals. The results demonstrated an overall sensitivity of 87.4%, specificity of 97.8% and tissue-of-origin prediction accuracy of 82.4% in the independent validation cohort. Preliminary results from a prospective study of 3,724 asymptomatic participants showed a sensitivity of 53.5% (predominantly early stage cancers) and specificity of 98.1%. These findings indicate that the MCED test has strong potential to improve early cancer detection and support clinical decision-making.

Metrics details

Microglia play a key role in the response to amyloid beta in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this context, the major transcriptional response of microglia is the upregulation of APOE, the strongest late-onset AD risk gene. Of its three isoforms, APOE2 is thought to be protective, while APOE4 increases AD risk. We hypothesised that the isoforms change gene regulatory patterns that link back to biological function by shaping microglial transcriptomic and chromatin landscapes. We use RNA- and ATAC-sequencing to profile gene expression and chromatin accessibility of human microglia xenotransplantated into the brains of male APPNL-G-F mice. We identify widespread transcriptomic and epigenomic differences which are dependent on APOE genotype and are corroborated across the profiling assays. Our results indicate that impaired microglial proliferation, migration and immune responses may contribute to the increased risk for late-onset AD in APOE4 carriers, while increased phagocytic capabilities and DNA-binding of the vitamin D receptor in APOE2 microglia may contribute to the isoform's protective role.

Microglia are key players implicated in the genetic susceptibility and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD genetic risk predominantly falls within regulatory regions of the genome, including those marked by H3K27ac1, an epigenetic modification found at active enhancers and promoters2. H3K27ac is dysregulated in the brains of individuals with AD3,4, and microglial H3K27ac regions are strongly enriched for AD genetic risk5,6. Microglia have also been associated with AD risk in their open chromatin regions7,8,9,10, and at the level of their transcriptome11,12,13. Recent research using single-cell transcriptomics has highlighted that microglia occur in various distinct subtypes and activation states, which are anticipated to exhibit different epigenomic and transcriptomic responses dependent on their environmental niche. This variation is expected to give rise to different downstream effects on AD pathogenesis. Supporting this is the continued characterisation of different microglial phenotypes in AD, including those responsive to amyloid beta (Aβ) aggregates, a pathological hallmark of AD14,15,16.

In mouse models, the strongest transcriptional response of microglia to Aβ aggregates is the upregulation of the gene APOE14,17,18, which harbours the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD. APOE is involved in regulating cholesterol and other lipid transport across cells19. In the periphery, it is produced by macrophages in the liver, while in the brain, it is primarily produced by astrocytes19. In humans, APOE has uniquely evolved into three different isoforms encoded by the alleles: APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4. In AD, APOE2 is thought to be protective, while APOE4 increases disease risk up to 12-fold in homozygous individuals of certain human populations20. Several studies have begun to explore the role of microglial APOE in AD, using different samples and methodologies. In mouse models of AD, mice expressing the APOE4 isoform exhibit a higher abundance of microglia stress and inflammatory markers, a phenotype also observed in human tissue15. Furthermore, APOE4 microglia are linked to dysregulated lipid metabolism21,22, followed by tau phosphorylation22. Regarding immune responses, APOE4 microglia induce the signalling of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), a multifunctional cytokine23. Clearly, APOE plays a critical role in regulating microglia in response to AD pathology. Thus far, studies have predominantly focused on APOE4, but it is equally important to determine the role of APOE2, which may potentially be antagonistic. We hypothesised that different APOE isoforms would differentially regulate the microglial phenotype in response to Aβ pathology. However, the unique evolution of APOE in humans makes it difficult to faithfully recapitulate its effects on AD risk and pathogenesis in mouse models. As previously suggested, investigating the microglial response in human tissue is challenging due to technical limitations and inconsistencies in biological findings24.

To tackle these challenges, researchers have developed a human microglia xenotransplantation model25,26, in which iPSC-derived human microglia are xenografted into the brains of mice. Single-cell profiling of these microglia has identified known and novel amyloid-responsive states27. These microglial states were enriched for different subsets of AD genetic risk genes, highlighting that multiple microglial states are influenced by AD genetic susceptibility. In addition, shift into what is thought to be a protective and human-specific microglial state was impaired in APOE4 microglia16. In addition to demonstrating the usefulness of this model in disentangling the microglial response to Aβ pathology, this highlights the need to investigate the functional role of AD genetic risk factors in a cell type-specific manner.

Here, we used ATAC-seq and RNA-seq to profile human microglia expressing the different APOE isoforms, which were xenotransplanted into the AppNL-G-F mouse model of AD. This enabled us to delineate the effects of the different APOE isoforms on the epigenomic and transcriptomic landscapes of microglia in AD.

We transplanted iPSC-derived human microglia APOE2/0, APOE3/0, APOE4/0 and an APOE knockout (APOE-KO) into the brains of the AppNL-G-F mouse model of Alzheimer's disease28. At 12 months, by which point Aβ pathology is extensive18,28, microglia were isolated by FACS using human microglia-specific antibodies (CD11b + hCD45+, Fig. 1a). This approach results in a scenario where the manipulations of the APOE genotype are restricted to microglia, thereby allowing us to study microglia-autonomous effects of the isoforms. To characterise the epigenomic and transcriptomic landscapes of these microglia, they were profiled using ATAC-seq for open chromatin and RNA-seq for gene expression, respectively. After quality control and pre-processing, we obtained high-quality chromatin accessibility data across 16 mice (APOE2 = 5, APOE3 = 5, APOE4 = 4, APOE-KO = 2; Supplementary Data 1, Supplementary Fig. 1) and high-quality transcriptomic data across 17 mice (APOE2 = 5, APOE3 = 4, APOE4 = 5, APOE-KO = 3; Supplementary Data 1, Supplementary Fig. 1). Overall, we observed widespread differences in gene expression and chromatin accessibility across microglia of the different APOE isoforms, highlighting the complexity of the microglial response to Aβ pathology. In support of the opposing roles of APOE2 and APOE4 in AD risk, the greatest differences were observed between these isoforms.

a Experimental design for xenotransplantation of iPSC-derived human microglia into the brains of AppNL-G-F mice, followed by ATAC-seq (APOE2 = 5, APOE3 = 5, E4 = 4, APOE-KO = 2) and RNA-seq (APOE2 = 5, APOE3 = 4, APOE4 = 5, APOE-KO = 3). Created in BioRender. Marzi, S. (2025) https://BioRender.com/1awx14m. b Boxplot of expression profiles of APOE, confirming the knockout for 3 out of 5 APOE-KO samples. The two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to calculate p-values. The central mark and edges indicate the 50th (median), 25th and 75th percentiles. Whiskers correspond to 1.5 * the interquartile range (IQR). c Genome tracks showing chromatin accessibility signals of all APOE alleles around the APOE locus. d Stacked barplot of the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs; FDR < 0.05) identified through pairwise comparisons across the experimental groups. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

APOE expression was significantly lower in three out of five knockout samples (Supplementary Fig. 2), and only these were used in downstream analyses (Fig. 1b). Additionally, APOE expression was lower in the APOE4 microglia compared to APOE2 and APOE3. This is in agreement with previous studies investigating the APOE alleles in microglia and astrocytes29,30. Chromatin accessibility around the transcriptional start site (TSS) of APOE was consistent across the APOE groups (Fig. 1c). As the most commonly expressed allele20, we used APOE3 as the baseline for pairwise comparisons in the differential expression and chromatin accessibility analyses performed using DESeq231. In addition, we compared the microglia expressing APOE4 with those expressing APOE2. When compared to APOE3 microglia, differential expression analysis revealed 470 (282 up, 188 down, (FDR < 0.05); Figs. 1d, 2a, Supplementary Data 2) and 332 (170 up, 158 down, (FDR < 0.05); Figs. 1d, 2b, Supplementary Data 2) differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in APOE2 and APOE4, respectively. As expected, given their postulated opposing roles in AD risk, the direct comparison of APOE4 with APOE2 revealed the most differences, with 1639 DEGs (751 up, 888 down, (FDR < 0.05; Figs. 1d, 2c, Supplementary Data 2). 126 genes were upregulated and 206 were downregulated in the APOE-KO when compared with the APOE3 isoform (Supplementary Fig. 3, Supplementary Data 2).

Comparison with the APOE-KO enabled us to infer whether the transcriptional mechanisms underlying APOE2 and APOE4 microglia can be explained by loss and/or gain of function. We used Rank-Rank Hypergeometric Overlap (RRHO) to quantify the degree of overlap between expression signatures in the APOE-KO vs APOE3 and APOE2 vs APOE3, and the APOE-KO vs APOE3 and APOE4 vs APOE3. We observed significant overlap between expression patterns in the APOE-KO and APOE2 comparison (Spearman's rank correlation, rho = 0.55, p < 2.2e−16; Fig. 2d), as well as for the APOE-KO and APOE4 variants (Spearman's rank correlation, rho = 0.34, p < 2.2e−16; Fig. 2e). The strongest overlap was seen for genes downregulated in both APOE2 and APOE4, suggesting that the mechanisms underlying the different APOE isoforms can be in part explained by a loss of APOE function. However, there were also unique transcriptional changes occurring in APOE2 and APOE4 microglia (Fig. 2d, e). This corroborates findings reported by Machlovi et al.32 in which the authors performed similar analyses investigating the APOE4 and APOE3 isoforms in mouse microglia. To further explore the overlaps with the APOE-KO, we correlated the genes that had similar expression profiles in APOE2 and the APOE-KO, and APOE4 and the APOE-KO, when compared to the APOE3 allele. All genes that had the same direction of expression change in APOE2 and the APOE-KO, also had the same direction of expression change in APOE4, when compared with APOE3 (Fig. 2f). A few genes were only significant in either APOE2 or APOE4, including TSPAN13, which was upregulated in APOE4 microglia and is associated with lipid accumulation in microglia22,33. Due to the pleiotropic nature of APOE, we evaluated whether genes differentially expressed across the APOE groups exhibited differential enrichment for AD genetic risk variants. Using MAGMA gene set analysis34, we found that genes downregulated in the APOE4 and APOE-KO microglia were enriched for risk variants identified in one AD GWAS35 (FDR < 0.05; Fig. 2g, Supplementary Data 3). This supports previous evidence suggesting that the mechanisms of APOE4 reflect a loss-of-function in the context of AD16,23,36, with APOE4 affecting biological pathways that are consistent with those linked to the polygenic component of AD.

To evaluate the upstream regulatory mechanisms associated with the transcriptomic changes across the APOE isoforms, we next investigated changes in chromatin accessibility. When compared to APOE3 microglia, APOE2 microglia had 40 differentially accessible regions (DARs) (24 up, 16 down, FDR < 0.05; Fig. 3a, Supplementary Data 4), APOE4 microglia had 50 DARs (38 up, 12 down, FDR < 0.05; Fig. 3b, Supplementary Data 4). Again, the direct comparison of APOE4 with APOE2 revealed the most differences, with 72 DARs (52 up, 20 down, FDR < 0.05; Supplementary Fig. 4a, Supplementary Data 4), with the fewest changes observed in the KO (14 up, 8 down, FDR < 0.05; Supplementary Fig. 4b). Notably, our analysis revealed consistent epigenomic and transcriptomic responses across microglia expressing the different APOE isoforms (Supplementary Fig. 5). For instance, CHCHD2, a mitochondrial gene involved in promoting cellular migration37 and implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD)38,39, was significantly downregulated in APOE4 microglia when compared to both APOE3 (logFC = –7.8, p = 1.3e−11; Figs. 2b, 3c, Supplementary Data 2) and APOE2 (logFC = –7.4, p = 7.8e−11; Figs. 2c, 3c, Supplementary Data 2). In parallel, chromatin accessibility was significantly reduced close to the TSS of this gene when compared to APOE3 (logFC = −7.8, p = 1.2e−7, distance to TSS = 0; Fig. 3b, d, Supplementary Data 4) and APOE2 (logFC = −6.5, p = 8.3e−9, distance to TSS = 0; Supplementary Fig. 4a, Supplementary Data 4). Expression of this gene was also significantly reduced in the APOE-KO, suggesting a potential loss of protective function via this gene in the APOE4 microglia (Supplementary Fig. 3). Similarly, the zinc finger protein ZNF248 was upregulated in APOE4 microglia (APOE4 vs APOE3, logFC = 9, p = 5.1e−14; APOE4 vs APOE2, logFC = 7.9, p = 5.2e−19; Supplementary Data 2) and genomic regions in the vicinity of this gene had increased chromatin accessibility (APOE4 vs APOE3, logFC = 6.3, p = 2.3e−5; APOE4 vs APOE2, logFC = 6.6, p = 3.2e−5; Supplementary Data 4). Interestingly, in an in vitro study investigating functional and transcriptional phenotypes of a TREM2 mutant and knockout in iPSC-derived microglia-like cells, ZNF248 was upregulated in the TREM2-KO, while CHCHD2 expression was reduced in the R47H mutant40. For an overall assessment of the concordance between ATAC-seq and RNA-seq, we correlated the logFC values between DEGs and DARs at the corresponding promoter peaks. We observed a strong correlation across all APOE comparisons, indicating general concordance between changes in chromatin and gene expression (Supplementary Fig. 6). Microglia-specific regulatory regions originating from human samples are strongly enriched for AD genetic risk5,6,10,41. To evaluate whether human iPSC-derived microglia xenotransplanted into the mouse brain would recapitulate this enrichment we used stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression (s-LDSC)42 with AD GWAS43. We found that open chromatin regions from the xenotransplanted microglia were enriched for AD heritability (FDR < 0.05, Fig. 3e, Supplementary Data 5). As the xenotransplanted microglia are predominantly responding to Aβ in our model, this enrichment also suggests that a significant proportion of AD risk is associated with microglial reactions to this pathological hallmark44. By repeating the analysis using GWAS data for autism spectrum disorder45 and amytrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)46, we confirmed that this enrichment was specific to AD, and not a general brain disease enrichment (Fig. 3e, Supplementary Data 5).

Human microglia from the xenotransplantation model used here were previously profiled using single-cell RNA sequencing27. Mancuso et al. (2024) report eight microglial states responsive to Aβ pathology, including previously characterised disease-associated microglia (DAM), as well as novel states annotated as cytokine response (CRM) and antigen-presenting response (HLA) microglia. Using hypergeometric testing, we found that genes dysregulated across the microglia with different APOE isoforms were strongly enriched within several microglia clusters (Fig. 4a): The strongest association was observed for genes downregulated in APOE4 microglia, which were enriched in the HLA, ribosomal microglia (RM), and DAM clusters (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, genes downregulated in APOE4 microglia were enriched in the DAM cluster associated with negative regulation of tumour necrosis (TNF) cytokine production (Fig. 4b). Since negative regulation of cytokine production refers to processes that inhibit cytokine production, the downregulation of these genes in APOE4 microglia suggests increased cytokine production in this isoform, which was confirmed in the gene expression data (Fig. 4c–f). CRM microglia mount a pro-inflammatory response driven by the upregulation of chemokines and cytokines, and have only been characterised in human16. Mancuso and colleagues16 showed that in response to Aβ, APOE4 microglia shift to the CRM state rather than HLA. In agreement, Machlovi et al. (2022) report increased cytokine production in APOE4 microglia. Conversely, where the authors found increased TNFα in APOE4 microglia, TNF family members, including TNFRSF25 and TNFRSF21, were upregulated in APOE2 microglia in our study. Taken together with the decreased HLA and DAM response in APOE4 microglia here, these findings suggest that APOE4 microglia fail to transition towards microglial states that are thought to be protective14,16 (Fig. 4a).

We used weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA)47 to identify microglial gene modules with similar expression profiles (Fig. 5a). These modules were then tested for differential expression across the APOE groups, and the differentially expressed modules were functionally characterised using pathway enrichment analysis. We identified two differentially expressed modules significantly associated with GO biological processes. First, a gene module upregulated in APOE2 microglia when compared to both APOE3 and APOE4 was associated with proliferation and cellular migration pathways (Fig. 5b, c, Supplementary Data 6). Such pathways are likely important for microglia being recruited towards the site of Aβ pathology and initiating its clearance, which in some cases, requires APOE48. Second, a module upregulated in APOE2 when compared to APOE4 was significantly associated with a range of immune responses, including both innate immune responses such as complement activation, and adaptive immune responses such as antibody-mediated immunity (Fig. 5d, e, Supplementary Data 6).

Previous studies have linked the APOE2 isoform to enhanced phagocytic capabilities49,50,51. Using a recently generated scRNA-seq dataset from phagocytic microglia associated with Aβ plaques52, genes upregulated in APOE2-expressing microglia when compared to both APOE3 and APOE4, were exclusively overrepresented in a set of genes upregulated in phagocytic microglia (Fig. 6a). To functionally validate this finding, we performed phagocytosis assays using iPSC-derived human microglia using pHrodo E. coli particles and fluorescent myelin. As hypothesised, APOE2-expressing microglia internalised significantly higher amounts of pHrodo E. coli compared to all other APOE groups (Fig. 6b, c, Supplementary Fig. 7). Additionally, a significantly higher proportion of APOE2-expressing microglia successfully took up myelin compared to APOE4-expressing microglia (Fig. 6d, e), as reported previously51. We also observed that APOE-KO microglia displayed very high amounts of intracellular myelin. This could indicate an impairment to digest the phagocytosed material, and is in line with previous studies showing lipid accumulation in ApoE−/− mouse microglia in models of demyelination53. Overall, the enrichment of proliferation, migration, phagocytosis, and immune responses suggests enhanced microglial function in APOE2.

To better understand the regulatory machinery of human microglia in Alzheimer's disease and the upstream orchestrators of altered transcriptional states, we performed de novo motif enrichment analysis using HOMER54 on the open chromatin regions from the xenotransplanted microglia. Specifically, we used the top 100 peaks with increased and decreased chromatin accessibility across the APOE isoforms as input and defined all ATAC-seq peaks as the background set. Regions with increased accessibility in the APOE2 microglia were strongly enriched for the DNA binding motif of the vitamin D receptor (VDR; Fig. 7a), a ligand-inducible transcription factor (TF) and main mediator of vitamin D signalling55. Importantly, vitamin D deficiency has been linked to increased risk for AD56,57. We next assessed whether VDR target genes were upregulated in APOE2 microglia. A hypergeometric test confirmed an overrepresentation of genes upregulated in APOE2 when compared to both APOE3 and APOE4 (Fig. 7b), in a list of monocytic VDR target genes identified in a previous study58. This confirms the expected downstream transcriptional response predicted by increased VDR binding in APOE2 microglia. Activation of an anti-inflammatory microglia phenotype via IL-10 and vitamin D signalling has been reported previously59 (Fig. 7c). Consistent with this, in our data, the alpha subunit of the IL-10 receptor (IL-10RA) was significantly upregulated in APOE2 microglia (Fig. 7d). We also checked to see whether VDR target genes were associated with any of the WGCNA modules identified in this study (Supplementary Fig. 8). The ME1 (dark green) module was enriched for upregulated VDR target genes, and this module was also identified as upregulated in APOE2-expressing microglia. The ME1 module was characterised by biological pathways associated with immune responses (Fig. 5d, e). The ME2 (blue) module was also enriched for upregulated VDR target genes, however, this module was not differentially expressed across the APOE groups (FDR < 0.05). Aside from the VDR enrichment, regions with increased chromatin accessibility in APOE4-expressing microglia when compared to APOE2 were enriched for STAT2, a TF involved in interferon response signalling60. De novo motif enrichment analysis results for all APOE isoform comparisons can be found in Supplementary Data 7.

Increasing evidence points to a highly complex response of microglia to AD pathology. Here, we show that the human APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4 differentially regulate microglia in the context of Aβ aggregates. By profiling human microglia isolated from a xenotransplantation model of AD using RNA-seq and ATAC-seq, we uncovered widespread changes to the transcriptomic and chromatin landscape of this cell type, dependent on the APOE isoform expressed. As anticipated, the largest differences were observed when comparing the AD risk opposing APOE2 and APOE4 microglia.

First, we observed consistent epigenomic and transcriptomic responses for several genes, including CHCHD2 and ZNF248. CHCHD2 is involved in promoting cell migration37 and has been linked to familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD)38, where it is transcriptionally downregulated. Its decreased expression and chromatin accessibility in APOE4 microglia, but also in the knockout, suggest a loss of normal function. Conversely, ZNF248 was upregulated in APOE4 and the knockout in both assays, suggesting a potential gain of toxic function. In a study comparing the effects of TREM2 knockout and a TREM2 mutation in a model of human microglia, the TREM2 knockout had deficits in phagocytosis, chemotaxis, and survival that were not observed in the TREM2 mutant40. ZNF248 was one of only four differentially expressed genes with reduced expression in the knockout but increased expression in the mutant. Although the authors argue that it is unlikely that such a limited number of genes, including ZNF248, could explain such vast phenotypic differences40, the overlap between APOE4 microglia and TREM2 knockout microglia is interesting. The convergence of results between the DEGs and DARs highlights the robustness of using multiple independent assays to profile cellular states in a disease context. Overlapping expression signatures with the APOE knockout enabled us to infer whether the APOE2 and APOE4 alleles resulted in a loss or gain-of-function. Although both alleles overlapped with the knockout, only genes downregulated in APOE4 microglia and the knockout were both enriched for AD genetic risk, lending support to previous reports of APOE4 microglia increasing AD risk through loss-of-function mechanisms16,23. Further investigation into the genes shared between the knockout and APOE4 microglia highlighted a strong upregulation of TSPAN13. This gene is also upregulated in microglia that accumulate damaging lipid droplets in the ageing brain33, and in microglia homozygous for APOE4, in response to Aβ22. Our data suggest that lipid dysregulation in APOE4 microglia may be driven by a loss of function.

Genes downregulated in APOE4 were enriched within distinct microglial states identified in response to Aβ: HLA, RM, and DAM27. HLA represents a novel, human-specific microglial state that has a pronounced response to Aβ pathology and is thought to play a protective role27. RM are enriched for ribosomal genes. In murine AD models, stage 2 DAM cells, which signal the full activation of the DAM programme that is thought to be protective, are enriched for ribosomal genes14. When considered collectively, these enrichments suggest that APOE4 microglia fail to shift into protective states. Furthermore, our analyses point toward diminished migratory capacity in APOE4 and enhanced migratory capacity in APOE2 microglia. This is supported in previous studies which have shown that migration is decreased in APOE4 microglia-like cells61, APOE4 microglia have reduced motility and responsiveness to ATP, a chemotactic cue of neuronal damage, and amyloid beta62. In contrast, genes associated with microglial migration are upregulated in APOE2 microglia51. Previously, APOE4 microglia were shown to downregulate their expression of cellular migration genes in response to demyelination51, and pericytes derived from APOE4 carriers exhibited downregulation of genes associated with cellular migration63. This also suggests that migratory capacity is not a cell type or pathology-specific mechanism affected by APOE in AD. In concordance with signatures of cellular migration, APOE2-expressing microglia also exhibited enhanced phagocytic activity when compared to APOE3 and APOE4 microglia. This observation is in agreement with previous studies which report a lower accumulation of myelin debris in APOE2-TR mice51, and increased clearance of Aβ from the interstitial fluid of mice expressing the APOE2 isoform50 In addition, APOE2-expressing macrophages derived from transgenic mice with an APP mutation were also more efficient at degrading amyloid beta than both APOE3 and APOE4-expressing macrophages49.

Another mechanism through which APOE4 may be exerting its pathogenic role in AD is by mounting a cytokine response. In other studies, mouse microglia expressing the humanised APOE4 allele increased cytokine production32, and xenotransplanted human microglia shifted towards a pro-inflammatory state27. Similarly, we report a general upregulation of cytokines in APOE4 when compared to both APOE2 and APOE3 microglia. One exception was CXCL16, which was upregulated in the APOE2 microglia. However, this chemokine has been reported to drive microglia to an anti-inflammatory phenotype in brain tumours64. In addition to changes to cytokine expression, regions with increased chromatin accessibility in APOE4-expressing microglia were enriched for STAT2, a TF involved in interferon response signalling. Increased interferon signalling as well as upregulation of associated genes has already been shown in mouse microglia expressing APOE432. Machlovi et al. (2022) also reported increased TNFα expression in APOE4 microglia, while we observed the opposite—nine TNF family genes were increased in APOE2 when compared to APOE4 (Supplementary Data 1). Whether a cytokine is pro-inflammatory is context dependent, and it is therefore difficult to conclude whether the upregulation of these TNF family genes is driving a pro-inflammatory response. In addition, it remains unclear to what extent pro-inflammatory responses are protective versus pathogenic in AD, and what triggers the increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the APOE isoforms. For instance, in APOE2 microglia the upregulation of TNF family genes may be triggered by their migration towards and interaction with Aβ plaques. Whereas in APOE4 microglia, the increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines could be due to a lack of response to Aβ, which in turn would result in continued Aβ deposition and a sustained pro-inflammatory response.

Several studies have shown an enrichment of AD genetic risk within microglia-specific genes and regulatory regions from the human brain5,6,11. Here, using the chromatin accessibility profiles from the xenotransplanted microglia we recapitulate this enrichment, highlighting the robustness of this model for investigating human genetic risk in a disease context. At the level of the transcriptome, AD genetic risk was enriched within genes downregulated in APOE4 microglia but also the APOE knockout. Supporting previous studies, this overlap suggests that AD risk increased by the presence of APOE4 is partially mediated through loss of protective function. Our findings underscore the need to consider the interplay between genetic risk factors and microglial states in AD.

In addition to arguing for increased proliferation, migration, phagocytosis and immune response in APOE2 microglia as underlying this isoform's protective effect, we report a potential upstream regulatory role for the VDR. In the context of AD, low levels of vitamin D have been associated with a higher incidence of the disease56,57, and vitamin D supplementation has been shown to improve disease outcomes65,66. It's important to take into consideration APOE genotype, as some studies have shown that APOE4 carriers have higher vitamin D levels67,68 and therefore vitamin D supplementation may be more beneficial to non-carriers66. Vitamin D acts via binding to VDR, and enrichment of VDR in regions with increased chromatin accessibility in APOE2 may therefore enable these microglia to be more responsive to vitamin D, regardless of serum levels. Furthermore, the increased expression of the IL-10RA in APOE2 microglia was particularly interesting. Vitamin D, via the VDR, increases the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-1059. IL-10 then activates SOCS3 via the IL-10 receptor, and this mechanism suppresses the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Several other studies have also demonstrated an association between vitamin D and the expression of anti-inflammatory factors in microglia69,70,71,72,73,74. The functional role of VDR activation and binding warrants further studies in terms of mechanisms and therapeutic exploration.

Our study has a number of limitations. First, microglia exist in different subtypes and states. For example, microglia associated with Aβ plaques may have distinct transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles compared to less responsive microglia. While it is worth considering the contributions of APOE from mouse microglia and astrocytes, these should remain consistent across the APOE groups and, as such, should not affect differential expression and chromatin accessibility analyses. Although transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling provide valuable insights into gene regulatory mechanisms, other factors, such as histone modifications, also play a significant role in AD3,4,41. It is also worth considering that the APOE isoforms might exert risk or protection prior to the onset of Aβ pathogenesis. Future studies could adopt a time-series approach to investigate this. We linked regions with differential chromatin accessibility to differentially expressed genes based on their proximity. While this approach may capture promoter-gene relationships, many DARs may also function as enhancers. These enhancer-gene links can regulate target genes up to a megabase away, making them more challenging to identify. Using appropriate chromatin interaction data such as Hi-C could help disentangle these connections. Finally, while the absence of an adaptive immune system is necessary to prevent xenograft rejection, it may lead to unaccounted for changes in the microglial response75.

Our work sheds light on the regulation of microglia in AD: we show that it is dependent on APOE isoform, at both the level of the transcriptome and epigenome, further highlighting the complexity of this cell type in response to Aβ. Our work suggests that APOE4 microglia have compromised microglial functions including diminished migratory capacity and heightened pro-inflammatory responses compared to APOE2, and these may underlie the increased risk of AD seen in carriers of this isoform. Furthermore, our findings underscore the importance of considering the interplay between genetic risk factors, such as APOE, and microglial states in disease progression. Importantly, we highlight the potential involvement of the VDR in modulating microglial responses, providing new avenues for therapeutic exploration. Overall, the use of the microglia xenotransplantation model coupled with genome-wide profiling has enabled us to dissect the regulatory landscape of microglia expressing the different APOE isoforms. In future, this approach could be extended to other relevant genes. In summary, our study emphasises the complex interplay between genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors in shaping microglial responses in AD and underscores the need for targeted interventions based on APOE genotype.

Stem cells were cultured on Matrigel in E8 Flex medium, dissociated at ~70–80% confluence, and aggregated in U-bottom 96-well plates with BMP4, VEGF, and SCF. Embryoid bodies were then transferred to six-well plates and cultured in X-VIVO medium with additional cytokines, followed by a media switch on day 11. By day 18, microglial precursors were harvested and transplanted into P4 mouse brains after depleting endogenous microglia with CSF1R inhibitor BLZ945. Ethics approval for transplantation of human iPS cells was obtained by the Ethics Committee Research UZ / KU Leuven (study S65730).

AppNL-G-F mice were crossed with homozygous Rag2tm1.1Flv Csf1tm1(CSF1)Flv Il2rgtm1.1Flv Apptm3.1Tcs mice (Jacksons Lab, strain 017708) to generate the Rag2-/- Il2rγ-/- hCSF1KI AppNL-G-F used in this study. The strain was maintained on the original C57Bl/6xBalbC background. In total, we transplanted 500,000 cells bilaterally across 20 mice. Male mice were used for the xenotransplantations to limit biological variability. Mice had access to food and water ad libitum and were housed with a 14/10 h light-dark cycle at 21 °C in groups of two to five animals. Animal experiments were approved by the local Ethical Committee of Laboratory Animals of the KU Leuven (government licence LA1210579 ECD project number P177/2017) following local and EU guidelines. Five biological replicates were prepared per experimental group: APOE2, APOE3, APOE4, APOE KO. Animals were anaesthetised with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital and transcardially perfused with ice cold PBS. Samples were obtained in the morning between 9 and 11 am. From each sample at 12 months, FACS purification of the following cell numbers were attained: 100,000 cells for ATAC-seq, 200,000 cells for RNA-seq. The FACS plots with the gating strategy can be seen in Supplementary Fig. 9. ATAC-seq samples were processed immediately after cell collection for tagmentation and elution of transposed DNA (details in ATAC-seq methods section). RNA-seq was conducted from cell pellets snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.

From snap frozen cell pellets of 200,000 cells per sample, RNA was extracted using the Monarch Total RNA Miniprep Kit (T2010) following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA-seq was conducted using the rRNA depletion strategy rather than mRNA enrichment so that noncoding RNAs could be recovered76. rRNA depletion was performed using NEBNext rRNA Depletion Kit v2 Human/Mouse/Rat with RNA Sample Purification Beads (E7405), followed by stranded (directional) library preparation using the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (E7765) following manufacturer's protocols without adjustments. RNA quality was checked using the Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (5067-1513) and final libraries were assessed using Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit (5067-2646) where all libraries were appropriate for sequencing apart from one replicate of the APOE3 microglia—therefore this isoform only has four biological replicates for RNA-seq.

ATAC-seq was conducted as previously described77. Following FACS collection of 100,000 cells per sample, cells were spun down at 500 g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was removed. Cell pellets were gently resuspended in 50 µL of ice cold Lysis Buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630). 2.5 µL Tagment DNA Enzyme (Illumina; 20034197) was added directly and gently mixed by pipetting. The transposition reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, then transferred to ice. DNA was purified immediately with the Zymo ChIP DNA Clean and Concentration Kit (D5205) following manufacturer's instructions. The DNA column was spun dry prior to elution of transposed DNA, which was conducted with 11 µL Elution Buffer. Purified DNA was stored at -20 °C until library preparation. 10 µL DNA per sample was transferred into a PCR tube and 34.25 µL PCR master mix was added per sample. 6.25 µL of 10 µM Nextera Primer 2 (with barcode) was added per sample, where a different barcode was used for each sample to enable multiplexing. PCR was conducted using the following settings: (1) 72 °C for 5 min, (2) 98 °C for 30 s; (3) 98 °C for 10 s; (4) 63 °C for 30 s; (5) 72 °C for 1 min; (6) repeat steps (3)-(5) for a total of 10 cycles; (7) hold at 4 °C. Amplified library was purified using the Zymo ChIP DNA Clean and Concentration Kit (D5205). The purified library was eluted using 20 µL Elution Buffer. 5 µL of 5x TBE Loading Buffer (Invitrogen; LC6678) was added and loaded in a 12-well 10% TBE gel (Invitrogen; EC62752BOX). A ladder was prepared using 0.25–0.5 µL ORangeRuler 50 bp DNA Ladder (ThermoFisher; SM0613) diluted in 5 µL 5x TBE loading buffer. The gel was run at 70 V until DNA enters the gel, then increased to 140 V for approximately one hour. The gel was stained using 10 mL 1x TBE with SYBR Gold Nucleic Acid Gel stain (Invitrogen; S11494) diluted at 1:10,000 (1 µL). The gel was cut between 175 and 225 bp markers into a 0.5 mL DNA LoBind tube perforated three times with a 22 G needle. The gel was shredded by centrifugation at maximum speed for 2 min at room temperature into a 1.5 mL DNA LoBind tube. 150 µL Diffusion Buffer (0.5 M Ammonium Acetate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Magnesium Acetate, ddH2O) was added to the gel in the 1.5 mL tube and shaken at room temperature for 45 min. The sample was then transferred to filter columns using wide-bore tips and spun at max speed for 2 min. DNA was purified (~140 µL) using the Zymo ChIP DNA Clean and Concentration Kit and eluted with 10 µL Elution Buffer into 1.5 mL DNA LoBind tubes. Final libraries were quantified with the Qubit 1X dsDNA HS Assay Kit (ThermoFisher; Q33230) and stored at −20 °C prior to sequencing (yield: ~0.25 ng/µL).

Final library size distributions were assessed by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser and Agilent 4200 TapeStation for quality control before sequencing. Libraries were pooled to achieve an equal representation of the desired final library size range (equimolar pooling based on Bioanalyser/TapeSation signal in the 150–800 bp range). Paired-end Illumina sequencing using the HiSeq 4000 PE75 strategy was conducted on barcoded libraries at the Imperial Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) Genomics Facility following the manufacturer's protocols.

General QC of each sample was assessed using fastQC (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/), followed by adaptor trimming using TrimGalore! (https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore). Reads were aligned to GRCh38 using bowtie2 with the following arguments: –local –very-sensitive –no-mixed –no-discordant -I 25 -X 1000. Post-alignment QC included removing: reads mapping to the mitochondrial genome, duplicate reads, multi-mapping reads, and reads with low mapping quality (q < 30). Read count generation was performed using featureCounts78. Additionally, peaks were filtered using the filterByExpr() function in DESeq231, retaining only peaks with sufficiently high counts for statistical analysis. This left 167,951 peaks for downstream analyses. The 2 APOE-KO samples with high APOE expression in the RNA-seq data were also excluded from the ATAC-seq dataset. Additionally, another APOE-KO and one APOE4 microglia sample were discarded due to having a low number of reads after QC filtering (<9 million).

General QC of each sample was assessed using fastQC (https://www.bioinformaticsf.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/), followed by adaptor trimming using TrimGalore! (https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore). Reads were aligned to the GRCh38 genome and transcriptome using STAR79. Duplicate and multi-mapping reads were retained. Transcript quantification was performed using Salmon80, using the GC bias flag. Two of the APOE knockout samples with high APOE expression were excluded from subsequent analyses (Supplementary Fig. 2).

DESeq231 was used for the differential expression and differential chromatin accessibility analysis. DESeq231 was designed for the differential analysis of RNA-seq data and has since been widely used for this purpose. In a recent study comparing methods for differential analysis of ATAC-seq read counts, Gontarz et al (2020)81 showed that with five replicates, which we have for most of our samples, DESeq2 had the lowest false positive rate and a true positive recall comparable to other methods available for differential accessibility analysis. For both analyses, the APOE3 microglia samples were used as a baseline for comparison, and we additionally tested for differences between APOE4 and APOE2 microglia. To perform the differential analysis, we used the DESeq() function which provides a wrapper for three functions: estimateSizeFactors() for estimation of size factors, estimateDispersions() for estimation of dispersion, and nbinomWaldTest() for negative binomial GLM fitting and Wald statistics. Genes and peaks were defined as being significant if p < 0.05 after FDR correction.

To identify which genes had similar expression profiles across the APOE groups, we used weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA)47. First, transcripts with zero or low expression counts were filtered out using the filterByExpr() function in edgeR82. As suggested by the authors of WGCNA, the count data was normalised by variance stabilising transformation and explored for outliers using principal component analysis. An appropriate soft thresholding power was chosen to ensure a scale-free network and used as input to the blockwiseModules() function in WGCNA to calculate the adjacency matrix. This function was also used to detect gene co-expression modules and to calculate module eigengenes. As defined by the authors47, the module eigengenes are the first principal component of a given module and can be considered to represent the gene expression profile of that module.

The module eigengenes identified in the WGCNA analysis were used to perform differential expression analysis using the lmFit() function in limma83, across the APOE groups. As the only differentially expressed modules were associated with APOE2, the genes belonging to these modules were used to perform pathway enrichment analysis using clusterProfiler84, allowing characterisation of the APOE2-associated modules based on their gene ontology (GO) enrichments. GO terms were considered to be significantly associated with the given modules if p < 0.05 after FDR correction.

To estimate the proportion of disease SNP-heritability attributable to open chromatin regions in the xenotransplanted microglia, we performed stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression (s-LDSC). Annotation files were generated and used to compute LD scores. Publicly available GWAS summary statistics for a recent AD GWAS43 were downloaded and converted to the required format for LDSC. Steps for the analysis were followed as instructed here https://github.com/bulik/ldsc/wiki and required files were downloaded from https://alkesgroup.broadinstitute.org/LDSCORE/GRCh38. LDSC was run using the full baseline model, thereby computing the proportion of SNP-heritability associated with the annotation of interest, while taking into account all the annotations in the baseline model. As we observed a significant enrichment, we repeated the analysis using GWAS data for PD85, Amyotropic Lateral Sclerosis46, and Autism spectrum disorder86, to ensure this was not a generic neurological enrichment.

MAGMA gene set analysis34 was used to assess the enrichment of AD SNP-based heritability among differentially expressed genes across the APOE isoforms. The SNP window was restricted to the gene region (0,0). Summary statistics for three independent AD GWAS were downloaded35,43,87 and formatted for use with MAGMA using MungeSumstats88. P-values were corrected using the FDR method.

Microglia progenitors, as generated according to the MIGRATE protocol, were collected on day 18 and plated in differentiation medium (DMEM/F12 supplemented with 200 mM L-glutamine, 1:2000 human insulin, 5 ng/mL N-Acetyl-L-cysteine, 50 mg/mL apo-transferrin, 20 μg/mL sodium selenite, 1 μg/mL heparin sulphate, 50ng/mL M-CSF, 100 ng/mL IL-34, 2 ng/mL transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, 10 ng/mL fractalkine (CX3CL1), 1.5 ng/mL cholesterol) in a concentration of 3.75*105 cells/mL in 8 well chamber slides (Ibidi, 80841). On day 6, microglia were incubated with 100 μg/mL pHrodo Red E.coli BioParticles (Thermofisher, P35361) for 1 h, or 200 μg/mL human myelin debris, as isolated from human brain tissue according to previously published protocol89 and fluorescently labelled according to instructions of the MINI67 cell membrane labelling kit (Sigma-Aldrich, MINI67) for 3 h. Cultures were rinsed with PBS three times and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min.

Fixed cells were permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min and nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 10 min. Microglia were incubated with anti- ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1; WAKO, 019-1974, 1:500), followed by incubation with secondary Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 donkey anti-rabbit antibodies (Invitrogen A21206 and A21207, 1:400), both in 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h at RT. This was followed by counterstaining with 1.67 μg/mL 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Merck, D9542) for 15 min at RT. Finally, cells were mounted with Mowiol solution and stored at 4 °C until imaging.

For each well (7 per genotype and phagocytosis stimulus), three fields were imaged using a Nikon A1R Eclipse Ti confocal microscope. For each field, a z-stack of three images was acquired with steps of 2.95 μm at 10x magnification for the E.coli conditions and 0.88 μm at 20x magnification for the myelin conditions. Images were further analyzed with a custom made FIJI script (v1.53). Maximum intensity projections were generated from z-stacks, and microglia masks were generated using the ‘Analyze Particles' function on the Iba1 channel, followed by manual verification. The number of microglia positive for E. coli/myelin phagocytosis was counted with the use of the ‘Cell Counter' plugin. Thereafter, the area of E. coli/myelin signal within microglia positive for phagocytosis was measured in μm². Values from three fields per well were averaged for analysis. Differences in phagocytosis between genotypes were assessed with one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni's multiple comparisons post-hoc test in GraphPad Prism (v10.2.0).

If and when AI will start replacing human labor has been the subject of numerous debates.  

While it's still hard to say with certainty if AI is beginning to take over roles previously done by humans, a recent survey from the World Economic Forum found that 40% of employers intend to cut staff where AI can automate tasks.

Researchers at SignalFire, a data-driven VC firm that tracks job movements of over 600 million employees and 80 million companies on LinkedIn, believe they may be seeing first signs of AI's impact on hiring.

When analyzing hiring trends, SignalFire noticed that tech companies recruited fewer recent college graduates in 2024 than they did in 2023. Meanwhile, tech companies, especially the top 15 Big Tech businesses, ramped up their hiring of experienced professionals.

Specifically, SignalFire found that Big Tech companies reduced the hiring of new graduates by 25% in 2024 compared to 2023. Meanwhile, graduate recruitment at startups decreased by 11% compared to the prior year. Although SignalFire wouldn't reveal exactly how many fewer grads were hired according to their data, a spokesperson told us it was thousands.

While adoption of new AI tools might not fully explain the dip in recent grad hiring, Asher Bantock, SignalFire's head of research, says there's “convincing evidence” that AI is a significant contributing factor.

Entry-level jobs are susceptible to automation because they often involve routine, low-risk tasks that generative AI handles well.

AI's new coding, debugging, financial research, and software installation abilities could mean companies need fewer people to do that type of work. AI's ability to handle certain entry-level tasks means some jobs for new graduates could soon be obsolete.

Gabe Stengel, the founder of AI financial analyst startup Rogo, started his career at Lazard investment bank where he helped large pharma companies buy biotech startups. Rogo's tool “can do almost all the work I did in the analysis of those companies,” Stengel said onstage at Newcomer's financial technology summit last week. “We can put together the materials, diligence the company, look through their financials.”

While most large investment banks haven't explicitly reduced analyst hiring due to AI yet, executives at firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley previously considered cutting junior staff hires by up to two-thirds and lowering the pay of those they hire because the work with AI is not as demanding as before, the New York Times reported last year.

Although AI's threat to low-skilled jobs is real, tech companies' need for experienced professionals is still rising. According to SignalFire's report, Big Tech companies increased hiring by 27% for professionals with two to five years of experience, while startups hired 14% more individuals in that same seniority range.

A frustrating paradox emerges for recent graduates: They can't get hired without experience, but they can't get experience without being hired. While this dilemma is not new, Heather Doshay, SignalFire's people and talent partner, says it is considerably exacerbated by AI.

Dashay's advice to new grads: master AI tools. “AI won't take your job if you're the one who's best at using it,” she said.

Self-driving truck startup TuSimple (now CreateAI) sent a trove of sensitive data — effectively the blueprint of an American-made autonomous vehicle system — to a Beijing-owned firm after committing to the U.S. government that it would cease such transfers under a national security agreement, according to The Wall Street Journal. 

The transfers to Chinese truck manufacturer Foton happened around February 2022, just a week after TuSimple signed the agreement in which U.S. regulators ordered the company to separate its business and technology from China-based employees and partners with firewalls and governance controls. The data sharing continued up until TuSimple's deadline to comply with the agreement six months later, according to hundreds of pages of correspondence that the Journal viewed.

A subsequent investigation with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) found the data sharing didn't technically violate the agreement, though TuSimple was fined for other infractions and paid a $6 million settlement without admitting fault, per the Journal. 

TechCrunch was unable to reach TuSimple, now CreateAI, for comment. 

Still, the saga of TuSimple's data transfers to China exposes the limits of U.S. safeguards meant to balance foreign investment with national security. And it's not just data that TuSimple has been trying to get across the border. 

This latest revelation comes eight months after TechCrunch reported that some of TuSimple's shareholders were trying to block the company from transferring its U.S. funds — roughly $450 million at the time — to the company's Chinese subsidiary to fund a pivot to AI animation and content generation. That drama is still unfolding as one of TuSimple's co-founders, Xiaodi Hou, fights in court for control over his voting shares so he can push for liquidation of the company. In December 2024, TuSimple officially rebranded to CreateAI. 

The company has been embroiled in controversy since going public via IPO in 2021. TuSimple started as a China-backed startup founded in 2015 by Hou and Lu Chen, an entrepreneur with ties to Sina Corp. It quickly became an autonomous vehicle industry favorite, managing to raise around $2 billion from a mixture of Chinese and U.S.-based heavy hitters, and was one of the first in the U.S. to successfully complete a fully driverless run on public highways. 

TuSimple's plans took a turn for the worse amid internal struggles and federal investigations into the company's ties with China, leading to its decision to exit U.S. operations and voluntarily delisting from the stock market in January 2024. The goal was to restart self-driving operations in China, but both the CFIUS agreement and other court orders that barred the company from transferring assets — financial or otherwise — to China made it next to impossible to restart operations there, the company has told TechCrunch. 

The Journal's reporting sheds light on a previously reported controversy regarding Hydron, a Chinese hydrogen trucking startup founded by Chen, which shared an office with TuSimple China. The overlap between Hydron and TuSimple was the subject of the 2022 CFIUS probe, during which TuSimple revealed that its employees spent paid hours working for Hydron in 2021 and shared confidential information with the company. 

According to documents the Journal viewed, TuSimple negotiated a deal in 2021 between Hydron and Foton to develop autonomous trucks. Foton, a subsidiary of state-owned BAIC Group, has an agreement with a Chinese military university to work on AV tech. 

Through a combination of emails, Slack messages, and video calls, TuSimple sent partners technical instructions for server dimensions, brake designs, sensors, steering, power supply, and chips, per the Journal. Employees also routinely downloaded autonomy source code developed by their American counterparts.

As geopolitical tensions and competition with China rise, TuSimple's ties are serving as a cautionary tale for Washington that has helped drive a shift in U.S. policy, prompting stricter rules on Chinese-linked tech deals and fueling a broader push to block high-risk transactions outright.

There's not a lot about the upcoming AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT that remains a mystery after AMD's launch presentation, and its AIB partner boards being displayed all over Computex. However, Slovakia-based tech site HW Cooling recently enjoyed a Gigabyte factory tour, where they managed to snap a nice, clear shot of an upcoming RX 9060 XT graphics card PCB. There are lots of other interesting photos and details, too, if you care to check their full story.



The PCB is accompanied by a typical Gigabyte codename, which in this case is ‘R906XTG.' We reckon that the PCB is therefore from one of Gigabyte's pair of Radeon RX 9060 XT Gaming graphics cards – either the 8GB or 16GB model, we can't tell from the image, and the -16GB or -8GD Gigabyte short code is missing from the model number. Gigabyte has announced four RX 9060 XT SKUs so far. They're all dual-slot triple-fan cards.



Refocusing on the image, we saw the diminutive Navi 44 GPU in the flesh at Computex, so that isn't new, but we can see it here where it should be, flanked by a quartet of GDDR6 memory chips from SK hynix at 12 o'clock and three o'clock. As we don't know whether this is the 8GB or 16GB Gigabyte RX 9060 XT Gaming PCB, we aren't sure whether there are another four VRAM chips installed on the other side of the PCB.

Above and to the right of the central GPU and VRAM area, Gigabyte has placed a single 8-pin power connector. Along the bottom edge is the lauded PCIe 5.0 x16 interface. AMD's decision to feature only three display outputs, as you can see on the left side of this photo, hasn't been warmly welcomed, though.

That's about all we have to say about the surprise photo exposé from HW Cooling. If you are a practical type, more interested in things like performance, availability, and pricing, we only have AMD's cherry-picked performance slides for now, and have been advised of MSRPs of $299 and $349 for the 8GB and 16GB versions of this card, respectively. “Wide availability” is officially touted by AMD for June 5 – a week on Thursday.

ASRock alleges that these problems have been fixed with their latest BIOS release.

A common thread among increasing user reports of failing Ryzen 9000 CPUs was their connection to an ASRock AM5 motherboard. Citing a conversation with the partner at Computex, Tech Yes City has brought to light that ASRock's initial PBO (Precision Boost Overdrive) presets were set too aggressively for initial CPU samples. It is believed these aggressive settings are what ultimately lead to the premature demise of these processors. AMD declined to comment on the story, while ASRock wasn't immediately available.

Earlier this year, reports of failing AMD Ryzen 9000 (Granite Ridge) processors were common on Reddit and other forums. ASRock initially dismissed reports connecting their motherboards to the problem as 'misinformation', all the while supplying a new BIOS to address boot-up and memory compatibility issues. Affected users had no other choice but to RMA their broken CPUs.

According to new details from Tech Yes City, the problem stems from the amperage (current) supplied to the processor under AMD's PBO technology. Precision Boost Overdrive employs an algorithm that dynamically adjusts clock speeds for peak performance, based on factors like temperature, power, current, and workload. The issue is reportedly confined to ASRock's high-end and mid-range boards, as they were tuned far too aggressively for Ryzen 9000 CPUs.

ASRock believes their settings for the Electric Design Current (EDC) and Thermal Design Current (TDC) were set overly high for early CPU samples. Does this imply initial silicon was less stable than what we're getting now? It's hard to say. ASRock reportedly ruled out memory incompatibility and excessive SoC voltages as potential causes, the latter of which has a history of wrecking last-generation Ryzen 7000 (Raphael) CPUs.

Liquid coolers and AIOs are said to compound this problem, as they provide greater thermal headroom for PBO. Per the YouTuber, ASRock has fixed this issue with a new BIOS update. While preliminary testing reveals no difference in EDC and TDC values, ASRock has also reportedly reduced "shadow voltages," which are settings not visible to users.

It's still uncertain if the fault lies with AMD or ASRock, as all partners are bound by specific and clear limits set by AMD. Likewise, it is too soon to tell if this fix is truly effective, but we'll know for sure if more cases surface. Questions also emerge from ASRock's media representative initially dismissing user reports as 'misinformation'. It's unlikely to be a coincidence when reports of the same issue point to motherboards from one specific manufacturer. While we've requested further comment on the matter, ASRock should release a public advisory urging users to update their BIOS to prevent potential failures, if that indeed is the necessary fix.

No matter how much experience you have in the kitchen or how much time you are willing to spend cooking, the right appliance can change your world. With the COSORI 9-in-1 air fryer, you can go from amateur to Michelin-starred chef in a few simple steps. This is the kind of kitchen remodeling that instantly makes plain old meals something to write home about without the mess or frustration of traditional cooking.

And because of a last-minute Memorial Day sale at Amazon, this air fryer is now more affordable than ever: for now, you can purchase it for as little as $89, down from its original cost of $119, which is a massive 25% off that is difficult to beat for such a quality product. Even more staggering is its 4.8 out of 5-star rating (acquired via more than 10,000 reviews) which is a near-new record grade for any product on Amazon, let alone a kitchen appliance.

What is special about the COSORI air fryer is that it is able to deliver professional-grade outputs with minimal effort: Its innovative TurboBlaze Technology uses a 3600 rpm high-speed fan and reaches 450°F so that each meal is crispy outside and juicy inside. Regardless of whether you are roasting, baking, broiling, reheating or even proofing dough, you have excellent, delicious results with every use. The advanced airflow system and precise temperature control mean that side dishes are evenly cooked with textures that rival anything you'd find in a restaurant.

With nine different functions, it's like having an entire kitchen's worth of appliances packed into one compact, stylish device. The 6-quart square basket is both deep and wide and it's easy to prepare family-sized meals in one go while saving valuable counter and storage space. And despite its power, the COSORI air fryer operates at less than 53 decibels—even on the highest fan speed—so your kitchen stays peaceful and quiet.

Perhaps the most seductive feature of air frying is the possibility of healthier meals and the COSORI does not fail on that front either. You can enjoy all your favorite fried foods such as fries, chicken wings or onion rings with up to 95% less oil so you need not feel guilty for indulging in crunchy fried foods. Cleaning is just as hassle-free as cooking, with the nonstick, dishwasher-safe basket and removable accessories.

This Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer is a kitchen necessity that you don't want to miss out on, especially while this final late Memorial Day sale is still available.

Hygon's processor know-how reinforces Sugon's supercomputer smarts.

A highly significant China tech industry merger looks set to go ahead, reports the South China Morning Post (SCMP). The Hong Kong-based organ says that the merger plan between chip designer Hygon Information Technology and supercomputer maker Sugon marks “a major move to consolidate two of the leading players in China's computing supply chain.” We may be seeing the forming of a highly impactful vertically integrated supercomputing giant that has blossomed in the shadow of U.S. sanctions.

The proposed deal involves Hygon absorbing Sugon shares in a stock-swap agreement. Should the process complete successfully, with both companies' shares being taken off the open market for up to 10 trading days, the newly consolidated entity will appear on the Shanghai stock exchange.

To give this merger some context, regular Tom's Hardware readers will be aware that Hygon chips leverage the AMD Zen processor architecture. However, the firm says it has moved on from those days. In a recent report we published highlighting an extraordinary Hygon C86-5G, a 128-core, 512-thread CPU with AVX-512 and 16-channel DDR5-5600 support, we quoted a company exec asserting it uses a "new self-developed microarchitecture” in its latest designs.



Our previous reports on Sugon made clear its existing close relationship with Hygon. In recent years, the supercomputer maker leaned heavily on Hygon x86 chips to develop high-performance platforms. Sugon is backed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, explains the SCMP, and has managed to push China into the “global top three for supercomputing,” it is claimed.

Both Hygon and Sugon are on the U.S. Entity List, which means they can't get direct access to chips from U.S. suppliers such as AMD, Intel, and Nvidia. Naturally, the pairing, in their new clothes, will be treated similarly by U.S. policymakers. However, that will likely be of little concern to the newly formed vertically integrated Chinese supercomputing giant. The U.S. trade measures might have drawn them inexorably together.

Consolidation in the Chinese semiconductor and computing sectors has previously been forecast by analysts. This newly merged company looks like a sure-fire success, with the Chinese political will to build a formidable high-performance computing infrastructure to drive its domestic AI and big data projects.

Finding the right tent for a backpacking trip is always tricky. You have to balance packed size and weight against livability and how well it stands up to wind and rain. I've always erred on the side of a sturdy tent over any weight concerns, which is why I love the Hilleberg Akto, but I don't always need the Akto.

There is a short season in my neck of the woods called summer, when storms are less likely and temps don't drop much below the 60s. This is when I've been using the Lunar Solo, Six Moon Design's flagship ultralight one-person tent. After several late and early summer trips around the north woods of Wisconsin and Michigan, it has proved itself a capable shelter. It weighs just 2 pounds, packs down quite small, and checks a whole lot of other boxes on my tent wish list.

There is no one tent to rule them all, and trying to find one is a mistake. You're better off with two tents, knowing the limitations of each and using each when it's the best for the job. Which is to say, I love the Akto, but I also think Six Moon Design's Lunar Solo is excellent for summer trips when you prize traveling light over withstanding intense storms.

That's not to say the Lunar Solo won't keep you dry. It will. The silicone nylon, or silnylon, is plenty waterproof, though you'll either need to seam-seal it yourself with some Seam Grip, or have the Six Moon Designs team do it for you before they ship it, which costs $35. My testing tent arrived seam-sealed, but being old enough to remember when you had to seam-seal just about every tent, I've done it enough times to say it's not hard should you choose to DIY it.

The Lunar Solo is single-wall, single-pole tent intended to be pitched with a trekking pole. This makes for a very small and light tent but also has two potential drawbacks: structural integrity and condensation. More on those in a moment. Once pitched, the Lunar Solo offers 26 square feet of living space and a peak height of 49 inches, and the vestibule offers 8.5 square feet of additional gear storage. Overall I found the Lunar Solo to be plenty spacious for one person with gear. The rear wall expands out slightly, giving you a place to stash frequently needed items without pushing them up against the tent wall.

The 20D silnylon and mesh walls feel as durable as anything you'll find at this weight, unless you want to go with a Cuben Fiber/Dyneema tent, but to my mind the high price of Cuben puts it in a different category. The floor of the Lunar Solo is a more robust 40-denier (40D), and has a bathtub shape to help ensure water doesn't get in. The rear of the Lunar Solo has a 6-inch mesh portion between the floor and the main wall that helps with ventilation.

Any single pole tent is going to struggle in wind, no matter how many guyline points it offers. I did find the Lunar Solo compressed a good deal when I pitched it in high winds on the exposed shores of Lake Superior. It was admittedly not a great campsite from a seeking-shelter point of view, not one I would pick if I wasn't testing the wind resistance of a tent. But it did convince me that the Lunar Solo needs either a trekking pole or a heavier tent pole than the ultralight pole Six Moon Design provided. (I did a good portion of my testing while bikepacking so I didn't have trekking poles.)

I eventually made a more robust pole from a couple of thicker (albeit, heavier) pole segments I had lying around. While I did not get a chance to repeat the wind test, I feel like this combo, which is what I used the rest of the time testing the Lunar Solo, would have held up fine. Most backpackers will use trekking poles to pitch the Lunar Solo, which will provide a much stronger pitch.

It's important you pitch the Lunar Solo correctly, which is a little tricky at first. I highly suggest practicing in ideal conditions before you hit the trail so you can get a feel for it without the added stress of rain. Six Moon Designs has some instructions on its site, which I highly recommend reading. The Lunar Solo pitches with six stakes for the base, two at each end, one for the back, one for the vestibule. The method I found that works best is to stake out the three rear stakes to form a nice taut triangle. Once that's done, I put in the pole to raise the tent up, then stake out the vestibule tension line and put in the remaining two side stakes. Once I came up with this system, I found I could get a good pitch in just a few minutes.

One thing worth emphasizing is that you don't want to try to keep the stakes high up to match the height of the tent off the ground. Use the guylines to handle the height difference and put your stakes all the way in the ground. This will make the Lunar Solo much stronger.

The Lunar Solo is what Six Moon Designs calls a hybrid single-wall tent. Technically, it is double-walled since it has a mesh door and mesh around the floor. But the sides and back of the tent are single-walled and thus vulnerable to condensation. Condensation happens in all tents to varying degrees depending on conditions, but single-wall tents put the condensation on the wall you're going to touch, making the consequences considerably higher. Waking up with water dripping on your face, or in a sleeping bag that's been rendered a sopping mess by condensation, is no fun.

The Lunar Solo attempts to manage condensation the only way you can—by offering a variety of ways to ventilate the tent, reducing humidity (at least the part you're creating) in the process. The Lunar Solo has a vent at the top of the vestibule, the entire door is mesh, and there's mesh all the way around the base, all of which do help with ventilation.

The fly does not reach all the way to floor, allowing more airflow, and the vestibule can be raised up when it's not raining to increase the effectiveness of the front mesh. Unfortunately, whether all this is enough to eliminate condensation depends entirely on the conditions you're in. If the humidity outside is high enough, all the ventilation in the world won't stop condensation.

I did not have a huge issue with condensation in the Lunar Solo, save one scenario—wind after a rain. I carried a small microfiber towel which I used to wipe off condensation in the mornings, and for the most part this kept things under control. One night last fall though, it rained for hours and then the wind picked up and shook a good bit of condensation off the tent walls onto me and my sleeping bag.

The Lunar Solo is a capable tent that doesn't weigh much and for $260 is a bargain. The nearest competitor is probably the Zpacks Plex Solo Lite, which has a very similar design but is made of Dyneema Composite Fabrics (DCF) and more than twice the price. I haven't tested the Plex Solo, but I have used other DCF tents and I am not a fan. Like all Dyneema, it crinkles loudly. I much prefer the packability and relative silence of silnylon.

The other interesting competitor is the Durston X-Mid 1. I have spent a few nights in an older model, but the X-Mid 1 was recently redesigned with 15D walls, and a slightly larger interior. The X-Mid 1 is a double-walled tent, which I consider an advantage, but it does require two poles and the max height is only 41 inches to the Lunar Solo's 49 inches. I'm hoping to get a chance to test the new X-Mid 1 this summer.

The Lunar Solo is tough to beat, though I do wish Six Moon Designs would use heavier zippers. I'd happily carry a couple extra ounces to have more robust zippers. The mesh front wall does limit it more to summer trips, but the Lunar Solo is a great option for those who want to travel light in the backcountry.

Hyperscalers and data center developers are in a pickle: They all want to add computing power tomorrow, but utilities frequently play hard to get, citing years-long waits for grid connections.

“All the AI data centers are struggling to get connected,” Amit Narayan, founder and CEO of Gridcare, told TechCrunch. “They're so desperate. They are looking for solutions, which may or may not happen. Certainly not in the five-year timelines they cite.”

That has led many data centers to pursue what's called “behind the meter” power sources — basically, they build their own power plants, a costly endeavor that hints at just how desperate they are for electricity.

But Narayan knew there was plenty of slack in the system, even if utilities themselves haven't discovered it yet. He has studied the grid for the last 15 years, first as a Stanford researcher then as a founder of another company. “How do we create more capacity when everyone thinks that there is no capacity on the grid?” he said.

Narayan said that Gridcare, which has been operating in stealth, has already discovered several places where extra capacity exists, and it's ready to play matchmaker between data centers and utilities.

Gridcare recently closed an oversubscribed $13.5 million seed round, the company told TechCrunch. The round was led by Xora, Temasek's deep tech venture firm, with participation from Acclimate Ventures, Aina Climate AI Ventures, Breakthrough Energy Discovery, Clearvision, Clocktower Ventures, Overture Ventures, Sherpalo Ventures, and WovenEarth.

For Narayan and his colleagues at Gridcare, the first step to finding untapped capacity was to map the existing grid. Then the company used generative AI to help forecast what changes might be implemented in the coming years. It also layers on other details, including the availability of fiber optic connections, natural gas, water, extreme weather, permitting, and community sentiment around data center construction and expansion. 

“There are 200,000-plus scenarios that you have to consider every time you're running this study,” Narayan said.

To make sure it's not running afoul of regulations, Gridcare then takes that data and weighs it against federal guidelines that dictate grid usage. Once it finds a spot, it starts talking with the relevant utility to verify the data.

“We'll find out where the maximum bang for the buck is,” Narayan said.

At the same time, Gridcare works with hyperscalers and data center developers to identify where they are looking to expand operations or build new ones. “They have already told us what they're willing to do. We know the parameters under which they can operate,” he said.

That's when the matchmaking begins.

Gridcare sells its services to data center developers, charging them a fee based on how many megawatts of capacity the startup can unlock for them. “That fee is significant for us, but it's negligible for data centers,” Narayan said.

For some data centers, the price of admission might be forgoing grid power for a few hours here and there, relying on on-site backup power instead. For others, the path might be clearer if their demand helps green-light a new grid-scale battery installation nearby. In the future, the winner might be the developer that is willing to pay more. Utilities have already approached Gridcare inquiring about auctioning access to newfound capacity.

Regardless of how it happens, Narayan thinks that Gridcare can unlock more than 100 gigawatts of capacity using its approach. “We don't have to solve nuclear fusion to do this,” he said.

Update: Corrected spare capacity on the grid to gigawatts from megawatts.

The 40-year-old standard has finally been discarded in the Japanese consumer space.

Earlier today, Panasonic announced refreshed models of its long-established Let's Note laptop series. However, for the first time in its history, we have a Let's Note portable that doesn't have a VGA port. According to a report by Nikkei Japan (machine translation), this is probably the beginning of the end for laptops sporting VGA output, with “other companies to follow suit.”

A number of factors have precipitated Panasonic's removal of the venerable VGA port. The Nikkei report highlights the strong competition from HDMI, which can simultaneously transmit audio. We also see that the new Panasonic Let's Note CF-SC6 models feature a pair of Thunderbolt 4 ports, which can also be used for video out. That's three separate ports remaining on the Let's Note to drive external displays.



Another disadvantage of VGA highlighted was that it is a rather bulky port for thin and light designs like the Let's Note. At the refreshed laptop product launch today, size and weight were confirmed to be key considerations driving forward Panasonic's consumer designs. The newest Let's Note laptop is just 919g in its 12-inch edition, and Panasonic Connect Executive Officer Kiyotaka Yamamoto said, "In addition to durability and long operating times, we will continue to focus on reducing the weight by even one gram."

In its favor, the Nikkei report cites the ruggedness of the VGA port. Moreover, a university professor it talked to indicated that turning to VGA can often be the answer when connection problems with HDMI occur. It seems like the educational market is one of the few remaining segments that appreciates the inclusion of a VGA port.

The 15-pin VGA port is a very old standard, originally arriving with the 1987 IBM PS/2 PC. This analog output doesn't support as high resolutions and refresh rates as its modern rivals, of course, with the maximum specs 2048×1536px (QXGA) @85 Hz. Naturally, VGA is also losing support from visual output peripheral makers releasing new monitors, TVs, and projectors.

Mainstream laptop brands available in the West mostly phased out VGA ports in the 2010s. Usually, HDMI took its place. More recently, popular American brands have sought to minimize laptop ports and standardize on Thunderbolt / USB-C for everything. This offers simplicity, standard docking equipment, and facilitates thinner/lighter portables.

Reading this news from the West, we are again struck by how ‘futuristic' Japan seemingly clings to the oldest technologies. For example, we reported on Japanese bureaucracy still requiring floppy disks and/or optical media in the 2020s, despite efforts to phase them out.

Nikkei reports that Panasonic was basically the last bastion of support for the VGA port in consumer laptops. Fujitsu phased out the port in 2019, and NEC too. Yet both these rivals appear to retain some designs with VGA ports for corporate markets.

If you ever tried to get real work done on a 13-inch laptop while traveling, you probably know the agony: You're hunched over a tiny screen, juggling incessantly between tabs and just hoping you had a bit more space to breathe. That's where a second (portable) screen can be a game-changer on the road, transforming your productivity and comfort overnight. And thanks to a belated Memorial Day sale on Amazon, you can grab the fantastic Anyuse 15.6″ 1080p portable monitor for under $50, down from $69, which is a price that's essentially unheard of for a product like this.

See at Amazon

Normally, portable monitors of this quality land somewhere in the $90 to $140 range and even on sale it's rare to see them go for less than $70. That makes this $49 deal truly stand out. It's not every day you see a full HD, ultra-thin travel monitor go for a price that's almost impulse-buy territory.

This 15.6″ portable monitor features a crisp 1920×1080 full HD resolution for sharp text and vibrant images whether you're working on spreadsheets or streaming your favorite shows. The IPS panel provides a wide 178-degree viewing angle and colors stay true and clear no matter where you're sitting. With HDR support, your visuals get an extra boost in brightness and realism. The screen also includes low blue light technology which helps reduce eye strain and fatigue during long sessions.

Weighing in at only 1.37 pounds and measuring 0.04 inches thick, this Anyuse monitor slips into any backpack or laptop bag effortlessly. The built-in kickstand means you can prop it up anywhere from a small airplane tray table to a hotel desk without needing any extra accessories. It's the kind of device that makes working from anywhere not just possible, but actually pleasant.

This monitor comes with two fully-functional USB-C ports and a mini HDMI port which makes it so convenient to connect to all sorts of devices. Whether you are working with a laptop, MacBook, PC, smartphone, gaming console, just plug and play without any problem. Just make sure your device supports.

This display is also super useful: You can mirror your laptop display for making presentations in meetings, extend your desktop for multitasking or use it as a gaming display. Two built-in speakers also provide decent audio for calls.

If you're tired of being limited by your laptop's small screen when you travel or work on the road, don't hesitate.

I've thoroughly enjoyed leveling up my espresso machines over the years. My first was the De'Longhi Dedica Arte, a great beginner espresso machine that doesn't break the bank and has lasted me for well over 10 years.

Still, I'm excited about the new wave of espresso machines on the market and have had the pleasure to test a few of them over the past couple of years, like the uber-tech-forward Terra Kaffe TK-02 and the more straightforward De'Longhi Magnifica Start. Cappuccinos are my preferred coffee drink, and while I enjoy nerding out about my coffee with scales and temperature-based electric kettles, sometimes I want a machine to do the hard, technical work for me, like the new Ninja Luxe Cafe Premier Series Espresso Machine.

I usually have mixed feelings about equipment under the Ninja brand, which is often known for trying to do too much at once, but this machine is impressive. The Luxe Cafe machine comes with a lot of tricks up its sleeve and, even though it's semiautomatic and therefore doesn't do all the espresso work for you—it still has a traditional portafilter, for instance—it feels like having a coffee shop right in your home. I've been using it consistently for the past two months and it's incredibly user-friendly, offering the ability to create almost every coffee drink imaginable, from your usual espresso-based drinks to a traditional drip, cold brew, plus the ability to froth a cold foam.

Combine this with the extremely beginner-friendly aspects like a built-in scale that doses coffee grinds for you and the ability to recommend a grind size based on your last drink's performance, and it's an undeniable feat of an espresso machine. It does a lot, and does most of it well.

There are some aspects in which the Ninja feels overengineered, but for the relatively cheap(er) price of around $600, it's a solid investment, especially considering that one of Ninja's main competitors with this machine is the Breville Barista Express ($700).

As far as pulling espresso goes, the Ninja Luxe holds its own, with a stainless steel portafilter that fits two baskets—one for a double shot and a deeper, quad-size basket for traditional coffee drinks and cold brew. (That's right, no single shots available on this machine.) A nine-bar pressure system uses a stepped and lower-pressure pre-infusion mode and comes programmed with the usual espresso ratios: 1:2, 1:2.5, and 1:3.

Along with espresso, the Luxe can brew a traditional cup of coffee (from 6 to 18 ounces) and, in a process that takes about 10 minutes, also make a cold brew. There's some customizability, like choosing between Classic and Rich for your drip coffee or brewing it over ice. There's even an option to get your espresso cold-pressed. All of these are available on the fairly intuitive interface. Depending on which drink option you choose, the machine's built-in grinder will scale it out for you.

Pulling espresso is a fairly hands-on process—you grind, tamp, and insert the portafilter into the group head—but the Luxe's grinder and scale offer some help along the way to make the process more consistent.

The built-in grinder and scale are without a doubt the Luxe's most impressive qualities and include intuitive technology that's great for beginners. The grinder uses a conical burr system and has 25 settings. When you insert the portafilter into the grinder, the machine will read the basket you've chosen. Based on your drink choice, it'll recommend a grind size. Once you adjust the grind size, the Luxe will scale the proper dose of coffee grinds for you. Yes, the Luxe doses by weight, taking much of the guesswork out of the coffee-making process.

Based on how the previous espresso shot performs, the interface recommends the next drink's grind size. If the shot pulls too slow, it recommends a larger grind size. Too fast, and it recommends a smaller grind. Relying on this in the beginning was finicky and I had to pull quite a few bitter shots before I received a decent one, more than I expected when I was initially calibrating the Luxe to my beans. While it's been fairly solid since, occasionally I'll get an inconsistent shot and not know what changed. Those who like to get their coffee down to a science may not enjoy relying on the Luxe's “barista technology” to this extent, and it was something I had to get used to myself.

I really, really appreciate Ninja's take on the Luxe's milk steaming system. Some automatic espresso machines incorporate a container of milk that has to be brought back and forth from the refrigerator, like the ones from this list. The Luxe, however, keeps it classic with a pitcher that you simply add milk to and a wand that begins steaming at the press of a button, another reason why it's great for those who want barista-quality coffee drinks without all the guesswork.

You can manually steam milk if you so choose, or you can steam milk to four programmed settings, and this includes a cold foam. There's also a setting for a plant-based option, and the Luxe adjusts automatically to this. I had little to no issues with this milk frother and enjoyed the opportunity to practice some latte art, even if the pitcher's spout isn't ideal for it.

The Luxe has a removable hopper and rapid heat-up time, which are fantastic. To the left of the machine is where much of your coffee's assembly happens. Before you grind your coffee, you'll place a funnel on the portafilter to keep it in place. Unfortunately, after a couple months of use, the funnel's plastic corners are chipping.

When not in use, there's a designated spot for the funnel on the left side of the machine alongside the pressure-click tamper. I really like this tamper, as tamping is something I often overthink (Am I creating enough pressure? Do I have an even surface?), and the Luxe's is designed for you to apply the ideal amount of pressure.

The water reservoir doesn't come with a filter, unfortunately. As for the drip tray, it's easy to remove and clean. An orange notch pops up when the tray needs to be emptied. On average, I empty the drip tray every four to five drinks. A handful of times the machine has leaked, even with the drip tray being empty.

A shelf allows the Luxe to accommodate your 2-ounce espresso shots but can be removed to allow room for a travel mug as large as 18 ounces. One common gripe about the Luxe is that despite the portafilter having two spouts, there is not enough room to accommodate two espresso cups on the shelf or drip tray, which is strange. However, one of the biggest misses on this machine is that there's no hot water spout, something I particularly enjoyed with a machine like the De'Longhi Magnifica Start.

My beef with many Ninja kitchen appliances is that sometimes they try to do too much, like the cooler with an added “frost vault.” The Ninja Luxe Cafe feels different, however, considering how intentional it was in competing with other new-age espresso machines. Pulling espresso is solid and, while occasionally inconsistent, delivers an overall smooth and robust shot. The drip coffee was good, not great, and the cold brew can be bitter since it uses the room-temperature water from the filter.

Like many Ninja products, the machine sits in a weird space. A coffee purist may choose a straightforward machine without all the assists of the Luxe, while a true beginner may not feel comfortable investing in the Luxe's “all-in-one” style. Nevertheless, it's an overall quality piece of equipment at a fair price that makes me view the Ninja brand with respect when it comes to its coffee game.

If you've ever shopped for a high-performance laptop, you're probably aware of how quickly prices explode past the $2,000 mark, especially when you want real power under the hood. But every once in a while, a deal comes along that's so out of the ordinary and it feels like an alien has landed in the laptop market.

That's exactly what's happening right now with this HP 17.3″ touchscreen 64GB RAM / 2TB SSD / Intel Core 7 laptop which has seen its price slashed by an almost unbelievable $3,700 on Amazon just after Memorial Day: At $1,139 down from a typical $4,809, this laptop is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to own a performance machine at a price that's almost unheard of.

See at Amazon

Let's get into the specs, because this HP laptop is a beast by any measure: At the center of it all is Intel's newest Core 7-150U processor with 10 cores and up to 5.4 GHz turbo speeds. This CPU provides the sort of raw power typically found in high-end desktops. Whether you're crunching huge spreadsheets, editing 4K video, or running dozens of browser tabs at the same time, this processor won't bat an eye. Pair that with a staggering 64GB of RAM, and you've got a multitasking beast that can handle anything you can throw at it. Storage is just as impressive: With a 2TB PCIe SSD, you get scorching boot times, almost instant file opening, and ample room for all your projects, media, and documents.

The 17.3-inch HD+ touchscreen display is perfect if you want a larger work surface. Brightview technology and 250 nits of brightness ensure it's easy on the eyes even during marathon work sessions and the touch functionality adds an additional level of flexibility perfect for creative apps and presentations. The full-sized backlit keyboard with number pad allows you to work efficiently under any lighting and the HP True Vision 720p HD webcam along with dual array microphones makes video calls and web-based conferencing clear and audible.

Connectivity is also future-proofed, with Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.3 for blisteringly fast wireless performance along with an ample selection of ports like USB Type-C, HDMI 1.4b, and multiple USB Type-A ports. Whether you need to connect to external displays, projectors, or high-speed storage solutions, this laptop has you covered.

One of the most impressive extras is perhaps the fact that this laptop includes a lifetime license for Microsoft Office Professional: That's complete versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Access, and Publisher—no subscription, no hidden fees, just the whole suite for as long as you own the laptop. If you need to download Office for school or work, that's worth a lot of added value right there. And to top it all off, HP throws in a free mouse.

Deals like this don't last long, and it's hard to imagine seeing a price drop of nearly $3,700 on a laptop of this caliber ever again. Make sure you grab yours before it runs out of stock.

As the chief merchandising officer for one of the largest sellers on Amazon, Owen Carr knew that the deck chairs he ordered from a Chinese factory in early April would cost him more than ever before. That's because the chairs, which normally go for $79 on Amazon, were among the first Chinese imports subject to minimum tariffs of 145 percent—a sky-high rate imposed by President Donald Trump—when they arrived at a port in Seattle in late April. “I was paying more to customs than to the factory for the good itself,” Carr says. “Mind boggling.”

Now his company, Spreetail, is part of a narrow class of importers asking whether the Trump administration might provide a refund. On May 12, Trump reached a 90-day trade-war truce with China, cutting the minimum China tariffs to just 30 percent. The higher rate was in effect barely a month, from April 10 through May 14. “We did think there would be an agreement, but we didn't think it would be that fast and that low,” Carr says.

A handful of trade attorneys who spoke with WIRED say they have told clients that refunds are unprecedented and unlikely—but not impossible. Businesses that had to pay the higher rate believe they were unfairly ensnared in Trump's hasty negotiations. “There's still a chance” of refunds, says Michael Roll, a partner at Roll & Harris. “I wouldn't say there's hope. I wouldn't bet on that.”

Trump, Congress, or the courts would have to authorize a new tariffs exemption for companies caught up in the trade deal for refunds to become a reality. Attorneys say their clients have been lobbying the Trump administration and lawmakers for exemptions, including retroactive measures that would result in money back. It's not a frivolous request. Companies that make cars, chips, and drugs have been spared from other tariff policies.

US Customs and Border Protection, which administers tariffs and exemptions, did not respond to a request for comment about the possibility of refunds.

Trump views his trade policies as crucial to increasing US manufacturing and gaining power over China. But his moves are beginning to erode the prices and product selection long familiar to US consumers, according to retail data and experts. Giving 115 percent back to merchants who paid the higher tariff rate would help avert further price increases and allow them to stay afloat if Trump renews tariff hikes, attorneys say. “For all but the most profitable and largest companies, this has been devastating,” says Ron Oleynik, a partner at law firm Holland & Knight.

Paying higher tariffs even once can have long-term consequences for small to midsize companies, attorneys say. US rules require importers to hold a bond—effectively insurance—so that the government can claim at least some funds from companies that flout the law and don't pay what they owe. The level of insurance required is determined by a business' total tariff payments over the past 12 months; as coverage requirements rise, so do the overall costs of the bond. “I have heard this is going to kill us if we have to up our bonds,” Oleynik says.

Companies such as Spreetail recognized the risks of importing goods after Trump imposed a 125 percent tariff on Chinese imports last month. Many businesses decided against placing new orders, and others quickly halted shipments that were in progress. But Carr says Spreetail wanted to support its suppliers, who might otherwise have had to shut down factories as orders tumbled. He also felt confident that he could raise prices enough to make new imports financially worthwhile.

Spreetail ended up paying elevated rates on the deck chairs and about 200 other products out of the 20,000 it imports, which include Razor scooters, ChargePoint EV chargers, and Sterilite boxes, Carr says. It paid rates as high as 190 percent after accounting for item-specific tariffs. “We will not be able to get those dollars back,” Carr adds, perhaps resigned to the limited prospect of refunds.

Companies have managed to get some money back. Products that were in transit when the higher tariff rate went into effect were exempted from having to pay it. But some of the initial bills importers received didn't reflect that. A straw-hat importer, who didn't provide their name when asked in a series of direct messages on Reddit, tells WIRED that they successfully wrangled for an exemption and brought their tariffs rate to about 61 percent from an initially feared nearly 177 percent—though the rate is still double the 31.5 percent they paid in 2023.

Though the lobbying push in Washington, DC, is moving forward, better luck may come from judges. Several lawsuits brought by businesses and states have alleged that Trump lacked the authority to impose recent tariffs such as those on Chinese imports. Some initial rulings are possible within days, but final decisions and any resulting refunds may be years away. Oregon attorney general Dan Rayfield, who is leading one of the cases, says that if he wins, the federal government must give back “every cent of the illegal tariffs collected.”

If the court cases fail, then businesses could resort to a last-minute plea in about 16 months, which is generally the deadline to protest import bills. Mark Tallo, a partner at law firm Sandler, Travis & Rosenberg, says he's telling clients to keep their ledgers open. “Wait until month 15,” he says. There might just be a new ray of hope.

Loud and proud.

Demand for high-performance, high-capacity storage devices is growing, and to meet it, manufacturers sometimes go to rather extreme ways. Take a look at Utran Technology, which introduced a PCIe 5.0 x16 add-in card at Computex that packs 28 M.2 NVMe SSDs offering read and write throughput of 109 GB/s and storage capacity of up to 224 TB.



At the heart of the device is the Broadcom PEX89144 — a 144-lane PCIe 5.0 switch to manage connectivity and bandwidth distribution across all drives — that enables simultaneous access to all 28 SSDs through a PCIe x16 slot and two x8 cables. Such a topology enables the unit to bypass typical lane and slot limitations while maintaining physical compatibility with all systems supporting full height full length (FHFL) cards.

As far as performance concerns, the card (well, rather a system) delivers an aggregate sequential read throughput of over 109,600 MB/s (about 109.6 GB/s) and more than 418,000 IOPS, as shown in the Iometer benchmark performed by the company. In addition, the unit has an average I/O response time of just 0.48 milliseconds, highlighting exceptional latencies enabled by the PEX89144 switch.



CPU usage during the test performed by the company hovered around 30%, suggesting headroom for parallel compute tasks or additional I/O operations. This level of performance, combined with a relatively low latency, makes the device quite an appealing choice for a variety of datacenter applications that require both capacity and performance.

The card is, of course, power hungry. Ultran says it can draw about 400W, though we can only wonder from where it draws that power, considering the fact that it only has one eight-pin auxiliary PCIe power connector.

The dense layout and a compact cooling system using a radiator and a high-pressure fan enable the device to work in rack-scale storage deployments, so with eight of such cards, one can store 1.792PB of data. On the one hand, such storage density is not really high, though keeping in mind the very high performance offered by such a storage subsystem, this can make sense for such storage applications.

There are still some things to keep in mind about the card. First up, it is not hot swappable. Secondly, it does not seem that there is power loss protection on the card level, so one must use SSDs with power loss protection on the drive level. Assuming that one uses ATP SSDs that can actually monitor power levels remaining in capacitors, enabling their power loss protection, this may well be quite a reliable storage solution. Furthermore, the drive supports management functions like USB terminal control, which could enable external monitoring or firmware updates. Also, the card is cooled down using a single high-pressure fan. Such fans are widely used in the datacenter industry.

Utran plans to start selling its 28-way M.2 adapter this summer for a rather eye-watering price of around $3,000. Then again, the Broadcom PEX89144 is not a cheap solution.

CXMT just reached peak DDR4 production, but it's now prioritizing DDR5.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Top Chinese DRAM manufacturer ChangXin Memory Technologies (CXMT) will reportedly phase out DDR4 memory for servers and PCs by the middle of next year. According to Digitimes, the company is making this sudden shift to accommodate the directives of the Chinese Communist Party, especially as Beijing is pushing the country to take the global lead in AI and cloud infrastructure. In line with this, CXMT is also believed to be prioritizing work on HBM technology, targeting validation of its HBM3 chips by late this year.

This announcement caught many in the industry off guard, especially as the company had just begun mass production of DDR4 memory in late 2024. This ramp-up in capacity, paired with aggressive pricing, has caused leading memory manufacturers Micron, Samsung, and SK hynix to end production of DDR3 and DDR4 chips by late 2025.

But as the Chinese government focuses on AI to compete against the U.S.'s technological supremacy, Beijing is likely directing its local tech giants to give their support. Because of this, industry analysts anticipate CXMT issuing an end-of-life notice for its DDR4 as early as the third quarter of this year. Despite that, DD4 supply has seemingly dried up, with some 8 GB chips jumping in price by 150% because of the lack of supply.

The overall market is heading towards DDR5 production to accommodate the demand for newer devices, but a few DDR4 manufacturing lines will remain. DigiTimes Asia says that CXMT will keep making it for GigaDevice to satisfy demand for consumer memory, while Samsung and SK hynix will keep on producing them using 1z-nm nodes. That means they do not require EUV tools, which are better utilized to produce newer chips.

Despite CXMT's success in DDR4 memory, its DDR5 chips reportedly still face some issues. It's been reported that some of its latest samples have failed some tests, with the memory chips becoming unstable when they hit 60 degrees Celsius and up, some 25 degrees lower than the up to 85 degrees Celsius that Samsung chips can operate in. There's also doubt whether CXMT's DDR5 memory would perform as expected in sub-zero temperatures. This likely would not be an issue with most users, though.

China's chip industry could emerge more resilient from U.S. sanctions

A new report claims that U.S. sanctions and restrictions placed on the semiconductor market to stifle China's growth may actually be fueling a rise in China's own semiconductor industry, building a more resilient ecosystem, and inadvertently accelerating China's ambitions in the market.

As reported by Digitimes, although the U.S. and China have agreed on a 90-day trade agreement to suspend the harshest tariffs between the two nations, "tensions in the semiconductor sector are escalating."

Digitimes says the rising temperature has put Taiwan's IC substrate manufacturers operating in China under renewed scrutiny, revealing some doubt about the efficacy of U.S. Sanctions.

As noted by the report, Taiwan's substrate supply chain delivered unexpectedly strong results in Q1 2025. According to Digitimes, a "stark difference" in positioning of companies in Taiwan versus China reveals the possibility that "China's semiconductor ecosystem may be accelerating its rise, even under U.S. restrictions."

As the report notes, President Trump has jettisoned the Biden administration's tiered chip diffusion rules in favor of a blanket ban on the global use of Huawei's Ascend AI chips and measures to prevent the export of other AI chips to China, a move Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang branded "a failure."

The report highlights the contrasting fortunes of Unimicron and Zhen Ding Technology. The former has reported depressed high-end capacity utilization at its China plants as a result of tightened chip restrictions. The world's foremost IC substrate maker has seen a rebound in orders at its Taiwan facilities to offset the slump, but executives remain concerned that escalating sanctions could see a permanent reduction in high-margin business from China's premium electronics sector.

Conversely, Zhen Ding – the case study behind the theory that sanctions are buoying China's chip industry – is reportedly seeing strong momentum in China's domestic markets. It reportedly credits its "China for China" strategy (prioritizing local production for local demand) as a key factor behind a 30% YoY revenue increase in its substrate division.

According to Digitimes, continued increase in China demand could even see Zhen Ding leverage its Taiwan Kaohsiung AI park to meet demand needs, reversing the flow of the supply chain.

The upshot, according to industry observers cited in the report, is that this strong performance points to a "critical paradox," namely, Digitimes says that "instead of crippling China's semiconductor ambitions, U.S. sanctions may be inadvertently accelerating them," with domestic demand and supply chain localization creating a resilient ecosystem that "that could emerge stronger in the face of adversity."

The sentiment broadly reflects Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's comments on the ban on AI chip exports recently. As mentioned, he branded the measures a failure, and specifically noted that companies are turning to Nvidia's Chinese rivals to make up for the dearth in U.S.-developed chips like its H20, giving its competitors a leg up rather than stifling the industry.

Recently, a report claimed that Nvidia is planning to launch new Blackwell-based solutions for China towards the end of the year to supersede its banned H20.

Dr LoConte spotlights emerging research that now ties alcohol to cancers beyond the well-known “big seven,” including prostate, pancreatic, and stomach cancers. Despite this growing evidence, many physicians still don't ask patients about alcohol use. She urges clinicians — especially oncologists — to normalize these conversations in everyday care, provide nonstigmatizing support, and acknowledge how deeply embedded drinking is in social norms. It's a call to action to reframe alcohol as a critical lifestyle factor in cancer care.

The American Society of Hematology (ASH) and the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) released new and updated clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of pediatric venous thromboembolism (VTE). The guidelines, published in ASH's peer-reviewed journal Blood Advances, were developed by an expert panel following a rigorous review process. They aim to improve health outcomes by providing evidence-based recommendations for managing VTE in children. 

The new and updated pediatric VTE clinical guidelines incorporate the latest research in the field and mark the first update to the guidelines since their publication in 2018. In total, 16 recommendations were updated and four were added. One of the most notable changes is the new recommendation for direct oral anticoagulants over standard-of-care anticoagulants. Specifically, this recommendation advises clinicians to consider dabigatran or rivaroxaban over therapies such as low molecular weight heparin and vitamin k antagonist. 

"These evidence-based guidelines are a key resource for clinicians to improve the quality of care for this vulnerable population," said Belinda R. Avalos, MD, ASH president. "The recommendations are updated to incorporate the latest science, and we are glad to have collaborated with the ISTH on this project." 

 Collaborating with ASH on these updated pediatric VTE guidelines reflects the ISTH's commitment to ensuring that children affected by VTE receive the most effective, evidence-based care. It's critical that we continue advancing research and education in this area to support better outcomes for young patients worldwide." 

 Pantep Angchaisuksiri, MD, ISTH president

VTE sometimes manifests as deep vein thrombosis, when a blood clot forms in the deep veins, or pulmonary embolism, when a blood clot blocks an artery in the lung. Although the incidence of VTE in children at a population level is very low, it is higher in children who are hospitalized and can be life-threatening. 

"Thrombosis in children is an increasingly common complication in children with complex illnesses and conditions and, if not managed well, can impact long-term outcomes for these patients," said Paul Monagle, MD, MBBS, MSc, a pediatric hematologist and professor of pediatrics at the University of Melbourne and chair of the ASH ISTH Guidelines on Treatment of Pediatric VTE. "The care of children is important, and parents should know that there is a body of evidence that supports their child's treatment options."

As part of a $93 million grant package, the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas, known for funding groundbreaking projects, has awarded the University of Houston $3 million to set up a Cancer Immunotherapy Biomarker Core. This state-of-the-art facility will offer researchers in Texas the most comprehensive targeted proteomic cancer biomarker screens currently feasible, particularly in the field of cancer biology and immunotherapy. 

UH CIBC will be the first such facility in Texas to offer targeted proteomics, which is the technology that makes it possible to study thousands of proteins at once and will offer its services at a minimized cost partly subsidized by CPRIT funding. 

Identifying better biomarkers for cancer will accelerate early diagnosis and better prognostication of cancer, better monitoring of disease progression and treatment response possibly leading to the identification of better medications for treating cancer. All of these will lead to reduced cancer associated morbidity and mortality." 

Chandra Mohan, Hugh Roy and Lillie Cranz Cullen Endowed Professor of Biomedical Engineering and project director

Rather than targeting cancer cells directly, immunotherapy treats cancer by training the immune system to find and attack the cancer cells. 

"Cancer immunotherapy is experiencing a meteoric rise, and this new chapter in oncology demands a new array of biomarkers, including blood and tissue biomarkers that predict who might respond best to immunotherapy, and biomarkers that help researchers identify the best targets for immunotherapy," said Mohan. 

To meet these needs the CIBC will offer four unique platforms that include a 11,000- plex targeted proteomic screen that allows 11,000 specific proteins to be screened in any single body fluid sample, representing the largest proteomic coverage possible, as well as 21,000-plex protein array platform that allows scientists to assess the specificity of autoantibodies/ligands against the entire human proteome. 

The core is designed to meet these objectives: 

To offer targeted exploratory proteomic technologies for protein biomarker discovery 

To offer targeted exploratory technologies for identifying novel autoantibodies, neoantigens and binding ligands 

To educate and promote the adoption of contemporary proteomic technologies among Texas researchers 

Mohan, an MD/PhD, has over two decades of expertise in engineering diagnostic arrays and using the platforms offered and is a member of the UH Drug Discovery Institute. He has reported novel biomarkers for colorectal, bladder, prostate, stomach and pancreatic cancers. Weiyi Peng, also an MD/PhD, an immunologist and associate professor of biology and biochemistry, will co-lead the CIBC. She directs the Drug Discovery Institute Immunology Core, with more than 100 UH faculty members. Peng has long-standing expertise in immunoassays and has led projects on T cell-mediated anti-tumor immune response pathways using genetic screens and preclinical models. 

"We are thrilled that Drs. Mohan and Peng received this award. The core is dedicated to immunology research, which aligns with our research priorities," said Claudia Neuhauser, University of Houston vice president for research. "It will add a critical component to our research infrastructure and synergize with the University-wide Drug Discovery Institute that supports immunology research." 

CPRIT is considered a national model for a state-based, voter-approved cancer research and prevention initiative. All CPRIT grant applications undergo rigorous, independent, unbiased, merit-based peer review.

A one-year study in healthy women who were also consistently cycling every 21-36 days and had normal ovulation, showed that it is usual to experience mild breast tenderness and swelling before the next period. Breast tenderness and swelling are common concerns associated with the menstrual cycle. However, little research previously has indicated how or if these breast symptoms are linked with ovulation.

"Previous research has not clarified if breast tenderness and swelling, that may be experienced before menstruation, are part of a 'premenstrual syndrome' (PMS) and thus a problem and abnormal, or are something that is to be expected," said Dr. Azita Goshtasebi, a family physician, and co-author who helped design the study.

"Our study evaluated the experiences of 53 healthy women over the course of a year and found that minimal breast swelling and breast tenderness usually occurred before flow in regular, ovulatory menstrual cycles," reported the lead researcher, Dr. Mary Wood. She began this work as a medical student and is currently an internal medicine resident at the University of British Columbia.

Dr. Sonia Shirin, co-author and UBC Centre for Menstrual Cycle and Ovulation research associate, explained: "Breast symptoms-including whether or not there was any breast tenderness and the breasts changed in size-were recorded daily in the Menstrual Cycle Diary©. Also, ovulation or egg release was confirmed using the validated Quantitative Basal Temperature© analysis in these community women over an average of 13 cycles each."

This is the first longitudinal study to characterize breast experiences with confirmed ovulation. We were surprised to find that women actually had more breast tenderness and swelling when they had normal ovulation, compared to ovulatory disturbed cycles with short luteal phases (<10 days) or anovulation (no ovulation)."

Dr. Jerilynn C. Prior, principal investigator

"These results are exciting because a better understanding of what are 'normal' or 'healthy' menstrual cycle experiences are critical in order to identify women with recurrent ovulatory disturbances even though their cycles are regular and of normal lengths," said Dr. Wood. "There are possible long-term health consequences associated with disturbed ovulation within normal cycles including bone loss and risk for earlier heart attacks."

"Note that the relationship of breast tenderness and swelling with normally ovulatory cycles was only possible to show when we examined the experiences of all 53 women in 491 ovulatory cycles versus the 199 with ovulatory disturbances. That disappeared when we studied only the 47 women who had 420 normally ovulatory and 199 ovulatory disturbed cycles," Dr. Shirin shared. "That may be because we had fewer normally ovulatory cycles."

This study included 53 women, ages 20-41, with menstrual cycle data from an average of 13 cycles each.

Results showed that the median breast tenderness on a 0-4 scale was 1.4, and the change in breast size from usual on a 1-5 scale, where three represents no change, was 4.

A total of 694 cycles had ovulation status documented by temperature analysis, of which 71 per cent were determined to be normally ovulatory; 26 per cent had short luteal phase lengths; and three per cent were anovulatory. Given the small number of anovulatory cycles recorded, unfortunately, the researchers were not able to analyze anovulatory cycle data directly.

A specific group of nerve cells in the brain stem appears to control how semaglutide affects appetite and weight – without causing nausea. The discovery, made at the University of Gothenburg, could pave the way for better drugs to treat obesity.

Semaglutide belongs to a group of drugs called GLP-1R agonists and has been shown to effectively reduce food intake and body weight. The drug is already well established as part of the treatment for obesity and type 2 diabetes, but can cause side effects such as nausea and muscle loss.

In a new study, researchers at the Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg have shown that it is possible to distinguish the nerve cells in the brain that control the beneficial effects – such as reduced food intake and fat loss – from those that contribute to side effects. The study is published in the journal Cell Metabolism.

To investigate how semaglutide affects the brain, the researchers worked with mice. They tracked which nerve cells were activated by the drug and were then able to stimulate these cells – without administering the drug itself.

The result was that the mice ate less and lost weight, just as they did when treated with semaglutide. When these nerve cells were killed, the drug's effect on appetite and fat loss instead decreased significantly. However, side effects such as nausea and muscle loss remained.

This suggests that these nerve cells control the beneficial effects of semaglutide. We have therefore identified a specific group of nerve cells that is necessary for the effects that semaglutide has on weight and appetite, but which does not appear to contribute to any significant extent to side effects such as nausea. If we can target the treatment there, we may be able to maintain the positive effects while reducing side effects."

Júlia Teixidor-Deulofeu, first author of the study and PhD student at Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg

The identified nerve cells are located in an area of the brain called the dorsal vagal complex. For the researchers, the result is not only an early step toward potentially improved treatment, it also provides new knowledge about how semaglutide works in the brain. The study also provides deeper insight into how the brain stem regulates our energy balance.

"Semaglutide and other GLP-1R agonists are currently being prescribed to more and more people and are also being investigated for other potential indications such as substance use disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. It is important to understand how these drugs actually work. The better we understand this, the greater the opportunity we have to improve them," says Linda Engström Ruud, researcher and supervisor to PhD students Júlia Teixidor-Deulofeu and Sebastian Blid Sköldheden, who both worked on the project.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) published the new Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG): Surgical Management of Chronic Rhinosinusitis today in Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) affects 11.6% of adults and prompts 4.1 million annual ambulatory visits.

Chronic rhinosinusitis doesn't just affect the nose-it can influence a person's general life. Patients can struggle with poor sleep, brain fog, depression, anxiety, and reduced productivity that ripples through their relationships and work or school performance."

Jennifer J. Shin, MD, SM, Chair of the CPG Guideline Development Group

"Many people don't realize that chronic rhinosinusitis can affect patients as much as diseases that have traditionally been viewed as life-threatening or more serious. Patients with CRS face daily challenges that deserve our full attention and comprehensive care. This CPG provides the guidance for developing the needed care pathways for patients who may undergo surgery for CRS, based on current best evidence, such as systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized control trials, as well as observational studies when these were more apt for specific clinical research questions."

CRS is diagnosed when a patient has two or more symptoms or signs of CRS for 12 weeks or longer, and inflammation is documented by one or more findings. The symptoms and signs include:

Some people with chronic sinus problems need surgery when medications alone don't provide enough relief. For certain types of sinus disease, having surgery sooner can help prevent worsening symptoms and reduce pain. Surgery works especially well for people who have fungal infections or nasal polyps (small growths), since these conditions often don't respond well to medication alone. Surgery may also help people whose sinus problems cause frequent infections, ongoing symptoms, or make other conditions like asthma worse.

This CPG provides proven, research-based recommendations for the best ways to treat chronic sinus problems. Specifically, through 11 evidence-based key action statements, it covers the main surgery and additional treatments that might be needed, as well as follow-up procedures when necessary. The goal is to ensure patients receive excellent care before, during, and after their sinus surgery, while making sure doctors clearly explain treatment options and involve patients in making informed decisions about their care.

The guideline development group consisted of 18 panel members representing experts in specialties/subspecialities encompassing rhinology, comprehensive otolaryngology, otolaryngic allergy, otorhinolaryngological advanced practice provision, as well as a consumer representative.

Scientists have unearthed surprising details about how our bodies handle insulin – the hormone that plays a crucial role in regulating blood sugar and developing diabetes.

The discovery could lead to better treatment of type 2 diabetes and earlier diagnosis, potentially even before the disease develops.

In a new paper in the scientific journal Cell, researchers from the University of Copenhagen found that all individuals have unique and varying degrees of insulin resistance at the molecular level.

The discovery of this 'molecular fingerprint' for insulin sensitivity challenges the traditional binary classification of people as being either healthy or living with type 2 diabetes.

We found huge variation in insulin sensitivity, even among people considered healthy and among those diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. There are even some individuals living with type 2 diabetes who respond better to insulin than healthy individuals. Our study highlights the need to move beyond separating people into two boxes and recognize individual variation."

Atul Deshmukh, Associate Professor from the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, CBMR, University of Copenhagen

He is one of the senior authors of the research that was carried out in collaboration with Karolinska Institutet in Sweden and Steno Diabetes Center in Denmark.

The breakthrough was made using cutting-edge protein analysis, known as proteomics, to study how insulin affects muscle tissue. This approach enabled the team to map molecular changes in muscle biopsies from over 120 individuals.

Their analyses revealed that certain proteins change consistently as insulin resistance develops. These molecular signatures could help identify people at risk earlier than current clinical methods allow – even before symptoms appear.

"By learning more about the molecular signatures of insulin resistance, we're building the foundation for precision medicine in type 2 diabetes tailored to each patient. Our research is a big step in that direction," adds Anna Krook, Professor at Karolinska Institutet and co-lead author of the study.

In addition, the researchers were able to use these molecular fingerprints to precisely predict how well the body handles insulin.

"When we combine this deep, clinical data with the molecular signatures of insulin resistance, we suddenly understand a lot more about people's insulin resistance that we can use to design precision medicine," says Jeppe Kjærgaard Northcote, first author of the study and researcher at CBMR.

Taking a statin medication is an effective, safe, and low-cost way to lower cholesterol and reduce risk of cardiovascular events. Despite clinicians recommending that many patients with diabetes take statins, nearly one-fifth of them opt to delay treatment. In a new study, researchers from Mass General Brigham found that patients who started statin therapy right away reduced the rate of heart attack and stroke by one third compared to those who chose to delay taking the medication. The results, which can help guide decision-making conversations between clinicians and their patients, are published in the Journal of the American Heart Association

I see patients with diabetes on a regular basis, and I recommend statin therapy to everyone who is eligible. Some people refuse because they want to first try lifestyle interventions or other drugs. But other interventions are not as effective at lowering cholesterol as starting statin therapy as soon as possible. Time is of the essence for your heart and brain health."

Alexander Turchin, MD, MS, senior author of the Division of Endocrinology, Brigham and Women's Hospital

Heart attacks and strokes remain the leading cause of complications and mortality for patients with diabetes. Statin therapy reduces risk of these cardiovascular events by preventing plaque buildup in the blood vessels, which, once accumulated, prevents delivery of oxygen and essential nutrients to the heart and brain.

The researchers used an artificial intelligence method called Natural Language Processing to gather data from the electronic health records of 7,239 patients at Mass General Brigham who ultimately started statin therapy during the nearly 20-year study period. The median patient age was 55, with 51% being women, 57% white, and the median HbA1c-a measure of blood sugar-being 6.9.

Nearly one-fifth (17.7%) of the patients in the study declined statin therapy when it was first recommended by their clinicians, then later accepted the therapy (after a median of 1.5 years) upon repeated recommendation by their clinician. Of those who delayed, 8.5% had a heart attack or stroke. But for patients who started statins immediately, the rate of those cardiovascular events was just 6.4%.

"Clinicians should recognize the increased cardiovascular risk associated with delaying statin therapy for patients with diabetes and use this information to guide shared decision-making conversations with their patients," said Turchin.

Public healthcare emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can drastically disrupt healthcare systems with long-term repercussions. The effects of such healthcare crises are more pronounced in the aging population, who are particularly vulnerable to chronic infections and sudden disruptions in healthcare.

The COVID-19 outbreak that emerged in December 2019 quickly spread worldwide, and several emergency measures were urgently implemented to curb its transmission. During the initial phase of the pandemic, stringent measures like social distancing, isolation, and mandatory wearing of masks were implemented. Unfortunately, older individuals were at a higher risk of acquiring the infection and were more likely to experience negative outcomes. The fear of infection, coupled with the state of emergency (SoE) declarations, has led to older adults refraining from seeking necessary medical care.

While initial responses to the pandemic have been well-documented, its long-term impact on healthcare utilization and access among the elderly remains unclear. Furthermore, the prolonged pandemic was characterized by the spread of relatively less virulent strains, gradual relaxation of stringent measures, and widespread vaccination, with limited data on the effect of this transition.

To bridge this knowledge gap, researchers from Waseda University, Japan, sought to analyze the effects of the extended phase-from November 2021 to September 2022-on older adults in Japan, one of the world's most aged societies with a universal healthcare system. The team comprised of Associate Professor Rong Fu from the Faculty of Commerce, master's student Sizhe Liu from the Graduate School of Commerce, Assistant Professor Masato Oikawa from the Faculty of Education and Integrated Arts and Sciences, Professor Haruko Noguchi from the Faculty of Political Science and Economics, and Professor Akira Kawamura from the Faculty of Human Sciences.

Explaining the rationale behind their research, Fu, the lead author, says, "As populations age globally, maintaining healthcare access during public health emergencies becomes increasingly critical. Our research addresses this challenge by providing insights into how healthcare systems can balance infection control with continued access to essential services for vulnerable elderly populations." Their findings were published online in Scientific Reports by Nature Research on April 22, 2025.

The researchers used a comprehensive dataset of 189,841,257 medical claims linked with income tax records from the long-term care insurance system to analyze trends in healthcare utilization among Japan's oldest-old population aged 75 years and above. They correlated trends in healthcare access and utilization with the implementation of public health measures, crisis severity, and socioeconomic status.

The analysis revealed that the implementation of precautionary measures led to a modest drop in the use of medical services and outpatient visits. Nevertheless, healthcare costs and services remained stable despite a decrease in patient volumes. The use of medical services varied across different residential areas depending on crisis severity and the extent of precautionary measures. Notably, there was no difference in healthcare utilization across different income levels except for dental services. Dental care visits by older adults with a lower income were significantly lower than high-income groups, highlighting socioeconomic disparities in dental care during public emergencies.

Overall, these findings suggest that healthcare adaptations can address the needs of the elderly during medical emergencies and help avoid medical delays with dire consequences. Adaptations may include integrated monitoring systems, enhanced safety protocols to bridge gaps in preventive dental care, early warning systems, and flexible delivery options, such as remote or mobile care, to improve accessibility for vulnerable groups.

"Our findings can help inform policymakers who devise targeted interventions to prevent socioeconomic disparities in healthcare access from widening during crises. Additionally, for healthcare providers, our research demonstrates the importance of maintaining service intensity even when visit frequency fluctuates," Fu adds.

Newly confirmed COVID-19 cases and governmental emergency responses. Notes: COVID-19 case data were obtained from the official governmental website. Data collection ended on May 7, 2023, due to the reclassification of COVID-19 to a Category V Infectious Disease. Information regarding the enforcement of SoE and SoPE policies was gathered from the official website of the Cabinet Agency for Infectious Diseases Crisis Management. The gray shaded area in both graphs denotes the study period.

A new study to be presented at the SLEEP 2025 annual meeting quantifies the amount of sleep loss experienced by first-time mothers in the weeks after giving birth and is the first to identify the unique type of sleep disruption that persists throughout the first months of motherhood.

Results show that the average daily sleep duration of new mothers was 4.4 hours during the first week after giving birth compared with a pre-pregnancy sleep duration of 7.8 hours. Their longest stretch of uninterrupted sleep also fell from 5.6 hours at pre-pregnancy to 2.2 hours in the first week after delivery. Nearly one-third of participants (31.7%) went more than 24 hours without sleep in the first week with a newborn.

The daily sleep duration of new moms increased to 6.7 hours across postpartum weeks 2 through 7 and 7.3 hours across weeks 8 through 13. However, their longest stretch of uninterrupted sleep remained significantly lower than pre-pregnancy levels at 3.2 hours in weeks 2 through 7 and 4.1 hours in weeks 8 through 13. This novel finding reveals that sleep discontinuity remains a problem for new mothers even as their total nightly sleep duration gradually returns to pre-pregnancy levels.

"The significant loss of uninterrupted sleep in the postpartum period was the most dramatic finding," said lead author Teresa Lillis, who has a doctorate in clinical psychology and is an adjunct professor in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. "While mothers generally returned to their pre-pregnancy total nightly sleep duration after the first postpartum week, the structure of their sleep remained profoundly altered. These results fundamentally transform our understanding of postpartum sleep; it's not the lack of sleep, but rather, the lack of uninterrupted sleep that is the largest challenge for new mothers."

The study involved 41 first-time mothers between the ages of 26 and 43 years. They provided their wearable sleep data from their personal Fitbit devices for a full year before childbirth through the end of the first year after giving birth.

Lillis noted that these findings explain why new mothers continue to feel exhausted even when they get the recommended 7 or more hours of sleep per night. The study results also identify sleep discontinuity as a potential risk factor and intervention target for postpartum depression and other postpartum-related health issues.

Our results validate the lived experience of new mothers' exhaustion and provide a new target for sleep-related interventions. Rather than simply encouraging mothers to 'nap when the baby naps', our findings show that mothers would most benefit from strategies that protect opportunities for uninterrupted sleep."

This study was supported by trackthatsleep LLC, for which Lillis serves as CEO. The study was conducted at Washington State University's Sleep and Performance Research Center with co-investigators Devon Hansen and Hans Van Dongen.

The research abstract was published recently in an online supplement of the journal Sleep and will be presented Monday, June 9, during SLEEP 2025 in Seattle. SLEEP is the annual meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies, a joint venture of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Sleep Research Society.

Researchers are investigating the mechanisms and identifying new areas of the brain that can benefit patients when stimulated.

Persons with Parkinson's disease increasingly lose their mobility over time and are eventually unable to walk. Hope for these patients rests on deep brain stimulation, also known as a brain pacemaker. In a current study, researchers at Ruhr University Bochum and Philipps-Universität Marburg, Germany, investigated whether and how stimulation of a certain region of the brain can have a positive impact on ambulatory ability and provide patients with higher quality of life. To do this, the researchers used a technique in which the nerve cells are activated and deactivated via light. Their report appeared in the journal Scientific Reports on April 12, 2025.

If medication is no longer sufficient in alleviating restricted mobility in the advanced stage of Parkinson's disease, one alternative is deep brain stimulation. An electrical pulse emitter is implanted within the brain, such as in the subthalamic nucleus, which is functionally part of the basal ganglia system.

The group under Dr. Liana Melo-Thomas from Philipps-Universität Marburg was able to show in previous studies on rats that stimulation of the inferior colliculus—chiefly known for processing auditory input—can be used to overcome mobility restrictions. "There are indications that stimulation of this region of the brain leads to activation of the mesencephalic locomotor region, or MLR," says Melo-Thomas.

Interestingly, the colliculus inferior—unlike the basal ganglia—is not affected by Parkinson's disease. However, the research group under Melo-Thomas discovered that its stimulation activates alternative motor pathways and can improve patients' mobility.

The current study aimed to further investigate this activating influence of the inferior colliculus on the MLR. "We suspected that this would have a positive effect on ambulatory ability," says Melo-Thomas.

The Marburg group led by Professor Rainer Schwarting sought support by Dr. Wolfgang Kruse from the Department of General Zoology and Neurobiology at Ruhr University Bochum. The team in Bochum led by Professor Stefan Herlitze played a significant role in co-developing the methods of optogenetics.

While doing so, the researchers ensure that the nerve cells of genetically modified test animals produce a light-sensitive protein in interesting regions of the brain. Light that reaches these nerve cells via small, implanted optical fibers allows the researchers to activate or inhibit them specifically. "This method is thus much more precise than electrical stimulation, which always affects the area around the cells as well," says Kruse.

For the first time, the effect of the stimulation was directly documented with electrophysiological measurements of neuronal activity in the target structures. A multi-electrode system originally developed at Philipps-Universität Marburg was used for this purpose. By combining these methods, the researchers were able to directly understand the effect of the stimulation. Parallel measurement with up to four electrodes is also highly efficient, allowing minimization of the number of animals used. Behavioral effects that can be triggered by the stimulation were monitored in conscious animals.

Optogenetic stimulation in the inferior colliculus predominantly triggered the expected increase in neuronal activity within it. "Simultaneous measurements in the deeper MLR region showed increased activity in the majority of cells, although nearly one quarter of the cells were inhibited by the additional activity in the inferior colliculus," reports Kruse. The activation of individual nerve cells occurred with an average delay of 4.7 milliseconds, indicating a functional synaptic interconnection between the inferior colliculus and MLR.

Investigating circuits outside of the basal ganglia that are affected by Parkinson's disease is a promising step in the search for a new therapeutic approach to alleviating motor deficits resulting from the disease. Such is the case with the connection between the inferior colliculus and the MLR that was investigated for this study.

"Even if the path toward new therapeutic approaches to alleviating the symptoms of Parkinson's disease still appears long, such foundational research is immensely important," emphasizes Kruse. The exact mechanisms that lead to the observed relief of symptoms with deep brain stimulation in the basal ganglia are not fully understood. Further investigation of the underlying interconnections may provide new insight that could optimize therapy in the long term.

This study was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) with the grants ME4197/2 und ME4197/3 and by the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) in Brazil (PROBRAL Grant 88881.198683/2018-01).

In a world first, Canadian scientists at the CRCHUM, the hospital research centre affiliated with Université de Montréal, have identified microRNA able to protect small blood vessels and support kidney function after severe injury.

For the four million people diagnosed with chronic renal failure in Canada-and millions more abroad-this scientific advancement could have a major impact on early diagnosis and prevention of the disease.

Previously, there was no known reliable biomarker for evaluating the health of these capillaries and for developing targeted approaches to preserve kidney function.

In a study published last Thursday in JCI Insight, the CRCHUM research team shows that miR-423-5p microRNA is a promising marker in the blood for predicting the microvascular health of the kidneys.

UdeM medical professors Marie-Josée Hébert and Héloïse Cardinal, holders of the Shire Chair in Nephrology, Renal Transplantation and Regeneration, co-authored the study with Hébert's research associate Francis Migneault.

Their specialty is studying the loss of peritubular capillaries, a conclusive indicator of chronic renal failure.

Located in the kidneys, millions of these small blood vessels filter waste products out of the blood and transport the oxygen and nutrients necessary for the organ's functions.

Kidney injuries, caused by the temporary interruption and restoration of blood flow, can lead to a decrease in the number of small blood vessels, seriously disrupting kidney function.

In people who have received a transplant, if kidney function is severely altered, the kidney's survival is threatened."

Marie-Josée Hébert, nephrology-transplant physician and UdeM's outgoing vice-rector for research, discovery, creation and innovation

"Using this biomarker, a test could be developed to evaluate the status of the small blood vessels much earlier," she said. "Doctors in hospitals could then better evaluate the microvascular health of higher-risk patients.

"These could include elderly patients or those undergoing surgeries during which blood flow is temporarily stopped, as is the case for organ transplants or cardiovascular interventions."

"We first observed fluctuating levels of miR-423-5p microRNA in the blood of mice with acute kidney injuries," said Migneault, the study's first author. "These results were then confirmed in 51 transplant recipients who participated in the CHUM kidney transplant biobank."

Thanks to this biomarker, clinical teams could confirm whether their interventions improve or diminish the health of small blood vessels.

"But what's really incredible is that by injecting this microRNA into mice with kidney injuries, we were able to preserve the small blood vessels and limit the damage done to the kidneys," said Migneault.

While direct injection into the kidney is a clinically feasible method during a transplant, to protect the remaining small blood vessels, the CRCHUM scientists are now focused on alternative techniques to transport the microRNA, or likely a microRNA cocktail, to the kidney.

In terms of prevention, a test based on this miR-423-5p microRNA could be useful for patients with cardiac failure, pulmonary failure or certain neurodegenerative diseases.

"For these medical conditions, the loss of small blood vessels plays a key role, because of the association with normal or accelerated aging," said Hébert. "Our discovery could, therefore, have a significant impact on the health of all Canadians."

For those with pulmonary failure, several research projects are in progress under Emmanuelle Brochiero, a researcher and head of the Immunopathology research theme at the CRCHUM.

It may also be possible, using the CHUM's biological material biobank, to determine if existing medications, administered after a kidney transplant to treat another issue, impact small blood vessel health, added Hébert.

A new study suggests that boys who become overweight in their early teens risk damaging the genes of their future children, increasing their chances of developing asthma, obesity and low lung function.

Research published this week in Nature Communications Biology is the first human study to reveal the biological mechanism behind the impact of fathers' early teenage obesity on their children.

Researchers from the University of Southampton and the University of Bergen investigated the epigenetic profiles of 339 people, aged 7 to 51. They assessed the father's changes in body composition across adolescence using self-reported body image as a proxy for body fat composition. They identified epigenetic changes in over 2,000 sites in 1,962 genes linked with adipogenesis (formation of fat cells) and lipid (fat) metabolism in the children of fathers who gained weight as teenagers.

These changes in the way DNA is packaged in cells (methylation) regulate gene expression (switching them on and off) and are associated with asthma, obesity and lung function. The effect was more pronounced in female children than male children, with different genes involved.

The overweight status of future fathers during puberty was associated with a strong signal in their children's DNA which were also related to the likelihood of their children being overweight themselves. Early puberty, when boys start their developing sperm, seems to be a key window of vulnerability for lifestyle influences to drive epigenetic changes in future offspring."

Dr. Negusse Tadesse Kitaba, Senior Research Fellow at the University of Southampton

Professor Cecilie Svanes from the University of Bergen says: "The new findings have significant implications for public health and may be a game-changer in public health intervention strategies."

"They suggest that a failure to address obesity in young teenagers today could damage the health of future generations, further entrenching health inequalities for decades to come."

Prof John Holloway from the University of Southampton and the NIHR Southampton Biomedical Research Centre added: "Childhood obesity is increasing globally. The results of this study demonstrate that this is a concern not only for the health of the population now but also for generations to come."

The research was funded by the Norwegian Research Council.

 May 27, 2025  

MINNEAPOLIS — Risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) appears substantially greater in patients with placenta accrete than in other pregnant patients, found a small single-center study presented at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) 2025 Annual Meeting.

Despite the institution having created a specific protocol — a VTE bundle — for patients with placenta accreta, only about one in five patients with placenta accreta received the complete bundle, reported Rinat Tal, of the University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, and colleagues. 

“Patients with placenta accreta spectrum are at risk for massive hemorrhage, need for blood transfusion, massive transfusion, long operating times, general anesthesia, and ICU stay, all of which increased patients' risk for VTE beyond the preexisting elevated risk in pregnancy,” the authors wrote. 

Yet, guidelines do not exist regarding the optimal VTE prophylaxis for patients with placenta accreta, they noted. So, the researchers assessed the effectiveness of a VTE bundle developed at their institution for reducing risk for VTE in patients with placenta accreta.

The Michigan Medicine VTE Bundle included four components: Intraoperative administration of subcutaneous heparin; anticoagulation restarted within 8 hours postoperatively; anticoagulation continued through discharged; and prophylactic anticoagulation prescribed at discharge.

The authors analyzed retrospective data on all scheduled cesarean hysterectomies performed for suspected placenta accreta, excluding patients with cancer and those with incomplete 6-week postpartum data. They identified 90 patients who met their criteria and found that only 22.2% had received the complete VTE bundle.

Incidence of VTE was 2.2% in the cohort: One patient who received the complete bundle and one who did not (P = .34). The groups therefore showed no difference in risk-based receipt of the complete bundle, but the population was likely too small, especially for such a rare outcome, to achieve statistical power in the study. The researchers noted, however, that the incidence of VTE was 18 times higher in this cohort than in pregnant patients generally.

Among the 77.8% of patients with placenta accreta who did not receive the full VTE bundle, 28.5% had a delayed restart of postoperative anticoagulation but otherwise received the other three components of the bundle. However, the other 71.4% were missing anywhere from one to three components, including 5.7% who received no prophylactic anticoagulation. 

The women who did and did not receive the VTE bundle had a similar age, a median 34 years old, and gestational age at delivery was a median 34 weeks. However, the median body mass index of women who received the bundle was 34.7 compared with 31.8 among those receiving incomplete bundles. Also, more of the women receiving an incomplete bundle had a previous C section (92.9%) than those who received the full bundle (80%). 

Median blood loss was greater in those who received an incomplete bundle (2500 mL) than those who received the full bundle (1600 mL), and more women receiving an incomplete bundle (21.4%) had a packed red blood cell transfusion than those who received the full bundle (5%).

The researchers suggested additional research to evaluate the barriers to providing all appropriate patients with the VTE bundle and targeted quality improvement efforts to improve compliance. 

Alison G. Cahill, MD, associate dean of translational research and professor of women's health at The University of Texas at Austin Dell Medical School, told Medscape Medical News that the findings here need to be interpreted cautiously given that it's such a small study and results are only currently available in the poster. Regardless, the question the researchers ask is an important one that should merit investigation, Cahill suggested. 

“We're constantly searching for opportunities to further reduce the chance of VTE in the setting of pregnancy for all kinds of all pregnant people,” Cahill said. This study “raises the question as to whether or not this group [those with placenta accreta] should be considered separately” in seeking more ways to prevent VTE, she said.

“Just the idea of thinking about VTE risk — that there are differences, and what they look like, and how we might approach them differently — is an important investigative lane, especially because a lot of the data that we have for VTE primary prevention is from outside of the obstetric literature,” Cahill said. 

No external funding or disclosures from the authors were reported. Cahill had no disclosures.

Researchers have found that central body fat, especially around the abdomen, is more strongly linked to psoriasis risk than total body fat, particularly in women. This link between central fat and psoriasis remained consistent regardless of genetic predisposition, indicating that abdominal fat is an independent risk factor. The study in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology, published by Elsevier, provides insights that could help improve early risk prediction and guide personalized prevention strategies.

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that can have a significant impact on quality of life. Many individuals with psoriasis also have elevated levels of body fat. While it is well established that increasing levels of body fat raise the risk of developing psoriasis, the impact of specific fat distribution and genetics remains unclear.

Researchers of the current study analyzed data from over 330,000 participants with White British ancestry in the UK Biobank, including more than 9,000 people with psoriasis. They examined 25 different measures of body fat using both traditional methods and advanced imaging techniques, assessing how each was associated with psoriasis.

Lead investigator Ravi Ramessur, MD, St John's Institute of Dermatology, King's College London, explains, "Our research shows that where fat is stored in the body matters when it comes to psoriasis risk. Central fat - especially around the waist - seems to play a key role. This has important implications for how we identify individuals who may be more likely to develop psoriasis or experience more severe disease, and how we approach prevention and treatment strategies."

Catherine H. Smith, MD, also at St John's Institute of Dermatology, King's College London, and senior author adds, "As rates of obesity continue to rise globally, understanding how different patterns of body fat influence chronic inflammatory conditions such as psoriasis is important. Our findings suggest that central body fat contributes to psoriasis risk irrespective of genetic predisposition and reinforces the importance of measuring waist circumference and pro-active healthy weight strategies in psoriasis care."

Because this study only included individuals of White British ancestry from the UK Biobank, the generalizability of these findings to more diverse populations may be limited. Future studies incorporating datasets with dermatologist-confirmed diagnoses and broader ethnic representation will be important to further validate these associations and refine risk stratification approaches.

Dr. Ramessur notes, "We were surprised by how consistently strong the association was across different central fat measures and how much stronger the effect was in women. The observed links between central body fat and psoriasis suggest that there may be underlying biological mechanisms contributing to the disease that are not yet fully understood and which warrant further investigation."

In an accompanying editorial Joel M. Gelfand, MD, MSCE, FAAD, Department of Dermatology and Center for Clinical Sciences in Dermatology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, points to the potential of incretin therapy for psoriatic disease. Incretins are gut-derived hormones, principally glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), that regulate glucose, digestion, and appetite, and are approved for treatment of diabetes, obesity, and obesity-associated obstructive sleep apnea.

Dr. Gelfand comments, "The strong relationship between psoriasis and obesity and the emerging promise of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1RA) for reducing psoriasis morbidity is a call to action for large scale clinical trials of GLP1RA monotherapy for treatment of psoriasis. Our current paradigm of just focusing on the skin and joint manifestations when treating psoriasis is outdated in the context of our evolving understanding of the tight relationship of psoriasis, obesity, and cardiometabolic disease."

Breakthrough MRI scans reveal hidden hypothalamic changes in young women, shedding light on the biological roots of anorexia and obesity, and paving the way for targeted treatments.

 Study: Unraveling neural underpinnings of eating disorders in the female brain: Insights from high-field magnetic resonance imaging. Image Credit: Suppakjj1017 / Shutterstock.com

A recent editorial feature published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition discusses the use of a novel imaging technique to investigate how certain structural features of the hypothalamus affect eating behaviors.

Women are more likely to develop eating disorders like anorexia nervosa than men, particularly during puberty. Despite this disproportional occurrence, few studies have investigated the role of the female brain in neuroscience and psychiatry.

The hypothalamus is a small, heterogeneous brain structure in the diencephalon that regulates homeostatic and hedonic functions involved in feeding behaviors. Current imaging techniques are limited in their ability to capture nuclei subsegmentation within the hypothalamus. As a result, most studies investigating the role of the hypothalamus have been conducted in rodents.

Utilizing precision imaging to investigate the neurobiological roots of eating disorders offers a critical avenue for driving progress.”

In a previous study published in the Journal of Clinical Medicine, researchers identified microstructural alterations in the hypothalamus of young adult females with anorexia nervosa and obesity. To this end, a highly sensitive, ultrahigh-resolution T1 quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is needed to overcome the limitations associated with traditional imaging modalities incapable of visualizing the human hypothalamus.

Herein, the hypothalamus of forty-four young females was imaged, twenty-one of whom were of normal weight, thirteen diagnosed with restrictive anorexia nervosa, and ten developed obesity. Appropriate age-matching removed any potential age-related bias.

Volumes and quantitative T1 values of individual hypothalamic nuclei, which served as proxy markers of cellular integrity, were compared after whole-brain normalization using nonparametric tests. Multivariate nonlinear partial least square (NIPALS) analysis was conducted to identify the factors associated with body mass index (BMI) and eating disorders, such as ghrelin and leptin levels, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters of hypothalamic nuclei, depression, and anxiety.

In this multidisciplinary strategy, 7T MRI data of hypothalamic subregions were bridged with measures of eating behaviors, anxiety, mood, and peripheral hunger—and satiety-related hormone levels.

Volumetric data and quantitative T1 measures of 50 distinct hypothalamic brain regions were obtained. Patients living with anorexia nervosa and, to a lesser extent, obesity had characteristic differences in the hypothalamic para- and periventricular nuclei, as well as connecting fiber tracts, compared to those with normal weight.

Both para- and periventricular nuclei were found to play crucial roles in feeding behaviors, thus indicating that any microstructural alterations in these regions may contribute to the pathophysiology of eating disorders.

Volume reductions are typically associated with atrophy in aging or neurodegenerative diseases. Comparatively, increased brain volumes in younger populations correlate with swelling or inflammation in neuronal tissues. The researchers reported that larger hypothalamic subregions may contribute to eating disorders in females.  

The current study also suggested potential underlying mechanisms for which younger women are at an increased risk of developing eating disorders. Mechanistically, the larger hypothalamic subregions, which may arise due to inflammatory processes, could cause imbalances in food consumption and eating disorders in females.

Considerable variations in leptin and ghrelin levels, along with changes in paraventricular nuclei, right anterior commissure, and left fornix, were observed in females with high body mass index (BMI) values and anorexia, which were associated with eating disorder severity.

The novel neuroimaging technique discussed in this study allowed researchers to identify specific changes in hypothalamic regions in young adult females that contributed to their eating disorders. Notably, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists were found to target the arcuate subnucleus of the hypothalamus and improve unhealthy eating behavior.

In the future, longitudinal studies should be conducted to understand whether modifications in hypothalamic subregional size and quantitative T1 precede the onset of symptoms. A follow-up analysis of structural and functional connectivity in hypothalamus subregions may also elucidate the neural processes within extended limbic and cortical networks in patients with eating disorders.

Hot flushes, memory loss, difficulty concentrating, mood swings, urinary incontinence and joint pain: these are just some of the more than 100 symptoms associated with the menopause, a natural process that all women go through when they stop ovulating and menstruating, typically between the ages of 45 and 55.

In addition to the stigma and discrimination women face during this biological transition, the physical and psychological effects can negatively impact their quality of life and productivity at work.

A new open access study published in Frontiers in Reproductive Health by Clara Selva Olid, researcher at the Behavioural Design Lab (BDLab), which is affiliated to the UOC's research unit on Digital Health, Health and Well-being, has found that implementing public actions in the political, social and organizational spheres can help reduce discrimination and social stigma, counteract the lack of attention given to this stage of life and significantly improve both quality of life and the healthcare received by women.

Drawing on interviews with 20 women between the ages of 45 and 60 who have experienced both physical and psychological symptoms related to the menopause and postmenopause over the past five years, Selva Olid, also a member of the Faculty of Psychology and Education Sciences at the UOC, has developed a 10-point proposal with three key areas for action: social awareness, education, and workplace and health measures.

"My aim was to give women a voice in the design of more inclusive and effective policies to better support them through this transition," explained Selva Olid, who believes that it is essential for women to be actively involved in the design, implementation and evaluation of public policies to ensure that they truly reflect their needs and lived experiences.

The study also brings to the fore the debate on how to adapt such initiatives to the different social and economic realities faced by women in Spain.

According to the Catalan Institute of Statistics (IDESCAT), there are nearly one million women in the region between the ages of 45 and 60 - the age range in which this transition typically begins. Factors such as health, genetics, sociocultural context and exposure to environmental factors ultimately determine when menstruation ends for good. However, perimenopause can begin several years earlier, bringing irregular periods and hormonal fluctuations. Once menstruation stops, postmenopausal symptoms, which affect eight out of 10 women, can last for several years.

Despite being a natural process that all women go through, there is often a lack of information. The public health system also tends to be over-medicalized, and myths and discriminations persist.

Against this background, Selva Olid's study aimed to identify and analyse actions that public organizations in Spain can take to support women during the menopausal transition. The study concludes with a 10-point action plan in three key areas: the social sphere, public health and the workplace, and medical research.

1. Social sphere. The women who took part in the study called for measures to increase the social visibility of the menopause, raise awareness of its effects and develop strategies for support and normalization. One such measure would be to include the menopause in school curricula, which would help normalize it as just another stage of life.

"It's about developing support strategies to prevent many women from feeling isolated or ashamed, and ultimately to break the stigma," said Selva Olid, adding that "we need to work to empower women to take more control over their own health". Role models have an incredibly positive impact, and in this respect Selva Olid believes that social media play a helpful role in normalizing this stage of life - unlike traditional media, which have lagged behind in supporting this mindset shift.

2. Public health. It is vital to have health professionals trained in menopause, as well as access to psychological help, support groups or workshops on healthy habits. Selva Olid said that "although it's a natural stage of life that can have a significant impact on a woman's health and work performance, the financial cost of treatments to relieve symptoms and improve well-being is borne solely by women. But it should be a social responsibility - women don't choose to go through the menopause."

3. The workplace. The interviews conducted as part of the study show that, in order to create a more equitable working environment, there is a need for mandatory work-life balance policies and clearly defined menopause support. This includes government incentives for organizations that implement best practices and promote staff training and awareness to reduce gender bias, encourage open dialogue and help normalize this life stage.

Measures such as appointing menopause role models in companies, offering flexible working arrangements and adaptations (e.g. more breathable uniforms), installing additional water stations in the workplace, allowing remote working and providing menopause-related leave can be highly effective in helping women to balance work with the challenges of this stage, while also reducing absenteeism and preventing job loss or resignation.

In this regard, Catalonia is a pioneer in Spain, having adopted the Comprehensive Plan for Menstrual and Climacteric Equity 2023-2025, which represents a significant step forward in recognizing menstrual and menopausal health as a matter of rights and well-being, both in the workplace and in society. However, as Selva Olid pointed out, "it's still not enough to achieve real equity, as it's not a binding law that forces action to be taken in the workplace".

4. Medical research. More funding and resources need to be devoted to research into the menopause, particularly treatments and therapies to relieve symptoms and prevent long-term health problems.

To date, research into women's health, if it has taken place at all, has focused on the reproductive phase, leaving menopause in the background, despite its profound physical, emotional and social impact."

 Clara Selva Olid, researcher, UOC

She added that her interest in this area stems from "the need to increase scientific knowledge about this stage of life and to provide data that can help improve women's quality of life".

The U.S. Women's Soccer Team is in St. Paul this week, hosting China in an international friendly on Saturday. The Americans had training on Tuesday at Allianz Field. Players Lily Yohannes and Sam Coffey spoke with reporters after.

ST. PAUL, Minn. (FOX 9) - The U.S. Women's National Soccer Team is in St. Paul this week to host China in an international friendly at Allianz Field, home of Minnesota United FC.

The Americans will face China at 4:30 p.m. Saturday. They held team training at Allianz Field to get a feel for the stadium and pitch ahead of the match.

What we know:

It was about this time last year midfielder Lily Yohannes made her international debut with Team USA. Not quite a year ago, June 4, she came off the bench in friendly against Korea Republic and promptly scored her first goal.

She's made six appearances with the U.S. women's soccer team, and says Allianz Field will hold a special place in her heart.

"It feels pretty crazy to be back here. That was such a special moment for me, so to be back here is kind of full-circle," Yohannes said. "This place definitely holds a special place in my heart."

What they're saying:

Sam Coffey is a U.S. Women's National Team veteran, with one goal and two assists in 33 appearances. She remembers playing against Korea Republic last year in a friendly at Allianz Field, and has an appreciation for the fanbase.

"It's such a passionate soccer community. I think every time we do play here, it's always such a great crowd specifically for women's soccer and supporting women's sports," Coffey said. "It's always special playing here, it's an amazing stadium."

Why you should care:

It's easy for the Americans to love playing at Allianz Field, they've had a lot of success there. They've won three other friendlies against Korea Republic and Portugal by a combined 12-0.

The U.S. Men's National Team also has three wins at Allianz Field, all shutouts.

What's next:

After Saturday's match, Team USA then heads to St. Louis to face Jamaica on June 3.

General public tickets for Saturday's FIFA 2025 Club World Cup playoff between LAFC and LIGA MX powerhouse Club América at BMO Stadium have sold out, the world governing body announced Tuesday.

FIFA is offering verified resale options for fans hoping to attend the one-off match that will see the winner enter Group D alongside Chelsea (England), Flamengo (Brazil) and ES Tunis (Tunisia) while earning a guaranteed $9.55 million for participating in the Club World Cup.

The expanded, 32-team tournament runs from June 14 to July 13 across the United States and features an unprecedented $1 billion prize pool.

LAFC and Club América are vying for the spot vacated by Club León, who were disqualified from the tournament due to FIFA's multi-club ownership rules.

Should the Black & Gold win, they'll become the third MLS side at the Club World Cup alongside Seattle Sounders FC (2022 Concacaf Champions Cup winner) and Inter Miami CF (host nation spot).

LAFC were granted this opportunity as the 2023 Concacaf Champions Cup runners-up; head coach Steve Cherundolo's side fell 3-1 on aggregate to Club León during that two-legged final.

Fast forward two years and the Black & Gold remain among the Western Conference's top contenders. They're also carrying an eight-game unbeaten run (3W-0L-5D), most recently earning a 2-2 comeback draw at CF Montréal thanks to Olivier Giroud's rebound finish.

LAFC are led by Denis Bouanga, who has 10 goals in 20 appearances (all competitions) this season, rising homegrown Nathan Ordaz and midfielder Mark Delgado. Additional stars include Giroud and fellow legendary French FIFA World Cup winner Hugo Lloris.

Club América qualified for this playoff match as the top club in FIFA's Concacaf Club Rankings Index after the 2024 Concacaf Champions Cup. The Index grades all clubs and leagues throughout the confederation, awarding or deducting points based on results across the past four years.

Following a 34-point Clausura campaign, Las Águilas finished second in the LIGA MX table. However, Toluca denied their four-peat bid with a 2-0 victory in Sunday's Leg 2 finale.

USMNT winger and former FC Dallas homegrown Alex Zendejas, Real Madrid academy product Álvaro Fidalgo and longtime captain Henry Martín are among the standouts in América's star-studded lineup.

State officials will spend $33 million on a new walkway between American Dream Mall and MetLife Stadium before the 2026 FIFA World Cup. The bridge aims to move a million visitors during the games.

"You don't need to bring a cooler full of beer. Why don't you come over to our restaurants and have a great meal?" said Paul Ghermezian, a senior executive with Triple Five, to NorthJersey.com.

The 3-million-square-foot site will test its plans during this summer's FIFA Club World Cup. Watch parties, activities, and food specials will run at 11 spots across the mall.

Staff must stay quick on their feet. With Club World Cup matchups announced in late June, they'll have mere days to set up if stars like Lionel Messi play at MetLife.

Past big events show what works. The site drew crowds for U.S. curling matches in 2024. Last summer, the Harlem Globetrotters packed the house.

Charles Cristella from JLL sees no issues with World Cup-sized groups. "They are very well-suited. This is what this company does. They build massive projects and they appeal to massive crowds, and they know how to handle it," he told NorthJersey.com.

Past soccer events paint the picture. For Copa America 2023, video games filled the space while DJs spun tracks through a Univision deal. Back in 2022, skaters gave way to soccer players when the FIFA Trophy Tour came through.

MetLife Stadium will host key matches, with the finals set for July 19, 2026. The stadium fits 82,000 fans.

Visitors find more than 200 shops and 50 food spots inside. Water slides splash next to ski slopes, while skaters spin near thrill rides. Soccer-themed shops will pop up before kickoff, though which ones stays under wraps.

Cristiano Ronaldo has posted a cryptic message on social media suggesting that his time with Al-Nassr could be over.

The 40-year-old has been locked into contract talks with the Saudi Arabian side for the past few months, but after going trophyless in 2024-25, it now seems likely that he'll be moving on.

FIFA president Gianni Infantino has hinted that Ronaldo could still play at the Club World Cup this summer, with one of the qualified sides signing him on a short-term deal.

“Ronaldo might play for one of the teams as well at the Club World Cup,” Infantino said during an interview with IShowSpeed.

“There are discussions with some clubs, so if any club is watching and is interested in hiring Ronaldo for the Club World Cup… who knows, who knows.”

A 10-day transfer window will open at the start of June, which will allow clubs to sign players ahead of the Club World Cup this summer.

Based on the current rumours around Ronaldo, we've assessed the five club that could sign him on a short-term deal.

This one is a long shot, but it would be a romantic story to see Ronaldo in a Real Madrid shirt for one last time.

After missing out on all the major trophies in 2024-25, Madrid will be desperate to salvage their season by winning the Club World Cup.

The thought of Ronaldo lining up alongside Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior this summer is an exciting one.

While this move seems unlikely, it's worth mentioning that Ronaldo does have a good relationship with incoming manager Xabi Alonso.

“Cristiano made everything very easy,” Alonso said when discussing his time playing with Ronaldo. “I take the ball, I find it and he did his individual actions to score.”

It's been well-documented that Todd Boehly has been interested in signing Ronaldo previously. Indeed, Chelsea were heavily linked with the Portuguese superstar prior to his move to Al-Nassr back in 2023.

While Enzo Maresca's side probably wouldn't be interested in a long-term deal, a short-term contract offer for the Club World Cup could suit all parties involved.

Links to Chelsea have resurfaced in recent weeks, although former Chelsea winger Florent Malouda thinks that CR7 would struggle to integrate into their squad.

“I remember when the owners took over, they were assessing the possibility of signing him,” Malouda told Racing Tipster.

“It would be more like a marketing and media coup than anything, really, in terms of sports logic.”

Ronaldo hasn't won any major trophies while playing for Al-Nassr and that's largely thanks to Al-Hilal.

It would be a controversial move for Ronaldo to sign for Al-Nassr's rivals, but it seems like a very real possibility.

The sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia owns a majority share in both clubs, so moving between them shouldn't pose too much of an issue. Albeit he'd annoy a lot of Al-Nassr supporters in the process.

With Neymar no longer on their wage bill, Al-Hilal could definitely be tempted to take a short-term punt on CR7.

According to reports in Spain, an unnamed Brazilian club has recently made an offer to Ronaldo.

Botafogo are one of the four Brazilian teams that have qualified for the Club World Cup this summer and their head coach, Renato Paiva, recently spoke about the prospect of signing Ronaldo.

“Christmas is only in December. But if he came, you can't say no to a star like that,” he said.

“I don't know anything – I'm just answering the question. But, as I said, coaches always want the best. Ronaldo, even at his age, is still a goal-scoring machine. In a team that creates chance after chance, he would be good.”

What better way to see the Ronaldo and Lionel Messi era come to an end than to see them both on the same team for the first time?

Messi will definitely be at the Club World Cup this summer, but could he be joined by his Portuguese nemesis?

Javier Mascherano's side look like they could use some reinforcements right now, having only won one of their last eight matches.

Inter Miami co-owner David Beckham has also spoken about signing Ronaldo in the past. Watch this space.

Al Nassr forward Cristiano Ronaldo could be set for a last-minute transfer to play in the Club World Cup next month.

The new expanded 32-team FIFA tournament starts in Miami on June 15.

Ronaldo's great rival Lionel Messi is playing for Inter Miami and is due to feature in the opening game against Egypt's Al Ahly SC.

Having Ronaldo play would be a major boost for the organisers - and ticket sales - for the controversial month-long tournament.

Several sources have confirmed that talks have been held about Ronaldo playing in the United States but they did not want to comment on the record.

The new format is being held every four years, so, at 40, this would appear to be Ronaldo's last chance to play in it.

Ronaldo hinted that he was leaving Al Nassr last night after their final game of the Saudi Pro League season.

In a cryptic post on X, he wrote: "The chapter is over. The story? Still being written. Grateful to all".

Al Nassr are not playing in the Club World Cup but their Riyadh rivals Al Hilal are representing Saudi Arabia and they are joined by two of Ronaldo's former clubs, Real Madrid and Juventus. Real Madrid's opening game is against Al Hilal in Miami on June 18.

Ronaldo's Al Nassr contract, which is believed to be worth more than £170m a year, runs out at the end of next month.

Ronaldo could use the special transfer window set up by FIFA between June 1-10 to sign for a new club.

Clubs can also use an in-tournament registration period from June 27 - July 3 (after the group stages) to add players to their squads.

Brazilian club Botafogo, who became champions of South America in December, are reported to be willing to sign Ronaldo on a short-term contract. They are in Group B with Paris Saint-Germain, Atletico Madrid and Seattle Sounders.

FIFA president Gianni Infantino said in an interview last week that talks were being held about Ronaldo playing in the United States next month.

"Ronaldo might play for one of the teams as well at the Club World Cup," Infantino said. "There are discussions with some clubs, so if any club is watching and is interested in hiring Ronaldo for the Club World Cup... who knows, who knows?"

From next season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.

If Cristiano Ronaldo does exit Al Nassr, could he play with Miami's Lionel Messi or another team at the FIFA Club World Cup, starting June 14 in the US?

Cristiano Ronaldo has hinted that he will quit his club team Al Nassr, possibly ending his association with the lucrative Saudi Pro League.

The 40-year-old Portugal striker announced only hours after his club's final match of the season that “This chapter is over” via his account on the social media platform X.

The post included a picture of him in an Al Nassr jersey and concluded: “The story? Still being written. Grateful to all.”

Speculation has now moved into overdrive about where the former Manchester United, Real Madrid and Juventus forward will move next.

Al Jazeera takes a look at what might occur in the coming days and possible options ahead for a player who remains one of world football's most bankable assets.

Ronaldo joined Al Nassr from Manchester United in January 2023 in a move that shocked the world.

The five-time world player of the year was the marquee signing that the Saudi Pro League needed to elevate its global standing.

His lucrative two-and-a-half-year deal, estimated to have been worth 200 million euros ($214.5m), comes to an end in June but was widely expected to be renewed.

Al Nassr have failed to win any titles in Ronaldo's time at the club and disappointingly have missed out on a place at both the FIFA Club World Cup and the Asian Champions League, having finished third in the league this season.

A place in the Asian Champions League Two is now the best they can hope for via a playoff.

Yes. The 32 teams involved in the Club World Cup have been granted a special transfer window to sign players.

It runs June 1-10 just before the tournament in the United States begins on June 14 when Inter Miami face Al Ahly.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino revealed last week that “there are discussions” surrounding Ronaldo playing at the enlarged and rebranded tournament.

1. Real Madrid

Ronaldo became a Galactico when he joined the Spanish giants from Manchester United in 2009 for what was then a world record fee of 80 million euros ($91m).

Even a short-term move back to Real for the tournament is unlikely given the struggles Los Blancos had in finding the best way for Kylian Mbappe, Vinicius Jr and Rodrygo to line up as the front three as Real tried to defend its Champions League and La Liga titles.

With Jude Bellingham already having to adapt to a new role last season given Mbappe's arrival from Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), it is difficult to envisage a Real return for Ronaldo.

Another of his former clubs at the tournament is Juventus, again at least offering the option of an emotional reunion. But because such a move would be only a short-term one, Juventus are unlikely to want to upset the playing group that qualified them for the tournament.

2. Inter Miami

The biggest headline move would undoubtedly be for a link-up with Ronaldo's career-long rival for the title of the best player in the world, Lionel Messi.

The Argentinian forward left Paris Saint-Germain to join the David Beckham co-owned Major League Soccer (MLS) side in 2023.

It was a sensational score for Miami as Ronaldo himself had also been linked with a move to the MLS before joining Al Nassr.

If Ronaldo's participation at the Club World Cup is seen as a boost to the competition by Infantino and FIFA, then clearly there would be no bigger headline-grabber than a link-up between two players that between them have shared the title of world player of the year on 13 occasions.

Last week, when he was asked if Inter Miami might sign Ronaldo, Infantino laughed and replied: “It's possible.”

3. Al Hilal

A strong contender for Ronaldo's signature, both in the short and long term, is 2023-2024 Saudi Pro League winners, Al Hilal.

The move makes a lot of sense to all parties. The marquee signing for the Saudi domestic league remains in the competition, plays in the Club World Cup and will spearhead the Saudi assault for next season's Asian Champions League.

For Ronaldo, it would mean staying in the Saudi capital, where many of his current business and commercial interests are based.

The other options in the region who are also represented at the Club World Cup are Al Ain from the United Arab Emirates and a switch to challenge for the African Champions League next season with Egyptian giants Al Ahly. The loss of Ronaldo to a neighbouring football nation is surely something the Saudi Pro League would prefer to avoid.

4. Botafogo

The Spanish newspaper Marca reported last week that Ronaldo is in talks with the Brazilian mega-club Botafogo.

That news made a lot of sense at the time because they could potentially afford a short-term deal with Ronaldo. However, that news came before the player's announcement that his time with Al Nassr might have come to an end.

A long-term move to Brazil, despite its footballing heritage and legacy, appears unlikely. A short-term deal remains an option unless it interferes with a move to a Club World Cup participant that would want a contract beyond the end of the competition.

Palmeiras, Fluminense and Flamengo are also representing the Brazilian top flight at the tournament.

5. Seattle Sounders

One move that would perhaps offer the cleanest solution to Ronaldo's appearance at the Club World Cup is to sign a long-term deal with one of the US-based participants.

Much like the Saudi Pro League's desire to elevate their exposure, the MLS would be significantly boosted by Ronaldo's signature – be it in a link-up with Messi or in opposition to the Argentinian on an opposing side.

A move to the Seattle Sounders, the MLS champions, would also bring credibility to his appearance in the competition as part of a longer potential plan to base himself in the US.

The thrill of a potential Messi and Ronaldo link-up at the Club World Cup goes beyond the positional play of the pair, but that too would be a huge talking point were a collaboration at Inter Miami to be arranged.

Messi's preference is to play either on the right, cutting in on his famed left foot, or in a deeper role through the middle with the team playing around him.

Ronaldo, who began on the left flank, now operates solely through the middle but in a more advanced position to that preferred by Messi.

Both scenarios could work, but both would result in Messi making runs into the area of the field occupied by Ronaldo, and that is where the on-field viability of a potential partnership would be questioned.

The pair have long been rivals for the famed Ballon d'Or title, making the annual award ceremony to name the best player in the world an often tense affair.

The debate as to who was the better player at their peak raged through their time in La Liga with Messi at Barcelona and Ronaldo at Real Madrid.

It was often a conversation that the pair would cryptically contribute to over the years while there was noticeably no love lost when the duo would meet on the field of play.

A partnership at the Club World Cup would be one of the biggest box office events in football history and would draw much needed attention to the competition.

Whether their longstanding rivalry and differences could be put to one side would be the biggest hurdle to perhaps the greatest matchup in the sport's history.

It's that time of year again. Throw on a tux, practice your fake smiles, heck, boycott it if you don't like your chances, because football's awards season is here.

To wrap up another season of following the Americans playing for clubs in Europe, we're dishing out gongs in a range of hotly contested categories.

So dim the stage lights, strike up the band and let's see who has won a coveted (ahem) Ballon d'Tracker. Sorry.

There's a forceful strand of logic that suggests this has to go to the USMNT's most high-profile, most naturally-gifted senior player, who has had another strong individual season at a top European club.

Despite Milan's troubled, mid-table campaign, Christian Pulisic (top left) has registered his highest tally of goals in a single season, and been a standout performer on several occasions. He has scored in a cup final to help his team win a trophy (their only one this term, January's SuperCoppa Italiana) and been Milan's most creative force.

But it's too easy to dish out the top award to Pulisic, especially in a season when Milan have not only failed to challenge for the Scudetto but missed out on any form of European qualification.

Instead, step forward one of the USMNT's younger playmakers: a midfielder who has ridden the ups and downs of injury to have a sensational solo season and end it with major domestic success.

Malik Tillman made his mark yet again during the thrilling climax of the Eredivisie in the Netherlands last weekend, scoring the third goal as PSV beat Sparta Rotterdam 3-1 and dramatically clinched the title after rivals Ajax stumbled.

It was the 22-year-old's 12th league goal of the season (he got 16 overall, including three in the Champions League) and made him second only to striker Luuk de Jong in the club's top-scorer chart.

Tillman's haul, especially for a midfielder, was even more impressive because it came in just 26 league games, with a serious ankle injury causing him to miss eight matches earlier this year.

But he recovered to play a crucial part in PSV's near flawless run-in, keeping Ajax under pressure in the top spot until eventually the Amsterdam side cracked, with Tillman getting five goals in that period. The big question now is whether the Dutch champions can keep hold of him.

Manager Peter Bosz is unlikely to let him go easily. “When you see him play, you remember what you missed for three months,” said the PSV coach after Tillman's full return in April, when he scored against Groningen. “I enjoyed him. He's a great player.”

It only lasted 13 minutes on a chilly night in Dortmund, but Cole Campbell will never forget November 5, 2024. That's when the then 18-year-old made his Champions League debut for one of Europe's top teams.

Following in the footsteps of Pulisic and Gio Reyna, the teenager from Houston was plunged into the spotlight as he came on for Borussia Dortmund against Sturm Graz in a 1-0 win during the competition's league phase.

Winger Campbell may not have gone on to become a first-team regular for the Bundesliga giant this term, but he made four league appearances too. That tally may have been greater were it not for an injury that caused him to miss 10 games since March.

Rumors of interest in Campbell from other German top-flight clubs have also surfaced this term, so it remains to be seen if he is loaned out for experience next season. But the 19-year-old signed a new deal in October keeping him at Signal Iduna Park until 2028, which underlines his promise.

“Cole is a very young and extremely exciting player, who took huge strides in the past year. We see so much potential in him,” Dortmund's sporting director, Sebastian Kehl, said at the time.

Goalkeeper: Matt Turner (pictured top with the trophy in goalkeeper gloves) hasn't played anywhere near as much football as he would have liked, but the USMNT No 1 played his part in Crystal Palace's FA Cup success, keeping two clean sheets in three games early in the competition as he deputized for Dean Henderson. Aside from the exciting young Barcelona prospect Diego Kochen, who didn't get any senior minutes this season, nobody is pushing Turner for his spot.

Left-back: One of the no-brainers. Fulham's European hopes may have fizzled out a touch as the Premier League reached its business end, but Antonee Robinson has been one of their standout performers all season. He has been one of the top-flight's best full-backs, and memorably shone against Mohamed Salah as Fulham held Liverpool to a draw in December.

Right-back: Richy Ledezma had the unenviable task of deputizing at PSV for the indomitable Sergino Dest for much of this season. And the Arizonan put in an impressive shift, making 38 appearances across all competitions as PSV successfully defended their crown.

Center-back: Chris Richards (pictured top with the trophy and US flag) became an integral part of Palace's three-man central defensive unit, culminating in Wembley glory. All power to him.

Center-back: Mark McKenzie has had a breakthrough season with Toulouse in Ligue 1 and, although Cameron Carter-Vickers won another title with Celtic in Scotland, McKenzie has flourished in a tougher division where he made 33 appearances across all competitions in his debut season in France.

Midfielder: Weston McKennie once again bounced back from a summer when he was briefly considered expendable at Juventus to become a major part of their team. As ever, he has also proved to be dependably flexible, playing in various positions.

Midfielder: Tanner Tessmann has shone in Lyon during his first campaign in Ligue 1, managing to break into their team despite a host of experienced central midfielders initially ahead of him. He also played his part as Lyon squeezed into qualification for Europe next season.

Midfielder: Pulisic. Obviously. He has become one of the top players a major European side relies on week in, week out. Milan are keen to tie him down to a new contract this summer.

Midfielder: This was close, but Tim Weah at Juventus edges into the team ahead of Milan's Yunus Musah, with more goals and assists than his compatriot.

Midfielder: We've sacrificed a striker to include Tillman, the Tracker's player of the season, but are confident his eye for goals will more than make up for any shortfall. His 0.24 Opta score for xAG (expected assisted goals) during the season put him in the 91st percentile of Eredivisie midfielders, underlining his creative potential.

Attacker: Josh Sargent couldn't fire Norwich City back into the Premier League but did finish as third-top-scorer in the second-tier EFL Championship despite an injury-hit campaign. Fifteen goals (and five assists) is no mean feat.

Everyone loves a feel-good story, and for most of the footballing world outside of Manchester, Crystal Palace's FA Cup win was just that. A first major trophy for a historic club who have long been in the shadow of London neighbours such as Arsenal and Chelsea.

But in the past year or so under new manager Oliver Glasner, Palace have been building to something, and this month their thrilling run in the cup ended the way every one of their fans dreamed about: in Wembley euphoria. For Chris Richards, it was also a major step in his blossoming Premier League career.

Richards became the first American to get his hands on the famous trophy in 21 years (Tim Howard lifted it in 2004 with Manchester United). He can also reflect on his progress since breaking into the Palace team, where he became a key performer in a mean defence alongside Maxence Lacroix and Marc Guehi. The USMNT should benefit from Richards' growing confidence and experience this summer, too.

It has largely been a season to forget for Gio Reyna, who must have felt at times like he was going backwards.

From being considered one of the Bundesliga's most exciting young talents in 2020-21, fast forward a few years and the 22-year-old managed just three starts for Dortmund all season. It didn't help that his club changed manager during the campaign, but it was telling that neither Nuri Sahin nor successor Niko Kovac were convinced.

The Champions League offered Reyna more encouragement: he made nine appearances in that competition compared with 16 across the whole Bundesliga season. But even those returns to Europe's elite did not shift the feeling that one of America's most natural talents in recent years has lost his way, and needs a fresh start elsewhere next season.

International Football

Brentford's Gtech Community Stadium is about to host a rejuvenated tournament of rivalries brought back for the first time since 2004, featuring four nations with large communities in London.

Nigeria, Ghana, Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago will face off to see who will be crowned the first Unity Cup winners for 21 years.

The first semi-final will take place today between Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago (kick-off 7pm UK time), before Nigeria face Ghana on Wednesday (7pm UK Time). The four teams will play again on Saturday, May 31, with a third-place game (beginning first at 12.30pm UK time) and a final to crown the champions.

Here, The Athletic's Nnamdi Onyeagwara and Carl Anka explain what's going on.

The original Unity Cup was a tournament held in the summer of 2004 between three nations with large communities in London: the Republic of Ireland, Nigeria and Jamaica.

Three games took place across five days at the Valley, the home of Charlton Athletic. 

The first game on May 29 saw a Republic of Ireland side that featured Robbie Keane and Steve Finnan fall to a 3-0 defeat against Nigeria. That Nigeria team had then-Inter forward Obafemi Martins and John Utaka, three years before he would make his move to Portsmouth, lining up for them, with Martins scoring the second goal.

Nigeria then beat a Jamaica outfit boasting Marlon King and Kevin Lisbie 2-0 on May 31, with Utaka scoring the opener. This win secured the Unity Cup trophy for the Super Eagles.

The final game of the 2004 edition saw Ireland beat Jamaica 1-0 on June 2 thanks to a goal from former Arsenal striker Graham Barrett. 

Nnamdi Onyeagwara

Nigeria and Ghana are the two largest nations in West Africa that the British colonised. Since gaining independence, a (mostly) friendly rivalry has developed where both nations constantly bicker as to who is better: at everything. Food. Football. Music. Culture. Which country has a more stable electricity grid. Which country has the more attractive people.

Fans call it the “jollof derby”, referencing the rice-based dish that originated in Senegal but has different variations across West Africa. When the two countries faced each other in a two-legged tie to qualify for Qatar 2022, Ghana won that tie on away goals, leading Nigeria fans to storm the pitch in Abuja.

Jamaica vs Trinidad & Tobago is arguably the strongest football rivalry in the Caribbean. The two countries are the only teams from the region to qualify for the World Cup in their respective histories. This is a rivalry for cultural supremacy. Reggae v Soca music. Who has the best track and field team? Who makes the best food?

In short: both of these rivalries are about nations with a shared culture and a sibling-like squabble.

Carl Anka

London's diversity is evidenced by the outlook of the city's football clubs, with the different religions and faiths of those in the city and the different cultures, slang and music evident.

In January, England striker Ivan Toney, who is of Jamaican descent, posted a video of Arsenal's England midfielder Declan Rice singing dancehall artist Mad Cobra's song “Press Trigger” word for word.

And just after Rice joined Arsenal from West Ham United in the summer of 2023, he shared a personal story about his then-team-mate Eddie Nketiah and how the striker would bring a big bowl of jollof rice, the traditional African dish, to feed the team.



When speaking about what to expect at the Unity Cup, Brentford club ambassador and former Jamaica international Marcus Gayle said: “This tournament will not only bring together elite footballing talent from Africa and the Caribbean, but also celebrate the deep cultural and sporting connections between these nations.” 

With so many football fans in England of West African and Caribbean descent, this tournament will allow them in particular to celebrate their heritage.

Nnamdi Onyeagwara

England, and more specifically London, serves as a meeting point for people across the Afro-Caribbean diaspora.

The capital is home to first-, second- and third-generation immigrants from all four nations.

Carl Anka

Do not be fooled by the description — this is not a ‘friendly' tournament.

Yes, the winner will not lift the World Cup, the Africa Cup of Nations trophy or the CONCACAF Gold Cup, but what is at stake here is much more significant: bragging rights.

Nigeria and Ghana, whose first official meeting was in 1960, will go toe-to-toe again. However, there is no forgetting the never-ending debate over which nation makes the best Jollof rice dish.

In England, Jamaica and Trinidad also have their own personal battles between nations, largely centred around music. For example, whether Trinidadian calypso, soca, and steelpan music is better than Jamaican reggae, dub and dancehall music.

These debates are fierce whether being had on social media, on the playgrounds of British schools or when those disputes continue into adulthood.

Carl and I agree on many things, but who makes the best jollof rice is absolutely not one of them!

Simply put, the games being played this week are about much more than just football and victory will mean a lot to the eventual champions.

Nnamdi Onyeagwara

This might be a rare regional tournament where the semi-finals have more cultural importance than the final. As Nnamdi says, bragging rights will be huge, as these are football rivalries with plenty of spice, but occur perhaps once a year (at best).

The last time Ghana and Nigeria met for a friendly at Brentford's old Griffin Park, Ghana won 4-1, ending a 15-year streak of dominance for the Super Eagles.

Ghana fans stormed the pitch in celebration of the win. If you're of West African or Caribbean descent, you'll want to be at these games, because it makes the gloating all the sweeter for when you next meet friends and colleagues from the opposing side.

Carl Anka

In the current political climate, I hope this tournament will be a timely reminder of the joy that cultural diversity can bring.

It will be a meaningful tournament for British fans of West African or Caribbean descent, but also for those who aren't.

Eberechi Eze, who is of Nigerian descent, helped bring joy to the whole of south London with an FA Cup-winning goal a couple of weeks ago. Cole Palmer is of Caribbean descent and his great-grandparents were part of the Windrush generation. Hopefully, they can both go on and help England lift the World Cup in 2026 and if they are eating jollof rice and listening to reggae or dancehall music while they do it, then more power to them.

Sport, music, culture and art — they are there for us all to enjoy and contribute to, whatever your background. I hope the 2025 Unity Cup is a tournament that exemplifies that.

Nnamdi Onyeagwara

These rivalries are more than just football.

The four nations enjoy a friendly bicker about everything. Music, culture, art — the works. The Unity Cup will be an amazing showcase from all four nations about what makes their countries great.

It'll be a fantastic opportunity for those across the Black diaspora (the people living around the world who can trace their roots back to Africa) to showcase their culture and reconnect with old friends and foes. Get back in touch with their roots. Football is meant to be fun. The Unity Cup will be a great reminder of that.

Cristiano Ronaldo has hinted at a potential departure from Saudi Arabian side Al Nassr as his contract enters its final month.

Ronaldo's two-year contract with Al Nassr expires this summer and, despite reports of a possible extension, the 40-year-old is yet to put pen to paper, sparking a wave of speculation that he could leave the club.

A number of teams competing at the Club World Cup are thought to be keen to sign Ronaldo before this summer's inaugural tournament, and the Portugal international suggested he may be available in a social media post following the conclusion to the Saudi Pro League season.

“This chapter is over,” he wrote alongside an image of himself in an Al Nassr shirt. “The story? Still being written. Grateful to all.”

It was reported earlier this month that Ronaldo had already received a formal offer to play at the Club World Cup, where he could meet long-time foe Lionel Messi and Inter Miami, and FIFA president Gianni Infantino even shocked fans by admitting “there are discussions” over Ronaldo's involvement at the tournament this summer.

Those comments did not go down well with sources close to Ronaldo, who expressed frustration when contacted by The Athletic.

A temporary loan to allow Ronaldo to play in the Club World Cup is thought to have been ruled out, meaning the striker will either extend his stay at the club or depart for pastures new this summer.

Ronaldo scored his 93rd goal for Al Nassr in his 105th appearance for the club at the weekend but, despite his prolific form in front of goal, he could not help his side qualify for next season's AFC Champions League.

Al Nassr have not won a major trophy since recruiting Ronaldo in 2023, finishing third in the Saudi Pro League this year after his debut season brought a second-placed finish.

“To represent my country in a soccer game, there's just nothing better than that.”

—Christian Pulisic, 2020

Never mind.

—Christian Pulisic, last week

With the World Cup, one the U.S. will play at home, just 380 days away, Captain America has decided to take a pass on the national team's last major competition ahead of the tournament.

That's Pulisic's choice, of course. He's played a grueling schedule with AC Milan this season, one that concludes Sunday, a week before the national team reports to camp in Chicago.

And he has permission.

“Christian and his team approached the Federation and the coaching staff about the possibility of stepping back this summer, given the amount of matches he has played,” said Matt Crocker, U.S. Soccer's sporting director, noting that Pulisic has played more than 4,400 minutes for club and country the last 12 months.

 Sports 

Congressional leaders are asking Marco Rubio to help streamline the visa process for fans hoping to attend 2026 World Cup and 2028 Olympics.

Nor is Pulisic alone in his absence. Weston McKennie, Tim Weah, Gio Reyna, Antonee Robinson, Josh Sargent and Yunus Musah, Pulisic's teammate in Milan, were also left off the 27-man roster summoned to training camp ahead next month's Gold Cup, although some of those players will be participating in the Club World Cup.

Yet even if reason and rules are strongly on Pulisic's side, the optics are bad.

Over the last year the national team has suffered through two of its worst performances in recent memory, getting bounced in the group stage of last summer's Copa América — which cost coach Gregg Berhalter his job — then losing in heartless fashion to Panama and Canada in the CONCACAF Nations League under Mauricio Pochettino, Berhalter's successor.

So with the national team in dismal form a year before the World Cup returns to the U.S. for the first time in 32 years, this is probably not the best time for the active leader in goals and caps to be asking out of the lineup. Especially since the Gold Cup likely will be the last, best chance for the team to rediscover the form that saw it reach the round of 16 in the last World Cup.

“There is already doubt and concern regarding this team given recent failures. People are even questioning if they care and saying, ‘If they don't care, then why should we?'” said Alexi Lalas, who played every minute in the 1994 World Cup, helping the U.S. reach the round of 16 and changing the trajectory of soccer in the U.S. forever. “I can't believe we created an apathy towards this team a year out from hosting a World Cup.

“I just think this summer's Gold Cup, a tournament in the U.S., is a great opportunity to create a more positive vibe surrounding the team and reignite a belief that they can do something special next summer. I don't think we can afford to waste it.”

That's all true. But Pulisic and the other first-choice players missing from the Gold Cup roster were put in a bad position by a global soccer environment with a rapacious appetite for matches — or rather a rapacious appetite for the money those matches produce.

Consider Pulisic's schedule the last 12 months. For the U.S., he played in the Copa América, five friendlies and four Nations League matches. For AC Milan, the Italian club that pays his $5.8-million salary, he played in four tournaments, including Champions League. He's clearly banged up and needs some rest.

Traditionally, the Champions League final was the last game on the European calendar. Now it's followed by the Club World Cup, a competition I'm not sure anyone really needed but one that extends the club calendar for 32 teams for as long as another six weeks.

Even at 26, that's a punishing schedule. If Pulisic and the others don't take a break now, they could head into the World Cup year running on fumes.

“Many people can say it's really important for us to be all together for the last time before the World Cup,” Pochettino said in virtual meeting with reporters. “As a coaching staff we listen to the player. We have our own idea in everything, but after consideration we decided the best for him, the best for the team, the best for the national team is the decision that we made.”

Lalas isn't buying that.

“I recognize that players play a lot of games,” he said. “But you know who plays a lot of games? Messi.”

(Not recently. Messi played about half as many games as Pulisic in the last year, according to the Fbref.com website.)

“Of course I want U.S. players to be at their best in the summer of 2026, but we can't put them in bubble-wrap until then,” Lalas continued. “I know I am from a different generation, and I try not be a grumpy old man. But I just can't fathom turning down the privilege of representing my country.

 Soccer 

The United States, which is the only country to bid for the 2031 Women's World Cup, likely will be the site of the biggest women's tournament in history.

“We need all hands on deck. We can rest in 2027.”

Pochettino might not be buying his own words either. Because in the same news conference in which he excused Pulisic and the others, he made it clear that every spot on his World Cup roster is up for grabs. And the best way to grab one is to show up at training camp.

“What we want to create in our national team is people desperate to come, but desperate to come to perform,” said Pochettino who, in his eight months in charge, has been unable to rouse his players from a listless funk. “To perform means follow the rules, create a good atmosphere, be part of the team.

“We need to create this culture about winning and we need to chase our aim. If we want to be good in one year's time, we need to think that today is the most important day. It's not to say, ‘OK, I wait. The World Cup is in one year. It's in six months. It's in one month.' And then it's late.” 

The U.S. has been building for this since 2018, when FIFA awarded the World Cup to the U.S., Mexico and Canada. The roster has been carefully cultivated, players have been methodically groomed; broadcast contracts have been negotiated and sponsorships signed, all in the hopes of the U.S. making a deep run next summer.

Now that the tournament on the doorstep, those plans appear to be crumbling.

 Sports 

Congressional leaders are asking Marco Rubio to help streamline the visa process for fans hoping to attend 2026 World Cup and 2028 Olympics.

Could the U.S. really field a World Cup team without Pulisic, Reyna, Weah and the others? Well, it will be fielding a Gold Cup team without them. And Pochettino seems to have found a sense of urgency that was missing in the Nations League debacle.

It's all a gamble. If the U.S. makes a long run in next year's World Cup, no one will remember who played in the Gold Cup. But if the U.S. is ousted early, Pulisic and the other absentees will get blamed, no matter how well they play.

“A home World Cup can create a legacy. We should be doing everything possible, on and off the field, to make it successful,” Lalas said. “There is pressure, responsibility and opportunity, especially for a country like the U.S. Home World Cups in 1994 and 1999 fundamentally changed the landscape and trajectory of soccer in America. 2026 can have the same impact.

“If we mess this up, on or off the field, we only have ourselves to blame.”

                        The Club World Cup, Henry Pollock and Ethan de Groot is discussed in Loose Pass.                    

This week we will mostly be concerning ourselves with the latest twist in the competitive landscape, the rise of Henry Pollock, and the latest judicial mis-steps…

It is difficult to imagine a better finale to the European season than the weekend just past. Tries, tackles, skills, talking points, free-flowing liquid refreshment and two worthy winners from two different countries.

How many of those supporters who watched on Friday night doubled up (as some tickets can do) on Saturday is unknown, but there was a combined attendance over the two matches of 107,000 people drawn from the four cities of participants and the small but indomitable throng of the disappointed from other clubs.

Yet while the finale was grand indeed, this column has repeatedly noted that the tweaks and re-boots of European rugby competition have somewhat eroded from the foundations of the success European rugby competition had originally been built on. Less jeopardy. More opportunities to field weakened teams. Ludicrous travel schedules. Teams making it through to the second phase despite only winning one of four pool matches. Knockout rounds featuring impossible logistics for fans and limited competitiveness. And such.

Still, at least the semi-finals and finals were both intensely competitive, brightly colourful and excellent occasions, throwbacks to the better days.

Except that from 2028, even those grand finales will be taken away from us. Because of the desire to have something even grander, bolder, bigger. Always bigger. Because in 2028, even conquering Europe and South Africa will not be enough, now you'll have to get past the Kiwis and Aussies and Japanese as well.

Idle bar chat has existed for yonks about how well the Toulouses, Bordeauxs, Northamptons and Leinsters of this world would match up against the Brumbies, Crusaders and… well, I guess the Saitama Wild Knights perhaps (?) in some tournament somewhere. Now we have that tournament. It's at the expense of Europe's grandest non-international occasion. And while interesting in the bar, we're not sure if watching Leinster take on travel-weary Brumbies in Marseille is actually going to be better than watching the knockout rounds in the Champions Cup. Or, for that matter, if European sides ended up trying for a win in an Otago winter somewhere down the line.

The worst thing about this new tournament – and the list is extensive – is that it has left us with the parts of the existing tournament we didn't like so much, and taken away the good parts to foist upon us something entirely devoid of the tradition, colour and history that makes European rugby such good fun. In a close second place for bad things comes the thought that this might be some form of answer back to FIFA's horribly-conceived Club World Cup to take place this year, which is enjoying, at best, a lukewarm reception. The same argument applies though: if you want to compete, do what you are best at. European rugby took time to bed in, but seven or eight years after its inception, we were all hooked.

Who's hot and who's not: Bordeaux and Bath celebrate but Henry Pollock mocking goes ‘too far' while All Black delivers ‘cowardly cheap shot'

Rugby does history and colour very, very well. It does not do global sporting domination and contrived, vanilla, mass-market appeal.

As a wise old man, who has been involved in the game for 81 of his 86 years explained to Loose Pass on Saturday after enjoying the Final: “I've never been so disillusioned. Weird new competitions everywhere with no meaning. Tours replaced by competitions that might last beyond my remaining years. Now they are fiddling with the Six Nations. Now the European Cup is going to be replaced. You don't know what to watch any more, or why. And all for money, not to make the rugby better. Why can't they just sit back and enjoy it, like we're always trying to do?”

If Henry Pollock did not consider that his somewhat extrovert presence in the rugbyverse around the world, replete with plentiful soundbite interviews, idiosyncratic scoring celebrations and full-on attention-loving presence everywhere, would make him a target, then someone is not doing their job.

It was good of his team-mates to back him when, apparently, the Bordeaux players went hunting for him at the final whistle on Saturday. But it's getting to the stage where club and country need to manage it a little more proportionately. Would it do anybody any harm if one of the older heads at Northampton had a little word? If the media people were to be perhaps encouraged to go looking for soundbites from someone else? If someone were perhaps to hint to him gently that the more he remains in his cage – in non-rugby activities at least – the less likely people are to want to rattle it?

It used to only be Owen Farrell and the RFU who got away with stunts like this, but the decision not even to take Ethan de Groot to task over his head-butt last weekend in Super Rugby Pacific is far, far beyond mystifying.

There's not a universe in which that movement was not intentional, in which that contact was not significant, in which that action was not clear and obvious even in real time. Getting away with it free as a bird makes even Sam Underhill look like an angel. It's a staggering miscarriage of justice by the NZRU and World Rugby, which does have previous in appealing non-decisions by judiciaries, needs to have a look at it.

Henry Pollock has posted a nine-word social media message about Saturday's Investec Champions Cup final loss for Northampton in Cardiff.

Retired England international Brian Moore has waded into the debate about Henry Pollock and the theory that he was "unfairly targeted" by Bordeaux in last Saturday's Investec Champions Cup final.

Saudi Arabia has denied reports that it will lift a long-standing ban on alcohol in the Gulf kingdom ahead of the 2034 World Cup. 

Several international media outlets reported this week that Saudi authorities were planning to allow alcohol sales in tourist settings. 

The report first appeared on a wine blog last week, but did not cite a source. 

It had claimed that the 73-year-old ban would be lifted on wine, beer and cider in licensed venues including luxury hotels, five-star resorts and tourist developments. 

On Monday, a Saudi official denied the reports to Reuters. An informed source aware of the matter told Arab News: “These claims lack any official confirmation from relevant authorities and do not reflect existing policies or regulations in Saudi Arabia.”

While alcohol remains banned, there has been a relaxing of some social norms since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman launched the Vision 2030 strategy nine years ago. 

The initiative seeks to move the kingdom away from oil reliance and improve its reputation around the world. 

Since it began, music festivals, fashion shows and cinemas have been legalised in the country. 

A ban on women driving was also lifted in 2017, and there was easing of gender segregation in some public spaces. 

Last year, the first alcohol store in Riyadh was opened, to serve non-Muslim diplomats. Prior to that, it was only available through the black market or diplomatic mail. 

The source told Arab News that the move was aimed at preventing the unauthorised use of diplomatic shipments, and control the use of alcohol under strict regulatory guidelines. 

In December, Saudi Arabia was unveiled as the host of the 2034 World Cup.

Its Gulf neighbour Qatar hosted the tournament in 2022. While it did not allow the sale of alcohol in stadiums during the tournament, it was sold in special fan zones. 

Prince Khalid bin Bandar bin Sultan Al Saud, Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the UK, said in February that alcohol wouldn't be available in the stands for the 2034 tournament.

“Rather like our weather, it's a dry country,” he said. “Everyone has their own culture, and we're happy to accommodate people within the boundaries of ours, but we don't want to change our culture for someone else.”

Tesla Cybertrucks joined Jalisco's police fleet before the 2026 FIFA World Cup. The Mexican state aims to enhance security and project a modern image with the Tesla Cybertrucks.



Jalisco is preparing to welcome millions of visitors as Guadalajara, its capital, joins Mexico City and Monterrey as one of three Mexican host cities for the global event. The 2026 FIFA World Cup will feature 13 matches, including an opening ceremony game.



The Tesla Cybertrucks are part of Jalisco's broader security strategy to ensure safety during the international tournament. With an expected influx of over 5 million visitors, the state is focusing patrols in key tourist areas. Acquiring Tesla's all-electric pickup trucks underscores Jalisco's commitment to blending innovation with security.



Governor Pablo Lemus defended the decision to integrate three Tesla Cybertrucks into the State Public Security Department's fleet.



“We also need to work a lot on the perception of security; we are going to deliver 678 patrol cars for the State Police, State Highway Police, and State Police, including some ‘Black Mambas,' which are this kind of tanks,” Lemus said.Advertisement
The Cybertrucks are part of a larger delivery of 678 patrol vehicles to state and municipal forces, enhancing capability and public perception. Lemus' comment reveals one of the reasons that Tesla Cybertruck continues to attract buyers despite its out-of-the-box design.

The Tesla Cybertruck's unveiling received mixed reviews, with many commenting on its origami-like form. Over time, the pickup truck was seen as a good commercial vehicle since it attracted attention and could be imposing.



During President Donald Trump's visit to Doha, Qatar, two Tesla Cybertruck police vehicles accompanied his motorcade. Their iconic light bars and striking design made them stand out, showcasing their versatility beyond Jalisco's borders.



As Jalisco prepares for the global spotlight of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the Tesla Cybertrucks symbolize a fusion of cutting-edge technology and strategic security planning. The initiative aims to protect visitors and positions Jalisco as a forward-thinking region, leveraging Tesla's innovative vehicles to enhance its global image. With the tournament approaching, these patrols could set a new standard for security at international events, blending sustainability with strength.

Tesla teased a new color that could be coming to the United States with the new Model S and Model X.

Tesla appears to be teasing a brand new color while it was testing the refreshed Model S and Model X, which was spotted last week in California.

Tesla currently offers six paint options in the United States, but they are all pretty basic. This has not been a problem for owners as wrapping the vehicles is a common practice, but some people would likely see more versatility from Tesla in terms of their standard paint colors.

This is especially relevant as Europe has been able to have both Midnight Cherry Red and Quicksilver, which were, at one time, exclusive to the market.

Quicksilver made its way to the United States, and Tesla did release a new Red last year with “Ultra Red,” but Midnight Cherry Red never made its way outside the walls of Gigafactory Berlin.

Last week, as the first spy images of the new Model S and Model X were taken and released by The Kilowatts, there was a very noticeable difference with the vehicle, as other changes seemed to be relatively underwhelming: a new paint color.

Many believed this was simply a wrap, but Ryan Levenson of The Kilowatts, a former Tesla employee, dispelled that rumor after several questions about it.

He said that this is absolutely a factory paint color and not a wrap:

Tesla released a new color earlier this year, but it was just a revision to Black, now called “Diamond Black,” featuring speckles that give a reflection and refraction of light as a diamond would.

However, this new color is certainly quite different than anything Tesla has previously offered in the U.S. before. It is relatively similar to Glacier Blue, a color Tesla launched in Asia. Earlier this year, Franz von Holzhausen, Tesla's Chief Designer, talked about bringing the color to the U.S.:

“Glacier Blue is just a color that we've been talking about with our team — the team is like right through that window by the way — and we were looking at the impact of silver, how do we get pigment into silver and really add a little bit of personality to it. If you look at our palette, you know it was either darks or white, and so we were looking for something in between. Blue is always a fairly popular color.”

It would be a refreshing addition to the options Tesla currently offers, and a breath of fresh air for those who have been wanting a different look altogether.

Mark Cuban said this simple Tesla feature will eventually lead to him selling the car.

Known Elon Musk critic Mark Cuban is ready to sell his Tesla because of a simple feature that is one of the more polarizing amongst community members.

Cuban and Musk have gone head-to-head in several back-and-forths on X, Musk's social media platform, formerly Twitter. However, it is not the public spats that the two have shared that makes Cuban want to sell his car. In fact, it is something relatively trivial and a feature that many could easily adjust to in the matter of a few minutes of driving.

For the entrepreneur and former owner of the Dallas Mavericks, it is a feature that every driver must use, but Tesla temporarily changed it in the Model 3, Model S, and Model X: the turn signal.

With the refreshed versions of the S, 3, and X, Tesla chose to eliminate the turn signal stalk, instead opting for a turn signal button, which is located on the steering wheel. This was a change that was extremely polarizing among the Tesla community, with many requesting that the company reverse the change with the new Model Y.

They listened, and the newest version of the all-electric crossover has a stalk. No turn signal haptics are available on the new Model Y.

This is one feature Cuban said he cannot get into, and instead chooses to drive his Kia EV6, which he said he is “comfortable with.”

On the Your Mom's House podcast, Cuban commented on the stalk and turn signal button dilemma within the vehicle:

“On the Tesla, you've got to find [the turn signal] and push the button…while you're driving. You can't pay attention to the road as much. [The Kia] doesn't try to be too fancy. Your turn signal is like, a turn signal.”

It's hard to imagine that someone's attention is taken away from the road when pushing a button. In my test drive of the new Model 3 last year, I noted that the button was definitely an adjustment, but it only took a few minutes to adjust to:

“It only took me about three or four turns, or roughly ten minutes, to realize I needed to stop reaching for stalks. I feel like the buttons are super convenient, but there were times I would push the edges or corners, and the signal would not come on.”

I drove the new Tesla Model 3, here's what got better



At least to me, it's not super believable that pushing a turn signal button takes your attention away from the road for more than a split second. Do I like the traditional stalk more? Yes. However, it would not make me sell a car I really enjoyed driving.

Cuban also said that his son called the EV6 “a nerd car,” to which he replied, “Exactly.”

A tax on vehicles in the United Kingdom is set to be adjusted after automakers have blamed it for struggling sales.

Published

A controversial tax set on cars that are above the £40,000 price threshold in the United Kingdom could be abandoned, as the “Tesla Tax,” as it is commonly referred to, is taking the blame for poor EV sales.

The tax has been imposed on ICE vehicles since 2017, but on April 1, 2025, the “Expensive Car Supplement,” or ECS, was applied to new EVs sold after that date, a move that was initiated in an act of fairness.

Tesla best-rated car brand in UK, beats Toyota in reliability: survey



However, the tax is now being blamed for sluggish EV sales across various parts of Europe. In the UK, manufacturers are blaming the tax for making it more difficult to reach sales quantities for binding green car sales targets. Missing these sales goals could cost manufacturers millions or even billions of dollars.

A leaked letter seen by This Is Money and MailOnline shows the UK is ready to reconsider the tax, which is combined with a Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) on cars in the second year after they are registered.

The tax could be applied to vehicles at a higher price point, or it could be eliminated altogether. However, Ben Maguire, a Lib Dem MP for one region in the UK, said:

“We will consider raising the threshold for zero-emission cars only at a future fiscal event to make it easier to buy electric cars.”

Several companies said an adjustment to the tax would be “a move in the right direction,” and one of the major new car retailers in the UK said sales targets are “unrealistic” with the tax currently set at where it is.

UK reconsiders EV sales targets, listening to automakers



Even still, without the adjustment, retailers are concerned that EVs are not at a spot where consumers truly can justify them as a purchase. One company said “cost, lack of incentives, and lack of a public charging infrastructure” are the biggest bottlenecks in the adoption of EVs.

FIFA Club World Cup

Trent Alexander-Arnold is a Liverpool player until June 30.

But Real Madrid want their prospective new signing to line up for them in the Club World Cup, starting in mid-June.

Kevin De Bruyne is due to leave Manchester City as a free agent, also at the end of June. He has said he is unlikely to take part in the competition — but what if City decide they want him to play in FIFA's revamped tournament, which runs until mid-July?

To make its new-look flagship club competition run as smoothly as possible, world football's governing body has put in place some new rules and amended some old ones, meaning players and clubs could defy conventional logic and take part, when it might previously have seemed impossible.

FIFA has changed its normal rules, creating an extra transfer window to help clubs sign players in time for the Club World Cup.

Normally, the world governing body allows each member country to set dates for two transfer windows each year, one mainly in the close season and another in the middle of the season — the summer and winter windows for European clubs.

But with the redesigned tournament around the corner, FIFA has included a new regulation in the Club World Cup rules, allowing a short extra window at the start of June.

It reads: “Member associations of clubs participating in the competition shall have the possibility to establish an exceptional additional registration period from June 1-10, 2025. For the avoidance of doubt, no member association is obliged to establish such an exceptional additional registration period.”

But FIFA's rules mean member countries can only allow transfer business for 16 weeks a year, interpreted in Europe as four mid-season and 12 in the summer.

To keep the summer window open until September 1 as planned, European nations will close their transfer window for five days, reopening it from June 16.

And to prevent any unfair advantages, the extra transfer window will be open to all clubs, not just those involved in the Club World Cup.

Standard player contracts in Europe typically run from July 1 to June 30, meaning clubs involved in the Club World Cup could find themselves with players leaving as free agents during the tournament.

To help solve that issue, FIFA has added a mid-tournament registration window from June 27 to July 3, allowing clubs to replace out-of-contract players with players who might have joined at the end of their contracts elsewhere, or been bought from other clubs after the end of the extra transfer window.

But if clubs want to add players whose contracts are expiring in time for the start of the tournament, they would need to reach an agreement with the player's current club.

For example, Real Madrid want Alexander-Arnold for the whole Club World Cup but to get their wish they need to agree a conventional transfer with Liverpool.

In reality, that would almost certainly require only a nominal fee, as the player is of no value to Liverpool now their season has ended — they are not part of the inaugural Club World Cup — and allowing him to leave early would mean a relatively small but significant saving to the Merseyside club on the player's salary.

But if a deal could not be agreed, Madrid would have to wait until Alexander-Arnold becomes a free agent mid-tournament — although he could still be added to their squad for the knockout stages of the Club World Cup thanks to the registration window.

For De Bruyne and other players who will reach the end of their contracts with Club World Cup sides during the tournament, the issue is different.

If the Belgian finds a new club before the end of his deal but decides he does want to represent City and see out the tournament, he would need to reach an agreement with his new club to sign a short-term extension at the Etihad, encompassing the first two weeks of July.

But any agreement would be complicated by the possibility of players being injured during the competition — something De Bruyne himself spoke about after the FA Cup final, telling The Athletic: “I think in a way I have to take care of myself because if I get injured in the Club World Cup, what am I going to do? Nobody's going to take care of me at that point. So there's a big chance probably that I won't play it, but I don't know, maybe yes.”

Players cannot play for more than one club in the Club World Cup so De Bruyne, for example, could not start with Manchester City and end it playing for another side, even if he signed for another Club World Cup participant during the competition.

Clubs can also add two extra players to the squad during the mid-tournament registration window, potentially taking their squad size from 35 up to 37. But clubs can make a maximum of six changes to their squad overall.

And for a new player to take part in a Club World Cup match, his new club must have registered him and notified FIFA at least 48 hours before kick-off.

The Club World Cup is exempt from FIFA rules stating players cannot play for more than two clubs in a single season, so a player who has represented two clubs during a domestic season could play for a third team in the tournament.

FIFA has also changed its rules compelling clubs involved in the Club World Cup to release players for international duty.

The tournament regulations say Club World Cup participants are exempt but must still release their players for the international window that runs from June 2-10, immediately before the tournament begins.

In reality, however, the only international fixtures that clash with the Club World Cup come at the Concacaf Gold Cup, also being held in the United States as well as Canada.

So ‘only' the 16 nations from North and Central America and the Caribbean are potentially affected.

Clubs have been asked to submit a provisional list of up to 50 players, which will be whittled down to a final list of 35 before the tournament begins.

Goalkeepers can be replaced by another of their club's players at any stage in the tournament if proof of serious injury or illness is provided.

Portugal icon Cristiano Ronaldo indicated on Monday that he could leave Al-Nassr after declaring that a "chapter is over" hours after the Saudi Pro League finished. Ronaldo, 40, joined Al-Nassr in 2022 from Manchester United and his contract in Saudi Arabia ends this summer. A special transfer window runs from June 1-10 to allow the 32 clubs involved in the Club World Cup to sign players. The iconic goalscorer is said to be in talks with a few clubs over a switch ahead of the start of the Club World Cup.

"This chapter is over," Ronaldo cryptically said on social media with a photo of him in an Al-Nassr shirt.

"The story? Still being written. Grateful to all," the former Real Madrid and Juventus attacker added.

This chapter is over.

Al-Nassr missed out on the Asian Champions League Elite, losing to Japan's Kawasaki Frontale in April's semi-finals and were third in the Saudi Pro League.

Ronaldo ended as the league's top goal scorer on 24.

Last year, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said he could end his career wit Al-Nassr.

FIFA president Gianni Infantino had earlier suggested that Ronaldo might indeed feature in the Club World Cup, hinting at the possibility of a deal between the Portuguese superstar and a few interested clubs. Infantino's comments received plenty of backlash, but it seems like something indeed is cooking between Ronaldo and certain clubs participating in the Club World Cup, set to be held in June.

"Ronaldo might play for one of the teams as well at the Club World Cup. There are discussions with some clubs, so if any club is watching and is interested in hiring Ronaldo for the Club World Cup... who knows, who knows," he had said.

The prospect of seeing the Club World Cup feature both Ronaldo and Messi is indeed enticing to many. It would be the first time that the FIFA Club World Cup will be played din the summer, with 32 teams participating.

Kim is giving everything for Bayern.

Kim Min-Jae has had a rough year for Bayern Munich. Despite an initially shaky start, head coach Vincent Kompany put his trust in the South Korean star and that trust was starting to be repaid following stabilized form and a solid first half of the season. But, in what is becoming a worrying trend, Kim's form trailed off terribly and he was culpable for some very poor errors during the business end of the season.

A key reason for this was his Achilles injury. Sustained in early October in a 3-3 draw with Eintracht Frankfurt, the former Napoli player soldiered through the pain and risk of an even bigger injury for over eight months. The only break of sorts that he got was missing out South Korea's World Cup qualifiers and being rested for the last two games of the season at Bayern.

Now it seems he has another. South Korea's official release of their squad for their games against Iraq on June 6 and Kuwait on June 10 notably excluded Kim. @iMiaSanMia captured the reason for his absence:

Kim Min-jae is not in South Korea's squad for the World Cup qualifiers early next month. He's working on getting fit for the Club World Cup.

One cannot deny Kim's strong desire to help the club as much as he can. 

On a side note, current Bayern player Lee Hyun-ju and former Bayern player Jeong Woo-yeong unfortunately miss out as well, despite their growth and good form this season. What a shame.

With a straight-sets win Tuesday at the French Open, Sonay Kartal is managing a promising start to her week with a steady hand and a new piece of ink on the horizon.

Sonay Kartal made quick work of Erika Andreeva on Tuesday at Roland Garros, cruising to a 6-0, 6-2 win in just over an hour. But her first main-draw victory in Paris wasn't the only thing on her mind this week. She also had a tattoo appointment to reschedule.

“I actually had one booked tomorrow at 11,” she said with a grin, when asked how she might celebrate. “But I'm on at 11 [doubles]. My sister just texted me and she's changed [the appointment] to 4. Yeah, I'll be getting one tomorrow.”

Kartal, a 23-year-old from Great Britain, revealed it would be her 14th tattoo, finally breaking past a number she wasn't exactly eager to sit on.

“Thirteen,” she said. “So I'm happy to get it off No. 13. Yeah, I've been stuck on that one. I haven't been able to get it. I'm happy to take it to 14.”

As for what the new ink will be, she's leaving that decision to her sister.

“Not actually sure what I'm going to get,” Kartal said. “I know she wants to get one, as well, so she's booked it. I think she wants matching, so I'll get whatever she wants.”

Kartal, currently the 56th-ranked player, didn't rule out marking the occasion more specifically once her tournament run is done. 

“Maybe once I'm finished here, I'll get something that resembles the French Open maybe,” she said.

And if you're wondering how she balances tattoo pain with professional tennis? She's not fazed.

“Honestly, the niggles I carry on the court every day are much more painful than that,” Kartal said. “Somewhere on my arm is not too sore. I've got a few,” she said. “No, it's nothing like a tennis niggle.”

She's through to Round 2, and if court times cooperate, she'll be in the tattoo chair before sunset.

With a straight-sets win Tuesday at the French Open, Sonay Kartal is managing a promising start to her week with a steady hand and a new piece of ink on the horizon.

Joao Fonseca made a sparkling Roland Garros debut on Tuesday when he ousted the in-form Hubert Hurkacz 6-2, 6-4, 6-2.

 
The 18-year-old is the second-youngest match winner at the clay-court major in the past 10 years, only behind an 18-year-old Carlos Alcaraz in 2021.

 
Fonseca struck the ball confidently and fed off the energy of a packed Court 7. He left the 30th-seed Hurkacz searching for answers, overpowering him from the baseline and matching that heavy hitting with watertight consistency. Hurkacz was a finalist at last week's ATP 250 event in Geneva, where he fell to Novak Djokovic in a three-hour, five-minute final.

 
Fonseca now boasts an 11-7 tour-level season record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. At the Australian Open, he earned a memorable first main-draw win at a major by stunning ninth seed Andrey Rublev. Fonseca won his maiden tour-level title the following month in Buenos Aires.





 
At No. 57 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, Fonseca will next face French veteran Pierre-Hugues Herbert, 16 years his senior.
In other Paris action, Jack Draper's clay-court evolution continued when he overcame a tricky start to notch his maiden match win at Roland Garros.
 The fifth seed overcame Mattia Bellucci 3-6, 6-1, 6-4, 6-2 in heavy conditions under the Court Suzanne-Lenglen roof, which was closed due to steady rain in the French capital. Draper broke serve five times across the second, third and fourth sets to improve to 10-3 on clay in 2025. That tally includes his maiden final on the surface at the ATP Masters 1000 event in Madrid as well as a quarter-final run in Rome. 
Back from a set down… Draper does it 👊He defeats Bellucci 3-6 6-1 6-4 6-2... 🔥 #rolandgarros #jackdraper pic.twitter.com/s096Ibp79Y— ATP Tour (@atptour) May 27, 2025 
 “I think Bellucci came out and played really aggressive from the start,” said Draper after improving to 2-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Bellucci. “He was coming out with some amazing shots, caught me a little bit off guard. I served a couple of double faults, which doesn't help at this level where everyone plays incredible tennis. The margins are so small. 
 "I'm really proud of the way I was able to turn the game on its head. I started to be more aggressive. It was a really tough battle and credit to Mattia, who played incredible.” 
 Draper, who is currently up one spot at No. 4 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, will play home favourite Gael Monfils or Bolivia's Hugo Dellien next in Paris. The 23-year-old is looking to add a first Grand Slam title to his maiden Masters 1000 crown, which he won in March in Indian Wells.

 “I think Bellucci came out and played really aggressive from the start,” said Draper after improving to 2-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Bellucci. “He was coming out with some amazing shots, caught me a little bit off guard. I served a couple of double faults, which doesn't help at this level where everyone plays incredible tennis. The margins are so small. 

 "I'm really proud of the way I was able to turn the game on its head. I started to be more aggressive. It was a really tough battle and credit to Mattia, who played incredible.” 

 Draper, who is currently up one spot at No. 4 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, will play home favourite Gael Monfils or Bolivia's Hugo Dellien next in Paris. The 23-year-old is looking to add a first Grand Slam title to his maiden Masters 1000 crown, which he won in March in Indian Wells.

Iga Swiatek is searching for a fourth consecutive French Open title at this year's event.

The Polish star hasn't had the best of starts to her 2025 campaign, and traveled to Paris having failed to win any of the eight WTA tournaments she's played.

Despite her recent struggles, many are still picking Swiatek to come away with the French Open title, thanks to her dominance on the Parisian clay over the years.

Swiatek beat Rebecca Sramkova in her opener, 6-3, 6-3, to send her through to the second round in convincing fashion.

After the match, Swiatek revealed what she finds different about the French Open compared to the next Grand Slam event, Wimbledon.

During her post-match press conference, Swiatek gave her verdict on the French Open and Wimbledon.

“I just love everything here because of the fact that I have played good here,” she said.

“When I compare it to Wimbledon, for example, at Wimbledon I always feel this tension that I am not sure what is going to happen, but here at Roland Garros it feels like home.

“I just hope that I am going to play well enough to stay here as long as possible.”

Swiatek then assessed her level, having beaten her Slovakian opponent in straight sets.

“Honestly, from the beginning I was ready to compete and I was just happy that I was there on Philippe Chatrier,” she said.

“Rebecca [Sramkova] played much better than in Australia, so for sure she worked on some stuff and changed some stuff.

“But I was happy with my game. I was really focused on what I wanted to do on the court, and my head was clear, so when I made some mistakes, I corrected them immediately, and it was a good day.”

Swiatek had beaten Sramkova, 6-0, 6-2, at the Australian Open in January, but was made to work harder in Paris.

Just as she did in Melbourne, Swiatek will return to take on Emma Raducanu after beating Sramkova.

Swiatek leads the head-to-head with Raducanu, 4-0, and is yet to drop a set against the British star.

Only time will tell who will come out on top in their fifth career meeting when Swiatek and Raducanu battle it out for a place in the third round on Wednesday, May 28.

Swiatek mentioned how she feels ‘tension' when playing at Wimbledon, but how has she fared on the grass during her career to date?

The world number five came closest to victory in 2023, when she lost to Ukraine's Elina Svitolina in the quarterfinals.

Her results at Roland Garros are far more impressive, winning the tournament on four of her six visits to the French capital.

It's perhaps no surprise that the French Open has been Swiatek's most successful Grand Slam event, as she continues to produce her best tennis on the clay.

It remains to be seen if Swiatek can improve upon her underwhelming Wimbledon record when the tournament begins on Monday, June 30.

Hugo Gaston withdrew from Roland Garros on Tuesday due to abdominal pain. His scheduled second-round opponent, Ben Shelton, advances to the third round.

In the pair's first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting, which came last year in the first round of Roland Garros, Shelton won in four sets. Gaston will not be able to level their series this tournament.

The Frenchman rallied from two sets to one down in the first round against countryman Ugo Blanchet to triumph in five sets. In his post-match press conference, he did not reference the abdominal pain.



Shelton, who ousted Lorenzo Sonego in his opener, will compete in the third round at the clay-court major for the second consecutive year and will try to make the fourth round on the Parisian clay for the first time. The 13th seed will take on 20th seed Stefanos Tsitsipas or Italian Matteo Gigante.

If Shelton advances, he will have reached at least the fourth round at all four Grand Slam tournaments. The lefty is a two-time major semi-finalist, including a trip to the last four of the Australian Open earlier this year.

The two-time Roland Garros finalist dishes on private chefs, stomach bugs and the foods he now avoids.ByStephanie LivaudaisPublished May 27, 2025 copy_link

Published May 27, 2025

PARIS, France — Riding high after capturing the biggest title of his career—his first ATP Masters 1000 in Madrid—an in-form Casper Ruud arrived in Paris with momentum, but also with something to prove after managing only one game in a Rome quarterfinal rout to Jannik Sinner.On Monday, the two-time Roland Garros finalist got off to a confident start, easing past Albert Ramos-Vinolas 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 to extend his perfect first-round record in Paris to 8-0.But while his tennis may be under control, managing his “clean and strict” diet on the road? That's a different challenge altogether.Read More: Carlos Alcaraz says he has “found the good path again” | Roland Garros Wrap, Day 2Last year, Ruud battled a stomach bug late in his Paris campaign—something the No. 7 seed is keen to avoid repeating.“It's not easy, I tell you, because we are pretty much in a new city every week or every second week,” he told Tennis.com in Paris.

Staying consistent with nutrition goals is no small feat on the pro tennis circuit. Temptation is always around the corner as they regularly compete in foodie havens—just try resisting the local cuisine in Rome, Paris, New York or Hong Kong. Add in varying food safety standards, and even the most disciplined players can struggle to stick to their plans.While a private chef might solve the problem, that luxury is reserved for the tour's top earners. Novak Djokovic, for instance, often travels with a chef to help manage his plant-based, gluten-free diet and intermittent fasting regimen.Read More: Novak Djokovic shares his diet regimen on Tennis United“That's an investment that I've thought about in the past, but it's practically quite hard because you would need a place with a kitchen, to have fresh food all the time. It's not easy at all,” Ruud explained.“Hotels are more practical for us because if you lose, you can just check out and leave. If you're renting a private place, you need to rent it for the whole stay in case you make the final or win the tournament.“It's a pretty big commitment financially to do that. I haven't found the budget for it and the need for it.”

When he's in tournament mode, Ruud keeps it simple:“I try to eat clean and strict,” Ruud tells me. “I have, of course, my favorite types of food, like everyone I guess. I don't eat greasy, fatty food typically during tournaments.“It's kind of boring: just a lot of rice, some pasta every now and then. I feel a bit heavy when I eat too much pasta. I keep it mostly to rice and some kind of protein.”He's also grown wary of raw vegetables and salads—foods he now avoids when traveling due to prior bouts of food poisoning.

“If you're in countries where the water is not clean enough, how can you be sure that it's not cleaned in the wrong way?” he explained.Ruud found that out the hard way, after falling ill multiple times last season due to gastrointestinal issues. He was also among several top seeds who withdrew from this year's Acapulco event with stomach problems.“Salad and vegetables is what you are told is going to be good for you, at the same time it's a quite big risk when it's not cooked or cleaned well,” he lamented. “It's kind of tough.“You're always thinking, where did I go last year and didn't get sick? I'll go back to that restaurant, probably.”

Cameron Norrie scored a major upset on Tuesday at Roland Garros, where he sunk 11th seed Daniil Medvedev in a gruelling five-set battle.

The Briton, currently No. 81 in the PIF ATP Rankings, dug deep for a 7-5, 6-3, 4-6, 1-6, 7-5 victory to advance to the second round in Paris for the fifth time. After rallying from a two-sets-to-love deficit, Medvedev then failed to serve out the match at 5-4 in the decider before Norrie crossed the line after three hours, 53 minutes.

“It was an incredible atmosphere, I really felt like I had the momentum there,” Norrie said when asked of the conclusion to the match. “I felt a lot of energy, and I managed to get over the line. He was a little bit tentative, it was honestly a crazy match.

“He's so tough to beat, I think I deserve a diploma for beating Medvedev… He's got me the last four times.”

PASSING THE TEST 📖

Norrie pushes through an absolute thriller of a match to defeat Medvedev 7-5 6-3 4-6 1-6 7-5 🔥@rolandgarros | #RolandGarros | #Norrie pic.twitter.com/rlwkcOXnEn

Last week, Norrie rose nine spots in the PIF ATP Rankings with his run to the semi-finals in Geneva, where he lost to eventual champion Novak Djokovic. The former World No. 8 will now look to build on his run of form in Paris, where next faces Argentine lucky loser Federico Agustin Gomez.

Medvedev failed to serve out the opening set at 5-4 and Norrie subsequently won eight consecutive games to soar to a two-sets-to-love lead. The former US Open champion, Medvedev shifted to a more aggressive approach during the second set, but it was unsuccessful, thus reverting back to his more traditional counterpunching style, which proved pivotal.

Leading 2-1 in the third set, Medvedev received a medical timeout to treat a cut on his right index finger. Yet despite the increasingly loose grip on his racquet — and the first-round encounter with Norrie — Medvedev showed signs of resilience. The 29-year-old let slip two break points at 3-2 in the third, according to Infosys Stats, but responded with a mid-match streak of his own, during which he won seven straight games en route to levelling the contest.

However, it was Norrie's fighting spirit that stole the show in the end. The deciding set had traits of a dogfight early on, with Norrie saving four break points to hold serve after a 13-minute opening game. Yet while Medvedev appeared to be closing in on his fifth career comeback from a two-set deficit, Norrie held firm and stuck to his aggressive game plan, reeling off the final four games from 3-5 to seal his first Lexus ATP Head2Head victory over Medvedev in their fifth battle.



Medvedev's first-round defeat draws parallels to his second-round loss at the Australian Open in January, when he rallied from two sets down only to fall to a gut-wrenching five-set defeat to #NextGenATP Learner Tien. Medvedev has now lost in the opening round at Roland Garros in six of his nine appearances in the French capital.

Now 18th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, the former Nitto ATP Finals champion faces a tough task to qualify for the prestigious season finale. He owns an 18-11 record on the season.

Last year's Roland Garros runner-up, Alexander Zverev claimed a contrasting 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 first-round win over Tien on Tuesday. The third seed, who was also defeated by the American in Acapulco in February, saved all four break points faced during the one-hour, 53-minute clash.

The third-seeded Zverev, who has reached the semi-finals in each of his past four appearances at the clay-court major, will next play Francesco Passaro or Jesper de Jong.

“I'm very happy to be back in Paris, Roland Garros is a very special place to me,” said Zverev. “It was a good start to the tournament, very happy with the three set win. Hopefully it's going to continue like this, and hopefully it's going to be a fun two weeks here.”

Zverev has experienced a topsy-turvy season since reaching his third major final in Melbourne in January. The German notably fell to opening-round defeats in Indian Wells and Monte-Carlo before triumphing at the ATP 500 in Munich. After surrendering the World No. 2 spot to Carlos Alcaraz, Zverev will hope to reignite his best form in Paris.

Last year, Zverev ended the Roland Garros career of 14-time champion Rafael Nadal in the first round. The Spaniard was honoured with a permanent plaque on Court Philippe-Chatrier on Sunday.

Cameron Norrie scored a major upset on Tuesday at Roland Garros, where he sunk 11th seed Daniil Medvedev in a gruelling five-set battle.

The Briton, currently No. 81 in the PIF ATP Rankings, dug deep for a 7-5, 6-3, 4-6, 1-6, 7-5 victory to advance to the second round in Paris for the fifth time. After rallying from a two-sets-to-love deficit, Medvedev then failed to serve out the match at 5-4 in the decider before Norrie crossed the line after three hours, 53 minutes.

“It was an incredible atmosphere, I really felt like I had the momentum there,” Norrie said when asked of the conclusion to the match. “I felt a lot of energy, and I managed to get over the line. He was a little bit tentative, it was honestly a crazy match.

“He's so tough to beat, I think I deserve a diploma for beating Medvedev… He's got me the last four times.”

Last week, Norrie rose nine spots in the PIF ATP Rankings with his run to the semi-finals in Geneva, where he lost to eventual champion Novak Djokovic. The former World No. 8 will now look to build on his run of form in Paris, where next faces Argentine lucky loser Federico Agustin Gomez.

Medvedev failed to serve out the opening set at 5-4 and Norrie subsequently won eight consecutive games to soar to a two-sets-to-love lead. The former US Open champion, Medvedev shifted to a more aggressive approach during the second set, but it was unsuccessful, thus reverting back to his more traditional counterpunching style, which proved pivotal.

Leading 2-1 in the third set, Medvedev received a medical timeout to treat a cut on his right index finger. Yet despite the increasingly loose grip on his racquet — and the first-round encounter with Norrie — Medvedev showed signs of resilience. The 29-year-old let slip two break points at 3-2 in the third, according to Infosys Stats, but responded with a mid-match streak of his own, during which he won seven straight games en route to levelling the contest.

However, it was Norrie's fighting spirit that stole the show in the end. The deciding set had traits of a dogfight early on, with Norrie saving four break points to hold serve after a 13-minute opening game. Yet while Medvedev appeared to be closing in on his fifth career comeback from a two-set deficit, Norrie held firm and stuck to his aggressive game plan, reeling off the final four games from 3-5 to seal his first Lexus ATP Head2Head victory over Medvedev in their fifth battle.



Medvedev's first-round defeat draws parallels to his second-round loss at the Australian Open in January, when he rallied from two sets down only to fall to a gut-wrenching five-set defeat to #NextGenATP Learner Tien. Medvedev has now lost in the opening round at Roland Garros in six of his nine appearances in the French capital.

Now 18th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, the former Nitto ATP Finals champion faces a tough task to qualify for the prestigious season finale. He owns an 18-11 record on the season.

Last year's Roland Garros runner-up, Alexander Zverev claimed a contrasting 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 first-round win over Tien on Tuesday. The third seed, who was also defeated by the American in Acapulco in February, saved all four break points faced during the one-hour, 53-minute clash.

Fresh from reaching a career-high world No. 8 ranking, British tennis stalwart Cameron Norrie remains a prominent figure in the sport.

This distinguished left-hander has etched a significant path on the ATP Tour, highlighted by a maiden Masters 1000 triumph at Indian Wells and a Wimbledon semi-final appearance.

While his ranking has seen recent shifts, Norrie's journey reflects his resilience as he continues to compete on the Grand Slam stage.

Tennis Head has everything you need to know about this accomplished player.

Norrie's partner is Louise Jacobi. She is an American who works as a textile designer and has her own homeware and fashion accessory shop called Studio Virgo. 

They reportedly met in 2019 in New York City and have been together for about four years.

Cameron Norrie and Louise Jacobi have been together for around four years. The couple were introduced by mutual friends at a New York City bar in 2019.

Norrie's ranking has seen a substantial shift. After reaching a career-high of No. 8 in the ATP singles ranking in September 2022, he has since moved down the rankings to his current position of No. 81 as of May 19, 2025.

His rise to the top 10 was a result of consistent performances, including his first ATP title win in Los Cabos in 2021, followed by a victory at the Indian Wells Masters later that year. 

However, maintaining such a high ranking in the competitive world of professional tennis is a constant challenge. While Norrie remains a formidable player, recent results have not consistently matched his peak level from 2021 and 2022, leading to the current drop in his ranking. 

Australian Open: Norrie's best showing in Melbourne was reaching the fourth round in 2024. Across his appearances, he holds a 7-7 win-loss record at the Australian Open. In the 2025 edition, he was beaten in the first round by Matteo Berrettini. His performance in the earlier rounds has varied, but the 2024 run marked his deepest journey in this Grand Slam.

French Open: Roland Garros has seen Norrie reach the third round on three occasions: in 2021, 2022, and 2023. His overall record at the French Open is balanced at 7 wins and 7 losses. He is currently participating in the 2025 tournament.

Wimbledon: His most successful Grand Slam tournament is Wimbledon, where he achieved his best major result by reaching the semi-final in 2022. His career record at the All England Club stands at 11 wins and 7 losses. In the 2024 edition, he reached the third round before losing to Alexander Zverev.

US Open: At Flushing Meadows, Norrie's best performance was reaching the fourth round in 2022. His overall win-loss record at the US Open is 9 wins and 7 losses, although he did not take part in 2024. His appearances have shown constant progress to the middle stages of the event.

Norrie was born in 1995 in Johannesburg, South Africa, to British microbiologist parents: his father, David, is from Glasgow and his mother, Helen, is from Cardiff.

In 1998, when Norrie was three, he and his family moved to Auckland, New Zealand, after being victims of a burglary in South Africa. His parents lived in New Zealand until 2023 when they moved back to the United Kingdom.

In 2011, at age 16, he moved to his parents' native United Kingdom, where he lived in London for three years before attending Texas Christian University in Fort Worth from 2014 to 2017. 

In June 2017, he ended his studies at TCU to turn professional during the grass court season of the 2017 ATP Tour.

Norrie is 29 years old and was born on August 23, 1995. He is 6 feet 2 inches tall. He began playing tennis at the age of six, with his mother introducing him to the sport, and he supposedly started playing in the driveway of their family home in New Zealand.

Norrie's estimated net worth is around £4.43 million as of July 2024, mainly built through his tennis career. His total prize money earnings exceed £8.75 million (as of January 2025). Beyond on-court earnings, lucrative endorsements greatly contribute to his wealth.

He has partnered with the likes of Babolat, Rado, Maui Jim and Lexus UK. Other endorsements include Ralph Lauren, Uber, Athletic Brewing, Waterdrop, PGIM, and Illuvium.

Tennis

ROLAND GARROS, PARIS — He's a young Italian tennis player, but not Jannik Sinner or Lorenzo Musetti.

He's an up-and-coming On athlete, but not Ben Shelton or Joao Fonseca.

He could have been a famous footballer, but left the youth academy of Serie A club Roma as a teenager.

And he's so softly spoken, that at times it's impossible to hear him without leaning in close.

Flavio Cobolli, an understated but self-assured 23-year-old Italian, has flown under the radar during his fledgling tennis career. That is now much harder, because he just won the biggest title of his career. Before the French Open, Cobolli beat former world No. 5 Andrey Rublev in straight sets to claim the Hamburg Open in Germany, an ATP 500 event, a couple of rungs below the Grand Slams. Cobolli saved all five of the break points he faced in the biggest match of his career.

Cobolli said he felt “a little bit confused” in an interview at Roland Garros on Sunday as he explained the feeling of winning a big title and then heading straight to another one, trophy in hand.

“I like it,” he said of the attention before a first-round match against lucky loser and 2014 U.S. Open champion Marin Čilić. “It's a little strange for me because I never had it.”

Clay is his preferred surface. In April, Cobolli won his first ATP Tour title on the surface at the Romanian Open. It was an unlikely win, coming off the back of an eight-match losing streak at the start of 2025. It was deflating after his breakthrough season in 2024, which saw his ranking rise from outside the world's top 100 to the top 30. His latest title win also followed a disappointing couple of results: a first-round exit at the Italian Open and a quarterfinal defeat at a Challenger tournament in Turin.

Going back to last year, Cobolli partly credits his progress to doing pre-season training in Spain with an old friend, Carlos Alcaraz. The two met over a decade ago on the junior circuit, where Cobolli once won a doubles match against the Spaniard. During an interview at the Laver Cup in September, Cobolli proudly referenced that junior victory, and said of their training block together at the Ferrero Tennis Academy in Alicante that he “learned a lot from Alcaraz and his lifestyle.”

They would have repeated the arrangement in the most recent off-season, but an injury to Cobolli got in the way. Still, Alcaraz has been impressed by what he's seen from his near-contemporary. “He has the level to be there, really,” Alcaraz said during a news conference Monday in Paris.

“I'm just really, really happy with everything he's doing lately. I'm pretty sure he's gonna keep building his path and (will) become a really good tennis player.”

Alcaraz, who said Cobolli has “really good hands, really good touch,” empathizes with one of Cobolli's weaknesses.

“What he was struggling (with) was about finding the right shots in the right moment. Probably he was a little bit inconsistent, like me sometimes,” he said with a smile.

Returning the compliment, Cobolli said: “He's a nice guy, always joking, but when practicing he's very focused.”

Six months before that training block, Cobolli drew Alcaraz in the first round of the 2023 French Open — his first main-draw match at a major.

“I said, ‘F—. Carlos on clay, first time main draw,'” Cobolli said of a match he ended up losing in straight sets, including a 25-minute bagel in the first. Cobolli said that “Carlos is a bit higher level” than anyone he'd faced, including Novak Djokovic.

It was at the 2024 Australian Open that Cobolli made his move, reaching the third round after entering as a qualifier. Sponsored by Lotto at the time, Cobolli formally joined On four months later.

The Swiss sportswear company's roster also includes four-time Roland Garros champion Iga Świątek, top-20 American Shelton and Fonseca, who is considered the sport's most exciting youngster. Joining has raised Cobolli's profile, and with a game based more on style than power — he's only 6 feet — his matches can catch fire. At last year's French Open, he played out a barn-burner against Holger Rune, as their late-night, second-round match on Court 14 turned into one of the matches of the tournament. Cobolli was ultimately edged out in a final set tie-break that he had led 5-0, before Rune hit a slap-shot backhand return that changed the complexion of the match's final minutes.

Cobolli has faced Alcaraz and Djokovic, the leading men on the ATP Tour, but not yet Sinner — a compatriot, a good friend and a fellow sporting polymath. Sinner's background as a high-level skier is well known, but had Cobolli's career headed in a different direction, he might be speaking as a footballer for Roma in Serie A.

He was a right-back in their academy for five years, but decided at 14 to pursue a career in tennis. His dad and coach, Stefano, was also a professional player, reaching a career-high ranking of No. 236.

Does Cobolli ever watch Roma and think he could be playing? “Of course — every match, I think it,” he said matter-of-factly.

“Every match, I think, ‘I can do better than him.'”

A number of his friends have gone on to play for the Roma first team, many of whom he plays padel with. Though born and raised in Florence, Roma is Cobolli's biggest passion. He goes to games whenever he can and follows the team obsessively while on tour, generally preferring watching football to tennis. When he won the French Open boys' doubles title as an 18-year-old in 2020, Cobolli celebrated by hoisting a Roma scarf into the sky. He hadn't planned it; it just felt right in the moment.

His infatuation extends to one of his many tattoos. He has the Italian phrase “sei tu l'unica mia sposa, sei tu l'unico mio amor,” which translates as “you are my only wife, you are my only love,” inked on his chest. It's a quote about Roma from club legend Daniele De Rossi, who wrote it on the captain's armband when he was managing the team between January and September 2024. Cobolli describes De Rossi as his “idol outside the court.”

Another of Cobolli's friends from his Roma days is Riccardo Calafiori, the swashbuckling defender who signed for Arsenal from Bologna last summer. “I texted him then just to say, ‘Congrats for your move.' He's a nice guy — just a normal guy,” Cobolli said.

“We played in the same team at Roma, and he was amazing with his feet. I'm a bit better with my hands.

“I did (always think he'd make it) — he's a special player. And he will be a great, great, great player for Arsenal.” He saw Calafiori's resilience up close in their youth, as his fellow Italian overcame a horrific knee injury to climb to football's highest level.

Another of their team-mates was Edoardo Bove, whom Cobolli met aged seven and now plays for Fiorentina. They became great friends playing together at the Roma academy, and Bove was also a gifted tennis player. In December 2024, Bove collapsed on the pitch during a match against Inter and suffered a cardiac arrest. Cobolli was watching the game and broke down in tears.

“I froze immediately,” Cobolli told the ATP Tour in December. “When I watched that moment, I called my mom, crying, and she told me, ‘Flavio, stop there, I'll come to you,' because it was tough for me.

In Paris, Cobolli said that Bove had surprised him by showing up at the Hamburg final. “He's good, he's happy, and I hope to see him on the pitch soon,” Cobolli said.

He still enjoys playing football tennis with some of his peers on the ATP Tour, including other talented footballers Alcaraz and Sebastian Korda, who he cites as one of the best in the locker room. Korda is close to footballing royalty, too — his girlfriend Ivana is the daughter of Pavel Nedvěd, the former Ballon d'Or winner.

Cobolli treasures these friendships from his Roma days, but ultimately chose tennis over football because, as well as his greater talent with a racket, he prefers the responsibility of an individual sport.

“I don't like to play with a team,” he said. “I like to play alone. I love to stay alone in my life. I don't like to lose because of someone else. I want to win because of me. In a team, it's different.”

Coco Gauff broke down in tears during a tense French Open moment at last year's tournament.

Attempting to advance to the 2024 women's finals, Gauff challenged a controversial call while playing No. 1 seed Iga Swiatek.

Swiatek took the first set, 6-2.

Knowing that she needed to rally in the second set, Gauff dug in and played more aggressive.

The No. 3 seed held a 2-1 lead in the second when play abruptly stopped.

"Coco Gauff is not happy," an announcer said. "Neither are the crowd."

Gauff challenged a call and confronted the chair ump on the court.

"They're booing because they know you are wrong," Gauff said. 

She added: "Are you serious?"

As the crowd booed in the background, Gauff began crying. 

The American star then backed away from the conversation with the umpire and kept crying, before drying her eyes.

"Wow terrible call," one fan tweeted. "Zero excuse when on video. So argumentative and often terrible calls. When is this going to stop?"

Gauff won the game to take a 3-1 lead in the second set and suddenly had the Roland Garros crowd in her corner.

While TV announcers discussed the "emotional aspect" of tennis and sports psychologists, Gauff was shown coldly staring straight ahead while sitting down.

But Swiatek battled back to move ahead 5-3 in the second set.

The Polish star finished it off to 6-4 to end Gauff's Roland Garros run.

Gauff quickly walked off the court after the loss.

"She is progressing a lot," Swiatek said. "I'm sure we're going to have plenty more matches at a high level."

Gauff became highly emotional in 2022 when she almost won the French Open as an 18-year-old.

Wowing Paris fans with her power and precision on the clay courts, Gauff ended up just two sets away from becoming a French Open champion.

"This is the first time for me, so let's try to get through this," an emotional Gauff said in the aftermath.

As she spoke, the young American was overwhelmed by the power of the moment.

With fans standing and applauding inside the venue, Gauff paid tribute to Swiatek and joked that she hoped to one day end as a winner when playing the game's No. 1.

"What you've done on tour the past couple months have truly been amazing and you totally deserve it," Gauff told Poland's superstar. "Hopefully we can play each other in more finals."

As Gauff referenced her supporters, tears began to flow.

Gauff turned her head and wiped her eyes while holding a microphone, then publicly praised all those who helped her reach the finals at 18.

She made amends in the women's doubles final alongside partner Katerina Siniaková, lifting her first Grand Slam tournament doubles trophy after defeating 11th seeds Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini.

Gauff grew up admiring Serena Williams and had a poster of the tennis legend on her wall.

After a tough start to 2025, the world No.2 began her French Open singles campaign on Tuesday against Australian Olivia Gadecki.

She was in scintillating form and reeled off a straightforward 6-2, 6-2 victory.

Emma Raducanu once made a surprise revelation when asked how she would spend her U.S. Open winnings. Raducanu shocked the sporting world in September 2021 by coming through qualifying to defeat Leylah Fernandez in the final as a teenager.

The then-18-year-old became the first British woman to win a Grand Slam since Virginia Wade in 1977. Moreover, Raducanu received the £1.8million ($2.5m) grand prize for her U.S. Open triumph. Many may have expected the teenager to splash out on big-money purchases, but she took a more low-key approach. When asked how she planned to spend her new fortune, replacing a pair of lost AirPods was Raducanu's top priority.

“There's a running joke in my team because before my first round qualifying match I lost my AirPods and I was basically running around the changing room like three minutes before my call to go on trying to find it but I lost it,” she told ESPN after her U.S. Open victory.

“I was thinking to myself, ‘You know what, if you win this match you can buy yourself a pair of AirPods' and that's become the running joke!”

Before her U.S. Open success, Raducanu's career earnings stood at just over £200k. However, she soon admitted to not trusting herself to manage her money and allowed her parents to take care of her seven-figure finances.

In an interview on BBC Breakfast days after her Grand Slam win, Raducanu explained: “I will just leave that to my parents and my team, to be honest. I'm just focusing on what I love to do, which is competing. They can take care of that.”

It was likely a wise move, as both her parents work in finance. Raducanu's focus on her tennis career, rather than her riches, was best illustrated by her admission to ITV's Good Morning Britain that she had not looked at her bank account to check if she had received her winnings. However, the British ace had an idea of how a portion of her prize money would be spent.

“Tennis is an extremely expensive sport,” Raducanu said. “From when I've travelled at a young age, there are a lot of expenses. So, it'll probably go towards that. I don't really think of the money side of it. I just love competing. I know that there are a lot of taxes and expenses.”

Raducanu, 22, has yet to secure another major titlle, but she defeated Xinyu Wang to progress in the French Open on Monday. She is scheduled to face defending champion Iga Swiatek in the second round tomorrow.

The British number two was recently asked about the possibility of hiring Andy Murray as a coach following his recent split from working with Novak Djokovic. The pair planned to team up in mixed doubles at Wimbledon last year, but Raducanu withdrew due to injury, denying Murray one last chance at Wimbledon glory.

“I hope he's forgiven me for last year, I still feel bad about it,” Raducanu admitted. “I'm looking forward to seeing him around and having a conversation.

“I think he would give great advice, he's been in a similar situation and would probably understand a lot of things that I'm also going through. But as to anything more, I don't know, that's very far out of thought.”

Nine's Wide World of Sports

French tennis boss Gilles Moretton defended the passionate local fans at Roland-Garros, comparing their parochial behaviour to the crowds seen at the Australian Open.

Crowd behaviour at Roland-Garros this year has come into focus after Iga Swiatek and David Goffin expressed displeasure over treatment from fans in 2024, with Goffin declaring the atmosphere "is becoming like football."

Moretton also defended French officials against complaints men's matches were being played in the prime-time spot at night in Paris ahead of the women's games which have been played in the morning.

Yet when it came to the fans and whether they're more boisterous than those seen at other tournaments, Moretton shut down the claim.

"You're talking about the French players playing? It was the same in Australia. I was in Australia," the French Tennis Federation chief said.

"We have some people, they love tennis, and they know tennis very well. They know when to stop. They are not doing anything. That's the way French people are. I'm sorry. They support their players.

"Maybe they make too much noise. We feel like that atmosphere is good for tennis. If it goes too far, we will have to say something. I hope it not bother too much the players. That's the way it is."

Australian Adam Walton, who plays German Maximillian Marterer in an opening round match on Tuesday night, agreed with Moretton, staying he copped it from the crowd when he played Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech last year.

He said it's normal for the home crowd to barrack for the local player and show a level of disdain for the opponent.

"When I played the Australian Open, it was all for me and then obviously here, it was all against me," he said.

Regarding men's matches taking precedence over women in the prime time night slot, Moretton said tournament boss and former world No.1 Amelie Mauresmo had a duty to schedule the match of the day at night.

The issue of scheduling comes up every year at every grand slam and it's no different at Roland-Garros this year, when Swiatek posted her 22nd straight win at Roland Garros in front of a half-empty crowd on Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday morning (local time).

"My position didn't change. I like playing days, so I'm happy that I'm done and I can have a longer rest," Swiatek said.

"But on the other hand, people just try to look for, like, not even things between men and women. You can find that in the schedule a little bit, and you can ask us all the time, but honestly, my answers are not going to change, so I don't mind."

In the opening days, world No.1 Aryna Sabalenka played in the day while former Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin played the midday match on the main court on Tuesday.

The men have held all the night slots so far, with American Ben Shelton and world No.1 Jannik Sinner playing the two prime time slots.

French veteran Gael Monfils has the night match on Tuesday (Wednesday morning AEST).

Aussie Jordan Thompson has revealed Nick Kyrgios is 'pretty down' after another knee injury forced him to withdraw from the French Open, while Naomi Osaka broke down in tears during her press conference after a first-round loss. Kyrgios surprised the tennis community having announced he was building his match fitness in order to play doubles at Roland Garros with Thompson.

Clay has never been Kygrios' favourite surface and in the past he has opted to skip a number of the major events to save his body for the grass court season. However, Kyrgios appeared keen to link-up with his fellow Aussie in just his fourth tournament of 2025.

Unfortunately, Thompson revealed Kyrgios injured himself while training in Australia. And in a sad revelation Thompson claimed Kyrgios was finding it harder and harder to return from each injury.

"Nick was really pumped to play here. He kept messaging me every week, 'you good to go to for doubs at Roland Garros'," Thompson said. "I know he was back home in Australia training on clay, but a few days ago, Nick told me that he's done something to his knee, so unfortunately, he just couldn't be here.

"He was pretty down. He told me he doesn't know how much more of these injuries he can take, and you've just got to feel for him. Because as much as he says things in the media, I think he loves playing tennis and he loves being on court, so it's disappointing that he can't be here on the court."

Thompson will now partner fellow Aussie Jason Kubler for a first-round match on Tuesday against French pair Quentin Halys and Albano Olivetti. After dealing with a number of wrist and knee injuries that ruled him out for around 18 months, Kyrgios made his comeback at the Australian Open where he went down in the first round.

Unfortunately, Kyrgios has only played four singles matches in 2025 having won his only match in Miami earlier this year. While he isn't able to compete in Paris it remains to be seen if he will make a push to play at Wimbledon. Last year, Kyrgios turned his attention to commentary having been ruled out for SW19.

Unfortunately for Osaka, she was left frustrated after Paula Badosa came from behind to clinch a three-set victory in their first round encounter. Osaka won the first set, but wasn't able to lift her game when Badosa rallied with the Spaniard prevailing 6-7 6-1 6-4 in an exciting clash.

However, Osaka was hard on herself after the loss and broke down in tears when talking about her trainer and the people she felt she had let down. “I hate disappointing people. Even with Patrick I was thinking just now that he goes from working with like the greatest player ever to like… what the f**k this is," she said fighting back tears.

Osaka entered the French Open as the World No.49, but received a brutal first round opponent in Badosa. Traditionally, she has never had much success on clay having reached the third round at the event three times, but never advancing beyond that.

While Osaka struggled in 2024 having not gone past the second round of any grand slam, she did one better at the Australian Open this year having reached the third. And she will be looking to do even better at Wimbledon with plenty of fans rallying around the tennis star after her latest setback.

seriously how can you not like her. i'm team naomi osaka until the day i die 🥺 https://t.co/3bgAyVpdd5

While Kyrgios won't be taking part in the tournament, he will feature as a commentator in Paris. Kyrgios hasn't competed at Roland Garros since 2017 having reached the second round. And while he won't get another chance to better that record in 2025, he will be on the sideline offering his analysis.

Kyrgios is increasingly turning his attention to media opportunities in recent years having made an appearance as a commentator at Wimbledon last year. The Aussie's guest appearances were met with plenty of praise. And after Thompson's latest comments about Krygios' setback, it appears a media career could be a future path for the 30-year-old.

Unfortunately for Thompson and the Aussie contingent it was not a great opening day on clay in Paris. Aleksandar Vukic, Chris O'Connell, Daria Saville, Kim Birrell and a battered Thompson all went down in the opening round.

But Alexei Popyrin managed to reach the second round of Roland Garros having broken his drought of first round exits. While Daria Kasatkina celebrated her first grand slam win playing under the Australian flag after making the switch.

ROLAND GARROS, PARIS — Everyone has them. Those places that always seem to bring pain.

Horner explains why Red Bull ‘rolled the dice' with Verstappen strategy in Monaco as he reflects on ‘jeopardy' of race

Gabriel Bortoleto found himself with a broken wing on the first lap of the race in Monaco after tangling with Kimi Antonelli's Mercedes. The Brazilian was left unimpressed with the sequence of events that put him into the barriers, even though he was able to get back to the pits and continue to race.

Bortoleto managed an impressive overtake around the outside of the hairpin, picking off Antonelli for P15. But he stayed there just one corner, taking a slightly wider line into Portier which allowed Antonelli to steal back the position before the duo reached the tunnel.

Bortoleto instead hit the barriers as Antonelli snuck past, losing time reversing back and then pitting for a new front wing. He eventually recaught the pack and raced home to finish 14th via three pit stops, but made his opinions on his fellow rookie Antonelli clear after the race:

“It's a shame what happened there on the first lap, I think I managed to make a very solid move in Turn 6 in the hairpin, so it was very nice around the outside and I gained a position.

"Obviously, he doesn't want to see any car ahead of him, losing a position in Monaco is quite embarrassing, it's bad because normally, historically you don't lose position but you don't gain as well.

“And I think he tried a very optimistic move there. We have seen a lot of crashes there in the past, it's not the first time. He didn't touch me, but he just went straight and to avoid crashing into him, I crashed into the wall and destroyed my front wing, needed to reverse, go back to the pits and unfortunately that's how my race ended up.”

Often, the drivers discuss contentious moves after the race, whether privately or in the following drivers' briefing at the next race. But Bortoleto has yet to decide whether to take things further with his fellow rookie.

“I don't know. For sure he didn't want to put me in the wall or anything. He ended up doing it in my opinion. At some point I will talk to him but I don't know, I need to think about it.

“I don't want to create any trouble, it's not like we are fighting for any title here or podium or any points in that moment, so I don't see why he would do that, would risk something like that. At the same time, we are racing so we need to race hard against each other but there is a limit.”

Hulkenberg had a frustrating race stuck in traffic in Monaco

Kick Sauber were not able to make much progress with either car in Monaco, Nico Hulkenberg finishing two places behind his team mate as he got caught up in the train of cars playing the team game – led by Racing Bulls and Williams.

But the German was clear that while it was a frustrating situation, it was one of his and the team's own making – by just not being quick enough on Saturday.

HIGHLIGHTS: Relive Norris' first Monaco Grand Prix victory after holding off Leclerc in closing stages

“I guess already where we started [in P13], having two or three teams in front playing the strategic game for each other, it's been a bit painful. Not much you can do, you are just a passenger, going slow. Impossible to overtake, and yeah I'm not the only one – many guys were the victim of that.

“Just put it to lack of performance, you need to help yourself, push your own luck. If you start ahead, you avoid all this trouble. We have work to do, we are getting an upgrade next weekend for Barcelona which I am excited about, and I hope this will give us a step forward and after today I'm happy to get going again next week and get this one out of my system.”

Williams have confirmed that Victor Martins will participate in an F1 race weekend for the first time at the upcoming Spanish Grand Prix by getting behind the wheel of the FW47 during Free Practice 1.

Martins – who joined the Williams Driver Academy in March – is currently competing in his third Formula 2 season, during which he has so far scored a podium for ART Grand Prix in the Saudi Arabia Feature Race as well as taking pole position in Melbourne.

The Frenchman previously won a closely-fought title fight in the 2022 Formula 3 campaign, beating drivers including Isack Hadjar and Ollie Bearman to take the crown at the Monza season finale.

Following his progression to F2, Martins helped the ART Grand Prix to secure their first F2 Teams' title in 2023 and went on to claim five podiums in 2024, which included a victory in Barcelona.

Martins is currently competing in his third Formula 2 season with ART Grand Prix

In preparation for his FP1 debut, Martins took part in the TPC (Testing of Previous Cars) programme in Monza earlier this year where he drove the FW45 alongside fellow Williams Racing Academy driver Luke Browning.

“I'm super happy to be taking the wheel of the FW47 for the first time in Barcelona!” said Martins. “It will be an incredible experience to drive for the team. I'm working hard to prepare as much as possible to maximise my time in the car and make it a valuable session for myself and the team.

Sven Smeets, Sporting Director at Williams, added: “We're proud that Victor will be taking part in his first Formula 1 session with Atlassian Williams Racing in Barcelona. He continues to demonstrate that he is a talented driver, and this session is an important step forward in his career as part of the Academy.

“His participation in our TPC programme and simulator work in Grove have prepared him well and we look forward to seeing him in the garage this weekend.”

Christian Horner has admitted that Red Bull “rolled the dice” with an offset strategy for Max Verstappen during the Monaco Grand Prix, with the team extending the Dutchman's final stint before making a compulsory second stop on the penultimate lap amid the “jeopardy” posed by the new regulation.

After lining up in fourth place on the grid – having been promoted one spot owing to Lewis Hamilton's three-place penalty – Verstappen ran a long opening stint on the hard tyre before bolting on the medium compound.

And while others were making a second visit to the pits – as part of a regulation change that required every driver to make two pit stops during the race in Monte Carlo – the World Champion remained out on track for as long as possible, meaning that he led the race for much of the latter stages before finally heading to the pits on the penultimate lap of the event.

This saw Verstappen cross the line in fourth – with McLaren's Lando Norris taking victory ahead of Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and the other papaya car of Oscar Piastri – and Horner believes that the plan was the best call should there have been any incidents during the closing stages of the Grand Prix.

Verstappen took fourth place in Monaco, having spent much of the latter stages of the race in the lead owing to his offset strategy

“We rolled the dice a little bit today,” Horner explained after the race. “Starting on the hard [tyre] our tactic was always to go long, with the main opportunity being Safety Cars or red flags, which can sometimes be the case here.

“Max led large portions of the race, but it was one of those Monacos where everybody pretty much behaved. So, yeah, the first stop, we got pretty close to Oscar at one point. He had a wobble on his second lap out after his pit stop but we would have been at best alongside, so we decided, look, we'll keep going, let's keep going.

MONDAY MORNING DEBRIEF: How Red Bull rolled the dice to give Verstappen the chance of an against-the-odds victory in Monaco

“The upside was, if there'd have been a Safety Car or red flag, Max would have led. Then, again, we had the medium tyre [for the second stint], went very, very long, obviously stopped on the last lap, and again, you're just hanging out for a Safety Car or VSC [Virtual Safety Car] or red flag at that point.”

Reflecting on the strategy of Verstappen's team mate Yuki Tsunoda – who started from P12 on the grid and ended the race down in P17 – Horner added: “For Yuki, we did the inverse – Lap 1 initially looked like he would get a significant benefit from it, but then everybody started to drive extremely slowly as they started to play around with the tactics.

It was a difficult race in Monte Carlo for Verstappen's team mate Tsunoda

“So he was basically on the same set of tyres for the whole race and did his fastest laps at the end there when he finally got some clear traffic. He was just sat in a queue the entire race, so a very difficult day today.”

In terms of how much the two pit stop rule affected the action of the race, Horner commented: “It was strategically more interesting [than last year]. There was more jeopardy to it.”

And when pushed on how much more of a challenge the squad had faced in trying to plan for their strategy beforehand, the Team Principal continued: “It was very dynamic.

“You're looking at all the different scenarios and it's starting to play out in front of you, what the others are doing with Williams and obviously Racing Bulls, and the teams that worked as a pair that had cars close together benefitted today, most of them.

“Usually you make the one stop and then you've just got your fingers crossed for reliability to the end of the race, [but] here there was a bit more going on.”

Race Highlights: 2025 Monaco Grand Prix

Now the attentions of the paddock switch to the Spanish Grand Prix – marking the final stop of a triple header sequence – and Horner is hopeful that Red Bull can repeat the success they experienced in Imola, where Verstappen scored his second victory of the season.

“Let's see,” Horner answered when asked how confident he was feeling about the team's prospects in Barcelona. “We always knew coming here [to Monaco] would expose some of our car's…. it was never going to be our strongest circuit.

“So going back to Barcelona, I hope we can replicate closer to what we did in Imola. We only gave away three points to the championship leader today, so we're still within a race win with, what,16 races still to go.

“There's an enormous amount of racing [left], plus the Sprint races, etc, etc, so there's a long, long way to go in this championship.”

[Editor's note: The following review contains spoilers for “The Handmaid's Tale” finale — Season 6, Episode 10, “The Handmaid's Tale.”]

If the “Handmaid's Tale” series finale is going to include a series-defining monologue, then Cherry Jones may as well be the one to deliver it. Having just heard her daughter, June (Elisabeth Moss), is planning to go back out into the field and continue fighting Gilead, Holly (Jones) is upset. She's been worrying about June for years now, suffering through long stretches when she doesn't know where she is, who she's with, or if she's even still alive. More recently, the opposite anxiety besets Holly. She has to watch as June is captured and strung up to be hanged, all while caring for June's youngest daughter (also named Holly).

It ends happily enough — June once again survives, and her rescue even sets off a string of events that frees Boston from Gilead's grip — but one ending is just another beginning. Holly takes a bus from Alaska to Boston to reunite with her family, and almost as soon as she gets there, June is planning to take off again. Hannah, her first child, is being moved to Washington D.C. Thousands of other boys and girls are still being brainwashed by Gilead. June has to help. She has to go back. “Mommies always come back.”

Holly understands, but understanding doesn't make what she has to say any easier. She has to encourage her daughter to keep fighting, and in doing so, she has to explain to the audience why they've spent six seasons and eight years with this story, even if it doesn't end with a beaten, broken Gilead — even if it doesn't really end at all.

“June, you should write a book,” Holly says. “About never giving up. This isn't a story for people who haven't lost anyone, they don't need this story. This is the story for people who may never find their babies. The people who will never, ever give up trying. This is the story for them. … Write it for your daughters, June. Tell them who their mother was.”

There's plenty to admire about creator (and finale writer) Bruce Miller's chosen approach to ending “The Handmaid's Tale.” Keeping June on the front lines, fighting a battle without an obvious end, befits both the character (who's come to know war as a way of life) and the audience (who witness a new constitutional crisis every week and may need the encouragement to fight back). The finale also provides a framework that honors Margaret Atwood's groundbreaking novel and gives June ample time to stroll through Boston, remembering what was and what could've been.

 










I'll leave it to others to decide which tear-jerking scene feels the most forced — Emily (Alexis Bledel) suddenly showing up in Boston, or all the handmaids singing karaoke in June's fantasy version of a life without Gilead — and whether the plentiful (if poorly choreographed) violence in the previous episode provided adequate contrast to the finale's pensive tranquility. (So much walking, so much thinking, so little stabbing.) 

But despite Jones' elegant delivery of a speech that screams, “This is what the show is about!,” isn't it a bit strange that June's already writing a book about a story that isn't over? Not only did the most climactic moments happen in the penultimate episode (when Commanders Lawrence and Wharton are killed, along with Nick), but most of the surviving character arcs are left naggingly open-ended.

I almost laughed when June tells Serena (Yvonne Strahovski), “I forgive you,” a sentiment as on-the-nose as it is unnecessary (and not helped by Moss' direction, which overemphasizes the line by zooming in on June as she delivers it). “The Handmaid's Tale” has bent over backward to get June and Serena to this point, where they're no longer enemies but something akin to sisters on opposite sides of the patriarchy's oppression. But considering Serena still laments being banished from Gilead in the same conversation where June forgives her for years of tyrannical abuse, it's hard to accept their tidy little resolution. (Serena's last scene, where she embraces motherhood despite being stripped of past privileges, adds little to her arc either.)

 










Luke (O-T Fagbenle) gets even less, which would be fine if his kicker did more than kick the can down the road. Luke's closing conversation with June is not-quite-a-break-up, not-quite-a-reunion, but it does make clear that he's as all-in on the fight as she is, while propping up the show's happy ending. “It wasn't all horrors, right?,” he says. “You had people who helped you. … People who loved you. People you loved. They're all worth remembering.”

Sure, right, let's remember the good times amid all the rape, torture, and tyrannical misogyny. I mean, some things worked out: Look at Aunt Lydia (Ann Dowd)! She was about to be executed one episode prior, and now she's back with Gilead? Orchestrating hostage drop-offs? Giving Janine (Madeline Brewer) back to the Americans, along with her daughter is a kindness, to be sure — but how does Lydia wield enough influence to make sure her handmaids don't have to “walk in stride with the wicked” anymore? 

So many indefinite endings almost make it seem like this isn't the end of “The Handmaid's Tale.” (Even the episode's biggest victory — taking back Boston — is quickly undercut by June rattling off all the cities and states still waiting to be wrested from Gilead.) Instead, Episode 10 just feels like a stopping point before our story picks back up under a new name. Oh, that's right — it will! “The Testaments” is coming! Hulu is turning Atwood's 2019 sequel to her 1985 original novel into a series of its own (sort of), with Bruce Miller showrunning and at least Aunt Lydia set to return. 

 










Miller has been open about what he could and could not do in “The Handmaid's Tale” in order to preserve the story of “The Testaments.” Obviously, Aunt Lydia was on the no-kill list, but so were June's kids, Hannah and Holly, which created a considerable speed-bump. Constructing the final season (or at least the last few episodes) around June saving Hannah would have made for a much more logical and consequential conclusion, but even without that card in the deck, the final hand didn't have to leave out so many others. That it did only mutes the emotional impact (which Miller and Moss try to make up for with all those walks down memory lane), while denying the audience enough closure to say goodbye. After all, if the audience is comfortable leaving “The Handmaid's Tale” behind, who's going to tune in for “The Testaments”?

“The Handmaid's Tale” has always been a story of mothers and daughters. The last shot emphasizes as much, while stressing the transformative journey of our central heroine. June sits in the same window perch as she is in the first shot, this time wearing her own clothes and speaking into a recorder for the book Holly demands she write for her children. She remembers her time as a Handmaid with the Waterfords. She sees the ruined state of the Waterford house now. “My name is Offred,” she says. And she smiles.

 










At least with this ending, one thing is clear: We know who June is, and so does she. Even if her story continues (they're already talking about her return for “The Testaments”), June's time as Offred is over. Whether your time with June is, too, well… you'll have to choose your own ending. 

“The Handmaid's Tale” is available on Hulu. “The Testaments” is expected in 2026.

The final action set piece of the Tom Cruise-led “Mission: Impossible” series wasn't just going to wrap up the film, it was also earmarked as the franchise's biggest, most dangerous, and technically challenging stunt. 

As the clock ticks down on the “Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning” A.I. villain (known as The Entity) launching a nuclear holocaust, Ethan Hunt (Cruise) must get the kill switch from around the neck of Gabriel (Esai Morales), who has escaped on a classic Stearman biplane. It's a sequence that Cruise, writer/director Christopher McQuarrie, stunt coordinator Wade Eastwood, and their team spent four-and-a-half months in South Africa working on.

While on this week's episode of IndieWire's Filmmaker Toolkit podcast, McQuarrie talked about how even before then, he had worked with animators to design the entire sequence in pre-viz. But it wasn't until the testing and R&D phase started on the ground in South Africa that the team could figure out what was actually possible while working with the nearly a hundred-year-old plane. 

McQuarrie offered one example of how what he assumed was a simple bit of action had to be reinvented. “There's a sequence when Tom is on the wheel of the plane and climbs up onto the wing and punches the pilot in order to take over the plane,” said McQuarrie. “In the pre-viz, that lasted a few seconds, it was very quick. That's because the people doing the animation — working out the sequence and coming up with these gags, and  I'm one of the people working with them — they didn't understand the sheer physics of what it was to be on the wing of a plane.”

After the first time Cruise attempted the punch during a test flight, he came back down to the ground to explain to McQuarrie he couldn't execute it at the speed at which it was designed. “[Tom] said, ‘You can't do anything quickly on the wing of that plane. I'm getting hit with wind at 140 miles an hour.' Just raising his hand took time; everything was an enormous physical effort,” said McQuarrie. “And finally, at the end of the conversation, he said, ‘You know what? I think the best thing for you to do is just get on the wing and see what it's like.'”

Cruise gave the director a tutorial, with McQuarrie in harness with two safety lines connected to a strut outside the cockpit.

 










“You have to climb out of the cockpit, keeping in mind that the minute you come out from behind the canopy, you're in another world; it's like going to a different planet,” said McQuarrie of walking onto the plane's wing. “You can't really breathe. There's air, but the molecules are hitting you so quickly, and there's such intense turbulence on the planes, you're not getting as much oxygen as you normally would. And imagine everything that you're doing, you have to push yourself forward just to stand still. You're having to rethink your entire physical being.”

Once back in his plane seat, McQuarrie said the 30 seconds on the wing felt like five minutes, and he'd just finished a 30-minute workout at the gym. “I had a really acute understanding of what it was Tom was going through when he was out there on the wing, and it affected the way that I directed him,” he said.

McQuarrie said the key to the redesign was to create a subjective experience where the audience feels the wind and physical exertion required for Cruise to simply lift his hand. The writer/director explained that the challenge most action directors face is having to mask that it is a stunt performer, not the principal actor, but with Cruise, he's learned to embrace a different set of challenges and opportunities.

 










“Making a ‘Mission: Impossible' movie is completely opposite, the challenge is showing that it's always the actor [because] you have this resource, you have Tom Cruise, and he is willing to get on the wing of the plane and do all of that action,” said McQuarrie. “The burden falls to me now to figure out: How can I put the camera there to show you that it's him and to be close enough to him to be feeling his performance, but also all the time remaining wide enough that you're never losing scale, you're never losing geography. That's the challenge of making a Tom Cruise movie.”

The climatic plane sequence would have to be redesigned a number of times as McQuarrie and team learned and adapted to different limitations, including the dramatic effect of subtle fluctuations in weather. If the temperature dropped just a few degrees on the ground, it would be significantly colder on the wing at altitude, and they had to avoid Cruise suffering hypothermia. The weather was also a major factor in dealing with the limitations of the antique planes, especially when flying ultra low, Cruise practically scraping against the landscape as he performed his stunts.

“The challenge on this movie is that the margins were so, so narrow, [and] these are not terribly fast aircraft. In the case of when Tom is on the wing of the plane flying in that canyon, he's only about five feet off the water; the plane is at max power. If there was any sort of downdraft, there was no way for the pilot to increase the power and pull out,” said McQuarrie. “So you had to be very, very, very careful about the weather conditions when you flew, because of the temperature would create thermals, which would create downdrafts, which meant you either couldn't fly that low, or if you were flying that low and hit a downdraft, it was game over.”

 










Eastwood called the airplane sequence in “The Final Reckoning” the most dangerous and nerve-wracking in his legendary stunt coordinator-star collaborations with Cruise. For his part, McQuarrie said that just by the very nature of his and Cruise's goal of constantly outdoing what they had done before, each new “Mission: Impossible” movie was the most challenging and dangerous.

“Do I get nervous? After. You cannot allow yourself to feel stress. You can't allow yourself to feel anxiety. All of those things represent distractions that are going to lead to an error,” said McQuarrie. “Everything that we do is to approach it in a gradient. We start with baby steps, and we get more and more and more competent at what we're doing. There is no daredevil, no cowboy attitude in any of these sequences. It's extremely rigid, it's drilled almost militarily.”

Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani made appearances during the American Music Awards telecast — but fans who witnessed the show live say they didn't get to see the music couple perform. In several TikToks posted on Monday, fans wrote that they felt “lied to” after being shown pre-recorded videos of the couple's performances onscreen during the event.


	During the telecast, Blake Shelton took the stage first to perform “Stay Country or Die Tryin,” and later “returned” to introduce his wife, Gwen Stefani. She performed a medley of her hits “The Sweet Escape” and “Hollaback Girl” along with a recent single, “Swallow My Tears.”

LIKE WHATTT… why would they say performing live when they aren't even here?? 😭 #gwenstefani #ama #livetv #dissapointme #taylorswift 


	One fan shared a video of her view from the seats at the Fontainebleau that showed Stefani's performance onstage before panning to her to say, “She's not here.” Over the video, the fan wrote, “We've been lied to,” adding in the caption: “Why would they say performing live when they aren't even here??”

	











	Another fan shared a video of Shelton's performance being displayed onscreen while a different band, seemingly for Lainey Wilson, set up onstage. “When Blake Shelton is ‘performing' at the AMA Awards but there is no Shelton in sight,” the attendee wrote.


	Although some fans might have been hoping to see all of the night's performers live, it's not uncommon for televised awards shows to feature pre-taped segments or performances.


	Reps for Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone‘s request for comment. A rep for the AMAs declined to comment.

@Gwen Stefani performance was pre recorded as well 😩🫠 #amaawards #blakeshelton #gwenstefani #jlo 


	Getty Images photos for the performances did not list the date for when they were recorded, but instead captioned the photos as “image released on May 26, 2025.”

	Stefani may not have been there in person for the show, but she seemed to be live-tweeting during several of the performances. “Ummm?!! @bensonboone that was incredible!” she wrote during the show. “We love u @GloriaEstefan, one of the sweetest humans I've had the honor to meet,” she said during Estefan's performance.


	Many of the award winners appeared via pre-recorded videos during the performance, including Billie Eilish, who won seven awards, including Artist of the Year, Album of the Year, and Song of the Year. Of the Artist of the Year nominees, only SZA was present at the awards show.

	Over the past few years, an array of musicians, historians, researchers, and critics have helped upend the history of country music. They've brought overdue attention to the myriad, yet long-ignored contributions of Black musicians to country's origins, stressing the way record company owners overlooked Black artists for recording sessions, or slapped bogus genre terms on the songs they did record (“race records”) to differentiate them from the similar tunes recorded by white artists. 


	With all this knowledge far more well-known now than it ever has been, it was not surprising to see Shaboozey react skeptically to a piece of presenter copy at last night's American Music Awards regurgitating the old myths that country music was originally by and for white people. 


	At the AMAs, Shaboozey was on-hand to present the award for Favorite Country Duo or Group with Megan Moroney. Their presenter copy found them name-checking the winners of the major country categories at the inaugural AMAs in 1974. That year, Charley Pride won Favorite Country Male Artist, Lynn Anderson won Favorite Country Female Artist, and Favorite Country Duo or Group went to the Carter Family. Moroney's presenter copy had her say that the Carter Family “basically invented country music.” 

	











	This garnered a not-at-all subtle side-eye glance and a curt laugh from Shaboozey before he continued with the names of this year's nominees. On Tuesday morning, Shaboozey addressed the matter further in a pair of posts on Twitter.


	“When you uncover the true history of country music, you find a story so powerful that it cannot be erased,” he said, adding: “The real history of country music is about people coming together despite their differences, and embracing and celebrating the things that make us alike.”


	Reps for Shaboozey and Moroney did not immediately return requests for comment. A rep for the American Music Awards declined to comment.

	While the Carter Family are indeed country pioneers, they are also a perfect case study in the way country history has been whitewashed. Much of the Carter Family's catalog was made up of songs that patriarch A.P. Carter collected while traveling around Appalachia. Often joining Carter on these song scouting trips was a Black guitarist named Lesley Riddle, who not only helped Carter write down and memorize the songs, but introduced him to Black musical traditions (like church music and the blues) that further influenced what became known as country music. Riddle also taught A.P.'s bandmate and sister-in-law, Maybelle Carter, his style of guitar finger-picking, which further influenced her famous “scratch” style of playing. 

	











	While the Carter Family have long been considered country music royalty, it was only in the Sixties that Riddle began to get his due, and in recent years that his story has become more widely known. Riddle is just one of many Black artists to play a pivotal role in country's history, with Shaboozey also encouraging fans to seek out other key figures like Steve Tarter, Harry Gay, and DeFord Bailey. 


	Others also expressed frustration with the AMAs presenter copy, including the musician Rissi Palmer, who wrote on Instagram, “Tell me you know nothing about the actual roots of Country music without telling me you don't know the roots… like, who wrote this script? What in the Project 2025 hell is this? … Behind every founding father and mother of Country music stands a Black musician playing Black roots music, strategically hidden in the mix.”


	Dom Flemons, the revered musician and historian, commented on Palmer's post, encouraging people to seek out a video he made with the organization Black in Appalachia all about Riddle's contributions to the Carter Family and country history. 


	“The Carter [Family] and [record producer] Ralph Peer deserve the credit for their work to establish country music as a genre,” Flemons wrote. “Lesley Riddle was never an established artist which is why he fell to the wayside in the early years… It took many years for his story to come out into the public.”

The two films delivered the biggest Memorial Day picnic in history at the box office, while 'Lilo' supplanted Tom Cruise's 'Top Gun: Maverick' as the holiday's top opener of all time, among numerous other feats.

	Stichin: Mission!


	Disney's live-action redo of Lilo & Stitch and Tom Cruise's final Mission: Impossible movie, from Paramount and Skydance, fueled the biggest Memorial Day weekend of all time as attendance skyrocketed across all demos.




Lilo & Stitch blew away all expectations with a record-smashing, four-day domestic debut of $92.7 million, and a jaw-dropping $361.3 million globally, while Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning opened to a series-best $79 million domestically and nearly $200 million worldwide, according to final weekend actuals (M:I's tally was up from Sunday's estimate of $77.5 million). The numbers include a three-day weekend gross of $145.5 million for Lilo and $64 million for Final Reckoning. On Memorial Day itself, Lilo earned a near-record $37 million.

	The previous best Memorial Day in terms of overall revenue belonged to the $306 million in ticket sales collected in 2013 when Fast & Furious 6 zoomed to $117 million, followed by The Hangover Part III with $50 million. This year also marked the best showing for two Memorial Day titles going up against each other.  In 2007, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End opened to $140 million over the holiday frame, followed by Shrek the Third with $67 million.


	While the mashup isn't quite the same cultural phenomenon that Barbenheimer was in July 2023, the potent combo of the two movies can't be ignored in terms of conquering and dividing.


	The female-fueled Lilo was always expected to beat the latest male-driven M:I title, but no one imagined it would hit these heights and, in an ironic twist, see Lilo & Stitch supplant Cruise's Top Gun: Maverick ($160 million) to rank as the biggest Memorial Day opener of all time, not adjusted for inflation. That's not the only irony: Cruise-starrer Minority Report barely beat the original animated Lilo & Stitch when they opened opposite each other in June 2002. In North America, Lilo also zoomed to the second-biggest gross of all time for any four-day holiday weekend behind the $242 million opening of Marvel and Disney's Black Panther ($242 million) and the third biggest debut ever for a Disney live-action title, both domestically and globally, behind Beauty and the Beast and crown-holder The Lion King, not adjusted for inflation. The film also saw Disney become the first studio of the year to cross $2 billion in worldwide ticket sales

	











	Three weeks ago, Lilo & Stitch was tracking to open to $120 million. On Thursday, that number had grown to $165 million. Then it came in even higher. The reason? Thank members of the Gen Z generation and younger Millenials.


Stitch isn't just drawing interest from families; to the contrary, 60 percent of ticket buyers were non-parents and kids, far higher than the norm. Interest exploded among teenage girls and younger women adults who grew up on the first movie and resulting TV show about a Hawaiian girl with a fraught family life who adopts an adorable, albeit trouble-making, dog-like alien. Box office pundits say the nostalgic factor ran red-hot, just as it did among millennials and Gen Z'ers for Disney's live-action Aladdin, which made $1.1 billion in global ticket sales after getting non-families. Rideback produced both Lilo and 2019's Aladdin.


	It is also playing to a notably diverse audience. Latinos, the most frequent moviegoers in the U.S., made up 33 percent of ticket buyers, while the film scored the biggest opening ever for a live-action Disney reimagining across Latin America.


	Both films benefited from strong scores from critics and glowing audience exits, including five-out-of-five stars from moviegoers polled by industry-leading service PostTrak. Lilo has a Rotten Tomatoes critics score of 70 percent and nabbed an A CinemaScore from audiences.


Final Reckoning — which had a lock on Imax screens — more than made up for the lackluster $54.7 million five-day bow of Dead Reckoning, as well as supplanting the $61.2 million three-day launch of Fallout to set a new franchise opening record. M:I movies have never been big openers since diehard fans are usually older adults, and particularly older males. Ticket buyers over the age of 55 made up the largest chunk of the audience (or a whopping 58 percent), followed by the coveted 18 to 24 demo, according to PostTrak. Cruise's film, directed by his go-to partner Christopher McQuarrie, boasts a current Rotten Tomatoes score of 80 percent and earned an A- CinemaScore.

	











	“Mission accomplished,” says Paramount domestic chief of distribution Chris Aronson. “This is a remarkable result for the eighth title in a franchise that's 30 years in the making.”


	A major challenge in terms of Final Reckoning‘s financial success is its $400 million net budget before marketing — making it one of the most expensive films ever made — although Paramount insiders note that each new installment increases the value of the entire library, including a spike in home entertainment sales and rentals of previous titles. Lilo & Stitch cost a modest net $100 million to make.


	Overseas, Lilo & Stitch likewise went up against Final Reckoning nearly everywhere, although the M:I movie began rolling out in a handful of major markets last weekend via previews.

“Elio” (opening theatrically June 20), Pixar‘s first intergalactic buddy comedy, takes an animated leap into space with imaginative design and visual splendor, utilizing a mixture of old and new techniques. The footage screened at Pixar was funny and, in one tender scene, very moving.

It's about 11-year-old orphan Elio (Yonas Kibreab), who's obsessed with getting abducted by aliens and finally gets his wish when he's mistaken for Earth's leader. Elio beams up to the candy-colored interplanetary space station of peace and security called the Communiverse, where he bonds with worm-like alien Glordon (Remy Edgerly), who's just as lost and friendless. That is, until Elio's found out and sent back home to the Air Force base where he lives with his stressed-out aunt Olga (Oscar winner Zoe Saldaña).

“Elio” is very much a post-COVID film about loneliness and the search for belonging that afflicts many children. Still grieving the loss of his parents, Elio has trouble fitting in socially with the other kids on the Air Force base, while his aunt has difficulty coping with her new role as an adoptive parent. The film was the brainchild of Adrian Molina (co-director of “Coco”), who conceived it as a personal coming-of-age story about youthful alienation. He grew up on a military base and didn't find “his people” until studying animation at CalArts.

But Molina's first solo opportunity ran into some speed bumps, and he was taken off “Elio” by chief creative officer Pete Docter and reassigned to “Coco 2” as co-director with director Lee Unkrich. Madeline Sharafian (the “Burrow” short) and Domee Shi (“Turning Red”) jumped aboard as the new directors. Sharafian, who contributed storyboards to “Elio,” previously served in that capacity on both “Coco” and “Turning Red.”

“We were really trying to infuse that feeling of loneliness into ‘Elio' and his wanting to belong somewhere, his deep desire to connect but not really knowing how,” Sharafian told IndieWire. “I think a lot of young people just want to make friends, they want to find their people. But they think if I'm in the perfect place where everyone thinks like me, acts like me, then I can belong. That will be the solution to all my problems.”

“But really that solution comes from within,” Shi told IndieWire. “It's about making that first step — reaching out to someone. It's more than that typical ‘I want to go into space and explore.' It's much deeper.”

 










Here's what we learned about “Elio”:

For his last Pixar film before retiring, veteran production designer Harley Jessup (“Coco,” “Ratatouille,” “Monsters, Inc.”) devised an experimental process to find the look of Communiverse in collaboration with visual effects supervisor Claudia Chung Sanii (“Zootopia,” “Brave”). He called it the “College Project” in the spirit of exploration. They utilized VR and macro photography in water tanks similar to his early work on ILM's “Inner Space.” One test shot was actually recorded sideways in a drinking glass at a Pixar party. Another took oil and water in a glass bowl set on top of a sheet of sequins and glitter.

“I   was able to bring some of that back into research on tiny, microscopic plants and animals,” Jessup told IndieWire. “And how alien they look is still part of the natural world that the audience would recognize and feel believable.  And everybody just picked up on that and ran with those ideas. Tests from every corner that were just astounding: oceanic characters that are outside of the ocean that are in our space, swimming through the atmosphere rather than water because their gravity is different.”

The goal was to create a unique, dazzling version of space that hasn't been seen on film before, made of  luminescent and translucent materials with gravity that is very fluid to accommodate the different species. The result was a space station housing 16 member planets that live in four different ecosystems that are represented on a series of rotating discs. There's a volcanic hot disc, an icy cold disc, an aquatic disc, and a verdant blush disc. 

 










The rotating discs are often shown backlit like colorful stained glass.  The embassies are situated on the disc that most closely matches the climate of the delegation's home planet. The basic construction of the four parabolic discs starts with topographic layering similar to 3D computer-generated relief maps. This precise sculptural quality adds a sense of technology to all the universe sets.

On “Elio,” Pixar brought lighting and camera together at the same time, thanks to a new interactive lighting toolset called Luna. This enabled them to crack the aesthetic much earlier to guide our eyes and tell the story.

 ”When we first started seeing artwork from Harley and his team, we really sought out to build this space we've never seen before, and, to me, the only way to do that was to bring everybody on the crew together into one room,” Chung Sanii told IndieWire. “And we quickly realized lighting happens last in CG, which is strange because, in live action, lighting and camera happen at the same time.

“So Pixar was developing Luna, which bring lighting to all interactive workflows,” she continued. “We got that pre-alpha of a look at that, and that's when we discovered this universe could really work: all the luminance and the translucency that Harley was putting in there. Although the tool wasn't ready for prime time, I think future movies are using it even more. It forced us to have our lighting DP, Jordan Rempel, start at the same time as Derek Williams, our layout DP. So they were always designing and planning and working on shots together. It made such a huge difference to be able to have that time to create with the lighting team and the layout team to see the potential, and we would change things on the set to plus what they had roughed out.”

 










The worm-like Glordon from the volcanic planet was one of Pixar's favorite aliens. Like Elio, he's lonely and doesn't fit in with his culture, where he's expected to don military armor and become a fierce warrior, like his father, Lord Grigon (Brad Garrett).  Gordon's design was influenced by Pixar's studies of larval insects and microbiotic creatures such as the tardigrade. Finding the right balance of disturbing and adorable was a big challenge. Another was finding expression in a creature without eyes.

“ I think part of what was special for me comes out in the first moments that you meet [Glordon],” animation supervisor Jude Brownbill told IndieWire. “He's sort of mysterious, creepy, off-putting, a work with a bunch of teeth.” But then one of the creepiest-looking characters becomes the one who puts the biggest smile on our face. “ Elio and Glordon develop into this really charming, heartfelt, empathetic friendship,” he added

Then there's OOOOO (Shirley Henderson), the liquid, shapeshifting supercomputer. Because of the dynamic effects involved, she marked an unprecedented technical and artistic challenge. Indeed, OOOOO is described as a Swiss Army knife made of droplets moving in space with moving circuitry inside her. The fluidity and charm came as a result of 2D testing. 

 










“She's so flexible as a character,” animation supervisor Travis Hathaway told IndieWire. “ She can become a screen, she can become a vinyl player, she can become a projector, she can manifest as a pen for Elio to write with. We leveraged some facial rigging and animation techniques that we learned on ‘Win or Lose.' You can use different forms and have them come together at render time.”

Directors Sharafian and Shi wanted to deepen Elio's motivation for wanting to be abducted by aliens. This meant raising the emotional stakes for his loneliness and making him more empathetic. A part of this was turning him into an orphan, shifting Olga from mother to aunt.

“ Knowing that Elio was going to have to decide where he wanted to be, it felt like a relationship with a mother and son was a bit too much,” Sharafian said. “Maybe they have an argument and they storm off, but, at the end of the day, you still kind of believe in your heart as an audience member that they're gonna come back together. But an aunt and a nephew [relationship] is a lot more tenuous.  There's a chance that they'd split off and lose that connection forever. And that tension for the audience watching these two characters who are missing connections, you're really rooting for them, that added a lot of juice.”

 










“ And I feel like I identified more with Olga as an aunt,” added Shi, “who suddenly has to like be saddled with this huge responsibility, and she's trying her best, but she wasn't prepared for it. And she's trying to navigate it day by day. It just felt really compelling. And she's lost too.”

Wallen earns his fourth Hot 100 No. 1, and McRae her first.


													By
												

	Gary Trust



Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae, blasts in at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.


	The collaboration between the country and pop stars – from Wallen's new album, I'm the Problem, which soars in at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with 2025's biggest week by equivalent album units – is Wallen's fourth Hot 100 leader and McRae's first. She surpasses her prior No. 3 best set by “Greedy” in January 2024. In March, McRae notched her first Billboard 200 No. 1 with So Close to What; she's the first artist this year to lead both lists for the first time.


	Wallen previously topped the Hot 100 with “Love Somebody,” also on I'm the Problem, for a week upon its debut in November; as featured on Post Malone's “I Had Some Help,” which bowed at No. 1 in May 2024 and led for six weeks; and with “Last Night,” for 16 weeks beginning in March 2023, before wrapping as the chart's top hit that year.


	Wallen boasts six songs in all in the latest Hot 100's top 10, with “I Got Better” also debuting, at No. 7, and “Superman” flying 16-8 in its second week on the chart. He has now charted nine top 10s from I'm the Problem; only Taylor Swift's The Tortured Poets Department and Midnights (10 top 10s each) have yielded more, with Drake's Certified Lover Boy also having generated nine.


	Meanwhile, Wallen claims the top three spots on the Hot 100, with “What I Want” followed by “Just in Case” at No. 2 and “I'm the Problem” at No. 3 – as he becomes the first artist that primarily records country music to have monopolized the top three in a single week over the chart's 66-year history.


	Browse the full rundown of this week's top 10 below.


	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated May 31, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, May 28 (a day later than usual due to the Memorial Day holiday May 26). For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.


Luminate, the independent data provider to the Billboard charts, completes a thorough review of all data submissions used in compiling the weekly chart rankings. Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.


	“What I Want,” on Mercury/Big Loud/Republic (with Wallen and McRae two of its six writers), becomes the 1,180th No. 1 in the Hot 100's archives, and the 83rd to debut on top. It tallied 31.2 million official streams, 3.9 million radio airplay audience impressions and 2,000 sold in the United States in its first week of release (May 16-22).


	The track also launches at No. 1 on Streaming Songs, where it's Wallen's fifth leader and McRae's first. Being promoted to pop and adult radio, it enters Adult Pop Airplay at No. 32 and Pop Airplay at No. 38, as well as Country Airplay at No. 55.


	“What I Want” concurrently debuts as Wallen's 11th No. 1, and record-extending eighth to open at the summit, on the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart. McRae leads in her first visit to the genre ranking.


	The single is the 30th to have topped both the Hot 100 and Hot Country Songs, dating to 1958, when the former originated and the latter became the country genre's singular Billboard songs chart. It's the first such hit of 2025, following four each in 2024 and 2023, the most in a year since 1975; it's the 10th this decade, after only two led over the previous 36 years.


	Wallen adds his record-extending fourth shared Hot 100 and Hot Country Songs No. 1. Glen Campbell, John Denver, Dolly Parton, Kenny Rogers and Taylor Swift follow with two each.


	While Wallen is from Sneedville, Tenn., McRae is from Calgary, Alberta (a mere 2,136 miles away). Billboard's Paul Grein recently chronicled every Hot 100 No. 1 by a Canadian artist, with McRae becoming the 29th such act to rule. She's the seventh woman, joining Celine Dion (four No. 1s), Nelly Furtado (three), Carly Rae Jepsen, Avril Lavigne, Alannah Myles and Anne Murray (also one each).


	Wallen boasts six songs in the Hot 100's top 10. After “What I Want” at No. 1, he follows with “Just in Case,” up from No. 11 to a new No. 2 high, surpassing its prior No. 4 peak; “I'm the Problem” (6-3, after reaching No. 2); “I Got Better” (a debut at No. 7); “Superman” (which leaps 16-8 in a single bound for a new best); and “Love Somebody” (18-10, following a week at No. 1 upon its debut last November). With three new top 10s, he ups his count to 18 in his career – the most for any artist that has primarily recorded country music.


	Wallen is the first core country artist to infuse the Hot 100's top 10 with at least six songs simultaneously; Taylor Swift (a record 10 in both 2024 and 2022, following her mid-2010s segue from country to pop), Drake, Kendrick Lamar and 21 Savage have also achieved the feat.


	Wallen also becomes the first country act to hold the Hot 100's top three spots simultaneously. Only five other acts have tallied such triples: The Beatles, for five weeks in 1964; Swift (three, 2022-24); Drake (three, 2021-23); Lamar (two, 2024-25); and Ariana Grande (one, 2019).


	Meanwhile, “What I Want” is Wallen's first song released with a woman artist. Collaborations by men and women have topped the Hot 100 for all but three weeks this year, as “What I Want” follows Kendrick Lamar and SZA's “Luther” (13 weeks at No. 1) and Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' “Die With a Smile” (five). The current streak of 14 weeks on top, as “What I Want” dethrones “Luther,” marks the longest by collaborating male and female acts since a record 25-week run in 2016 via Drake's “One Dance,” featuring WizKid and Kyla (nine), Sia's “Cheap Thrills,” featuring Sean Paul (four), and The Chainsmokers' “Closer,” featuring Halsey (12).


	Elsewhere in the Hot 100's top 10, Alex Warren's “Ordinary” dips to No. 4 from its No. 2 high.


	Kendrick Lamar and SZA's “Luther” falls to No. 5 after 13 weeks atop the Hot 100. It adds a 22nd week at No. 1 on both the multimetric Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Rap Songs charts – tying Lamar's “Not Like Us” (in 2024-25) for the longest command on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs (dating to October 1958, when it became the genre's singular songs ranking).


	Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' “Die With a Smile” slips 3-6 following five nonconsecutive weeks atop the Hot 100 beginning in January.


	Plus, Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” slides 4-9 on the Hot 100, following its record-tying 19 weeks at No. 1 beginning last July.

	When Rage Against the Machine‘s Tom Morello took the stage at Boston Calling Music Festival on Sunday evening, his solo set featured a pointed message. On the screen behind him, a graphic compiled nearly two dozen buttons that read and spelled out “Fuck Trump,” labeled the president a “tyrant,” and referred to him as the “Hater in Chief.” Addressing the crowd, Morello said: “Welcome, brothers and sisters, to the last big event before they throw us all in jail.”


	Morello used the performance to join the legion of musicians backing Bruce Springsteen in the musician's recent standoff with Donald Trump. “Bruce is going after Trump because Bruce, his whole life, he's been about truth, justice, democracy, equality,” Morello said. “And Trump is mad at him because Bruce draws a bigger audience. Fuck that guy.” The guitarist performed a cover of Springsteen's “The Ghost of Tom Joad” in solidarity.

	Elsewhere in his set, Morello performed Woody Guthrie's “This Land Is Your Land,” a song he learned in the third grade only to later discover that essential lyrics were removed from the version he knew. “It's a beautiful song, but they censored out all the verses that explain what the song is really about,” Morello said. “This is a revolutionary anthem. Woody Guthrie knew that music could be … an uplifting, unifying, transcendent thing; a defensive shield, and a weapon for change. Authoritarians and billionaires think this country belongs to them. Woody Guthrie knew that this land is yours.”

	











	His account of the song mirrors recent sentiments that Neil Young shared in his own stance against Trump. “Bruce and thousands of musicians think you are ruining America. You worry about that instead of the dyin' kids in Gaza. That's your problem. I am not scared of you. Neither are the rest of us,” Young said last week. “You are forgetting your real job. You work for us.” 


	Morello isn't only representing musicians in this battle. He also showed support for his alma mater, Harvard University, at the festival, which is held at the Harvard Athletic Complex. The Ivy League school recently sued the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department, and the Department of Justice in response to the Trump administration's attempt to block the university from enrolling international students. Earlier this month, the Department of Education froze all federal grant funding to Harvard over their refusal to bend to their demands.

	The musician put a spotlight on the free course “We the People: Civic Engagement in a Constitutional Democracy,” which is available online through the university. Morello explained that the course is “basic U.S. government, understanding the Constitution, and how to recognize a dictatorship takeover of your country.” An honors student, he graduated from Harvard in 1986 with a B.A. in political science.

	At another moment in his set, Morello flipped his guitar over to reveal a message printed on the back that read: “Fuck I.C.E.” Since taking office, the Trump administration has shown repeated noncompliance with court orders mandating due process for migrants in its immigration practices that have led to the detainment and deportation of U.S. citizens, too. 


	“No retreat baby,” Morello wrote on X, referencing his set. “No surrender.”

When the winning team of “Rock the Block” season 6 was revealed on May 26, 2025, during HGTV's big finale, there was a massive celebration in the sky — with 300 illuminated drones spelling out clues to who had won. 

But on the ground, in the Utah cul-de-sac where they'd spent six weeks transforming a new home into a “refined rustic” oasis, the winning team — HGTV veterans Alison Victoria and Michel Smith Boyd — were never seen embracing or celebrating with each other. Many fans took to social media to express confusion and surprise over the duo's reactions to their big win. 

A post shared by HGTV (@hgtv)

At the start of the two-hour finale, Victoria, who was competing on “Rock the Block” for her third time, and Boyd, who won season four with designer Anthony Elle, were all smiles and seemed to be in agreement over their exterior design plans. Victoria managed the landscaping and entryway while Boyd handled the episode's other challenge, the upper-level guest room, which he turned into a gym. 

But after they were revealed as the winners, many viewers noticed, they were never seen celebrating together after their win — only with their fellow contestants Jonathan and Jordan Knight, Tristyn and Kamohai Kalama, and Chelesa and Cole DeBoer.

On an HGTV post about the finale, one fan commented, “Did anyone else notice the ICE between Alison and Michel??? What happened?”

“I did,” a fellow viewer replied. “It was crazy noticeable tonight”

“I picked them to win 6weeks ago,” someone else wrote. “Winners win and @michelboyd is a winner. Also I read between the lines and could see there was friction so thank you for being the true professional and star that you are. Congratulations Michel 🙌🏾🍾👏🏽💪🏾”

Another fan later weighed in, “Is it me🤔 Michel & Allison don't seem to like each other… they by chance won and didn't even interact with each other. Allison hugged the same ppl over and over and never once hugged her teammate, also even when standing at the beginning and end of the show when Ty is giving instructions etc they seem very stand offish. #mypov”

Viewers also expressed concern on EntertainmentNow's HGTV Facebook page, including one who wrote that Victoria “never acknowledged Michel” and “didn't want to collaborate with him,” while someone else replied, “I didn't see him acknowledge her either.”

A post shared by MICHEL SMITH BOYD (@michelboyd)

The morning after the finale, on May 27, Boyd posted a video of himself preparing a “solo finale party,” and watching the episode by himself. When someone wrote, “Congratulations! But time to spill the tea, what's up with you and Alison?” Boyd simply replied, “😂☕”

The four teams of HGTV stars worked on identical homes, each with a starting value of $750,000. They were given $250,000 for their design transformations, plus an additional $50,000 to use on their backyards, bringing each house to a base value of $1,050,000. After three independent appraisers went through each home, Victoria and Boyd's was deemed to have the highest final value — $1,400,000. 

When their names appeared in the sky, Boyd and Alison both looked shocked. They turned briefly to each other, mouths agape, but then turned to their competitors on either side. It's not clear if they ever hugged each other, but they were seen onscreen hugging the others. 

As host Ty Pennington asked how the win felt, Victoria could be seen in a tight embrace with Tristyn as Boyd — suddenly the first-ever two-time “Rock the Block” champ — responded, “This is amazing. This feels like a massive accomplishment. My partner's been here three times and I am just as grateful as I could be.”

When Pennington noticed that Victoria was in tears, he pointed out that she is “never emotional.” She told him, “We worked so hard and this is, you know, third time's the charm, I guess. This was a tough one.” 

In a post-win interview with HGTV.com, Victoria said that her jaw-dropped response was genuine and that it was the hardest of the three “Rock the Block” shows she'd competed on.

“That shock was authentic,” she said. “During the finale, I was standing on that street, it was 25 degrees out; it was the hardest ‘Rock the Block' ever. I'm so tired, I just want to go home after everything I've endured. And in my mind, I was wondering if the win would go to Chelsea and Cole because their house was so child-friendly and we're in Utah where there are big families. But I knew in my heart we should have won. I toured everyone's houses and I was still like, ‘This is my win. For sure, this is my win.'”

A war hero who worked with Otis Redding and The Furys, he appeared in four Clint Eastwood movies and portrayed lots of cops during his career. 


							By 

	Mike Barnes


Senior Editor


	James McEachin, who wrote and produced songs for Otis Redding before turning to acting to portray cops on his own NBC Mystery Movie series and in 18 of the popular Perry Mason telefilms, has died. He was 94. 


	McEachin died Jan. 11 and was interred last month at Los Angeles National Cemetery.




	The familiar character actor also appeared in four films opposite Clint Eastwood: Coogan's Bluff (1968), Play Misty for Me (1971) — as the deejay Sweet Al Monte — Every Which Way But Loose (1978) and Sudden Impact (1983).

All in the Family aficionados know him for his turns as the IRS tax examiner who won't be bribed on the 1972 episode “Archie's Fraud” and as Solomon Jackson, a Black Jew whom Carroll O'Connor's character invites into his lodge to check off some diversity boxes, on the 1977 installment “Archie the Liberal.”

	











	A onetime contract player at Universal, McEachin starred as family man Harry Tenafly, a Los Angeles cop turned private detective, in Tenafly, created by Richard Levinson and William Link of Columbo and Mannix fame.


	One of the rotating, once-a-month NBC Mystery Movie shows that in 1973-74 included Dan Dailey's Faraday & Company and The Snoop Sisters, starring Helen Hayes and Mildred Natwick, Tenafly was the rare TV series back then to star a Black actor, but it lasted just five episodes.


	Later, McEachin played Lt. Ed Brock on the NBC Perry Mason telefilms that starred Raymond Burr (and, after his 1993 death, Hal Holbrook) from 1986-95. And he portrayed another police lieutenant, Frank Daniels, on the first season (1986-87) of NBC's Matlock, starring Andy Griffith.


	James McEachin was born on May 20, 1930, in Rennert, North Carolina, and raised in Hackensack, New Jersey. At 17, he joined the U.S. Army in August 1947.


	“When I saw those signs saying ‘Uncle Sam Wants You,' I swear I thought that bony index finger of his was pointing right at me,” McEachin told the Los Angeles Daily News in November 2021.


	McEachin spent more than two years in Japan as part of his first three-year term, then re-enlisted for another three years. As a member of the 2nd Infantry Division, he was wounded in an ambush and left for dead before being rescued. (He was awarded both the Purple Heart and Silver Star in 2005.)

	











	After the service, McEachin worked as a firefighter and a cop in Hackensack, then left for Southern California. Known as Jimmy Mack, he became a songwriter, composer, record producer, talent manager and label owner who worked with the doo-wop group The Furys (“Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart”) and Redding, whom he “brought into the business,” he said in a 2014 interview.


	He didn't think he was the “Jimmy Mack” in the hit 1967 song from Martha and the Vandellas. “I couldn't have been,” he said, “even though there are people who say to this day, ‘He's just trying to hide from it.' What is there to hide from?” (Songwriter Ronnie Mack was said to have been the inspiration for the tune.)


	McEachin was walking along Melrose Avenue one day when someone asked him if he wanted to be in a movie. He asked his wife if she thought he should do it. “She said, ‘Well, you might as well. You've bombed out on everything else you've ever done,'” he recalled with a laugh.


	That movie, shot in Bakersfield, California (not in the Deep South, as the poster said), was I Crossed the Color Line (1966), also known as The Black Klansman, produced and directed by Ted V. Mikels.


	“I didn't know you had to memorize dialogue,” he said. “I didn't know that you didn't have to just pose and do things naturally. It took me forever to learn that. Even though I didn't know anything about acting, I knew what bad acting was. I think I had a patent on bad acting.”


	However, before the decade was done, McEachin had signed with Universal and appeared in films including Uptight (1968), If He Hollers, Let Him Go! (1968), True Grit (1969) and Hello, Dolly! (1969) and on such TV shows as Dragnet, It Takes a Thief, Adam-12, The Name of the Game, Mannix, The Wild Wild West, Hawaii Five-O and Burr's Ironside.

	











	McEachin worked in the 1972 films Fuzz, Buck and the Preacher and The Groundstar Conspiracy before starring on Tenafly.


	After showing up on Insight, The Rockford Files, Police Story, Emergency!, Columbo, T.J. Hooker, St. Elsewhere, Murder, She Wrote and Hill Street Blues, McEachin signed up for his first Perry Mason movie, 1986's The Case of the Notorious Nun. He stuck around through 1995's The Case of the Jealous Jokester.


	He said he turned down a role in Steven Spielberg's The Color Purple (1985) because he was offended at how his character was written.


	In 2002, McEachin played a liberal Supreme Court justice on First Monday, a short-lived CBS drama from Donald P. Bellisario that starred James Garner and Joe Mantegna.


	McEachin was appointed a U.S. Army Reserve Ambassador in 2005 to spend time speaking with soldiers and veterans. A year later, he wrote, produced and starred (with David Huddleston, a castmate on Tenafly) in a 23-minute video called Old Glory that the military community embraced.


	His one-man play, Above the Call; Beyond the Duty, opened at the Kennedy Center in Washington in 2008 and played L.A.'s Mark Taper Forum three years later. He portrayed Old Soldier, a character who “pries open tough issues left in the wake of battle, boldly confronting challenges that are facing those serving in our military today while reconciling the spirit of one who has killed in war.”


	McEachin also wrote several books, including 1996's Tell Me a Tale: A Novel of the Old South, 1997's Farewell to the Mockingbirds, 1999's The Heroin Factor, 2000's Say Goodnight to the Boys in Blue and 2021's Swing Low My Sweet Chariot: The Ballad of Jimmy Mack, a memoir.

	











	His wife, Lois, whom he married in 1960, died in July 2017.

	They join previously cast Ingalls family: Alice Halsey as Laura Ingalls, Luke Bracey (Charles), Crosby Fitzgerald (Caroline) and Skywalker Hughes (Mary Ingalls).


	Sims will portray Dr. George Tann, a generous and kind-hearted man with a charming bedside manner that makes him a connector within the community. Based on a real person, Tann is featured in the Little House novels as a doctor on the Osage Diminished Reserve who saved the lives of the Ingalls family when they got malaria.


	Christie will play John Edwards, a Civil War veteran from Tennessee.

Luca Guadagnino continues his visionary stamp of approval on rising artists — like Sundance Grand Jury Prize winner Hailey Gates' “Atropia” or recent arthouse favorite “April” from director Dea Kulumbegashvili —  with another festival favorite newcomer. Giovanni Tortorici, who brought his writing/directing feature debut “Diciannove” to the Venice Horizons section last year, is Guadagnino's latest find. And he's about the U.S. audiences' find, too, as this restless coming-of-ager about a reckless young man is coming to stateside theaters on July 25. IndieWire shares the exclusive trailer. Watch in the video above.

 










Here's the synopsis: “A bold, brash and unflinching coming-of-age drama, ‘Diciannove‘ (the film's title translates to ‘nineteen' in Italian) follows the highs and lows of a restless youth as it collides headlong into the concrete realities of adulthood when Leonardo (Manfredi Marini), a teenager from Palermo leaves home for the first time. His studies land him in Siena, by way of London, where he clashes with his instructor, the curriculum, and most chaotically, with himself.” (Read IndieWire's review here.)

Guadagnino discovered Gen Z Sicilian filmmaker Giovanni Tortorici when he worked as an assistant director on Guadagnino's HBO miniseries “We Are Who We Are.” Tortorici's slippery debut “Diciannove” is an exuberantly directed coming-of-age story about a 19-year-old (hence the title) on a journey from a dead-end stint at business school to discovering his love of the Italian classics — and beautiful men and women.

Leonardo will remind you of the great coming-of-age characters, like Jean-Pierre Léaud as Antoine Doinel in the films of François Truffaut, as Tortorici crafts a bildungsroman about his hero's sentimental and literary education. He's got strong opinions about filmmakers, including Pasolini — whose “Salò” Leonardo jerks off to in a scene that plants the seed for a much darker film beneath the surface — and is eventually labeled as someone incel-adjacent by a literary mentor. Leonardo's sexuality is also ambiguous, with an interest in men and women hinted at, and also a fascination with a group of Siena teenagers who you can't tell if he wants to fuck them, kill them, or be them. At one point, Leonardo looks up Justin Bieber's nudes, which the filmmakers used without any permission or clearance, knowing the pop star will probably never see this film.

 










But Tortorici doesn't necessarily identify with the darker impulses you might read into the character, while explaining in an IndieWire interview at Venice last year that this film is torn directly from the pages of his own life. Look out for “Diciannove” in theaters from Oscilloscope July 25.

The Robertsons announced the passing of patriarch Phil Robertson on May 25. He was 79. The family has used social media as a way to pay tribute to the man who touched their lives in numerous ways. Phil's son, Willie Robertson, shared his thoughts on the loss of his father in an emotional message, which he posted on Instagram on May 26.

Willie posted a collection of photos of himself and his father from throughout the years. There are some pictures from his childhood, as well as other, more recent photos. In the caption, he reflected on their time together and the bond they shared.

A post shared by Willie Robertson (@realwilliebosshog)

“Looking back at pics I noticed he was always looking at me funny, prolly trying to figure out, ‘How did this boy turn out like this?' I remember in 8th grade bringing my boombox in the living room and doing a break dance routine for him as he sat on his recliner,” Willie wrote. “He just looked strangely at me and said, ‘Well, I've never seen anything quite like that!' I took it as a compliment.”

The moment was repeated decades later, when Willie shared that toward the end of his father's life, he did another dance for him. “In a much weaker voice, he simply said, ‘Will, you got moves I didn't know you had.' Not sure why I was always dancing in front of Phil. Maybe I figured it was the last thing he would think I would do, so I just did it.”

Willie also reflected on the things that his dad taught him. “I watched him, and knew he had figured out so many things,” he wrote. “Most importantly, he taught me the value of sharing my faith with others. He was the Real Deal, the same on Sundays as Fridays. Most of our conversations were not about hunting or business, but about sharing the Gospel. I was never more proud that when I printed my book, Gospeler, for him to read first. I wanted him to know what he had passed down to me. He read it in one sitting and said, ‘That's the best explanation of the Good News I have ever read…and you were so nice about it!' That made me laugh because sometimes he would forget about the nice part.”

A post shared by Korie Robertson (@korie.robertson)

Willie's post also highlighted the last words that his father said to him, telling him, “You're my brother.” Willie continued, “It made total sense to me. He always told me we were coworkers in the Kingdom of God. Maybe that's why I always just called him Phil. Not sure if he is up in Heaven now doing his own dance moves for our Father.”

He concluded his post by expressing his love for his dad and how much he would miss him. But also thanked him for the values he instilled in him. “Thank you for raising me the right way and teaching me the most important lesson to prepare me for the day you passed on,” Willie wrote. “Not sure how people deal with loss without the Lord. We may be wrong about all this….but I doubt it! Sleep well Dad, can't wait to see you.”

Fans reacted to the post with condolences and mentions of how “Duck Dynasty” had positively impacted their lives.

It was previously announced that Phil had Alzheimer's Disease. “Dad's not doing well at all. It's definitely progressing,” Willie told Us Weekly on May 20. “And mom has shown the same type of symptoms of Alzheimer's or dementia. It's just part of life — and mom has her good days.”

The Robertsons will make their reality TV comeback with “Duck Dynasty: The Revival,” set to air on June 1 at  9 p.m. ET on A&E.

Pierce Brosnan may be Irish by blood, but his MobLand accent has been met with a chorus of disapproval following the premiere of the Paramount+ series.


The Irish Times pilloried his “mangled” vocal work as a “horror for the ages,” while other critics have bemoaned the performance as a “distraction” from the Guy Ritchie-directed gangster drama.


	Brosnan was born in Drogheda, County Louth, but the James Bond star has spent much of his life in England and the U.S. 


	In an interview with Radio Times, Brosnan was asked about the backlash and said that mob boss Conrad Harrigan's accent is quite different from his own native tongue.

	“My own accent is very soft … Conrad's accent is a million miles away from me,” he explained, adding that his performance was the result of a suggestion from his dialect coach. 


	“I told him that I needed a Kerry accent,” he added. “So he gave me the name of a man, and I Googled the guy and that was it. It was a Kerry accent. And so, I just gave it full tilt.”


	Brosnan, who admits his Irish accent has “dissipated to the mists of time,” previously told Dave Moore on Today FM that he had raised concerns about his task with Ritchie.


	“Last summer I spoke to Guy for the first time about it and having read the five episodes he said not to worry about it,” the actor added. 


	It's not all bad news for Brosnan. Irish GQ writer Ben Allen said critics are “being a little harsh” on the performance, and he is “largely pulling off what seems to be a semi-thick Kerry accent.”

"It felt right to bring closure to her journey," says the actor about their cameo.

[This story contains specific spoilers from The Handmaid's Tale series finale, titled “The Handmaid's Tale.”]


	While looking into a window marked with the words, “Freedom,” June (Elisabeth Moss) and viewers of The Handmaid's Tale heard a familiar voice.




	“Blessed be the fruit.”


	The voice belonged to Alexis Bledel, who returned as Emily in the series finale of the Hulu series, which began streaming Tuesday.


	Her arrival was as much of a surprise to June (Elisabeth Moss) as it is to the audience who hasn't seen the OG handmaid since Bledel left the series after season four. Bledel, an original star who earned four nominations for her role on the Hulu dystopian series, departed without a specific explanation.

	While the fifth season was in production, Bledel had said, “After much thought, I felt I had to step away from The Handmaid's Tale at this time. I am forever grateful to [showrunner] Bruce Miller for writing such truthful and resonant scenes for Emily, and to Hulu, MGM, the cast and crew for their support.”


	The series then explained her character Emily's absence in the fifth season premiere, when June is told by Emily's wife, Sylvia (Clea DuVall), that Emily decided to go back to Gilead to fight and find Aunt Lydia (Ann Dowd), and that she called to say goodbye to her family, which included a young son. When June pushes to go save Emily, Sylvia tells June not to go after her, convinced they'll never see Emily again. “It's what she needed to do,” says Sylvia. “She's gone.”


	Bledel spoke to The Hollywood Reporter for a recent oral history on the series and about her return, which was an idea from series creator Bruce Miller, who wrote the final episode, “The Handmaid's Tale,” which was directed by Moss.


	“It was an immediate yes,” she says of coming back for the series ending cameo. “It felt right to bring closure to Emily's journey and offer the audience a sense of completion. Bruce put together such a kind and talented group, and so many of the original crew were still there in season six. The production runs like a well-oiled machine — everyone brings their best. I'm excited to see what they create in [sequel series] The Testaments.”


	In Emily's return, she and June continued the full-circle theme of the final season by walking — in two — through the streets of a freed Boston after an embrace that called back their very first scene of the series (when, in voiceover, June called Emily a “pious little shit”). Long gone are their red cloaks as their city is now out from under Gilead's rule after success from the guerrilla resistance Mayday movement to take down the (fictional) fascist regime.

	











	Emily filled in the lost time, telling June she was a Martha for a Commander who was a friend and that she kept in touch with Sylvia and her son. “So, you weren't just gone?” says June. “Of course not,” says Emily. “They're the reason I'm fighting.”


	The friends stopped in front of the wall and Emily pointed out the miracle of them being alive, together, to read the hopeful and inspiring words before them written by women who are now free from Gilead. Next to the messages are two hanging guardians — instead of the familiar sight of two hanging handmaids, or Marthas, or “traitors.”


	Emily urged June to adjust her definition of “impossible,” and Bledel's cameo then ended with a dream sequence where June imagined if there never was a Gilead. June, Emily, Moira (Samira Wiley), a two-eyed Janine (Madeline Brewer), Rita (Amanda Brugel) and killed handmaids Alma (Nina Kiri) and Brianna (Bahia Watson) are seen laughing, embracing and singing Fleetwood Mac's “Landslide” in a karaoke bar.


	“I hope viewers take away to keep hope alive when things seem impossible,” Bledel adds to THR of her cameo. “Even if it seems like seeds you plant couldn't possibly grow, plant seeds of hope anyway. You never know; they might find a way.”


	When speaking to THR about the series finale, Moss said that once Miller shared his early idea of bringing Bledel back for the final episode she was seton making it happen. Turns out, Bledel agreed. “I said to him at the time, ‘You realize now that you've told me that, we have to do it.' It's not the easiest thing in the world to call an actor and be like, ‘Can you come back for this one episode?' They're busy. … And she wanted to do it from the beginning. She didn't need convincing at all. My first official scene on day one [on set] was with Alexis. So it meant a lot to get to work with her again,” said Moss.

	











	Miller added that her day back on set was a hug-fest. “She cried and hugged people every four feet,” he said, adding that “it was wonderful to see her and Lizzie get right back into it after all that time. It's like watching the fucking Yankees bullpen every day with these guys. They're so good.”

"This is called 'The Handmaid's Tale.' It's her time as a handmaid. And at the end, she's nobody's handmaid: She's Onjune," says Miller, who spoke to THR along with star Elisabeth Moss about the Hulu series' ending and how sequel series 'The Testaments' comes into play.

[This story contains MAJOR spoilers from The Handmaid's Tale series finale, titled “The Handmaid's Tale.”]


The Handmaid's Tale‘s creator Bruce Miller always knew how he was going to end the series. A key location detail changed along the way and he didn't know how many seasons it would take to get there, or that Margaret Atwood would write a sequel novel in 2019. But he knew that when the show reached its ending, June's story would circle back to where it began, but with new perspective.




	“This is definitely not a story where you get what you want most of the time — or where June gets what she wants. It's a story about how to live with the things you can't get,” Miller explains to The Hollywood Reporter about the series finale.

	The 2017 pilot of the Emmy-winning Hulu series had introduced viewers to Elisabeth Moss as June, the woman readers first met as Offred in Atwood's best-selling 1985 novel of the same name. The pilot flashed back to June being separated from her husband Luke (O-T Fagbenle) and daughter Hannah (Jordana Blake) before reintroducing her as a handmaid, wearing a red cloak and white bonnet, while sitting in a windowsill in the home of Gilead Commander Fred (Joseph Fiennes) and his wife, Serena Waterford (Yvonne Strahovski).


	Viewers who listened carefully could hear a click before June then said in voiceover: “A chair. A table. A lamp. There's a window with white curtains, and the glass is shatterproof, but it isn't running away they're afraid of. A handmaid wouldn't get far. … My name is Offred. I had another name, but it's forbidden now. So many things are forbidden now.”


	Now with the series finale that began streaming on Tuesday, viewers understand that clicking sound was a tape recorder and that voiceover was a present-day June. In the series ender, aptly titled “The Handmaid's Tale” and written by Miller and directed by Moss, June is again sitting in that Waterford windowsill after revisiting the remains of the Boston home that burnt down midway through the series. Except now, Gilead's occupation is over and Boston is free, and June is beginning to record the tale we've been watching for six seasons.


	But this means that this tale has reached its end, and June (and viewers) didn't get the reunion they'd been hoping for since the start: The dystopian series doesn't end with June reuniting with her oldest daughter, Hannah. It ends with June continuing to fight for her.

	











	“When [Atwood's sequel novel] The Testaments comes out, you know certain things — you know that June's not dying, you know [her daughter] Hannah is still in Gilead. There's a whole other book about that story,” Miller explains of how the series finale sets TV's Gilead universe on its next course; Miller, also creator of The Testaments, began working on that adaptation ahead of the final season, with Eric Tuchman and Yahlin Chang showrunning season six. “You appreciate the end of the novel and why leaving you loose ends is still satisfying because you feel like, ‘This woman is still around. She made it this far,'” he adds. “If she didn't make it any further, that's okay, but what a story of her making it this far. It is the story of women through history.”


	The finale does — praise fucking be! — deliver the highly emotional mother-daughter reunion between Janine (Madeline Brewer) and Charlotte, facilitated by a revolutionized Aunt Lydia (Ann Dowd) with Naomi's (Ever Carradine) consent; while Serena is handed a fate left open to interpretation, as she is once again a refugee without a home for her and son Noah. After the deadly penultimate episode with the High Commander deaths of Nick (Max Minghella), Lawrence (Bradley Whitford) and Wharton (Josh Charles), the finale updated viewers that Gilead will continue to fall across the once-United States and that June will be among the resistance, fighting undercover until she gets Hannah out. Luke vows to do the same.


	Following up on The Hollywood Reporter‘s oral history on the blazing success of the series and how it will launch The Testaments, THR spoke with Miller and Moss in separate conversations edited below about how they delivered a satisfactory yet realistic ending to the beloved, timely saga while also setting up the sequel series, which is currently in production. In that near future, Aunt Lydia is the starring character and Chase Infiniti plays Agnes, which we know is the Gilead name given to Hannah, June's daughter.

	











	***


Bruce, you recently told me that this is a story about living with what people can't get and how they survive. Before Margaret Atwood came to you with her plan to write sequel novel The Testaments, were you planning on reuniting June (Moss) with daughter Hannah? Or did that seem like too much of a neat ending for this world?


BRUCE MILLER It felt like it was tying it too much in a bow. Given where we started with June, that seemed like a whole other section of her life. This show was about June and her daughter and her husband and how she lost everything, and how she has gradually been pulling a lot of that back together. It's The Handmaid's Tale, not Hannah's Tale. It's focused on June's journey from handmaidness to freedom. The question of how she rebuilds her family felt like a whole other step, which we're seeing is a lot more complicated than just, “Let's all go to Alaska.” 


	We spent the season with June at first thinking, “I can dust off my hands and say, ‘I'm done.'” [If she stayed in Alaska with her mom and daughter Holly], that's what that would look like: The neat ending. But it didn't end up like that. June threw herself back in — she couldn't walk away from her daughter, Hannah. I think they say it in the book: There's plenty of stories from people who get their kids back. Those are the one-in-a-million stories we always tell. I want to tell the story about the 999,000 people who don't get their kids back. They have to go through life and live, and it's not easy. June is a good example of someone who doesn't ever take the easy way out, but this is as hard as things get in the world and you see what that does to somebody.

	











When Margaret said, “I'm writing The Testaments and this may influence what you do on The Handmaid's Tale,” she told me that she gave you a very small no-kill list: Aunt Lydia, and June's two daughters, Hannah and Nichole/Holly. 


MILLER Yes, a very small one. Lydia is a fucking cat. She has 900 lives, which is exactly how those people survived in those kind of regimes by being very good at stepping slightly out of the way when the shit starts to fall. Ann [Dowd] has taken that character in so many different directions and shown us doors to parts of her past and personality that we haven't opened yet. Aunt Lydia [by the end of The Handmaid's Tale] is just starting to realize that maybe Gilead was lying to her, and maybe it isn't just her “special girls” who deserve to be free. Ann has built that slowly, carefully in a believable way over time. Margaret and her are wonderful friends. It's a great pleasure to be able to continue that character [in The Testaments]. If you look at what happened just in this last season — Lydia's at the end of a rope and then she's back already in power by the end, which is totally her! 


	Margaret came to me as soon as she was having the inkling [of writing The Testaments], so it was very early for me to get the information. She let me know as the creator of the world that things might be shifting a little under my feet. The show went past the book, The Handmaid's Tale. So I was trying to come up with an ending that fit well and certainly I was playing with a lot of the things that she talked about doing in The Testaments. But this is called The Handmaid's Tale. It's not June's Tale. It's her time as a handmaid. And at the end, the final episode is that she's not a handmaid anymore in any way, shape or form. She's nobody's handmaid: She's Onjune.

	











ELISABETH MOSS I didn't have the task of writing [the ending], but I understand and I'm aware that that was the biggest challenge: The Testaments has Hannah not get out. That was definitely something we would have played with for the end of Handmaid's; June maybe getting her out. But we had to move towards the sequel that had been written. Now, I don't think that was a bad thing. But was it the thing that was probably most present? Yeah, I would say so.


Lizzie [Moss goes by “Lizzie”], did you know after season three that because of The Testaments [which released in 2019] that this show was going to end differently?


MOSS It was before I read it, because I spoke to Bruce about it. Then I read it and it was definitely like, “So that won't be our ending.”


Bruce, you have told me you always knew how the series would end. So, had you always imagined the final scene would be June saying those words that began her tale? Was that in your initial pitch for how you wanted to adapt the series?


MILLER Yes, it was in my pitch because it's really the story of the book. It was how you think about her as a character from the beginning. What is that voiceover? Where's it coming from? From the beginning, I was thinking, “So what we're watching is this box of tapes that someone found, just dramatized.” But it's this box of her story, her tale of being a handmaid. So I said that what I really wanted to do was that when you get to the end, you feel like you understood what you just saw and what it was as a full piece. I'm hoping that it felt satisfying as an ending for this story. 

	











MOSS What I connected to with June at the beginning was the same thing I connected with at the very end. She has this quality of wanting to survive, not only as herself, but to create a better future specifically her children but also for the next generation. That is her goal in life. I saw that in episode one, in that first script. I remember calling my mom and telling her that. And it's the same thing in the very last scene.


	For whatever reason, I'm not a stranger to doing work that somehow ends up becoming a part of the zeitgeist or becoming relevant in a very present way. Those aren't choices that I'm necessarily making on purpose. I've just gravitated towards material that is, for me, personal. This story was personal and my job is to tell the personal side of things, the human side of things. When it then goes out into the world and becomes political or something on such a larger scale, I'm grateful and moved by that.


Lizzie, when we spoke at the beginning of the final season, you said this ending was true to Bruce's vision, but that the location shifted. Now I understand why the location was so important.


MOSS The original idea was that June would maybe go to that cabin in the woods [that Luke and June hid out in near the border] from [a flashback in] season one, episode seven. June, Luke and Hannah were making pancakes — we call that the “pancake episode.” Originally, the idea was that June was going to go back there. And actually, before we started shooting, we established that cabin was still there. But then Bruce wrote a different location, and I think it's so much better.

	











	Originally, it was written that June goes and sits on the front steps of the Waterford house. And I said, “I want her to go inside. I think it would be so much more powerful if she goes into that room.” So I talked to Bruce and asked, “Can we go inside the house?” And he said, yes. He loved it, and so he wrote it so June goes inside the house.


MILLER I really wanted the ending to be June back and kind of reclaiming Boston. That old neighborhood was taken away from her, so reclaiming it and going back there is the end of that part of her story. She's back in the same place, but in a very different position. 


	In the book, she records [the tale] in a cabin in Maine and buries it in the ground. Lizzie and I had talked about that and we could have done that here, with her going back into Gilead at the end. But so much of the show had a sense of place and was so connected to Boston. Seeing her walk back through those streets and those places now as a free person is something that, as Alexis Bledel's character says, was impossible. And look, it happened. So we should adjust what's possible and what's impossible.


I understand the finale scripts were redacted for the cast, who were only privy to their parts in the episode. Did you, as director, close the set when filming this final scene to keep it under wraps?


MOSS I did close the set. Not to keep it secret, but mostly because I needed the set to be a very quiet space that day. When you're shooting the final scene of a show, it tends to attract some attention. So it was actually me as a director protecting my actor, who is me. I needed to be able to do my job that day, which was a very difficult job of ending a series as an actor and pulling off that final moment. So I closed the set for that reason. I also closed the set for the final scene inside the plane in episode nine [Whitford and Minghella's final scene before Lawrence and Nick's deaths].

	











MILLER It was a big thing to rebuild this [Waterford house] set. You have to make a commitment to the things you really want, and for Lizzie as director and me as a writer and both of us as executive producers, this was one of the things. Budgets are shrinking in Hollywood; our show is not any exception. When you get to the end of a show, you don't have money flying around, so we had to be careful with what we planned because we weren't going to be able to pick anything up afterwards. So we thought very long and hard from the beginning of the episode to make sure we protected that. You reduce the cost by giving [production designer Elisabeth Williams and her team] lots of lead time. But they had a lot of fun building the house interiors again. [The hallway to her room] goes up and down — there's a step up and then a step down. It feels like a [claustrophobic] funhouse staircase.


I can't think of another director who filmed themselves in the final scene of a long-running series.


MOSS That's a good question. That would be a fun fact to find out. But this cast, this crew has made me a better director. They made me a better actor. They made me a better producer. That post team made me better at what I do because of them. Every time I've been talking with [season six showrunners] Eric Tuchman and Yahlin Chang I tell them how I miss collaborating with them. I don't see why we couldn't at some point come back and do something. What's so great about the landscape now is that we could do something in a few years if we wanted to. There's nothing saying we can't. There are no rules anymore. But I do think where we end it is right. They did a brilliant job of wrapping it up.

	











MILLER Lizzie did such a great job. In these last couple of episodes, she pulled out new elements of her performance as June. It's amazing to do that, six seasons in. That scene with her and Serena [where June forgives her in the finale] is some of the best work [she and Yvonne have] done.


	It was very natural [for Lizzie to direct and act in the final episode], I think because we had been talking about it for a long time. You'd imagine it being a very internal situation, but she was as communicative with the crew as she always is. It was a group effort so for Lizzie, it was that collective experience she loves. I think there's very few people you can compare to, just on the amount that the show rests on them. In addition to directing and being an executive producer who is ingrained with the show — creatively, she works on so many different levels — I think it makes it easier in that final scene. Both Lizzie and I we're really confident about it. We knew what it was going to be. I wasn't even there. I was very happy for her to do it on her own. I knew she'd get it right, and she did.


Lizzie, were you listening to yourself [from the pilot] as you were saying your final lines?


MOSS I realized about 10 minutes before we shot it that I wanted to make sure that when I was speaking the final voiceover it matched the original voiceover from episode one. I wasn't sure if I wanted to do that or not, but I realized that I needed to match my mouth to [the pilot words]. We're setting up the final shot of the series, and I went on the Hulu app on my phone to episode one, and I just played it over and over and over again and memorized it in the cadence that I said it. I told our script supervisor that I can't get one word wrong. This has to be word-perfect. Then we did it, and it matches almost perfectly. There's a slight cadence change, when my body's going back and I lean forward, that we were able to fix in post. But what's in the finale is my voiceover from nine years ago.

	











Bruce always told us this show was June's tale, so she survives. Even still, the audience wasn't sure she'd make it through. I rewatched the pilot and knowing what you just said, that's wild and very meta.


MOSS Oh, that's awesome. [Using the pilot voiceover] is an idea that I had and I didn't know if it would work, and then it ended up working and it's so cool because there's something slightly disconnected about it that's really interesting. I think almost subconsciously as an audience member, you feel the meta nature of it, especially when she says, “My name is Offred.” And the [tape recording click] is in the pilot. After the door slams, you hear the click.


MILLER The click of the recording at the beginning, we put in the pilot. So we have been thinking about this particular moment since then.


I also don't know that there's another IP that got a sequel midway through, which then tasked the show with landing the plane but keeping the world open. 


MILLER That's the key here. I'm going to have to beg some flexibility. Most of the time, when you're adapting a book, the person who wrote it is not continuing the books. Sometimes they are with Game of Thrones. But most of the time, it was a book written in the past. In this case, there are great things about having Margaret around that outweigh the problem of her being able to change her world a little bit when she wants to. Of course she can do that. 


	But I think the way to look at The Testaments is that The Testaments book is a sequel to The Handmaid's Tale book, and there are things that are different between that and the show; timeline things that end up mattering because you want it to be consistent within the TV world. So [as creator of The Testaments], I'm trying to make a sequel to the TV show The Handmaid's Tale and make that work cleanly. There are things that actually contradict from the book to the TV show, but each adaptation has to be its own thing.

	











You left June — and also Luke, and likely Rita (Amanda Brugel) and Moira (Samira Wiley) — still out there in the ether of this TV universe fighting against Gilead. Moss is an executive producer on The Testaments, but there's no word about an onscreen role. What would you say to people who are hoping June will show up in The Testaments?


MILLER That's a good thing to hope for. I hope she shows up there, too. She's still doing her job, still doing what she was doing in The Handmaid's Tale. Luke and Moira are still out there somewhere, ringing the bell to get Hannah back. The beauty of having watched The Handmaid's Tale is that you understand there's this huge operation of people who are out there who care and who are risking themselves to get to reunite with their children. The people in The Testaments show don't feel that. But from experiencing Handmaid's, you know there's this whole operation. So is June influencing The Testaments? Absolutely. She's out there. She's trying to get Hannah back. Do we see her? I would love to see her. I love Lizzie Moss, she's awesome! She's very involved behind the scenes.


MOSS You're just going to have to watch the show. [Moss is currently filming the forthcoming Apple series Imperfect Women.] I won't be there [on set of The Testaments], which is different as a producer. But I can't not be hands on. I don't know how to do it any other way. And it certainly feels hands on, given the amount of emails!

	











So if we weren't going to get Hannah back, did you always know you were going to give Janine Charlotte back? Thank you for that!


MILLER Oh, my gosh. Yes. One of the things I always thought is that little girl looks so much like her. We had talked from the beginning, and a lot of it was about building Naomi and Janine to the point where that would happen. Building to where Naomi knows the one thing about Janine is that Janine is really tough, which she needs to know when she's [giving her daughter back]. Listen, I hope June does get Hannah back. But I'm hoping that people feel like this is the ending to Janine's story [that she deserves]. The fact that I'm not going to be able to work with or see Maddie Brewer every day is impossible to say out loud. 


MOSS Ever wasn't in that scene originally, and I asked if she could be there. I really wanted her to be a part of it. I felt that it was really important that Naomi is the one who hands Charlotte over to Janine. I felt like that was a story for Ever and for that character that needed to be her ending in the show. That Janine scene just kills me.


Could there be a place for Janine in the background fight in The Testaments?


MILLER I would be thrilled. I think you should imagine that all these people are in the background still fighting to save these girls you see in The Testaments. Fighting, fighting, fighting. As calm as it will seem in Gilead, as sweet and human and beautiful as Gilead is in The Testaments, you know that there are people pounding on the walls from the outside — and you've met those people. 

	











One character who may not be in that fight is Serena. I understand you had a different ending for her than the one that we saw. 


MILLER I don't believe “what people deserve” and all that stuff, but I wanted to kill her. Because I think she was such a horrible person and being dead on the side of the road completely anonymously [after she was pushed from the train in the beginning of the season] would have been a fitting end. I had to be convinced not to throw her off that train, along with the kid. 


Wow. 


MOSS Bruce did tell me his thoughts and he told me that he was toying with certain things. I'm not the writer, and I respect the role of the writer very much. So he told me what he was thinking and I thought, “Okay, that's interesting. Wow, that would be kind of crazy if she didn't make it.” But in my heart, I really wanted to see her survive because I'm Serena's biggest fan. I'm her biggest supporter and defender. I want her to live. I just think she deserves that, and I think Noah [her son] deserves that.


MILLER If it was Eva Braun and it was Hitler's kid, what would you do? I don't think anybody would hesitate. But I love what we ended up doing because what I really wanted for most of the characters is to get exactly what they wanted and see what happened. June got a ton of what she wanted and a ton of stuff she didn't expect, including Emily[‘s return], including reuniting with Luke, who she thought was dead at the beginning of the show. Serena's story really feels like the end of Serena's story, that she is someone who's never going to admit that she did wrong. But you can see how holding onto the illusion that she did right is getting very, very difficult. I love Serena. I love her to the point where I'm so much more mad at her because she should know better.

	











But to see June forgive her in the end felt like it gave the audience permission to accept that as well.  


MOSS That scene also kills me. I think it's beautiful. I couldn't read [Serena's ending] without crying. I can't watch it without crying. Yvonne's performance is magnificent. Each and every single one of these actors is at the top of their fucking game this season. And she did it in one take. That whole speech when she's talking to the baby. I get chills talking about it.


MILLER Circling back to their performances and the new things they all brought out in the final episode, they all did exceptional work. It's unfathomable that they would have these moments that you really feel are completely new and see different sides of the characters at the very last minute. 


MOSS Yvonne had the idea that she wanted to get to this place of acceptance and place of peace at the end. It would have been very easy to cut that scene shorter, but when we were in the edit I protected it because Yvonne wanted her character to find peace. You see this peace on her face where she realizes Noah is all she needs. That's all Serena ever wanted: Having a baby. I think her ending is my favorite ending in the series. It's so perfect.


Did Alexis Bledel [who left the series after season four] need convincing to come back or was she excited when she got the call from you?


MILLER We were both thrilled that it might work out. I think she was really excited when we talked. The only thing that was hard was the logistics to get her up for the time we needed. But no, it was not hard at all, and it wasn't hard to decide to try to see if she was going to be available. It was great having her back that day — except she cried and hugged people every four feet, it seemed emotionally difficult! But it was wonderful to see her and Lizzie get right back into it after all that time. It's like watching the fucking Yankees bullpen every day with these guys. They're so good.

	











MOSS Bruce talked to me about bringing her back a while ago, before there was even an outline or script. I think I said to him at the time, “You realize now that you've told me that, we have to do it.” It's not the easiest thing in the world to call an actor and be like, “Can you come back for this one episode?” They're busy. But I was like, “She has to do it.” I get very passionate about these things! And she wanted to do it from the beginning. She didn't need convincing at all. My first official scene on day one [on set] was with Alexis. So it meant a lot to get to work with her again. (Bledel spoke to THR about her return.)


Were there characters along the way who you considered killing but let live?


MILLER No, I don't really think about it that way. I think, do they end up in some place where they would die or not? By definition, the handmaid told this story. She had to live to the end, so the story is about her dodging explosions and stuff. That's part of the story. But the other people — I don't ever want to kill anybody, but I know that if I was in this group of people and Janine died, I would never recover. if Janine died and Alma [Nina Kiri] died, I would never recover. TV people die willy nilly. When people in your life die, it changes you. I don't know that June would be the same June if those people would have all been killed off. One of the reasons those people are in her memories is because they didn't die.


MOSS I hope people see the positivity [in the ending]. The final piece of music that plays over the credits is so hopeful. The piece of music [we chose] is from season four, when June tells Luke that she's pregnant. It's so much about the future and the future being brighter, and the next generation having a better chance. So the final decision that we made on the series is about the future. 

	











Does that mean we should find hope in June and Luke's final conversation? Because it was ambiguous.


MOSS Yes. I don't think I was so ambiguous! I definitely felt like there was hope in that future when I was standing there with him. We had this idea to play it like they were flirting with each other, like they had crushes on each other. Like, did they almost go back to the beginning? There's such a circular nature to the finale and absolutely I think there's a lot of hope for the two of them. But I think they have to kind of start again.

Benson Boone brought the magic to the American Music Awards stage today. The singer performed a characteristically spirited rendition of his recent single “Mystical Magical” at the 2025 awards.


	Boone came out onstage wearing a Seventies-inspired purple floral suit, dazzling the audience from his very first note. During his performance, the singer made sure to fully engage fans and attendees alike when he walked off the stage into the crowd. Boone gave a cheeky nod to his 2025 Grammys performance by stopping by to say hi to Nikki Glaser and Heidi Klum, who were sitting front row, and got the rest of the audience dancing.


	Of course, the singer managed to incorporate a perfectly executed flip into his performance.

	This is Boone's first time at the AMAs, with the musician up for five awards, including New Artist of the Year and Favorite Male Pop Artist. His breakthrough hit, “Beautiful Things,” was also nominated for Song of the Year, Favorite Music Video, and Favorite Pop Song.

	











	As for “Mystical Magical,” Boone released the song last month after debuting it at Coachella. It's slated to appear on his second album, American Heart, which is arriving June 20. Before releasing “Mystical Magical,” Boone teased the album with “Sorry I'm Here for Someone Else,” while more recently he dropped the soulful tribute, “Momma Song.” 


	In a recent Rolling Stone cover story, Boone spoke about American Heart, describing the album as “very Bruce Springsteen, Americana, like a little more of a retro vibe.” While he admitted he's not sure the album has another hit as massive as “Beautiful Things,” he also said achieving that wasn't his top priority as an artist.

	“It  all started with me believing in the song ‘Beautiful Things,'” he said. “Now, I have a whole album just about ready to go — and I've never believed so much in a body of work.” 


	Boone will hit the road this summer in support of American Heart as well. The trek kicks off Aug. 22 at the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul, Minnesota, and wraps with a three-night stand in Salt Lake City on Oct. 8, 9, and 11.

[Editor's note: The following contains spoilers for ‘Final Destination Bloodlines.']

The secret to directing the Skyview from “Final Destination Bloodlines” hides in plain sight. But for Adam Stein and Zach Lipovsky, striking the right tone was as much about the big picture horror as it was the funny little details. The pair met while making Steven Spielberg's “On the Lot,” a reality competition show from 2007. Now, they're on-track to deliver the highest-grossing chapter in a treasured 2000s franchise.

“What make the guys so successful is casting that wide net and seeing what they get,” said editor and frequent collaborator Sabrina Pitre. Fresh off another victory with Eli Craig's “Clown in a Cornfield,” she's already hard at work cutting Lipovsky and Stein's next film, “Freaks 2.”

Pitre says the directors' knack for truly valuing talent is what helped capture so many moments that make “Bloodlines” feel special. Warner Bros. and New Line's triumphant sequel is a win for so-called “fans” of freak accidents everywhere — and a testament to the style Stein and Lipovsky have been developing since before “Final Destination” went dormant.

“They trust us all as professionals and they want all of these different departments to give their A game, so we can all bring something new to the table and find things they otherwise wouldn't have thought of,” said Pitre.

Kicking off in 1968, “Bloodlines” opens on a high-rise restaurant disaster. The structural collapse at the Skyview is in strong contention for the all-around best massacre of the series — featuring an ocean of slapstick visual effects and essential backstory that makes the core of the movie. Yes, the scene boasts some outrageously entertaining kills, but also anchored in a pitch-perfect showing from star Brec Bassinger, it's more emotional than the sum of its “Looney Tunes”-like parts.

“We have all sorts of different ways that we like to keep the performances feeling fresh,” said Lipovksy. “Whenever possible, we always shoot the movie as written, and we'll also do takes where we let them say other things in the moment. There's a lot of that in this movie. We have really funny jokes and things that came from improvs, but we also do silent takes where we run the scene and no one talks.”

 










Fan-favorite character Erik Campbell sees the magnetic Richard Harmon ripping through one-liners faster than you can pull a Prince Albert piercing through flesh — but Bassinger's dreamy first impression as a scream queen was essential to the entire script's success. Introduced and killed off over the course of “Bloodlines,” Iris Campbell (also played by 70-year-old Gabrielle Rose) steps in as a legacy final girl à la Jamie Lee Curtis for a universe that's never had a main character.

“We would do an improv take, where they'd be like, ‘Don't say any words! Just say what you're feeling,'” Bassinger told IndieWire. “Then, we would do a silent take, which I had never done that before. I'd never even heard of that, where we do the entire scene, but we didn't speak.”

Dovetailing Iris's “Final Destination” debut with the late Tony Todd's bittersweet exit, Bassinger found her character's most important beat during a silent take. “Bloodlines” hinges on a soap opera-like investigation into a family tree that only exists because Iris, her husband Paul (Max Lloyd-Jones), and their unborn baby escape the Skyview. Her premonition also saves jazz singer Evie (Natasha Burnett) and her son, the legendary William Bludworth. (5-year-old Jayden Oniah plays Todd's iconic role here.)

 










“There's this moment where Evie catches me about to throw up and she's like, ‘How far along are you?' I'm like, ‘Oh, I'm not pregnant!' And then there's a moment where I look down, I see that my hand is on my stomach, and then I look back up,” said Bassinger. “It feels silly, but in the moment when you're taking away the words and you're just focused on the intent, I think there are some really great moments created from that.”

“There's so much power behind an expression,” said Pitre. “There's a tendency with dialogue to over-explain things and not let the audiences figure it out for themselves. Silent takes allow that. They allow the actors to get outside of their heads and live in the moment, and as an editor, I really pick up on that. They're little bits of gold, honestly.”

On creating emotional tension while editing the scene, Pitre continued, “We spent so much time with the buildup in the Skyview to make sure that we were in love with these characters and I feel like the second we see Brec on camera, I was just like, ‘Oh, wow.' There's something about her presence that just blew me away. She's just a natural and it really comes across. Your heart just breaks for her.” 

Not too uptight but still plenty exacting, “Bloodlines” boasts an almost bouncy scare style and an intuitive pop-comic feel. Lipovsky said, “One of the things we've learned over the years is often when you're writing the script and you're putting everything in there and you're making sure it's all explained carefully, sometimes an actor can just give you all that information without saying anything.” 

 










He continued, “Because it's cinema and the person's face is 70 feet across in the movie theater, that can be often more powerful. We love trying that in all our movies.

Speaking on Death's Design as an opportunity to exemplify craft, Stein said, “What comes for these characters are little insert closeup shots that all connect to each other in this mousetrap Rube Goldberg way, which is so much fun as a filmmaker because it's really the filmmaking that's coming for the characters.”

“It's the way the shots are designed and planned that creates the suspense that leads to the deaths,” he said. “It was such a joy as a director to get to play in that sandbox.”

Bludwurth's farewell speech was original dialogue too, spoken straight from the heart of the actor. Asked about working with Todd, Lipovsky noted the “Candyman” was nothing like his often-menacing character. Stein confirmed that with another spur-of-the-moment story.

“His favorite thing about being on set was meeting his mom and the kid who played the younger self,” Stein said. “They weren't shooting that day, but they came to meet Tony because he so wanted to meet them. He was like, ‘I get to meet my mom today!' It just tickled him so much and he was so excited. He was a little kid.”  

 










From Warner Bros. and New Line, “Final Destination Bloodlines” is now in theaters.

Fans of true-crime shows have undoubtedly come to learn that Netflix features a treasure trove of programming that will satisfy the urge to learn more about some of the most infamous murder cases in history. Their newest hit, Cold Case: The Tylenol Murders, was released yesterday and is already skyrocketing up the charts, taking the #2 slot right behind their dark comedy series Sirens. It's no surprise, really, as the three-part docuseries traces one of the biggest unsolved cases in U.S. history. 

Directed by Yotam Guendelman and Ari Pines, Cole Case: The Tylenol Murders takes an in-depth look at one of America's largest criminal investigations that changed the way pharmaceuticals were distributed. Taking place in the early 80s in Chicago, the case began when several people died from cyanide-laced Tylenol capsules. This led to widespread panic about public health as authorities raced to find a culprit, with the biggest suspect being James William Lewis, who was never charged and died in 2023 at the age of 76. 

Let us be your personal Netflix curators so you can find the kind of shows you'll wish lasted twice as long but can't wait to start over, once again!

While no one was ever caught, the case changed the way that Tylenol and other drugs were forever packaged and distributed. No longer was it as simple as opening up the bottle and shaking a couple of capsules into your hand. Johnson & Johnson introduced tamper-resistant packaging to include induction seals and child-proof caps, and stricter quality control methods were also put in place in factories across the country.

Cold Case: The Tylenol Murders joins another recently-released true-crime documentary in the Top 10 list of TV shows on Netflix, as Fred and Rose West: A British Horror Story still sits in the #8 slot after being released on May 14, 2025. Like The Tylenol Murders, it also stretches across three episodes, and tells the tale of two of the UK's most prolific murderers.

The popularity of these two shows highlights the fact that the true-crime genre as a whole shows no signs of slowing down any time soon. It seems that as soon as a docuseries is released, it immediately climbs the charts as fans flock to get their fix. HBO Max is another great streaming service that offers a lot of content by way of Investigation Discovery, including their newest series, Sherri Papini: Caught In the Lie.

True-crime fans will recall the Papini case being everywhere in 2016 after the young wife and mother disappeared in broad daylight. Appearing three weeks later, she infamously lied to the FBI about being kidnapped, and was later sentenced to 18 months in prison. The case was previously examined last year in the three-part Hulu docuseries Perfect Wife: The Mysterious Disappearance of Sherri Papini.

Needless to say, there's no shortage of true-crime mysteries out there to consume, with Cold Case: The Tylenol Murders being just the latest in a string of shows this year that have been all the talk around the social media water cooler. You can check out the three-part docuseries streaming now on Netflix, but be warned: if you have a headache, it might make you think twice about taking a couple of Tylenol.

Researchers have found fresh evidence that Africa is breaking apart because of a deep mantle superplume of hot rock beneath the East African Rift System.

Researchers have found new evidence that a gigantic superplume of hot rock is rising beneath Africa, causing intense volcanic activity and splitting the continent in two.

Geologists have long known that Africa is slowly breaking apart in a region called the East African Rift System (EARS), but the driving force behind this massive geological process was up for debate. Now, a new study has presented geochemical evidence that a previously theorized superplume is pressing up against — and fracturing — the African crust.

Scientists found that gases at the Meengai geothermal field in central Kenya have a chemical signature that comes from deep inside Earth's mantle, likely from between the bottom of the mantle and the core. The signature matches those of gases found in volcanic rocks to the north, in the Red Sea, and to the south, in Malawi, indicating all of these places are sitting on the same deep mantle rock, according to a statement from the University of Glasgow in Scotland.

"The deep mantle signatures observed in different segments of EARS are remarkably similar, suggesting that they all originate from a common deep source," study first-author Biying Chen, a postdoctoral research associate in the School of Geosciences at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, told Live Science in an email.

The researchers published their findings May 12 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.

EARS is the largest active continental rift system on Earth, ripping through around 2,175 miles (3,500 kilometers) of Africa. The lithosphere, Earth's rocky outer shell of crust and upper mantle, has been gradually breaking apart across the rift for around 35 million years. This has left a network of valleys that carve through the top of the continent from the Red Sea off northeastern Africa to Mozambique in southern Africa.

Previous studies identified signs of a deep mantle plume beneath EARS in noble gas signatures. Noble gases, such as helium and neon, are rare and inert, which means they usually don't chemically react with other substances. As a result, they stick around for a long time, so researchers can use them to trace long-term geological processes. However, Chen noted that these geochemical tracers have been sparse and often controversial beneath EARS.

To help clarify what's going on beneath EARS, the team used high-precision instruments to look for neon (Ne) isotopes in Kenyan gases — and they detected a deep mantle signature. The signature in the gases is very similar to those of the most primordial (ancient) surface signatures in Hawaii, which is also thought to be sitting on a deep mantle plume.

"We were very excited to see the preliminary Ne isotope data showing the primordial deep mantle signature," Chen said. "But the deep mantle signature is small and we had to work hard to disentangle it — truthfully there was no Eureka moment, we frequently questioned the result and spent many hours checking and re-checking the data."

Once the team had rigorously assessed the data, they became confident that the signature was genuine and matched signatures found in other parts of the rift. Chen noted that the EARS plume likely originates from the core-mantle boundary, about 1,800 miles (2,900 km) deep inside the Earth.

While the EARS signatures are similar to those found in volcanic rocks on Hawaii, Chen noted that the Hawaii plume is proposed to be a discrete rising stream of hot mantle, a bit like a lava lamp, while the EARS plume is probably a different shape.

"More likely a large mass of upwelling of hot buoyant material from deep within the Earth has replaced the mantle that was originally beneath the EARS," Chen said. "As it has risen and meets the solid colder lithosphere it spreads out generating enough force to fracture the thin lithosphere, leading to intense volcanic activity in the region."

Around 2,000 years ago, fraternal twin infants were buried facing each other in a cemetery. But it's still unknown why they died.

Nearly 2,000 years ago, fraternal twin infants — one boy and one girl — were buried facing each other in a cemetery in what is now Croatia, a new study finds.

It's unclear why the twins died, but lead poisoning may have played a role, the researchers wrote in a study published in the April issue of the Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports.

"It is one of the very few double burials known in Croatia and is the only double burial of very young individuals in this cemetery," study first author Anna Osterholtz, a bioarchaeologist at Mississippi State University, told Live Science in an email.

The burial ground, known as Dragulin cemetery, was initially excavated in 2016, when construction for a parking lot revealed a handful of ancient stone urns, the researchers wrote in the study. The cemetery is in the modern city of Trogir (Tragurium in Roman times), a UNESCO World Heritage site. This area became a part of the Roman province of Illyricum after Julius Caesar's civil war in 47 B.C.

An investigation into the "short life and death of these siblings" revealed that they were buried sometime between the end of the first and the late second century A.D., the researchers wrote in the study.

An ancient DNA (aDNA) analysis showed that the infants were fraternal twins who were either stillborn or died within two months of their birth.

"The burial posture of both twins suggests that they were important to their family and buried with significant care," Osterholtz said. "This is the first case of fraternal twins from the Roman period in Croatia that has been confirmed via aDNA analysis."

Both individuals showed signs of chronic metabolic disease, or diseases caused by nutritional deficiency (like scurvy or rickets) or the body's inability to utilize nutrients.

Given the twins' young age at death, their nutrition would have come entirely from their mother, either through the placenta in the womb or breast milk after birth. So, it's possible that their metabolic diseases reflected their mother's poor health — meaning she was either malnourished or suffered from a metabolic disease herself.

Another idea is that the twins died from lead poisoning. Lead was pervasive in the Roman world; it was used in pipes and cookware. A lead compound was even used as a sweetener in wine and as a preservative for fruits. The twins' skeletal conditions are consistent with the effects of lead exposure, such as increased bone porosity and periosteal reactions, or new bone formation that happens when bones weakened from lead poisoning are fractured, the researchers wrote in the study. Chronic lead exposure can disrupt metabolic processes like hemoglobin synthesis, sperm production and neural function, and it can also hinder nutrient absorption, which could manifest in both the mother and the developing infants.

"Lead exposure through breast milk is a known cause of elevated infant blood lead levels," Amy Pyle-Eilola, an assistant professor of pathology at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email. "Additionally, there is a known correlation between elevated blood lead and metabolic bone disease in children."

Although the authors did not test the twins' remains for lead, they highlighted several cases of metabolic disorders in Roman-era children with high levels of lead in their teeth whose remains were found near Tragurium.

"So, if the mother had a significant lead exposure, which is a realistic possibility based on studies examining the same general time and location, it is absolutely possible that the lead was passed to the twins during pregnancy and/or via breastmilk, and the resulting elevation in lead could cause the observed bone disease," Pyle-Eilola added.

However, it's hard to know why the twins' health was so poor; there are many other nutritional, genetic and developmental issues that could account for the metabolic bone disease described in this study, Pyle-Eilola said.

The High Court has prevented parties from using voluntary deregistration as a loophole to avoid accountability.

The Australian Electoral Commission's refusal to accept the United Australia Party's re-registration for the 2025 election has been unanimously upheld by the High Court.

The party had voluntarily deregistered after the 2022 election, and their re-registration was blocked to prevent the party from avoiding financial transparency rules for party donations.

Section 135(3) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Cth) says that a party which voluntarily deregistered cannot re-register until after the next federal election, in this case the 2025 election.

Given the looming election, on 12 February, just 5 days after hearing oral arguments, the High Court ruled against the UAP and decided to publish its reasons later. Those oral arguments were covered in this series at the time. The reasons have now been published.

The UAP, represented by Senator Ralph Babet and Clive Palmer, relied on an unlawful burden or limitation on the informed choice of voters and the implied freedom of political communication.

Ironically, while bringing a case based on the ‘informed choice' of voters, the UAP refused to inform the High Court why they de-registered, which several judges called them out for.

Sections 7 and 24 of the Australian Constitution state that Senators and Members must be “directly chosen by the people,” with the “democratic theme of the Constitution” giving rise to the need for a ‘free and informed choice' about the candidates.

Contrasted with that are sections 10 and 31, which allow Parliament to determine all aspects of the electoral process.

The broader implied freedom of political communication limits this power to ensure that voters can engage in the political process and discuss political issues, involving some elements of ‘free speech.' The test for this has been explored in detail in other articles.

Led by the joint judgment of Chief Justice Gageler and Justice Jagot (the remaining judges made individual judgments), the High Court identified several legitimate purposes and upheld the legislation.

The court was also asked to reopen Ruddick v Commonwealth (2022), briefly covered here. There, the AEC gave the Liberal Democrats notice under section 137(1)(ca) that an objection had been raised by the Liberal Party to their registered name.

There, Justices Gordon, Edelman, Steward and Gleeson upheld the provision on a ‘broad' approach that considered it in context, finding that there was no burden on the implied freedom or informed choice, while Chief Justice Kiefel and Justices Keane and Gageler dissented by ruling against it under the ‘narrow' approach of considering just that provision.

Here, all the judges agreed on section 135(3), refused to reopen Ruddick and rejected the implied freedom argument , but the Ruddick split on informed choice was not fully resolved.

The narrow approach

Chief Justice Gageler and Justice Jagot, joined by Justices Gleeson and Beech-Jones, formed the majority.

The joint judgment maintained that the majority in Ruddick was wrong to find that there was no burden on informed choice in that case, and held that there was a “substantial burden” here there was a disadvantage to the voters as the party affiliations of some candidates would be removed. However, there were legitimate purposes for that burden, and the burden was a reasonable one:

Transparency - registered parties have to disclose large political donations and their finances. Without section 135(3), a party could deregister, receive massive non-disclosed donations, and then re-register to spend that money at the next election. Transparency is necessary to keep voters informed.

Avoidance - Under section 136, a party will be deregistered if it does not endorse or nominate a candidate for 4 years. Without section 135(3), voluntary deregistration and then immediate re-registration to ‘reset the clock' defeats the purpose of section 136.

Section 135(3) also prevents parties from deregistering and then reregistering under a similar name to avoid those consequences.

Justice Gleeson, a member of the majority in Ruddick, “readily” accepted a burden on the ‘informed choice' ground. Her Honour agreed with the joint judgment that the “ballot paper can be expected to be an important source of information about party affiliation.”

It was different from Ruddick, because Her Honour argued that similar party names led to confusion for voters. However, despite the burden, section 135(3) was sufficiently narrow in scope to be allowed, especially as it would rarely be relevant

Justice Beech-Jones agreed with the joint judgment about the consequences of ‘obscuring' certain “political viewpoints” by removing some party names and logos, “especially if the law advantaged incumbents.” However, he accepted the above purposes, and added that the deregistration is only limited to one term of Parliament, so isn't disproportionate.

The broad approach

Justices Gordon, Edelman and Steward were members of the majority in Ruddick v Commonwealth, where they held that there was no burden. Here, they maintained their “broad approach” that section 135(3) shouldn't be considered on its own, but as part of the “whole structure” of the legislative scheme, which includes sections 136 and 137.

It should be noted that they recognised the legitimate purposes, but not the narrow approach.

Justice Gordon held that there was a “very slight burden.” The UAP, not the legislation, had affected the informed choice of the voters because the UAP decided to voluntarily de-register. Further, the party's name and logo could still be used “in the parliamentary process, election campaigning and broader political debate.”

Taking a slightly different approach, Justice Edelman said the test was whether the whole “scheme” imposed a burden, and then if that burden changed by removing section 135(3).

Given His Honour's reasoning that there was no burden by the scheme in Ruddick, he identified a “narrow and shallow” burden here.

Justice Steward agreed with Justice Gordon's reasoning, but found no burden whatsoever. His Honour also directly criticised the joint judgment, saying that there is no rule that “the existence of a burden must be measured only from the perspective of the voter.”

The position taken by His Honour and Justice Gordon, which placed the burden on the UAP's actions, was also the Commonwealth's argument.

Although the UAP was unsuccessful, the High Court once again endorsed the implied right to informed choice, separate from the implied freedom of political communication, repeating its stance in Ruddick here.

It's been nearly 52 years since Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker claimed they were abducted by aliens while fishing along the Pascagoula River in Mississippi, and yet another docuseries has been released on the alleged extraterrestrial encounter.

Pascagoula 73, a four-part series now available on Amazon and YouTube, was produced by Danny Weir and written by Weir alongside longtime UFO researcher Philip Mantle. Mantle published two of Parker's books before his death and has done extensive research on arguably the best documented case of its kind.

The docuseries is based on Mantle's book, Pascagoula Uncovered – Witnesses, Files, & Audiotapes, and brings first-hand eyewitness accounts back into the fold, according to a press release. One of the eyewitnesses, Maria Blair, said after her and her husband spotted Hickson and Parker's abduction, she had extraterrestrial experiences of her own. She never spoke about them until sitting down with Mantle.

Previously unheard recordings from the night of and aftermath of Hickson and Parker's experience on Oct. 11, 1973, are included in the docuseries. It looks back at the encounter through Hickson's eyes while emphasizing discussions Parker had with Mantle about how the beings kept contact with him for decades.

“A gripping tale of extraterrestrial encounters, fear, and resilience that changed their lives forever,” a description of Pascagoula 73 reads. “Discover the astonishing 1973 Pascagoula UFO abduction through the eyes of Charles Hickson, an ordinary man thrust into the extraordinary. Taken alongside his friend, he faced terrifying extraterrestrial beings. We chronicle his life after the encounter.

“An 18-year-old Calvin Parker found himself thrust into an unimaginable ordeal. Unlike his older companion Charles Hickson, Calvin was a young man just beginning his adult life when he was suddenly faced with extraterrestrial beings.”

Parker and Hickson, then 42, had just gotten off work on Oct. 11, 1973, when they decided to go fishing at an abandoned shipyard on the west bank of the Pascagoula River. At about 9 p.m., they claimed to have seen a long, football-shaped craft with three aliens or robots levitating in front of them. Suddenly, both felt paralyzed, and the creatures were said to have grabbed them with possibly mitten-shaped or crab-like claws. Some of the creatures were described as having bullet-shaped heads, carrot-like noses and ears, and slits for mouths. Once inside the craft, both men were allegedly examined by a large, robotic eye before being returned to the riverbank.

The two men decided to report what happened to the Jackson County Sheriff's Department. Amid initial skepticism from deputies, a secret recording device was hidden in the room with Hickson and Parker. Both maintained their story even when alone, which along with passing polygraphs, led police to believe something did happen that night. Media then came in droves to the then-sleepy fishing town to cover Hickson and Parker's story, which over a half century later, is still pointed to by UFO junkies as proof that extraterrestrials exist.

The Pascagoula Abduction immediately had an impact with newspapers, radio stations, and TV channels across the globe wanting a piece of Hickson and Parker's tale. While Parker was hesitant to share and moved into life as a recluse, Hickson wanted people to know what happened to him and his fishing partner that night. With the influx of media, the Jackson County Sheriff's Department didn't have enough people on staff to answer all the calls they were receiving. After Hickson did interviews with publications such as Rolling Stone and the Los Angeles Times while going on different national talk shows, the Pascagoula Abduction found its way into pop culture. Movies were made, music was written about it, and soon enough, the event was being talked about in almost every country.

In terms of what impact the Pascagoula Abduction had on UFO believers, the passing of lie detectors by Hickson and Parker allowed them to point to the instance as credible proof that humans have been taken aboard by aliens, The Pascagoula Abduction has also helped erase the negative stigma surrounding belief in aliens as former government officials – including Pentagon intelligence officer David Grusch – have since come forward in asserting the U.S. has knowledge of extraterrestrial life and could even be in possession of alien spacecraft.

What can be learned from the new docuseries?

While a lot of information is already available on the Pascagoula Abduction through articles, interviews, and books, Pascagoula 73 provides never-discussed insight into what happened, according to the press release.

During a Netflix series called Files of the Unexplained, released in 2024, Parker's son Eddie hints at his father being contacted by the aliens in the years following. The latest from Weir and Mantle explores a section of Mantle's book in which Parker discusses the reunions further.

“The book finishes with a final word by Calvin Parker himself who passed away in August 2023. Parker asked the author not to publish this until after he died,” the press release notes. “The whole book is almost like a look back through time to see what happened that night in Pascagoula and how the events unfolded thereafter. And in a stunning revelation, Calvin Parker recounts a previously unknown encounter from 1992 which is published here for the first time.”

Pascagoula 73 also swings the spotlight to another person, who may not be known by the masses. Maria Blair was one of the people claiming to see Parker and Hickson abducted. For the first time, she discloses to Mantle that she also has experience extraterrestrial encounters since the fateful night.

“Maria and her late husband, Jerry, were on the opposite side of the Pascagoula River the night of the Hickson/Parker abduction. The Blairs went on the record to state that they too had an encounter,” the release continued. “A full interview with Maria Blair is published here for the first time.”

The new docuseries on the Pascagoula Abduction can be watched on Amazon and YouTube.

The story, centering on a man who can predict murders, has 'The Gentlemen' producer Ivan Atkinson on board for a feature adaptation.


							By 

	Aaron Couch


Film Editor


	The Kick-Ass team is getting back together, with prolific comic book scribe Mark Millar and artist John Romita Jr. reteaming for the new comic book Psychic Sam.


	The book launches on Kickstarter today, and centers on a man who knows about murders before they happen, with a voice in his head telling him the name and address of future killers.




	“It's about a guy with a big gun who goes out and solves problems. He hears voices in his head that tell him to kill bad guys,” Millar says in a video announcing the comic. “The only trouble is, the bad guys haven't done anything yet. But every time he ignores it, someone innocent dies. It's only a matter of time before the bodies pile up.”

	Millar and Romita struck gold 15 years ago with Kick-Ass, the comic that centered on a regular teenager who decided to become a vigilante, despite having no powers and no special skills. The zeitgeisty book spawned the hit 2010 movie that helped establish Mathew Vaughn as an in-demand director in the comic book space.


	Now, the pair hope to repeat the success, with producer Ivan Atkinson coming aboard to develop Psychic Sam as a feature. Atkinson is known for his work with Guy Ritchie, producing films such as The Gentlemen and Wrath of Man. If the movie comes to fruition, it'd be the latest in a string of Millar titles to hit the big screen, with Wanted and Kingsman also on the list. Meanwhile, his genre-breaking 2000s work at Marvel on The Ultimates and Civil War helped inspire the Marvel Cinematic Universe.


Psychic Sam is noteworthy for Millar, as it does not fall under Netflix, where he has been exclusive since 2017, when the streaming giant purchased his company Millarworld in a splashy deal that brought titles to the screen such as Jupiter's Legacy and The Chosen One. Millar says Psychic Sam will not affect his output at the Netflix-owned Millarworld, with books still slated through 2026. 


	Millar says the desire to do Psychic Sam came after receiving offers from Marvel to do a big summer event series, ala Civil War, as well as from DC, to take on a big Superman project. Instead, he carved out 12 weeks at the end of last year to write the project.


	With the Kickstarter now live, Millar and Romita are offering a number of incentives, including the chance to be drawn into the book. Said Romita in the video announcing the project: “I have to do justice to all of you.”

	A trailer for the feature, entitled "Holiguards," was shown in Cannes.

Kevin Spacey has directed his first feature film in more than 20 years. 


Variety understands that the two-time Oscar winning actor — who fell from grace in Hollywood following multiple accusations of sexual misconduct — has directed a supernatural action-thriller in which he stars alongside Dolph Lundgren (“Rocky IV,” The Expendables”), Tyrese Gibson (the “Fast & Furious” franchise, “Morbius”), Brianna Hildebrand (“Deadpool,” “Lucifer”), Disha Patani (“Kalki 2898 AD,” “Bharat”) and Eric Roberts (“Runaway Train,” “The Righteous Gemstones”).

	The indie film, which has the working title of “Holiguards,” is planned to be the first in a franchise known as “Statiguards vs. Holiguards” and also stars Harry Goodwins (“The Gentlemen”), Swen Temmel (“The Clean Up Crew”) and Sonia Pim Couling (“Operation Bloodhunt”). It also marks the first feature to be produced by Elledgy Media, owned by Portugal-based Ukrainian entrepreneur Elvira Gavrilova Paterson.


	As per the description, “Holiguards” is set against the backdrop of a near-future world fractured by hidden supernatural forces, where two ancient warrior factions — the Holiguards and the Statiguards — wage a secret war for control of humanity's fate. Amid this conflict, a young woman discovers that she's the daughter of two rival leaders and could end the conflict. Meanwhile, a Statiguard strategist prepares a catastrophic attack in Paris using a nuclear device and an army of mind-controlled civilians, channeling energy from a cosmic portal to awaken an ancient force known as the Prime. 


	The film, which has a budget of around $10 million, shot in Mexico last year and is now in post-production. Elledgy Media Group produces “Holiguards” alongside Lado Film. Producers include Paterson, Vadim Vadim Degtyarev and Vitaly Kucherov. The script was written by Sergey Torchilin and Lado Okhotnikov. Variety hears a trailer was being screened to potential interested parties at this year's Cannes Film Festival. 


	It was actually in Cannes where Spacey made his boldest return to the limelight since his career nosedived in the wake of the MeToo scandal, and since he was found not guilty of multiple allegations of sexual misconduct in a high-profile court trial in 2023. The actor — whose last trip to the south of France during the festival was in 2016 — hit the carpet at several events, most notably the amfAR gala dinner and also the Better World Fund gala, where he was given a lifetime achievement award and, in a fiery 10-minute speech, took aim at his own blacklisting from Hollywood, declaring that it was “nice to be back.”

	











	“Holiguards” wasn't the only film of Spacey's in Cannes. The actor was also in town to help promote the British indie “The Awakening,” a conspiracy action-thriller in which he appears as the head of sinister global cabal that controls the world, which was selling in the market.

Authorities investigating a strange sphere that could be a UFO

Residents of Buga, Colombia were minding their business when the sky decided to drop a plot twist right into their backyard: a mysterious metallic sphere with no explanation, no owner, and absolutely no chill.

This thing landed like a statement piece. Now, authorities are investigating, scientists are scratching their heads, and the internet is doing what we does best: losing our damned minds.

In early 2025, residents of Buga (a small city in western Colombia) spotted a blue metallic orb flying overhead. There was no sonic boom, no fiery trail, no “ET phone home”… just a solid sphere falling quietly, like it missed its spaceship's last stop and bailed.

When authorities recovered it, they found a basketball-sized object weighing around 4.5 pounds, with no visible seams, welds, screws, or panels. Just bowling ball smooth. Like it had been forged by gravity-defying space elves or printed by a 3D printer from the year 3047.

Inside, X-rays revealed a cluster of 18 smaller spheres arranged neatly around a central chip. That's either:

Adding to the weirdness, the sphere was reportedly cold to the touch, and had ancient-looking symbols etched around the surface —some said runes, others said Mesopotamian, and one guy on Reddit swore it was a message from Atlantis.

Naturally, the word UFO got tossed around faster than conspiracy theories in a Facebook comment thread. After all, it's 2025. We've had Congressional hearings on unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). We've had former Air Force officials claim the U.S. is reverse-engineering recovered “craft.” So yeah, the public is primed for mystery or, at the very least, a good plot twist.

But while the sphere looks like it belongs in a sci-fi museum, there's nothing (yet) to prove it's from another world. No propulsion system, no energy signature, no attempt to abduct anyone's livestock.

Enter Dr. Julia Mossbridge, physicist, biophysicist, and potential buzzkill—unless she's right. “It looks to me like a really cool art project,” she said. The materials, the perfect shape, the “symbolic” interior—all of it screams conceptual installation with a hint of techno-mysticism.

Her argument? If it's art, then it's doing exactly what art's supposed to do: make you question your reality, your place in the universe, and what kind of budget modern artists have these days.

“If an artist is doing this, why?” she asked. “Because we're learning we don't understand what's in our skies. Or in our backyards, apparently.”

Of course, not all theories require aliens or artists. Some require only a little caffeine and a love of absurd math. What if —and hear us out— this sphere is just the tip of a giant BIC pen?

We ran the numbers. A regular BIC pen tip is about 0.7 mm wide. If this sphere (about 24.6 cm in diameter) is the ballpoint scaled up… the pen would be 52 meters long. That's 172 feet. That's a skyscraper-sized pen. Imagine the kind of galactic bureaucracy that requires that much ink.

We call it: BIC Titan™ — Made to Sign Treaties from Orbit.

Right now, the Colombian government hasn't ruled anything out—or in. They're running tests, scanning materials, and trying to figure out who, if anyone, wants to claim responsibility.

No agency has stepped forward to say, “Oops, that's ours.” No companies, no defense contractors, not even an anonymous Banksy-type artist trying to cash in on the viral moment. Just crickets, confusion, and conspiracy threads.

Until someone fesses up, or it starts glowing and sending GPS coordinates, the Buga Sphere will remain part of that wonderful category of modern phenomena: “unexplained, weird, and kind of beautiful.”

Scientists in Colombia are currently studying a mysterious sphere, dubbed the Buga Sphere, believed by some to be an unidentified flying object (UFO). The object was spotted flying over Buga, in the Valle del Cauca department of western Colombia, on March 2 and was later recovered in the area. The sphere's unusual characteristics have sparked global attention and fueled speculation about its origins.Researcher Jose Luis Velasquez, who inspected the object, noted that it shows no welds or joints, features that would typically indicate human manufacturing. "It is a very rare piece ... I've never seen a piece like this," Velazquez said, according to People magazine. He and his team conducted X-ray scans on the sphere and discovered it consisted of three metal-like layers and contained nine microspheres in its interior.  Velazquez believes that the lack of welds or joints bolsters the theory of the sphere's extraterrestrial origin. He added that the sphere appears to have mysterious symbols carved on its surface. Witnesses reported seeing the orb floating erratically in the sky, zigzagging before crashing near a forest. These observations have led some to conclude that the object could be a UFO.Dr. Julia Mossbridge, a member of the University of San Diego Department of Physics and Biophysics and the founder of the Institute for Love and Time (TILT), expressed skepticism about the sphere's origins. "It looks so human made to me," she told Fox News. Mossbridge suspects the Buga Sphere might be a piece of artwork rather than an object of alien technology. Advertisement"It looks to me like a really cool art project," Mossbridge said, advising against jumping to conclusions too quickly. She urged thorough vetting before declaring anomalies in mysterious discoveries. "Before you decide something's anomalous or a UFO, bring the object to a group like the Galileo Project," she suggested, referring to the international research initiative founded by Harvard University astrophysicist Avi Loeb, which aims to rigorously study potential extraterrestrial artifacts.Mossbridge framed the mysterious object as part of a bigger picture in which humanity must confront its own limitations. "We are entering a time when we don't have the control that we thought we had," she noted. She explained that prior grandiose beliefs in total mastery blind society when "something shows up that doesn't fit our model of the world." The physicist emphasized the importance of using non-governmental, non-partisan research groups like the Galileo Project and the Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies to investigate such phenomena. "They are all trying to get rigorous information themselves, not necessarily waiting on the federal government, about what's going on in our skies, what's going on in our waters, and actually trying to get international cooperation around these things," Mossbridge told Fox News.

So, what are the rules about how we deal with something that's interesting that's found there?" she asked.While the sphere is currently being studied by researchers in Mexico, the next steps for identifying its origin remain unclear.The Pentagon and NASA have recently addressed the topic of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP). A November 2022 report from the Pentagon documented numerous instances where balloons, birds, and satellites were mistakenly identified as UAPs. Similarly, a NASA report in 2023 concluded that most UAPs are likely attributable to balloons, aircraft, or sunlight reflections, rather than evidence of extraterrestrial life.  Officials at the Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), established in 2022 to track UAPs, have stated there is no evidence suggesting that any cases they examined have extraterrestrial origins. Federal efforts to investigate UAPs have prioritized potential risks to national security and air safety rather than delving into theories about their origins.Despite her skepticism about the Buga Sphere, Mossbridge acknowledged the significance of continued inquiry into unexplained phenomena. "Frankly, we've been looking at UAPs for decades, and the federal government has admitted that there are things that we don't understand, but we are investigating them," she said.Mossbridge believes that such mysteries can have a unifying effect on humanity. "When people start focusing on something that's bigger than us, it really powerfully changes behavior for the better," she said according to Newsweek."As humans, we want to feel safe, so we want to say this is how things work," Mossbridge said. "It's a real trick of just noticing how human psychology works and allowing ourselves to know everything. The safest thing we can do is try to discover what's true."

"Frankly, we've been looking at UAPs for decades, and the federal government has admitted that there are things that we don't understand, but we are investigating them," she said.Mossbridge believes that such mysteries can have a unifying effect on humanity. "When people start focusing on something that's bigger than us, it really powerfully changes behavior for the better," she said according to Newsweek."As humans, we want to feel safe, so we want to say this is how things work," Mossbridge said. "It's a real trick of just noticing how human psychology works and allowing ourselves to know everything. The safest thing we can do is try to discover what's true."




Dr. Julia Mossbridge, a member of the University of San Diego Department of Physics and Biophysics and the founder of the Institute for Love and Time (TILT), expressed skepticism about the sphere's origins. "It looks so human made to me," she told Fox News. Mossbridge suspects the Buga Sphere might be a piece of artwork rather than an object of alien technology. Advertisement"It looks to me like a really cool art project," Mossbridge said, advising against jumping to conclusions too quickly. She urged thorough vetting before declaring anomalies in mysterious discoveries. "Before you decide something's anomalous or a UFO, bring the object to a group like the Galileo Project," she suggested, referring to the international research initiative founded by Harvard University astrophysicist Avi Loeb, which aims to rigorously study potential extraterrestrial artifacts.Mossbridge framed the mysterious object as part of a bigger picture in which humanity must confront its own limitations. "We are entering a time when we don't have the control that we thought we had," she noted. She explained that prior grandiose beliefs in total mastery blind society when "something shows up that doesn't fit our model of the world." The physicist emphasized the importance of using non-governmental, non-partisan research groups like the Galileo Project and the Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies to investigate such phenomena. "They are all trying to get rigorous information themselves, not necessarily waiting on the federal government, about what's going on in our skies, what's going on in our waters, and actually trying to get international cooperation around these things," Mossbridge told Fox News.

Local fiction: Megan Giddings' “Meet Me at the Crossroads” is about a family and two sisters who make wildly different choices.

By Chris Hewitt

In her “Meet Me at the Crossroads” Megan Giddings thanks people you'd expect a writer to acknowledge, including readers and University of Minnesota English department colleagues V.V. Ganeshananthan and Julie Schumacher. There's also at least one you might not expect: an Uber driver.

That driver, who drove the creative writing and literature professor to a New Orleans bar, claimed to be a psychic. She told Giddings personal things that left her shaken.

The psychic also gave Giddings the ending of “Crossroads,” a speculative fiction novel about twins who are faced with the appearance of a mysterious door near their Michigan home (Giddings' editor compares it to Carl Sagan's bestselling “Contact”). Olivia passes through the door and possibly into another world. The other twin, Ayanna, spends years struggling with the disappearance of her sister.

Giddings, 40, and husband Jon Cameron live in Minneapolis. We chatted about her third novel (the others are “Lakewood,” one of New York magazine's 10 best books of 2020, and “The Women Could Fly”). We began with that crazy car ride:

Q: No spoilers but the book ends with a scene in which Ayanna's ride-share driver conveys a key message to her. That happened in real life?

A: Yes. In New Orleans, this woman started telling me things, some a little vague and some uncomfortably like what was going on in my life at the time. She was a nurse and apparently a psychic — this is the most New Orleans thing I can think of — and she kept saying that someone had a message for me, someone from the other side. It was so unnerving.

Q: You knew right away you were going to use it?

A: I still have no idea how to interpret what went down but I realized, “This is the next book.” There's only one other moment in my fiction that is drawn so directly from real life. But I knew, “This is something I'm going to use.” It happened in 2021 and I was just finishing up “The Women Could Fly.”

Q: You grabbed a notebook and started writing stuff down?

A: I posted about it on social media. I immediately told people at dinner about it. The other thing is my husband was in the Uber, too, and he was like, “What the [expletive]?” I was saying, “That really happened, didn't it? I didn't have some complete break from reality?” And he said, “Yeah, that was the craziest Uber ride I've ever had in my life.” It's also the only Uber ride where the driver hugged me. I was crying. It was an emotional situation.

Q: Did you give a good tip?

No Section

No Section

No Section

A: Oh, 25% tip. Five stars. “Thank you for finishing my future book. Thank you for making me feel weird for three days.”

Q: What did you want to accomplish with “Crossroads”?

A: I knew for a long time I wanted to write about two things. A number of my friends were having kids and were really worried about, “How do I teach my kid to be a good person? How do I give them a foundation of caring about other people?” Even my own roots — I was raised strictly Catholic and I have really mixed feelings about having faith now but I can see that there's where I learned even to want to care about other people, which is one thing I'm really grateful for.

Q: You said there were two things?

A: I was interested in writing about my fear of death and the unknown. I thought by the time I was 35 or 40 I would feel less lost, or the world would make more sense, but I think it's gotten even more inexplicable.

Q: The idea of being a good person really comes through. I counted 79 uses of the word “kindness” in the book.

A: It's been interesting to see it called a coming-of-age novel. I have some hesitations around that but if it's a coming-of-age novel about learning to be kind in an unkind world, and that's part of the progress to being an adult, that would make me really happy.

Q: That's probably even trickier for young people who are, like you, Black. The sisters in the book are Black, too, and its treatment of race feels very subtle. Can you speak about that?

A: I get a lot of pleasure out of them but a lot of the books that get published seem to be catered to the idea that the primary concern of being a Black person is being a Black person in a country that doesn't want Black people. They are important and necessary — I get sent so many books that are Black horror or speculative fiction that deal with repercussions of race. They're often very good. But I felt like there's not always room for fun or kindness or thinking deeply about living a long life.

Q: And we should say it is a really funny book. What was the hardest part to get right?

A: The ending. And, also, all of it.

Q: Say more about that, please.

A: A lot of books, especially around death or kindness themes, can be scolding. I felt like the book should feel comfortable, like you're being invited in to think about all of these things, so there were times I had to work really hard not to scold. I changed a lot of my diction to feel more informal and I tried to emphasize play, have jokes.

Q: You've said the writing of your books often overlaps. Did that happen here?

A: Very slowly. I'm doing research and writing very poorly. But it is nice to be thinking about the next one.

Q: And now you know that if you get stuck, all you have to do is go to New Orleans and hop in an Uber?

A: I'll email and let you know if she ever gives me a new book.

Astrology, tarot cards and seances are not often associated with the pragmatism and sobriety of the Royal Family.

But Princess Diana - in moments of personal crisis - often turned to the spiritual realm for reassurance, cramming her diary with appointments in the late 1980s and 90s.

Andrew Morton wrote in the authorised biography Diana Her True Story: 'When she first began investigating the possibilities of the spiritual world, Diana was very open, almost too open, to belief.

'She was so much at sea in her world that she clutched at any prediction, in the way that a drowning man clutches at flotsam.'

But a former palace official told royal author Sally Bedell Smith that this was a 'cry for help'. 

Diana was first encouraged to speak with a spiritual advisor by Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York.

In 1986, the couple referred Diana, tortured over her failing marriage to Prince Charles and the pressures of royal life, to astrologer Penny Thornton.

'I just wanted to see,' she told Thornton, 'if there is light at the end of the tunnel.'

Diana began seeing psychic Betty Palko, naturopath Roderick Lane, celebrity psychic Sally Morgan, astrologer Debbie Frank, clairvoyant Vasso Kortesis, medium Rita Rogers and homeopathic dowser healer Jack Temple.

Morton wrote that Prince Charles, who himself is known for his interest in holistic medicine and philosophy, was not supportive of Diana's many spiritual appointments.

He said: 'When Charles saw her reading a book called Facing Death while she was on holiday he asked her bluntly what she was doing wasting her time reading about all those issues.'

Diana became close friends with San Lorenzos restaurant owners Lorenzo and Mara Berni, who Morton wrote 'had a reputation of an Indian earth mother'.

They encouraged Diana's interest in astrology, tarot cards and 'other realms of alternative metaphysics such as clairvoyance and hypnotism'.

It was around this time that Diana was introduced to Debbie Frank who - as Morton wrote - 'combines general counselling and analysis concerning the present and the future as they relate to the conjunction of planets appropriate to Diana's birth time and date'. 

'Born under the sign of Cancer, Diana has many qualities typical of that sign: protective, tenacious, emotionally attuned and nurturing.

'As her confidence in herself grew, Diana started to see these methods of self-analysis and forecast as tools and guides rather than as a lifeline to gab on to.'

As depicted in season six of The Crown, Diana and Dodi visited psychic Rita Rogers - one of the UK's best-known mediums just weeks before they died in the fatal car crash in Paris.

They were put in touch by a mutual friend in 1994, and Rogers did an initial reading over the phone before they met in person.

'You couldn't pull the wool over Diana's eyes,' she said.

'She could spot a fraud from 20 paces, and would have quickly sussed me if I hadn't been genuine.'

Christopher Andersen, author of The King, said: 'Over the years Diana went through a revolving door supply of astrologers, faith healers, numerologists, tarot card readers, clairvoyants, psychics, and 'spiritual advisors.

'Most told her what she already knew: that her husband was cheating on her with his old flame.'

Bodyguard Ken Wharfe agreed. 'Diana was in the thrall of all these mad psychics,' he told Tina Brown in The Diana Chronicles.

At the inquest into Diana's death it was noted that Diana's reliance on spiritual advisors offered companionship and a sense of comfort during a difficult time - but also fueled her paranoia. 

The inquest heard Diana was obsessed with clairvoyants - including one she dubbed 'Fergie's witchwoman', whose identity was not revealed.

Mr Jephson, a former lieutenant commander in the Royal Navy, worked for Diana between 1990 and 1996.

He said he was worried that she put so much faith in astrologers and soothsayers because this 'fed the paranoia that never lurked far beneath the surface'.

By the time of her Panorama interview in 1995, he said, Diana 'saw plots everywhere', even claiming that someone had taken a 'pot-shot' at her with a gun in Hyde Park.

'Needless to say, I had all the accusations checked out, but the threats were, as I had known all along, all in her imagination.'

The psychic bloodline of the royal family can be dated back to the days of Queen Victoria. 

Rogers said: 'You couldn't pull the wool over Diana's eyes. She could spot a fraud from 20 paces, and would have quickly sussed me if I hadn't been genuine'

Occult expert J.H. Brennan claimed that Queen Victoria, who reigned from 1837 to 1901, was 'fascinated by spiritualism' and would invite mediums to Buckingham Palace and hold seances

In his book Whisperers: The Secret History of the Spirit World, occult expert J.H. Brennan claimed that Victoria, who reigned from 1837 to 1901, was 'fascinated by spiritualism' and would invite mediums to Buckingham Palace and hold seances.

Brennan also claimed that Victoria's servant John Brown, whom she was rumoured to have a romantic relationship with, actually acted as a medium to help her channel the spirit of her beloved late husband, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.

Many other members of the Royal Family, such as the Queen Mother, the late Queen and Prince Philip have also reportedly attended seances and other investigations into the paranormal.

In the documentary The King of UFOs, paranormal historian Richard Felix claimed that Queen Elizabeth II attended a seance in 1953 hoping to connect with her then-recently deceased father. 

The queen's mother, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, sister, Princess Margaret, and husband, Prince Philip, were also reportedly in attendance. 

Last year Diana's former butler revealed that the late royal haunts his mansion in Cheshire and that the late Queen also believed in the supernatural.

Paul Burrell started working in Charles and Diana's royal household in 1987 and was the Princess's personal butler until her death in 1997.

He was having his home inspected by a group of ghost hunters on an episode of Celebrity Help! My House is Haunted when he made the claims.

Prince Harry wrote about exploring the occult to feel connected to his late mother.  

In his memoir Spare he said that he once sought help from a woman who claimed to have powers to connect with his late mother.

'Your mother says that you are living the life that she couldn't live,' Harry recalled the woman telling him. 

'You're living the life she wanted for you.'
