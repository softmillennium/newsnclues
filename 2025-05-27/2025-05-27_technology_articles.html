                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If and when AI will start replacing human labor has been the subject of numerous debates. Researchers at SignalFire, a data-driven VC firm that tracks job movements of over 600 million employees and 80 million companies on LinkedIn, believe they may be seeing first signs of AI's impact on hiring. Specifically, SignalFire found that Big Tech companies reduced the hiring of new graduates by 25% in 2024 compared to 2023. Meanwhile, graduate recruitment at startups decreased by 11% compared to the prior year. Although SignalFire wouldn't reveal exactly how many fewer grads were hired according to their data, a spokesperson told us it was thousands. While adoption of new AI tools might not fully explain the dip in recent grad hiring, Asher Bantock, SignalFire's head of research, says there's “convincing evidence” that AI is a significant contributing factor. Entry-level jobs are susceptible to automation because they often involve routine, low-risk tasks that generative AI handles well. AI's new coding, debugging, financial research, and software installation abilities could mean companies need fewer people to do that type of work. AI's ability to handle certain entry-level tasks means some jobs for new graduates could soon be obsolete. Gabe Stengel, the founder of AI financial analyst startup Rogo, started his career at Lazard investment bank where he helped large pharma companies buy biotech startups. While most large investment banks haven't explicitly reduced analyst hiring due to AI yet, executives at firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley previously considered cutting junior staff hires by up to two-thirds and lowering the pay of those they hire because the work with AI is not as demanding as before, the New York Times reported last year. “AI won't take your job if you're the one who's best at using it,” she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Self-driving truck startup TuSimple (now CreateAI) sent a trove of sensitive data — effectively the blueprint of an American-made autonomous vehicle system — to a Beijing-owned firm after committing to the U.S. government that it would cease such transfers under a national security agreement, according to The Wall Street Journal. The transfers to Chinese truck manufacturer Foton happened around February 2022, just a week after TuSimple signed the agreement in which U.S. regulators ordered the company to separate its business and technology from China-based employees and partners with firewalls and governance controls. And it's not just data that TuSimple has been trying to get across the border. That drama is still unfolding as one of TuSimple's co-founders, Xiaodi Hou, fights in court for control over his voting shares so he can push for liquidation of the company. TuSimple started as a China-backed startup founded in 2015 by Hou and Lu Chen, an entrepreneur with ties to Sina Corp. It quickly became an autonomous vehicle industry favorite, managing to raise around $2 billion from a mixture of Chinese and U.S.-based heavy hitters, and was one of the first in the U.S. to successfully complete a fully driverless run on public highways. The Journal's reporting sheds light on a previously reported controversy regarding Hydron, a Chinese hydrogen trucking startup founded by Chen, which shared an office with TuSimple China. Through a combination of emails, Slack messages, and video calls, TuSimple sent partners technical instructions for server dimensions, brake designs, sensors, steering, power supply, and chips, per the Journal. Employees also routinely downloaded autonomy source code developed by their American counterparts. As geopolitical tensions and competition with China rise, TuSimple's ties are serving as a cautionary tale for Washington that has helped drive a shift in U.S. policy, prompting stricter rules on Chinese-linked tech deals and fueling a broader push to block high-risk transactions outright.

There's not a lot about the upcoming AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT that remains a mystery after AMD's launch presentation, and its AIB partner boards being displayed all over Computex. However, Slovakia-based tech site HW Cooling recently enjoyed a Gigabyte factory tour, where they managed to snap a nice, clear shot of an upcoming RX 9060 XT graphics card PCB. There are lots of other interesting photos and details, too, if you care to check their full story. Gigabyte has announced four RX 9060 XT SKUs so far. Refocusing on the image, we saw the diminutive Navi 44 GPU in the flesh at Computex, so that isn't new, but we can see it here where it should be, flanked by a quartet of GDDR6 memory chips from SK hynix at 12 o'clock and three o'clock. As we don't know whether this is the 8GB or 16GB Gigabyte RX 9060 XT Gaming PCB, we aren't sure whether there are another four VRAM chips installed on the other side of the PCB. Above and to the right of the central GPU and VRAM area, Gigabyte has placed a single 8-pin power connector. AMD's decision to feature only three display outputs, as you can see on the left side of this photo, hasn't been warmly welcomed, though. If you are a practical type, more interested in things like performance, availability, and pricing, we only have AMD's cherry-picked performance slides for now, and have been advised of MSRPs of $299 and $349 for the 8GB and 16GB versions of this card, respectively. “Wide availability” is officially touted by AMD for June 5 – a week on Thursday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ASRock alleges that these problems have been fixed with their latest BIOS release. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. A common thread among increasing user reports of failing Ryzen 9000 CPUs was their connection to an ASRock AM5 motherboard. Citing a conversation with the partner at Computex, Tech Yes City has brought to light that ASRock's initial PBO (Precision Boost Overdrive) presets were set too aggressively for initial CPU samples. AMD declined to comment on the story, while ASRock wasn't immediately available. Earlier this year, reports of failing AMD Ryzen 9000 (Granite Ridge) processors were common on Reddit and other forums. Affected users had no other choice but to RMA their broken CPUs. Precision Boost Overdrive employs an algorithm that dynamically adjusts clock speeds for peak performance, based on factors like temperature, power, current, and workload. The issue is reportedly confined to ASRock's high-end and mid-range boards, as they were tuned far too aggressively for Ryzen 9000 CPUs. Does this imply initial silicon was less stable than what we're getting now? ASRock reportedly ruled out memory incompatibility and excessive SoC voltages as potential causes, the latter of which has a history of wrecking last-generation Ryzen 7000 (Raphael) CPUs. Liquid coolers and AIOs are said to compound this problem, as they provide greater thermal headroom for PBO. Per the YouTuber, ASRock has fixed this issue with a new BIOS update. While preliminary testing reveals no difference in EDC and TDC values, ASRock has also reportedly reduced "shadow voltages," which are settings not visible to users. Questions also emerge from ASRock's media representative initially dismissing user reports as 'misinformation'. While we've requested further comment on the matter, ASRock should release a public advisory urging users to update their BIOS to prevent potential failures, if that indeed is the necessary fix.

The proposed deal involves Hygon absorbing Sugon shares in a stock-swap agreement. To give this merger some context, regular Tom's Hardware readers will be aware that Hygon chips leverage the AMD Zen processor architecture. However, the firm says it has moved on from those days. Our previous reports on Sugon made clear its existing close relationship with Hygon. In recent years, the supercomputer maker leaned heavily on Hygon x86 chips to develop high-performance platforms. Entity List, which means they can't get direct access to chips from U.S. suppliers such as AMD, Intel, and Nvidia. Naturally, the pairing, in their new clothes, will be treated similarly by U.S. policymakers. However, that will likely be of little concern to the newly formed vertically integrated Chinese supercomputing giant. The U.S. trade measures might have drawn them inexorably together. Consolidation in the Chinese semiconductor and computing sectors has previously been forecast by analysts. This newly merged company looks like a sure-fire success, with the Chinese political will to build a formidable high-performance computing infrastructure to drive its domestic AI and big data projects.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. Finding the right tent for a backpacking trip is always tricky. I've always erred on the side of a sturdy tent over any weight concerns, which is why I love the Hilleberg Akto, but I don't always need the Akto. There is a short season in my neck of the woods called summer, when storms are less likely and temps don't drop much below the 60s. This is when I've been using the Lunar Solo, Six Moon Design's flagship ultralight one-person tent. After several late and early summer trips around the north woods of Wisconsin and Michigan, it has proved itself a capable shelter. It weighs just 2 pounds, packs down quite small, and checks a whole lot of other boxes on my tent wish list. There is no one tent to rule them all, and trying to find one is a mistake. Which is to say, I love the Akto, but I also think Six Moon Design's Lunar Solo is excellent for summer trips when you prize traveling light over withstanding intense storms. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. That's not to say the Lunar Solo won't keep you dry. The silicone nylon, or silnylon, is plenty waterproof, though you'll either need to seam-seal it yourself with some Seam Grip, or have the Six Moon Designs team do it for you before they ship it, which costs $35. The Lunar Solo is single-wall, single-pole tent intended to be pitched with a trekking pole. This makes for a very small and light tent but also has two potential drawbacks: structural integrity and condensation. Once pitched, the Lunar Solo offers 26 square feet of living space and a peak height of 49 inches, and the vestibule offers 8.5 square feet of additional gear storage. Overall I found the Lunar Solo to be plenty spacious for one person with gear. The rear wall expands out slightly, giving you a place to stash frequently needed items without pushing them up against the tent wall. The 20D silnylon and mesh walls feel as durable as anything you'll find at this weight, unless you want to go with a Cuben Fiber/Dyneema tent, but to my mind the high price of Cuben puts it in a different category. The floor of the Lunar Solo is a more robust 40-denier (40D), and has a bathtub shape to help ensure water doesn't get in. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Any single pole tent is going to struggle in wind, no matter how many guyline points it offers. I did find the Lunar Solo compressed a good deal when I pitched it in high winds on the exposed shores of Lake Superior. It was admittedly not a great campsite from a seeking-shelter point of view, not one I would pick if I wasn't testing the wind resistance of a tent. I eventually made a more robust pole from a couple of thicker (albeit, heavier) pole segments I had lying around. Most backpackers will use trekking poles to pitch the Lunar Solo, which will provide a much stronger pitch. It's important you pitch the Lunar Solo correctly, which is a little tricky at first. I highly suggest practicing in ideal conditions before you hit the trail so you can get a feel for it without the added stress of rain. Six Moon Designs has some instructions on its site, which I highly recommend reading. The method I found that works best is to stake out the three rear stakes to form a nice taut triangle. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. This will make the Lunar Solo much stronger. The Lunar Solo is what Six Moon Designs calls a hybrid single-wall tent. Condensation happens in all tents to varying degrees depending on conditions, but single-wall tents put the condensation on the wall you're going to touch, making the consequences considerably higher. Waking up with water dripping on your face, or in a sleeping bag that's been rendered a sopping mess by condensation, is no fun. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Unfortunately, whether all this is enough to eliminate condensation depends entirely on the conditions you're in. I did not have a huge issue with condensation in the Lunar Solo, save one scenario—wind after a rain. I carried a small microfiber towel which I used to wipe off condensation in the mornings, and for the most part this kept things under control. One night last fall though, it rained for hours and then the wind picked up and shook a good bit of condensation off the tent walls onto me and my sleeping bag. The nearest competitor is probably the Zpacks Plex Solo Lite, which has a very similar design but is made of Dyneema Composite Fabrics (DCF) and more than twice the price. I much prefer the packability and relative silence of silnylon. I have spent a few nights in an older model, but the X-Mid 1 was recently redesigned with 15D walls, and a slightly larger interior. The X-Mid 1 is a double-walled tent, which I consider an advantage, but it does require two poles and the max height is only 41 inches to the Lunar Solo's 49 inches. The Lunar Solo is tough to beat, though I do wish Six Moon Designs would use heavier zippers. I'd happily carry a couple extra ounces to have more robust zippers. The mesh front wall does limit it more to summer trips, but the Lunar Solo is a great option for those who want to travel light in the backcountry.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hyperscalers and data center developers are in a pickle: They all want to add computing power tomorrow, but utilities frequently play hard to get, citing years-long waits for grid connections. “All the AI data centers are struggling to get connected,” Amit Narayan, founder and CEO of Gridcare, told TechCrunch. That has led many data centers to pursue what's called “behind the meter” power sources — basically, they build their own power plants, a costly endeavor that hints at just how desperate they are for electricity. But Narayan knew there was plenty of slack in the system, even if utilities themselves haven't discovered it yet. He has studied the grid for the last 15 years, first as a Stanford researcher then as a founder of another company. Narayan said that Gridcare, which has been operating in stealth, has already discovered several places where extra capacity exists, and it's ready to play matchmaker between data centers and utilities. Gridcare recently closed an oversubscribed $13.5 million seed round, the company told TechCrunch. It also layers on other details, including the availability of fiber optic connections, natural gas, water, extreme weather, permitting, and community sentiment around data center construction and expansion. To make sure it's not running afoul of regulations, Gridcare then takes that data and weighs it against federal guidelines that dictate grid usage. At the same time, Gridcare works with hyperscalers and data center developers to identify where they are looking to expand operations or build new ones. We know the parameters under which they can operate,” he said. Gridcare sells its services to data center developers, charging them a fee based on how many megawatts of capacity the startup can unlock for them. For some data centers, the price of admission might be forgoing grid power for a few hours here and there, relying on on-site backup power instead. For others, the path might be clearer if their demand helps green-light a new grid-scale battery installation nearby. Utilities have already approached Gridcare inquiring about auctioning access to newfound capacity. Update: Corrected spare capacity on the grid to gigawatts from megawatts.

Earlier today, Panasonic announced refreshed models of its long-established Let's Note laptop series. However, for the first time in its history, we have a Let's Note portable that doesn't have a VGA port. According to a report by Nikkei Japan (machine translation), this is probably the beginning of the end for laptops sporting VGA output, with “other companies to follow suit.” We also see that the new Panasonic Let's Note CF-SC6 models feature a pair of Thunderbolt 4 ports, which can also be used for video out. That's three separate ports remaining on the Let's Note to drive external displays. Another disadvantage of VGA highlighted was that it is a rather bulky port for thin and light designs like the Let's Note. At the refreshed laptop product launch today, size and weight were confirmed to be key considerations driving forward Panasonic's consumer designs. The newest Let's Note laptop is just 919g in its 12-inch edition, and Panasonic Connect Executive Officer Kiyotaka Yamamoto said, "In addition to durability and long operating times, we will continue to focus on reducing the weight by even one gram." Moreover, a university professor it talked to indicated that turning to VGA can often be the answer when connection problems with HDMI occur. This analog output doesn't support as high resolutions and refresh rates as its modern rivals, of course, with the maximum specs 2048×1536px (QXGA) @85 Hz. Naturally, VGA is also losing support from visual output peripheral makers releasing new monitors, TVs, and projectors. More recently, popular American brands have sought to minimize laptop ports and standardize on Thunderbolt / USB-C for everything. This offers simplicity, standard docking equipment, and facilitates thinner/lighter portables. For example, we reported on Japanese bureaucracy still requiring floppy disks and/or optical media in the 2020s, despite efforts to phase them out. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Fujitsu phased out the port in 2019, and NEC too. Yet both these rivals appear to retain some designs with VGA ports for corporate markets. Mark Tyson is a news editor at Tom's Hardware.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. I've thoroughly enjoyed leveling up my espresso machines over the years. My first was the De'Longhi Dedica Arte, a great beginner espresso machine that doesn't break the bank and has lasted me for well over 10 years. Cappuccinos are my preferred coffee drink, and while I enjoy nerding out about my coffee with scales and temperature-based electric kettles, sometimes I want a machine to do the hard, technical work for me, like the new Ninja Luxe Cafe Premier Series Espresso Machine. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. I usually have mixed feelings about equipment under the Ninja brand, which is often known for trying to do too much at once, but this machine is impressive. The Luxe Cafe machine comes with a lot of tricks up its sleeve and, even though it's semiautomatic and therefore doesn't do all the espresso work for you—it still has a traditional portafilter, for instance—it feels like having a coffee shop right in your home. I've been using it consistently for the past two months and it's incredibly user-friendly, offering the ability to create almost every coffee drink imaginable, from your usual espresso-based drinks to a traditional drip, cold brew, plus the ability to froth a cold foam. Combine this with the extremely beginner-friendly aspects like a built-in scale that doses coffee grinds for you and the ability to recommend a grind size based on your last drink's performance, and it's an undeniable feat of an espresso machine. There are some aspects in which the Ninja feels overengineered, but for the relatively cheap(er) price of around $600, it's a solid investment, especially considering that one of Ninja's main competitors with this machine is the Breville Barista Express ($700). As far as pulling espresso goes, the Ninja Luxe holds its own, with a stainless steel portafilter that fits two baskets—one for a double shot and a deeper, quad-size basket for traditional coffee drinks and cold brew. (That's right, no single shots available on this machine.) Along with espresso, the Luxe can brew a traditional cup of coffee (from 6 to 18 ounces) and, in a process that takes about 10 minutes, also make a cold brew. There's some customizability, like choosing between Classic and Rich for your drip coffee or brewing it over ice. There's even an option to get your espresso cold-pressed. All of these are available on the fairly intuitive interface. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The built-in grinder and scale are without a doubt the Luxe's most impressive qualities and include intuitive technology that's great for beginners. The grinder uses a conical burr system and has 25 settings. Based on your drink choice, it'll recommend a grind size. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. If the shot pulls too slow, it recommends a larger grind size. Too fast, and it recommends a smaller grind. While it's been fairly solid since, occasionally I'll get an inconsistent shot and not know what changed. Some automatic espresso machines incorporate a container of milk that has to be brought back and forth from the refrigerator, like the ones from this list. The Luxe, however, keeps it classic with a pitcher that you simply add milk to and a wand that begins steaming at the press of a button, another reason why it's great for those who want barista-quality coffee drinks without all the guesswork. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. I had little to no issues with this milk frother and enjoyed the opportunity to practice some latte art, even if the pitcher's spout isn't ideal for it. The Luxe has a removable hopper and rapid heat-up time, which are fantastic. Before you grind your coffee, you'll place a funnel on the portafilter to keep it in place. Unfortunately, after a couple months of use, the funnel's plastic corners are chipping. The water reservoir doesn't come with a filter, unfortunately. As for the drip tray, it's easy to remove and clean. An orange notch pops up when the tray needs to be emptied. On average, I empty the drip tray every four to five drinks. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. A shelf allows the Luxe to accommodate your 2-ounce espresso shots but can be removed to allow room for a travel mug as large as 18 ounces. One common gripe about the Luxe is that despite the portafilter having two spouts, there is not enough room to accommodate two espresso cups on the shelf or drip tray, which is strange. However, one of the biggest misses on this machine is that there's no hot water spout, something I particularly enjoyed with a machine like the De'Longhi Magnifica Start. My beef with many Ninja kitchen appliances is that sometimes they try to do too much, like the cooler with an added “frost vault.” The Ninja Luxe Cafe feels different, however, considering how intentional it was in competing with other new-age espresso machines. Like many Ninja products, the machine sits in a weird space. A coffee purist may choose a straightforward machine without all the assists of the Luxe, while a true beginner may not feel comfortable investing in the Luxe's “all-in-one” style. Nevertheless, it's an overall quality piece of equipment at a fair price that makes me view the Ninja brand with respect when it comes to its coffee game.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That's because the chairs, which normally go for $79 on Amazon, were among the first Chinese imports subject to minimum tariffs of 145 percent—a sky-high rate imposed by President Donald Trump—when they arrived at a port in Seattle in late April. The higher rate was in effect barely a month, from April 10 through May 14. “We did think there would be an agreement, but we didn't think it would be that fast and that low,” Carr says. A handful of trade attorneys who spoke with WIRED say they have told clients that refunds are unprecedented and unlikely—but not impossible. Businesses that had to pay the higher rate believe they were unfairly ensnared in Trump's hasty negotiations. Trump, Congress, or the courts would have to authorize a new tariffs exemption for companies caught up in the trade deal for refunds to become a reality. Attorneys say their clients have been lobbying the Trump administration and lawmakers for exemptions, including retroactive measures that would result in money back. Companies that make cars, chips, and drugs have been spared from other tariff policies. US Customs and Border Protection, which administers tariffs and exemptions, did not respond to a request for comment about the possibility of refunds. Trump views his trade policies as crucial to increasing US manufacturing and gaining power over China. Giving 115 percent back to merchants who paid the higher tariff rate would help avert further price increases and allow them to stay afloat if Trump renews tariff hikes, attorneys say. “For all but the most profitable and largest companies, this has been devastating,” says Ron Oleynik, a partner at law firm Holland & Knight. Paying higher tariffs even once can have long-term consequences for small to midsize companies, attorneys say. US rules require importers to hold a bond—effectively insurance—so that the government can claim at least some funds from companies that flout the law and don't pay what they owe. Companies such as Spreetail recognized the risks of importing goods after Trump imposed a 125 percent tariff on Chinese imports last month. Many businesses decided against placing new orders, and others quickly halted shipments that were in progress. Spreetail ended up paying elevated rates on the deck chairs and about 200 other products out of the 20,000 it imports, which include Razor scooters, ChargePoint EV chargers, and Sterilite boxes, Carr says. But some of the initial bills importers received didn't reflect that. A straw-hat importer, who didn't provide their name when asked in a series of direct messages on Reddit, tells WIRED that they successfully wrangled for an exemption and brought their tariffs rate to about 61 percent from an initially feared nearly 177 percent—though the rate is still double the 31.5 percent they paid in 2023. Though the lobbying push in Washington, DC, is moving forward, better luck may come from judges. Several lawsuits brought by businesses and states have alleged that Trump lacked the authority to impose recent tariffs such as those on Chinese imports. Some initial rulings are possible within days, but final decisions and any resulting refunds may be years away. If the court cases fail, then businesses could resort to a last-minute plea in about 16 months, which is generally the deadline to protest import bills. Mark Tallo, a partner at law firm Sandler, Travis & Rosenberg, says he's telling clients to keep their ledgers open.
