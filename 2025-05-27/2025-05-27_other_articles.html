                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fans of true-crime shows have undoubtedly come to learn that Netflix features a treasure trove of programming that will satisfy the urge to learn more about some of the most infamous murder cases in history. Directed by Yotam Guendelman and Ari Pines, Cole Case: The Tylenol Murders takes an in-depth look at one of America's largest criminal investigations that changed the way pharmaceuticals were distributed. This led to widespread panic about public health as authorities raced to find a culprit, with the biggest suspect being James William Lewis, who was never charged and died in 2023 at the age of 76. Let us be your personal Netflix curators so you can find the kind of shows you'll wish lasted twice as long but can't wait to start over, once again! While no one was ever caught, the case changed the way that Tylenol and other drugs were forever packaged and distributed. No longer was it as simple as opening up the bottle and shaking a couple of capsules into your hand. Johnson & Johnson introduced tamper-resistant packaging to include induction seals and child-proof caps, and stricter quality control methods were also put in place in factories across the country. Cold Case: The Tylenol Murders joins another recently-released true-crime documentary in the Top 10 list of TV shows on Netflix, as Fred and Rose West: A British Horror Story still sits in the #8 slot after being released on May 14, 2025. HBO Max is another great streaming service that offers a lot of content by way of Investigation Discovery, including their newest series, Sherri Papini: Caught In the Lie. True-crime fans will recall the Papini case being everywhere in 2016 after the young wife and mother disappeared in broad daylight. Appearing three weeks later, she infamously lied to the FBI about being kidnapped, and was later sentenced to 18 months in prison. Needless to say, there's no shortage of true-crime mysteries out there to consume, with Cold Case: The Tylenol Murders being just the latest in a string of shows this year that have been all the talk around the social media water cooler. You can check out the three-part docuseries streaming now on Netflix, but be warned: if you have a headache, it might make you think twice about taking a couple of Tylenol. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Hasbro has launched 'Power Rangers: Re-Ignition' on the franchise's official YouTube page. To say that fans are disappointed would be an understatement. Netflix's dark and bloody answer to 'Yellowstone' could be getting a follow-up season after being billed as a limited series.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers have found fresh evidence that Africa is breaking apart because of a deep mantle superplume of hot rock beneath the East African Rift System. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Researchers have found new evidence that a gigantic superplume of hot rock is rising beneath Africa, causing intense volcanic activity and splitting the continent in two. Geologists have long known that Africa is slowly breaking apart in a region called the East African Rift System (EARS), but the driving force behind this massive geological process was up for debate. Now, a new study has presented geochemical evidence that a previously theorized superplume is pressing up against — and fracturing — the African crust. "The deep mantle signatures observed in different segments of EARS are remarkably similar, suggesting that they all originate from a common deep source," study first-author Biying Chen, a postdoctoral research associate in the School of Geosciences at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, told Live Science in an email. Related: 'River of fire' unleashes toxic gases as eruption destroys town in La Palma — Earth from space EARS is the largest active continental rift system on Earth, ripping through around 2,175 miles (3,500 kilometers) of Africa. The lithosphere, Earth's rocky outer shell of crust and upper mantle, has been gradually breaking apart across the rift for around 35 million years. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Previous studies identified signs of a deep mantle plume beneath EARS in noble gas signatures. Noble gases, such as helium and neon, are rare and inert, which means they usually don't chemically react with other substances. However, Chen noted that these geochemical tracers have been sparse and often controversial beneath EARS. To help clarify what's going on beneath EARS, the team used high-precision instruments to look for neon (Ne) isotopes in Kenyan gases — and they detected a deep mantle signature. "But the deep mantle signature is small and we had to work hard to disentangle it — truthfully there was no Eureka moment, we frequently questioned the result and spent many hours checking and re-checking the data." —Pair of 'glowing' lava lakes spotted on Africa's most active volcanoes as they erupt simultaneously — Earth from space —'It was amazing': Scientists discover ash from 2 mystery volcanic eruptions in Wyoming Patrick Pester is the trending news writer at Live Science.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The High Court has prevented parties from using voluntary deregistration as a loophole to avoid accountability. Those oral arguments were covered in this series at the time. The UAP, represented by Senator Ralph Babet and Clive Palmer, relied on an unlawful burden or limitation on the informed choice of voters and the implied freedom of political communication. Ironically, while bringing a case based on the ‘informed choice' of voters, the UAP refused to inform the High Court why they de-registered, which several judges called them out for. Contrasted with that are sections 10 and 31, which allow Parliament to determine all aspects of the electoral process. The broader implied freedom of political communication limits this power to ensure that voters can engage in the political process and discuss political issues, involving some elements of ‘free speech.' The court was also asked to reopen Ruddick v Commonwealth (2022), briefly covered here. There, Justices Gordon, Edelman, Steward and Gleeson upheld the provision on a ‘broad' approach that considered it in context, finding that there was no burden on the implied freedom or informed choice, while Chief Justice Kiefel and Justices Keane and Gageler dissented by ruling against it under the ‘narrow' approach of considering just that provision. Here, all the judges agreed on section 135(3), refused to reopen Ruddick and rejected the implied freedom argument , but the Ruddick split on informed choice was not fully resolved. The joint judgment maintained that the majority in Ruddick was wrong to find that there was no burden on informed choice in that case, and held that there was a “substantial burden” here there was a disadvantage to the voters as the party affiliations of some candidates would be removed. Transparency - registered parties have to disclose large political donations and their finances. Without section 135(3), a party could deregister, receive massive non-disclosed donations, and then re-register to spend that money at the next election. Avoidance - Under section 136, a party will be deregistered if it does not endorse or nominate a candidate for 4 years. Section 135(3) also prevents parties from deregistering and then reregistering under a similar name to avoid those consequences. Justice Gleeson, a member of the majority in Ruddick, “readily” accepted a burden on the ‘informed choice' ground. Her Honour agreed with the joint judgment that the “ballot paper can be expected to be an important source of information about party affiliation.” It was different from Ruddick, because Her Honour argued that similar party names led to confusion for voters. However, despite the burden, section 135(3) was sufficiently narrow in scope to be allowed, especially as it would rarely be relevant Justices Gordon, Edelman and Steward were members of the majority in Ruddick v Commonwealth, where they held that there was no burden. Here, they maintained their “broad approach” that section 135(3) shouldn't be considered on its own, but as part of the “whole structure” of the legislative scheme, which includes sections 136 and 137. Further, the party's name and logo could still be used “in the parliamentary process, election campaigning and broader political debate.” Taking a slightly different approach, Justice Edelman said the test was whether the whole “scheme” imposed a burden, and then if that burden changed by removing section 135(3). Given His Honour's reasoning that there was no burden by the scheme in Ruddick, he identified a “narrow and shallow” burden here.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's been nearly 52 years since Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker claimed they were abducted by aliens while fishing along the Pascagoula River in Mississippi, and yet another docuseries has been released on the alleged extraterrestrial encounter. Pascagoula 73, a four-part series now available on Amazon and YouTube, was produced by Danny Weir and written by Weir alongside longtime UFO researcher Philip Mantle. Mantle published two of Parker's books before his death and has done extensive research on arguably the best documented case of its kind. The docuseries is based on Mantle's book, Pascagoula Uncovered – Witnesses, Files, & Audiotapes, and brings first-hand eyewitness accounts back into the fold, according to a press release. She never spoke about them until sitting down with Mantle. Previously unheard recordings from the night of and aftermath of Hickson and Parker's experience on Oct. 11, 1973, are included in the docuseries. It looks back at the encounter through Hickson's eyes while emphasizing discussions Parker had with Mantle about how the beings kept contact with him for decades. Taken alongside his friend, he faced terrifying extraterrestrial beings. Unlike his older companion Charles Hickson, Calvin was a young man just beginning his adult life when he was suddenly faced with extraterrestrial beings.” Parker and Hickson, then 42, had just gotten off work on Oct. 11, 1973, when they decided to go fishing at an abandoned shipyard on the west bank of the Pascagoula River. At about 9 p.m., they claimed to have seen a long, football-shaped craft with three aliens or robots levitating in front of them. Suddenly, both felt paralyzed, and the creatures were said to have grabbed them with possibly mitten-shaped or crab-like claws. Once inside the craft, both men were allegedly examined by a large, robotic eye before being returned to the riverbank. Amid initial skepticism from deputies, a secret recording device was hidden in the room with Hickson and Parker. Both maintained their story even when alone, which along with passing polygraphs, led police to believe something did happen that night. Media then came in droves to the then-sleepy fishing town to cover Hickson and Parker's story, which over a half century later, is still pointed to by UFO junkies as proof that extraterrestrials exist. The Pascagoula Abduction immediately had an impact with newspapers, radio stations, and TV channels across the globe wanting a piece of Hickson and Parker's tale. After Hickson did interviews with publications such as Rolling Stone and the Los Angeles Times while going on different national talk shows, the Pascagoula Abduction found its way into pop culture. Movies were made, music was written about it, and soon enough, the event was being talked about in almost every country. In terms of what impact the Pascagoula Abduction had on UFO believers, the passing of lie detectors by Hickson and Parker allowed them to point to the instance as credible proof that humans have been taken aboard by aliens, The Pascagoula Abduction has also helped erase the negative stigma surrounding belief in aliens as former government officials – including Pentagon intelligence officer David Grusch – have since come forward in asserting the U.S. has knowledge of extraterrestrial life and could even be in possession of alien spacecraft. What can be learned from the new docuseries? While a lot of information is already available on the Pascagoula Abduction through articles, interviews, and books, Pascagoula 73 provides never-discussed insight into what happened, according to the press release. “The book finishes with a final word by Calvin Parker himself who passed away in August 2023. “The whole book is almost like a look back through time to see what happened that night in Pascagoula and how the events unfolded thereafter. And in a stunning revelation, Calvin Parker recounts a previously unknown encounter from 1992 which is published here for the first time.” Maria Blair was one of the people claiming to see Parker and Hickson abducted. “A full interview with Maria Blair is published here for the first time.” With four statewide radio networks, 12 talk stations, 16 music stations, SuperTalk TV, and over 50 affiliates, SuperTalk Mississippi Media covers every inch of the state.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The story, centering on a man who can predict murders, has 'The Gentlemen' producer Ivan Atkinson on board for a feature adaptation. The Kick-Ass team is getting back together, with prolific comic book scribe Mark Millar and artist John Romita Jr. reteaming for the new comic book Psychic Sam. The book launches on Kickstarter today, and centers on a man who knows about murders before they happen, with a voice in his head telling him the name and address of future killers. But every time he ignores it, someone innocent dies. It's only a matter of time before the bodies pile up.” Mark Millar Returning to Spy World With Graphic Novel 'King of Spies' Millar and Romita struck gold 15 years ago with Kick-Ass, the comic that centered on a regular teenager who decided to become a vigilante, despite having no powers and no special skills. Atkinson is known for his work with Guy Ritchie, producing films such as The Gentlemen and Wrath of Man. Psychic Sam is noteworthy for Millar, as it does not fall under Netflix, where he has been exclusive since 2017, when the streaming giant purchased his company Millarworld in a splashy deal that brought titles to the screen such as Jupiter's Legacy and The Chosen One. Millar says Psychic Sam will not affect his output at the Netflix-owned Millarworld, with books still slated through 2026. Millar says the desire to do Psychic Sam came after receiving offers from Marvel to do a big summer event series, ala Civil War, as well as from DC, to take on a big Superman project.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A trailer for the feature, entitled "Holiguards," was shown in Cannes. Kevin Spacey has directed his first feature film in more than 20 years. Variety understands that the two-time Oscar winning actor — who fell from grace in Hollywood following multiple accusations of sexual misconduct — has directed a supernatural action-thriller in which he stars alongside Dolph Lundgren (“Rocky IV,” The Expendables”), Tyrese Gibson (the “Fast & Furious” franchise, “Morbius”), Brianna Hildebrand (“Deadpool,” “Lucifer”), Disha Patani (“Kalki 2898 AD,” “Bharat”) and Eric Roberts (“Runaway Train,” “The Righteous Gemstones”). Wes Anderson Says Gene Hackman Was 'Furious' Over 'Royal Tenenbaums' Pay and 'Left Without Saying Goodbye'; They Never Spoke After Film's Release: 'We Had Friction' It also marks the first feature to be produced by Elledgy Media, owned by Portugal-based Ukrainian entrepreneur Elvira Gavrilova Paterson. Amid this conflict, a young woman discovers that she's the daughter of two rival leaders and could end the conflict. The script was written by Sergey Torchilin and Lado Okhotnikov. Variety hears a trailer was being screened to potential interested parties at this year's Cannes Film Festival. It was actually in Cannes where Spacey made his boldest return to the limelight since his career nosedived in the wake of the MeToo scandal, and since he was found not guilty of multiple allegations of sexual misconduct in a high-profile court trial in 2023. “Holiguards” wasn't the only film of Spacey's in Cannes.</p>

When authorities recovered it, they found a basketball-sized object weighing around 4.5 pounds, with no visible seams, welds, screws, or panels. Like it had been forged by gravity-defying space elves or printed by a 3D printer from the year 3047. Naturally, the word UFO got tossed around faster than conspiracy theories in a Facebook comment thread. We've had Congressional hearings on unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). We've had former Air Force officials claim the U.S. is reverse-engineering recovered “craft.” So yeah, the public is primed for mystery or, at the very least, a good plot twist. But while the sphere looks like it belongs in a sci-fi museum, there's nothing (yet) to prove it's from another world. Enter Dr. Julia Mossbridge, physicist, biophysicist, and potential buzzkill—unless she's right. “It looks to me like a really cool art project,” she said. If it's art, then it's doing exactly what art's supposed to do: make you question your reality, your place in the universe, and what kind of budget modern artists have these days. “If an artist is doing this, why?” she asked. Of course, not all theories require aliens or artists. What if —and hear us out— this sphere is just the tip of a giant BIC pen? A regular BIC pen tip is about 0.7 mm wide. If this sphere (about 24.6 cm in diameter) is the ballpoint scaled up… the pen would be 52 meters long. We call it: BIC Titan™ — Made to Sign Treaties from Orbit. Right now, the Colombian government hasn't ruled anything out—or in. They're running tests, scanning materials, and trying to figure out who, if anyone, wants to claim responsibility. No agency has stepped forward to say, “Oops, that's ours.” No companies, no defense contractors, not even an anonymous Banksy-type artist trying to cash in on the viral moment. Until someone fesses up, or it starts glowing and sending GPS coordinates, the Buga Sphere will remain part of that wonderful category of modern phenomena: “unexplained, weird, and kind of beautiful.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The sphere's unusual characteristics have sparked global attention and fueled speculation about its origins.Researcher Jose Luis Velasquez, who inspected the object, noted that it shows no welds or joints, features that would typically indicate human manufacturing. I've never seen a piece like this," Velazquez said, according to People magazine. He added that the sphere appears to have mysterious symbols carved on its surface. These observations have led some to conclude that the object could be a UFO.Dr. "It looks so human made to me," she told Fox News. She urged thorough vetting before declaring anomalies in mysterious discoveries. "Before you decide something's anomalous or a UFO, bring the object to a group like the Galileo Project," she suggested, referring to the international research initiative founded by Harvard University astrophysicist Avi Loeb, which aims to rigorously study potential extraterrestrial artifacts.Mossbridge framed the mysterious object as part of a bigger picture in which humanity must confront its own limitations. "They are all trying to get rigorous information themselves, not necessarily waiting on the federal government, about what's going on in our skies, what's going on in our waters, and actually trying to get international cooperation around these things," Mossbridge told Fox News.

A November 2022 report from the Pentagon documented numerous instances where balloons, birds, and satellites were mistakenly identified as UAPs. Similarly, a NASA report in 2023 concluded that most UAPs are likely attributable to balloons, aircraft, or sunlight reflections, rather than evidence of extraterrestrial life. Officials at the Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), established in 2022 to track UAPs, have stated there is no evidence suggesting that any cases they examined have extraterrestrial origins. Federal efforts to investigate UAPs have prioritized potential risks to national security and air safety rather than delving into theories about their origins.Despite her skepticism about the Buga Sphere, Mossbridge acknowledged the significance of continued inquiry into unexplained phenomena. "Frankly, we've been looking at UAPs for decades, and the federal government has admitted that there are things that we don't understand, but we are investigating them," she said.Mossbridge believes that such mysteries can have a unifying effect on humanity. "When people start focusing on something that's bigger than us, it really powerfully changes behavior for the better," she said according to Newsweek.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Local fiction: Megan Giddings' “Meet Me at the Crossroads” is about a family and two sisters who make wildly different choices. In her “Meet Me at the Crossroads” Megan Giddings thanks people you'd expect a writer to acknowledge, including readers and University of Minnesota English department colleagues V.V. There's also at least one you might not expect: an Uber driver. That driver, who drove the creative writing and literature professor to a New Orleans bar, claimed to be a psychic. She told Giddings personal things that left her shaken. The psychic also gave Giddings the ending of “Crossroads,” a speculative fiction novel about twins who are faced with the appearance of a mysterious door near their Michigan home (Giddings' editor compares it to Carl Sagan's bestselling “Contact”). Olivia passes through the door and possibly into another world. Giddings, 40, and husband Jon Cameron live in Minneapolis. We chatted about her third novel (the others are “Lakewood,” one of New York magazine's 10 best books of 2020, and “The Women Could Fly”). We began with that crazy car ride: Q: No spoilers but the book ends with a scene in which Ayanna's ride-share driver conveys a key message to her. In New Orleans, this woman started telling me things, some a little vague and some uncomfortably like what was going on in my life at the time. She was a nurse and apparently a psychic — this is the most New Orleans thing I can think of — and she kept saying that someone had a message for me, someone from the other side. A: I still have no idea how to interpret what went down but I realized, “This is the next book.” There's only one other moment in my fiction that is drawn so directly from real life. Q: You grabbed a notebook and started writing stuff down? A: I posted about it on social media. I immediately told people at dinner about it. The other thing is my husband was in the Uber, too, and he was like, “What the [expletive]?” I was saying, “That really happened, didn't it? I didn't have some complete break from reality?” And he said, “Yeah, that was the craziest Uber ride I've ever had in my life.” It's also the only Uber ride where the driver hugged me. Q: Did you give a good tip? “Thank you for finishing my future book. Q: What did you want to accomplish with “Crossroads”? A number of my friends were having kids and were really worried about, “How do I teach my kid to be a good person? How do I give them a foundation of caring about other people?” Even my own roots — I was raised strictly Catholic and I have really mixed feelings about having faith now but I can see that there's where I learned even to want to care about other people, which is one thing I'm really grateful for. Q: You said there were two things? A: I was interested in writing about my fear of death and the unknown. Q: The idea of being a good person really comes through. I have some hesitations around that but if it's a coming-of-age novel about learning to be kind in an unkind world, and that's part of the progress to being an adult, that would make me really happy. Q: That's probably even trickier for young people who are, like you, Black. The sisters in the book are Black, too, and its treatment of race feels very subtle. They are important and necessary — I get sent so many books that are Black horror or speculative fiction that deal with repercussions of race. But I felt like there's not always room for fun or kindness or thinking deeply about living a long life. Q: And we should say it is a really funny book. What was the hardest part to get right? I felt like the book should feel comfortable, like you're being invited in to think about all of these things, so there were times I had to work really hard not to scold. I changed a lot of my diction to feel more informal and I tried to emphasize play, have jokes. Q: You've said the writing of your books often overlaps. I'm doing research and writing very poorly. But it is nice to be thinking about the next one. Interim books editor Chris Hewitt previously worked at the Pioneer Press in St. Paul, where he wrote about movies and theater.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But Princess Diana - in moments of personal crisis - often turned to the spiritual realm for reassurance, cramming her diary with appointments in the late 1980s and 90s. Diana was first encouraged to speak with a spiritual advisor by Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York. In 1986, the couple referred Diana, tortured over her failing marriage to Prince Charles and the pressures of royal life, to astrologer Penny Thornton. In 1986 Prince Andrew and Sophie referred Diana, tortured over her failing marriage to Prince Charles and the pressures of royal life, to astrologer Penny Thornton. Andrew Morton wrote: 'When she first began investigating the possibilities of the spiritual world, Diana was very open, almost too open, to belief.' Diana began seeing psychic Betty Palko, naturopath Roderick Lane, celebrity psychic Sally Morgan, astrologer Debbie Frank, clairvoyant Vasso Kortesis, medium Rita Rogers and homeopathic dowser healer Jack Temple. Morton wrote that Prince Charles, who himself is known for his interest in holistic medicine and philosophy, was not supportive of Diana's many spiritual appointments. He said: 'When Charles saw her reading a book called Facing Death while she was on holiday he asked her bluntly what she was doing wasting her time reading about all those issues.' Diana became close friends with San Lorenzos restaurant owners Lorenzo and Mara Berni, who Morton wrote 'had a reputation of an Indian earth mother'. It was around this time that Diana was introduced to Debbie Frank who - as Morton wrote - 'combines general counselling and analysis concerning the present and the future as they relate to the conjunction of planets appropriate to Diana's birth time and date'. 'Born under the sign of Cancer, Diana has many qualities typical of that sign: protective, tenacious, emotionally attuned and nurturing.

Andrew Morton wrote in Diana Her True Story: 'When she first began investigating the possibilities of the spiritual world, Diana was very open, almost too open, to belief' As depicted in season six of The Crown, Diana and Dodi visited psychic Rita Rogers - one of the UK's best-known mediums just weeks before they died in the fatal car crash in Paris. 'You couldn't pull the wool over Diana's eyes,' she said. 'She could spot a fraud from 20 paces, and would have quickly sussed me if I hadn't been genuine.' Christopher Andersen, author of The King, said: 'Over the years Diana went through a revolving door supply of astrologers, faith healers, numerologists, tarot card readers, clairvoyants, psychics, and 'spiritual advisors. Diana and Dodi visited psychic Rita Rogers - one of the UK's best-known mediums - just weeks before they died in the fatal car crash in Paris At the inquest into Diana's death it was noted that Diana's reliance on spiritual advisors offered companionship and a sense of comfort during a difficult time - but also fueled her paranoia. Mr Jephson, a former lieutenant commander in the Royal Navy, worked for Diana between 1990 and 1996. He said he was worried that she put so much faith in astrologers and soothsayers because this 'fed the paranoia that never lurked far beneath the surface'. By the time of her Panorama interview in 1995, he said, Diana 'saw plots everywhere', even claiming that someone had taken a 'pot-shot' at her with a gun in Hyde Park. Rogers said: 'You couldn't pull the wool over Diana's eyes. She could spot a fraud from 20 paces, and would have quickly sussed me if I hadn't been genuine' Brennan claimed that Queen Victoria, who reigned from 1837 to 1901, was 'fascinated by spiritualism' and would invite mediums to Buckingham Palace and hold seances Brennan claimed that Victoria, who reigned from 1837 to 1901, was 'fascinated by spiritualism' and would invite mediums to Buckingham Palace and hold seances. Brennan also claimed that Victoria's servant John Brown, whom she was rumoured to have a romantic relationship with, actually acted as a medium to help her channel the spirit of her beloved late husband, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. In the documentary The King of UFOs, paranormal historian Richard Felix claimed that Queen Elizabeth II attended a seance in 1953 hoping to connect with her then-recently deceased father. In his memoir Spare, Harry said that he once sought help from a woman who claimed to have powers to connect with his late mother My House is Haunted when he made the claims.
