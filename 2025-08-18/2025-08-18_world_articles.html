                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President reverses ceasefire position but says US will give Ukraine security help and expresses hope for trilateral talks Donald Trump has ruled out a ceasefire in Ukraine as Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his European allies visited the White House to push for US-backed security guarantees as part of any long-term peace deal. The US president, who only last week warned Russia of “very severe consequences” if Vladimir Putin failed to agree to a halt the fighting, made clear on Monday he had reversed his position. Trump said: “When it comes to security, there's going to be a lot of help.” But the US president made it clear that European countries would be expected to carry the burden, saying: “They are a first line of defence because they're there. “I think if everything works out well today we'll have a trilat, and I think there will be a reasonable chance of ending the war when we do that.” Trump added: “I just spoke to President Putin indirectly, and we're going to have a phone call right after these meetings today – and we may or may not have a trilat.” Trump's meeting with Zelenskyy went more smoothly than their first encounter in the Oval Office six months ago, when the Ukrainian leader was ambushed and berated by Trump and Vice-President JD Vance. Later, sitting with Keir Starmer and other European leaders in the east room, Trump acknowledged: “All of us would obviously prefer an immediate ceasefire while we work on a lasting peace. Friedrich Merz, the chancellor of Germany, insisted that “we would all like to see a ceasefire” and he could not imagine the next meeting taking place without one. Unmoved, Trump suggested that would be left to Zelenskyy and Putin: “Well, we're going to let the president go over and talk to the president, and we'll see how that works out.” He added: “And again I say it, in the six wars that I've settled, I haven't had a ceasefire.” Monday's meeting came after Trump met Putin in Anchorage and said that the onus would now be on Zelenskyy to agree to concessions that he said could end the war. Some commentators saw it as a damage limitation exercise after Trump was apparently swayed by Putin and began to echo his talking points. But he also said Putin had accepted there would be security guarantees for Ukraine as part of any peace deal. Trump said: “In a very significant step, President Putin agreed that Russia would accept security guarantees for Ukraine and this is one of the key points that we need to consider and we're going to be considering that at the table, also who will do what essentially.” Macron said: “The first one is clearly a credible Ukrainian army for the years and decades to come.” Europe was also clear about carrying its “fair share” of the burden, he said, “so you can count on this as we can continue.” Giorgia Meloni, the prime minister of Italy, said: ‘We will talk about many important topics. The first one is security guarantees, how to be sure that it won't happen again, which is the precondition of every kind of peace.” Trump has made a habit of carrying out high-stakes diplomacy before the cameras with a series of leaders who arrive in the Oval Office to face reporters' questions. People are being killed and we want to stop that. Zelenskyy outlined what he said his country needed to feel secure, which included a “strong Ukrainian army” through weapons sales and training. Trump jumped in, saying: “I said the same thing.” Turning to Zelenskyy, Trump said: “That's the one that attacked you last time.” “I remember that,” Zelenskyy said, before addressing Glenn: “But you are in the same suit ... The European leaders held a preparatory meeting with the Ukrainian president in Washington on Monday morning, while Zelenskyy also met Trump's Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg. But Trump had alarmed Kyiv and European capitals in recent days by repeating a number of Russian talking points.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A furious row is raging over whether the Zambian president, Hakainde Hichilema, will preside over the funeral of his predecessor, Edgar Lungu, as the former president's family wage a legal battle in South Africa to try to prevent his body from being repatriated. Mourners had already arrived for a funeral in Johannesburg in June when it was halted by a high court judge after an 11th-hour request by Zambia's attorney general, Mulilo Kabesha. Lungu's family said he had specifically requested that Hichilema not attend his funeral. On 8 August, the Pretoria high court ruled that Lungu's body could be sent back to Zambia for a state funeral. Lungu's older sister Bertha broke down, shouting across the courtroom at Kabesha as she was restrained by other relatives. Lungu's family then applied for leave to appeal. Meanwhile, conspiracy theories have spread, from rumours that Lungu is not actually dead to speculation that Hichilema wants to use the body for witchcraft. “It's coming home!” Kodwani Banda, a self-described “youth advocate”, posted to his 356,000 Facebook followers, with an image of white smoke rising from the Sistine Chapel chimney. Emmanuel Mwamba, a spokesperson for the Patriotic Front, Lungu's party, said: “There should have been more sympathy. When [government officials] came to South Africa, they were just interested in picking up the body and holding the funeral. Mwamba responded that a state funeral could be held without the current president presiding over it. Sishuwa Sishuwa, a political historian and senior lecturer at Stellenbosch University, said the burial dispute had heightened political discord in Zambia. Lungu ruled Zambia from 2015 to 2021, having taken over when Michael Sata died in office. He defeated Hichilema in the 2016 presidential election, which Hichilema and his United Party for National Development (UPND) party claimed was rigged. Four months later, after an international outcry, he was released and the charges were dropped. Hichilema finally defeated Lungu in the 2021 elections, amid an economic crisis. In 2023, police stopped Lungu from going out for runs, saying they were “political activism” that had to be approved in advance to “ensure public safety”. In 2024, Lungu was banned from running in next year's presidential election by the constitutional court, which ruled that the period from when Lungu took office in 2015 until the 2016 election counted as a full first term.</p>

As settler violence continues to escalate in Palestine, including the killing of activist and documentary filmmaker Awdah Hathaleen by an Israeli settler at the end of July, Western activists who have been watching from afar as Israel commits a genocide in Gaza are increasingly putting their lives at risk in the West Bank to stand in the way of home demolitions and settler invasions. He was denied entry after a lengthy interrogation by Israeli intelligence officials. This would have been Eli's first visit to Israel or Palestine, and as he told Truthout, “I was very careful to take down any pro-Palestine posts I had online and deactivated all of my social media accounts.” Still, “The second I stepped off the plane, there was somebody waiting on the jet bridge. I don't know if they were waiting specifically for me, but before I even caught [sic] my surroundings, there was someone who pulled me aside and started doing a lot of questioning,” he said. Eli was held for hours by Israeli officials and asked about his reasons for visiting Israel, with a clear indication that Israeli officials knew of his intent to volunteer in the West Bank. Due to the difficulty of entering and exiting the West Bank, Western activists will often tell Israeli officials they are visiting as Christian pilgrims or to see friends in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem. Telling an Israeli border official that one intends to visit the West Bank, or even mentioning the word “Palestine,” is a sure way to end up in hours of interrogation or with a complete denial of entry. The VWP is structured to be reciprocal in nature, so Israel's entry into the VWP was conditional on its compliance with a set of terms outlined by the U.S., which includes allowing U.S. citizens visa-free entry into Israel regardless of national origin, religion, or ethnicity. As then-State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki said during a briefing in 2014, “The Department of Homeland Security and State remain concerned with the unequal treatment that Palestinian Americans and other Americans of Middle Eastern origin experience at Israel's border and checkpoints, and reciprocity is the most basic condition of the Visa Waiver Program.” Multiple activists who have been visiting and volunteering in Palestine since the early 2000s told Truthout that the border crossings have become increasingly hostile to foreign visitors. Whether it is due to a formal policy from Israel's Populations and Immigration Authority or an informal change in sentiment, entering and exiting the West Bank is becoming increasingly difficult, to the point that some fear access will soon be closed off entirely. Telling an Israeli border official that one intends to visit the West Bank, or even mentioning the word “Palestine,” is a sure way to end up in hours of interrogation or with a complete denial of entry. And as settler violence continues to escalate in the West Bank, with Israeli human rights group B'Tselem calling it “part of a strategy to cement the takeover of Palestinian land,” Westerners are living and working in solidarity with Palestinians who are facing the demolition of their homes and theft of their land by Israeli settlers. It is also now more important than ever that Westerners are able to enter the West Bank and bear witness to the violence, as one activist said. “We keep inviting Westerners here because Palestinians feel safer when they're in the villages,” an official at the International Solidarity Movement (ISM), who asked to remain anonymous for fear of being deported, told Truthout. The ISM official told Truthout that after October 7, they have witnessed a significant increase in interest among Westerners in traveling to the occupied West Bank as protective presence activists. However, Israel has also stepped up its efforts to identify Western activists before they enter the West Bank and deport them. Dee Murphy, who is from Ireland and has been volunteering in the West Bank since the 2000s, told Truthout that after she was picked up by Israeli forces in Masafer Yatta, she was told she would be deported. During her interrogation, she recounted, “The Israeli officer said to me, ‘So have you ever been involved in actions against Israel, in your country or abroad?' The Population and Immigration Authority, which controls Israel's ports of entry, has deployed artificial intelligence and facial recognition technology to gather evidence of Western activists' “anti-Israel sentiment,” as activists witnessed firsthand after their initial detention. Activists who were detained at either the airport or one of Israel's land crossings also told of systematic abuse and harassment by Israeli officials. According to one activist, as soon as the officials learned that they had any affinity for Palestine or the Palestinian cause, “They treated us like we were less than human.” Sophie, an American who is identified by a pseudonym for fear of retaliation by Israeli authorities, recounted to Truthout how she was pulled aside for a “security screening” while exiting the country. She believes her file in the system was somehow flagged to note that she had been volunteering in the West Bank, as during the screening, “She [the officer] put her hands in my underwear and proceeded to cavity search me, and then after that, she put her hands up my shirt and up my sports bra. Whether it is identifying activists before they arrive, detaining them in the West Bank, or abusing them at border crossings, Israel is doing all it can to stop Western activists in the West Bank from doing their solidarity work.

She asserted on X that the U.S. should not be accepting any refugees from Palestine — even though HEAL Palestine only arranges temporary visas for children to receive medical care. Loomer posted a video showing young children being cheered by people waving Palestinian flags as they arrive at San Francisco's airport with their families. This is a lie that nonetheless took hold on the right. HEAL Palestine condemned the State Department's decision in a statement, and emphasized that it is not bringing children over as part of a refugee resettlement program. “HEAL Palestine is an American humanitarian nonprofit organization delivering urgent aid and medical care to children in Palestine, including sponsoring and bringing severely injured children to the U.S. on temporary visas for essential medical treatment not available at home. Indeed, medical evacuation is the last hope for an estimated 11,000 Palestinians in Gaza, including 4,500 children, who require it, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has estimated. With Israel's systematic destruction of Gaza's health system — and decades of medical blockades by Israeli occupation — thousands in Gaza have no treatment options within the Strip for diseases like cancer or treatment for severe injuries caused by Israeli bombings. These are children who have lost limbs or suffered severe burns, likely as a result of Israeli attacks, while others have chronic conditions. Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended the visa suspensions in an interview with CBS on Sunday, accusing the groups helping Palestinians acquire visas of being affiliated with Hamas, without evidence. It's a bunch of adults that are accompanying them,” he said, likely referring to the children's family members. Advocates for Palestinian rights have said that the State Department's decision is cruel. “Blocking Palestinian children injured by American weapons from coming to America for medical treatment is the latest sign that the intentional cruelty of President Trump's ‘Israel First' administration knows no bounds,” said Nihad Awad, the ​​Council on American-Islamic Relations' national executive director. Humanitarian groups have pleaded with international partners to welcome Palestinians for treatment as Israel has denied the vast majority of requests for medical evacuations, no matter how dire the cases. Most countries are refusing to allow Palestinians to evacuate, MSF says, while Israel has imposed a number of arbitrary restrictions on approving evacuations. “We are looking for countries — we really want them to open their doors to accept more and more cases because those patients are dying inside Gaza,” said Hani Isleem, the group's project coordinator for medical evacuations in Gaza. France was one of those countries, but earlier this month also froze its program to allow Palestinians to flee Gaza amid the genocide after a Palestinian student was suspended from her university due to allegations that she made antisemitic posts online.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Attorney General Bill Barr arrived on Capitol Hill on Monday for a deposition by the House Oversight Committee about matters related to Jeffrey Epstein, the first of 10 high-profile Democratic and Republican witnesses subpoenaed by the committee to testify on the case. The committee has also issued a subpoena to the Justice Department calling for it to provide Congress any Epstein files in its possession, with victims' names redacted. Barr's appearance comes one day before the DOJ is supposed to turn over those records to the committee. “You can imagine, how many documents there are. I think we're working together in a good-faith effort and everything's coming along.” Barr served in the top job at the Department of Justice during President Donald Trump's first term and was in the role when Epstein died by suicide while awaiting trial on federal charges accusing him of sexually abusing underage girls. Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell at New York's Metropolitan Correctional Center, a federal detention facility. Barr did not speak to reporters as he arrived about an hour earlier than when he was scheduled to begin his deposition. Shortly after Epstein's death, Barr said that he was “appalled” and “angry” to learn of the Metropolitan Correctional Center's “failure to adequately secure this prisoner,” and announced that the FBI and the Justice Department's internal watchdog would investigate Epstein's death. In 2023, the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General issued a scathing rebuke of the Bureau of Prisons detailing multiple failures that led to Epstein's death but found no evidence to contradict the “absence of criminality” in his death. House Speaker Mike Johnson took steps to delay until September a vote of the full House to publicly release the DOJ's Epstein files. The Republican-led panel additionally subpoenaed nine other individuals for private depositions between August and mid-October. Those are: former Attorneys General Merrick Garland, Jeff Sessions, Loretta Lynch, Eric Holder and Alberto Gonzales; former FBI Director James Comey; former special counsel and FBI Director Robert Mueller III; former Secretary of State and first lady Hillary Clinton; and former President Bill Clinton.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Together with the U.S., the EU will continue working towards a lasting peace that safeguards Ukraine's and Europe's vital security interests," Costa said. An EU source told the Kyiv Independent that several EU leaders had expressed interest in such a debrief, particularly those not present in Washington. The summit follows Trump's Aug. 15 meeting in Alaska with Russian President Vladimir Putin, to which Zelensky was not invited. Trump said the two "made some headway" on peace, but no agreement was reached. The clash in February led Trump to cancel a planned U.S.-Ukraine mineral agreement and publicly accuse Zelensky of having "disrespected the United States of America in the cherished Oval Office" in a post on Truth Social. Previously, she worked as a TV journalist at Ukraine's public broadcaster Suspilne, covering global politics and international developments. "And we will come to a resolution today, I think, on almost everything, including probably the security," Trump said in the East Room, speaking alongside Zelensky and European leaders. In the Oval Office, Zelensky said Ukraine wants to end the war and welcomed Trump's signal of openness to trilateral negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Miss Universe Organization (MUO) said in a statement sent to CNN on Sunday that it was “pleased to confirm” that Ayoub would compete in the Miss Universe 2025 competition, which takes place in November. Ayoub will join competitors from more than 130 other countries and territories at the 74th Miss Universe final, which will be held on November 21 in Bangkok, Thailand. Miss Netherlands pageant scrapped as ‘the world is changing,' organizers say Ayoub, now 27, was crowned Miss Palestine back in 2022, according to Abu Dhabi-based news outlet The National. “I am honored to announce that for the first time ever, Palestine will be represented at Miss Universe,” she wrote in the caption. “As Palestine endures heartbreak — especially in Gaza — I carry the voice of a people who refuse to be silenced. I represent every Palestinian woman and child whose strength the world needs to see,” Ayoub added. “We are more than our suffering — we are resilience, hope, and the heartbeat of a homeland that lives on through us.” The decision to include a Palestinian entry in the beauty pageant comes amid growing international criticism of Israel's war in Gaza. Beauty queen at center of South Africa xenophobia spat crowned Miss Universe Nigeria Authorities in Gaza do not distinguish between civilians and Hamas fighters when reporting casualty figures, but the health ministry and the United Nations say the majority of deaths are women and children. As the war continues, a growing number of countries are pledging to recognize a Palestinian state, with more than 145 nations now joining the call for international recognition. Most recently, Australia, Canada and France announced plans to recognize a Palestinian state at the United Nations General Assembly meeting in September, while the United Kingdom has conditionally said it will recognize it if Israel does not meet criteria that include agreeing to a ceasefire in Gaza.

"We focused on NATO territory like no others did," he said. Also, he noted, the Bundeswehr established a permanent brigade in Lithuania. However, he emphasized that German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius will have to look closer at the issue. Germany's top diplomat was "moderately optimistic" regarding potential talks on Ukraine. "The fact that these negotiations were held at such a level means that it will not be easy for the interested parties to step back and do nothing," Wadephul said, commenting on the Russia-US summit in Anchorage. Later on Monday, US President Donald Trump will hold a meeting with Vladimir Zelensky in Washington. A number of European leaders will also be traveling to the United States. Among other things, Washington will discuss possible security guarantees for Ukraine, NBC News reported. On August 15, a meeting between Russian and US Presidents Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump took place at a military base in Alaska. The Russian leader also called for turning the page in bilateral relations and resuming cooperation as he invited Trump to visit Moscow. For his part, Trump stressed that "great progress" had been made, even as not all positions were agreed upon at the meeting.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A U.S.-made M113 armored personnel carrier bearing Russian and American flags was filmed storming Ukrainian positions in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Russian propaganda media outlet RT claimed on Aug. 18. The video was shared by Russian propaganda media just days after U.S. President Donald Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska in what Moscow cast as the end of its international isolation. Russian media frequently amplify Trump's past claims that either President Volodymyr Zelensky or former U.S. President Joe Biden "provoked" Russia's war, a narrative that shifts blame from Moscow. The RT footage appeared shortly after Trump praised his Aug. 15 summit with Putin as "10 out of 10," even though no peace agreement was reached. In recent statements, Trump claimed Zelensky could end the war "almost immediately" if he agreed to concessions, making clear that Ukraine would not be allowed to join NATO or reclaim Crimea under any deal he might broker with Moscow. The footage was allegedly filmed in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, where Russia is preparing to make a new push, redeploying troops from other sectros of the front, according to Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi. Russian President Vladimir Putin had earlier demanded Ukraine's withdrawal from the Ukrainian-controlled parts of Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, Luhansk, and Kherson oblasts as preconditions for peace negotiations. Most recently, the demands have reportedly narrowed to Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. Tim Zadorozhnyy is a news editor at The Kyiv Independent. Tim began his career at a local television channel in Odesa. After moving to Warsaw, he joined the Belarusian opposition media outlet NEXTA, starting as a news anchor and later advancing to the position of managing editor.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) thwarted a terrorist attack on the Crimean Bridge planned by Ukrainian special services, the FSB Public Relations Center reported. TASS has compiled the key facts about the thwarted terrorist attempt known so far. Officers of Russia's Federal Security Service traced a Chevrolet Volt with a powerful improvised explosive device inside, and the bomb was defused. The car arrived in Russia from Ukraine via a number of countries. In the Krasnodar Region, the car was to be handed over to another driver, who had to drive it onto the Crimean Bridge. The driver was to become an unwitting suicide bomber, the Kiev regime intended to use him as a pawn. A criminal investigation into the new terrorist attempt has been opened. Kiev's actions were aimed at derailing negotiations on resolving the Ukraine conflict, said Rodion Miroshnik, the Russian Foreign Ministry's ambassador-at-large overseeing the Kiev regime's crimes. On April 2, Belarusian security officers detained a minibus carrying more than 500 kg of synthetic explosives smuggled through the Belarus-Poland border to the Union State of Russia and Belarus. During the investigation, accomplices of the planned crime were detained, including an unaware driver who was also supposed to become a "suicide bomber" while driving to the Crimean Peninsula via the Crimean Bridge.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ontario Premier Doug Ford recently declared on CNN that in Canada, U.S. President Donald Trump is the “most disliked politician in the world . because he has attacked his closest family member.” In January, just before Mark Carney announced his leadership bid for the Liberal Party, he appeared on The Daily Show and told Americans that Canada and the United States could be “friends with benefits.” Are prominent U.S. leaders making time for media appearances to defend Canada as their “closest family member”? Believing that trading partners are family, or friends even, betrays our leaders' wide-eyed view of the world that not even historical precedent appears able to shake. It has invited complacency and deepens the damaging economic consequences when trade relationships evolve or break apart. If there is one long-term takeaway for Canadian leaders from Mr. Trump's assault on Canada's access to U.S. markets, it's realizing that countries we trade with are neither family nor friends, but jurisdictions that do business with us – business that is transactional, situational and evolving. We have had Donald Trump-like figures before who upended our economy and who we should have already learned this lesson from. In 1846, Mr. Peel dropped Britain's protectionist tariffs on grain, ending Canada's preferential grain market access that had been in place since 1815. Lumber producers praise federal plan to diversify markets amid trade war with U.S. Three years later, Canada's then Governor-General, Lord Elgin, reported that property in Montreal and “in most of the Canadian towns . had fallen by 50 per cent in value” and that “three-fourths of the commercial men are bankrupt.” By 1854, the search for a market to replace lost share in Britain was secured through a reciprocity deal with the U.S. that removed duties on fish, timber, coal and grain just as railways began to boom in Canada, opening more efficient transportation routes to move Canadian goods south. The abrogation of the 1854 trade agreement helped cement efforts to create what we now know as Canada through Confederation in 1867, a project that was expected to create one national economy to help compensate for lost trade with the U.S. Today's interprovincial trade barriers measure the success of that intention. The U.S. Fordney-McCumber Act in 1922 slapped an average 40-per-cent tariff on imports. This was followed by the American Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in 1930, and in 1971, President Richard Nixon's administration imposed a 10-per-cent tariff on many Canadian goods crossing the border. Opinion: Ottawa can't let our canola industry – a true Canadian success story – fade away Equally transparent is China's goal of crushing our EV sector through the sale of cheap EVs produced using low-wage work, heavily subsidized, stolen or misappropriated IP, and as Human Rights Watch has documented, forced labour. Canada has negotiated many trade agreements with other countries, yet, those deals are often more sizzle than steak. As trade experts noted earlier this year in Policy Magazine, “Today, Canada has more comprehensive trade agreements than any other G7 country. Utilization rates of these agreements have remained low. The 2017 Canada-EU Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement is an example. It has yet to win full ratification by all EU member states. The Europeans seem not to care, given all the Canadian interprovincial trade barriers that also complicate EU trade with Canada. In Britain, objections to Canada's dairy and supply management systems as well as rules of origin closed the doors on free trade. The world isn't made up of countries that want to trade with Canada because they are our family or friends. It's comprised of countries who only value how Canada can serve their economic needs and political agendas.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. She has served in the Department of State's Office of Policy Planning and as National Intelligence Officer for Russia and Eurasia. Russia's aggression against Ukraine and other neighbors is transforming the Black Sea into Eurasia's strategic frontier. Russia has disrupted flows of energy, food, and other commodities; generated millions of migrants; and heightened insecurity not just in Ukraine but also across the entire Black Sea region. These efforts constitute part of a much longer and larger strategy. Russia does not merely seek to dominate Ukraine. It wants to render each of the other five states that border the Black Sea—as well as Moldova, which borders Romania and Ukraine and whose waters flow into the sea—subservient to its interests so that it can exercise veto power over choices these countries make. Russia's quest to become the dominant force in the Black Sea is an essential element in its strategy to reassert itself as a great power. Turkey poses the greatest obstacle to Russian objectives in the region because it is the only Black Sea state that Russia has not historically dominated and it is a NATO member. In recent decades, Russia has sought to further subordinate these states to Moscow through a combination of persuasion and coercion. Increasing Russia's Black Sea presence is also at the heart of President Vladimir Putin's decades-long plan to resurrect the country's maritime power. He prioritized modernizing the Black Sea Fleet, whose interventions proved critical in supporting Russia's Mediterranean Squadron and its 2015 intervention in Syria. Although Ukraine has prevented Russia from taking all of its Black Sea coast, Moscow has deployed naval mines as well as blockaded and bombed Ukrainian ports to sever Ukraine's sea access and minimize the presence of other navies. Failing to do so will likely prolong the war, further enable Russia's massive human rights violations, exacerbate refugee flows, and provoke turbulence in global energy and commodity markets. Turkey was its main competitor, but Moscow came to dominate all the other Black Sea coastal states. After the Soviet Union collapsed, in 1991, Russia's regional role changed dramatically. As a result, Russia lost its access to parts of the Black Sea coastline. In March 2014, Putin justified the annexation of Crimea by warning that otherwise, “NATO ships would have ended up in the city of Russian navy glory, Sevastopol.” Between 2014 and 2022, the Kremlin tripled the amount of Black Sea coastline under its de facto control and strengthened its influence by wielding a combination of military, diplomatic, economic, energy, and disinformation tactics. The country's remaining westward pipeline gas routes run under the Black Sea to Turkey and then on to southeastern Europe. The sea is also vital to Russian agriculture: Russia routes almost all of its grain exports and a significant proportion of its fertilizer and other agricultural goods through its ports there. These flows enable Moscow to increase revenue, create new markets, establish trading systems less reliant on the U.S. dollar, and gain influence in recipient countries. Russia now employs a variety of interference tactics to swing Black Sea states toward Moscow. About eight percent of Georgians have been internally displaced because of that invasion and other Russian efforts to exploit the country's ethnic conflicts. But military campaigns are not the only way Russia has sought to bring the Black Sea region to heel. The Kremlin has frequently used disinformation to persuade populations in post-communist countries to align with Russia over what the Kremlin calls pro-Western elites, appealing to people disillusioned with their governments' failures. Moscow has also supported pro-Russian political parties, interfered in elections, and sought to carry out coups against incumbents. Moscow cut all gas transit through Ukraine to Europe several times before its initial 2014 incursion and shut off gas supplies to Bulgaria in 2022 and Moldova in early 2025. It has restricted food flows, banning wheat exports to Georgia or limiting Moldovan wine exports to Russia, for instance, to discipline Georgia and Moldova when it believes that either is diverging from Moscow's priorities. The Kremlin also deploys espionage and sabotage to destabilize these societies. Its ability to disrupt maritime traffic has scrambled regional energy flows: although Russia's gas exports to Bulgaria, Romania, and Ukraine have declined significantly since February 2022, its exports to Georgia and Turkey have increased substantially as each of those countries has refused to join sanctions on Russia. Turkey has become the world's largest buyer of Russian refined oil products. Many of these imports are relabeled in Georgia and Turkey and then reexported to circumvent the European Union's import ban. The sea has also become a major staging area for Russia's “shadow fleet” of unregistered ships, which it uses to circumvent Western sanctions. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev calls food Russia's “silent weapon.” The Kremlin has stolen Ukrainian agricultural products and bombed Ukraine's farmlands, agricultural infrastructure, and ports to undercut a primary source of Kyiv's revenue and gain new markets for Moscow. Russia's efforts to destabilize other Black Sea states are a tale of uneven successes and setbacks. The region's weakest links are Georgia and Moldova. Russian forces are stationed in each country's breakaway regions, and broader domestic discontent provides fertile ground for subversive Russian tactics. Georgia's ruling party, Georgian Dream, has turned toward Russia, suspending accession negotiations with the EU in November 2024 and later introducing legislation that represses freedom of speech and assembly. Although a large segment of Georgian society opposes these moves, the party has managed to win successive elections; many Georgians fear that if the country continues along a pro-EU path, Russia will invade again. The victory of pro-Western candidates in recent Moldovan and Romanian elections illustrates the limits of Russian interference, but the Kremlin is working hard to manipulate Moldova's fall 2025 parliamentary elections to boost pro-Russian parties. Moscow has secured access to key grain markets at Ukraine's expense, but flexing its agricultural power has aggravated tensions with recipient countries. African leaders have told Putin that the war has created food insecurity: in July 2023, for instance, the Kenyan diplomat Korir Sing'Oei called Russia's withdrawal from a pact that allowed Ukraine to export grain through the Black Sea “a stab on the back.” Although Moscow has managed to leverage the sea to evade sanctions, generate revenue, and access critical technology, that effort has required developing elaborate and inefficient trading and shipping schemes, and some Black Sea countries have also sought alternative energy sources. Ukraine's success in denying sea control to Russia and inflicting heavy damage on its Black Sea Fleet has crimped Moscow's influence over nearby regions. Ankara has complex ties with Moscow: Turkey is a significant trading partner and purchaser of Russian oil, as well as a key transit route for Russian gas. Moscow remains a significant player in the South Caucasus but has lost its role as the regional hegemon; Turkey now plays a much more important regional role than it did before 2022. Until 2023, Russia acted as Armenia's protector in its conflict with Azerbaijan over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, but when Azerbaijan attacked Armenia in 2023, Russia, its military overextended, did not come to Armenia's assistance. It needs such influence: the loss of Russia's Khmeimim Air Base and Tartus Naval Base in Syria would complicate Moscow's efforts to expand its operations in the Mediterranean and Africa. Policymakers seeking to exploit Moscow's mixed record in the Black Sea must overcome several challenges. The end of U.S. foreign assistance programs in Ukraine and other states in the region geared toward fighting corruption, supporting an independent news media, and promoting economic development, health, and good governance has left a gap that only EU and NATO allies can fill. Brussels's plan is full of good intentions but lacks concrete commitments and has no budget. NATO has focused on defending its northeastern flank, even though Russia's last three invasions have taken place in the Black Sea, not the Baltic. In the past three years, EU and NATO countries have prioritized their own resilience strategies; now they must develop plans to stabilize vulnerable Black Sea partners. The EU should forge West-East corridors that link the Mediterranean, Black, and Caspian Seas––circumventing Russia and including Turkey, which EU plans have thus far avoided. Additionally, members of the Three Seas Initiative, which seeks to build digital, energy, and transport links between the Adriatic, Black, and Baltic Seas, should invite Ukraine and Moldova to become full members Black Sea states should further develop their own considerable energy resources. The war has limited Ukraine's ability to exploit its gas resources, but in peacetime, EU and U.S. energy companies and international financial assistance could help the country become a major gas producer. Ankara often diverges from its NATO allies on the nature of regional challenges: it has armed Ukraine and refused to recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea, for instance, but maintains lucrative commercial ties with Moscow. Turkey opposes a formal NATO maritime presence in the sea involving countries outside its immediate coastal region. But Ankara is offering concrete material support for Bulgaria's and Romania's defense modernization efforts. The alliance could bolster its forward presence by improving air defense capabilities and deploying additional forces to its multinational battle groups in Bulgaria and Romania. Enhanced intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance could better monitor Russian activities. Strengthening U.S. support for NATO and EU initiatives can have an outsize impact at relatively low cost. Following the Trump-Putin Alaska summit, however, it is unclear whether Trump will exert pressure on Russia to end the conflict, which may continue for some time. Yet halting Moscow's expansionist aims must start with ending that war. Russia's targeting of civilian infrastructure has already pushed millions from their homes and entrenched Russian domination in occupied Ukrainian lands. Efforts to end the war must be paired with a robust strategy to prevent Moscow's dominance in the greater Black Sea region. If such steps fail to stabilize the region, Russia's aggression in Ukraine may well extend to Moldova and Georgia and could even balloon into a direct confrontation with NATO states that border the Black Sea—the consequences of which would ripple across markets worldwide and threaten an even wider variety of U.S. and European interests.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. He served for 35 years as a CIA officer, including as National Intelligence Officer for East Asia from 2015 to 2018. For the high command of the People's Liberation Army, Xi Jinping's third term as China's president has been a period of almost operatic tumult. By the end of his tenure, Xi could well exceed the mercurial Mao Zedong in his body count of officers who have been purged. Although Xi oversaw military purges earlier in his career and even imposed a sweeping overhaul of the PLA's command structure in 2015, this recent shakeup has raised eyebrows since many of the affected men were Xi's putative allies rather than potential political rivals. The ousting of senior officers who were once considered untouchable has fed a flurry of rumors that Xi is losing his grip over the PLA—and even prompted more extreme claims that Xi's own political demise might be imminent. Much like a Mafia don, Xi has shown that he considers even his associates to be disposable. More important, the staggering political casualties reflect that he is losing patience with his military rather than his control over it. The moves demonstrate his continued dissatisfaction with the PLA's high command and can be seen as part of an ongoing process of achieving his larger goals of bending the military to his will. Indeed, Xi wants to ensure he can employ violence with confidence, but Xi's confidence seems to be the rarest and most precious commodity for an otherwise well-resourced military. Two goals have driven his unforgiving management of the PLA. His paramount aim is ensuring the military is thoroughly politicized and thus willing to fulfill its role as the ultimate guarantor of the party's rule should it be challenged by internal unrest. And Xi also wants a military that can fight if he needs it to do so, including against the U.S. military. In other words, Xi's iron grip on the military not only endures, it is also indicative of his obsession with breaking the PLA's insularity and endemic corruption and ensuring that, should he need to bet the regime on the military's prowess, it will not fail. The two men overlapped with Xi in Fujian Province earlier in their careers and were believed to enjoy a special relationship as a result. But He is now missing (he hasn't been seen in public since March), and Miao was removed from his post in November 2024. The more mundane is that these purges reflect embarrassingly poor judgment by Xi in his choice of subordinates. The more extravagant is that they reflect a burgeoning movement among disaffected party and military leaders who now seek to challenge or even remove Xi. Neither of these hypotheses stands up to scrutiny, however. If the political turmoil inside the PLA was in fact embarrassing to Xi, it would be covered up rather than publicly acknowledged, as most of these cases have been. If the party excels at nothing else, it is adept at propagandizing and protecting the leadership's image, particularly Xi's. After a decade of seemingly supine obeisance, there is no obvious reason why the military leadership would suddenly rouse itself to oppose Xi. But so far, the PLA has not only succumbed to Xi's sweeping reforms, it also seems to be earnestly preparing for Xi's order to provide military options for a Taiwan contingency by 2027. Historically, the PLA has been loath to wade too deeply into politics. Xi still has close ties to key senior officers, after all, especially CMC Vice Chairman General Zhang Youxia, whom Xi has known for decades and whose father was close friends with Xi's father. Xi has even allowed Zhang to remain CMC vice chairman after he exceeded the party's informal retirement age—a remarkable and clear sign of Xi's trust in him. Zhang has also survived Xi's anticorruption campaign unscathed despite having previously run the PLA's Equipment Development Department, which has been a focal point of the most recent round of purges. And given that corruption is such a widespread reality of life in the PLA, especially since Xi initiated his pricey military modernization program, the recently purged officers may have miscalculated that their ties to Xi would allow them to line their pockets with impunity. The scale and drama of these machinations in the high command, however, raise deeper questions about why Xi has been so fixated on the military—and so ruthless in his management of it. As the son of a leader who played a major role in China's civil war, Xi was more comfortable with military affairs than his two predecessors—both of whom were engineers with little prior exposure to the military. Xi's immediate predecessor, Hu Jintao, had few if any identifiable allies among senior PLA officers and struggled to exercise full control over the military. Yet in 2010 when Xi became a member of the CMC and the Chinese Communist Party's heir apparent, he was probably alarmed by what he discovered at PLA headquarters. Thanks to the domination of generals loyal to former leader Jiang Zemin, who sustained his influence throughout the Hu era (2002–12), the PLA had become an insular and unwieldy institution that was spending more time protecting its own parochial interests than operating as a joint force globally or even regionally. Indeed, Xi started his tenure as commander in chief by promulgating the idea that the PLA needed to be prepared “to fight and win battles,” a turn of phrase that rather patronizingly implied that the PLA was not currently prepared to do so. Xi also likely found that behind the wall of PLA insularity, there was extensive corruption. As one of Xi's princeling allies famously commented, corruption had become so rife in the PLA that “only our own corruption can defeat us.” It is a sprawling, opaque, and technologically advanced empire unto itself within the party apparatus, and even civilian Communist Party leaders often can't understand, penetrate, or control it. Unlike in the United States, there is no cadre of civilian experts on military affairs either inside or outside the PLA. Paradoxically, this has bred an increasing degree of professionalism: senior officers in the PLA are neutral experts focused on warfighting and not on politics. Although an apolitical military appeals to democracies such as the United States, this trend would have startled rather than mollified Xi. In the Chinese political system, the military is supposed to be thoroughly politicized: virtually all officers are required to be members of the Chinese Communist Party and both senior commanders and the rank and file devote considerable time to ideological education and other tasks that are ancillary to military proficiency. During China's 1989 pro-democracy movement, the PLA's support for quashing the protesters in Tiananmen Square rested on a narrow consensus; many senior PLA officers opposed martial law and the military was paralyzed for a month before paramount leader Deng Xiaoping could sway the outcome. For any civilian leader, this state of affairs would be troubling. But for a Leninist leader like Xi, it was unacceptable. He arrested and purged two retired but influential vice chairmen of the CMC for accepting bribes before purging several other senior officers across a wide swath of the PLA. Xi's reforms wrested operational control from the services and handed it over to a novel command structure that is streamlined and reflects Xi's dual emphasis on strict party control and joint operations. This is a marked shift from just 20 years ago, when the ground forces still dominated the PLA's priorities and institutions. Those services have grown, meanwhile, while the army has been cut by almost 500,000 since 2010. Given the audacity of Xi's purges and reforms, many analysts have expected—or even hoped for—some kind of backlash against Xi for more than a decade. Yet Xi made these extensive renovations to the high command with no visible sign of dissent. It was a gamble, but the moves effectively bludgeoned resistance and seemed to enhance Xi's stature. Indeed, power in Chinese politics tends to accrue like compound interest rather than depreciate, and the potential for opposition to Xi has dissipated rather than coalesced over time. This dynamic was most vividly on display at the last party congress, in 2022, when Xi not only evicted the already marginalized allies of his predecessor Hu from the leadership lineup but also had Hu himself physically removed from the proceedings while Xi looked on impassively. Xi's focus on reforming the PLA is often portrayed in the West as a myopic obsession with unification with Taiwan. Xi's overbearing approach to the PLA not only ensures Xi's military objectives, it also serves his political objectives. Keeping senior officers uncertain about their career prospects and reliant on Xi for their promotions and livelihoods allows Xi to cultivate multiple channels of information from within the PLA so that he can puncture that wall of insularity and triangulate what he hears from different sources. This tactic is especially important as the PLA modernizes to conduct twenty-first-century warfare and becomes even more impenetrable for senior party civilian leaders. For many observers, Xi's approach may seem counterproductive. Stringent management of the PLA and the relentlessness of Xi's anticorruption campaign is probably both humiliating and demoralizing for senior officers. Yet Xi probably sees such suffering among the high command as having a salutary effect. Xi's own father was ousted from power and imprisoned multiple times during his long career in the CCP—trials that seem to have deepened his loyalty to the party rather than undermined it. For more than 40 years, the PLA has been a peacetime military unbloodied by actual conflict. He wants a military that is inured to such trials and ready to take on the most difficult missions, whether that is punishing its purported compatriots in Taiwan and fending off a potential U.S. intervention, or even employing violence to protect the party from its fellow citizens. As Xi noted in his first speech to the PLA after becoming commander in chief, the Soviet Union fell because “nobody was man enough to stand up and resist.” Xi is obsessed with ensuring that the PLA's men would resist if need be—but he is still not confident they would.
