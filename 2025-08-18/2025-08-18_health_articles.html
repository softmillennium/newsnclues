                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This biochemical process, which involves the attachment of fucose to glycoproteins and glycolipids, plays a fundamental role in cell adhesion, signal transduction, and immune response modulation. The latest insights reveal how genetic mutations in fucosyltransferases (FUTs) contribute to disease susceptibility. Variations in these genes can alter the fucosylation process, leading to inflammatory responses, barrier dysfunction, and increased cancer risk. Similarly, changes in fucosylated glycans affect the adhesion and invasion of Helicobacter pylori, a key factor in gastric cancer. Elevated levels of fucosylated biomarkers in the bloodstream provide valuable diagnostic indicators, enhancing the ability to differentiate between benign and malignant conditions. The disruption of fucosylation pathways also contributes to pancreatic cancer progression, where specific fucosylation patterns are associated with tumor aggressiveness and chemotherapy resistance. The use of fucose-based treatments and fucosylation inhibitors demonstrates promising effects in modulating immune responses and tumor growth. These targeted approaches aim to restore normal fucosylation patterns, offering new avenues for personalized medicine and disease management. The role of fucosylation in digestive diseases and cancers is increasingly recognized as a critical element in biomedical research and clinical applications. Advancements in diagnostic biomarker identification and the development of fucosylation-targeted therapies pave the way for innovative treatment options. By further exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying fucosylation-related disorders, the medical community moves closer to more effective interventions and improved patient outcomes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With a $1 million Impact Award from the U.S. Department of Defense, Tianfu Wu, a University of Houston biomedical engineer, is developing a method to send medication directly to the spleen where certain immune cells cause the disease known as lupus, or Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. Lupus is a debilitating autoimmune disease characterized by uncontrolled disease activity, frequent flares, long-term immunosuppression, increasing infection rates, cumulative organ damage and decreased quality of life. The spleen has often been called the security guard of the bloodstream, filtering out old or damaged blood cells while housing millions of white blood cells, or lymphocytes, that carry out immune system functions. The current therapeutic landscape for lupus is often marred by systemic side effects and relatively limited efficacy. To address these challenges, we are proposing a spleen-specific selective organ targeting lipid nanoparticle drug delivery system to modulate immune responses and mitigate symptoms with minimal side effects." "New drug delivery systems are urgently needed to provide more effective treatment options that fine-tune or modulate the immune system rather than employing systemic immunosuppression or B-cell depletion," said Wu. "Systemic immunosuppression can lead to severe side effects and increase the risk of infections, while systemic B-cell depletion may wipe out beneficial B cells, leading to unfavorable complications." This work may mark the first instance of a spleen-specific targeting system being designed, developed and applied in lupus models.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Innovative intervention delivered by trained community health workers – meaning nonclinical personnel with deep knowledge of the community – increased treatment utilization among participating families with children who have ADHD, according to a pilot study published in the Journal of Attention Disorders. "We know from previous studies that compared to White youth, Black, Hispanic, and Asian children with ADHD receive less treatment, including fewer visits with a healthcare provider and lower medication use," said lead author Andrea Spencer, MD, Vice Chair for Research, Pritzker Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago and Associate Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. "We are excited to make a tangible difference for children and their families by using a community-based approach to ADHD that has proved to be so successful for other pediatric conditions, like asthma," she said. "When so many children have an illness and access to care is inadequate, we need to think beyond individual patient interactions and develop public health solutions. This is the first study to use an intervention for ADHD delivered by community health workers." Treatment, which includes a combination of FDA-approved medication, behavioral therapy and school accommodations, is effective at reducing symptoms and can improve ADHD outcomes. Dr. Spencer explained that barriers to ADHD care include logistical difficulties, such as finances, insurance, transportation and lack of childcare. Also stigma, discrimination and implicit bias affect families' experiences with engaging in ADHD care for their children. In developing content for the intervention, Dr. Spencer and colleagues sought guidance from a Community Advisory Board consisting of racial and ethnic minoritized caregivers of children with ADHD, public school staff, pediatric clinical providers and leaders, child mental health clinicians and child mental health equity researchers. The pilot study initially included 18 caregivers of children with recently diagnosed ADHD aged 6-12 years. We received overwhelmingly positive feedback about the content and strategy addressing stigma in particular. Caregivers reported that the intervention helped them confront their own stigma about ADHD, as well as stigma from others. A community-based approach really can change the stigma associated with ADHD and hopefully get more kids into treatment." Dr. Andrea Spencer, MD, Vice Chair for Research, Pritzker Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago Ninety-four percent of caregivers reported that the intervention made them feel more confident in seeking treatment for ADHD, and many caregivers reported that the program made them more likely to consider medications (69 percent), therapy (75 percent), and school services (88 percent) for their child's ADHD. "Based on our promising results, we are planning a larger study, a randomized clinical trial, to evaluate the effectiveness of our intervention," said Dr. Spencer. Study activities were done at Boston Medical Center/Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The study found that a lack of Polβ leads to a significant increase in small insertions and deletions of DNA, known as indels near CpG sites, which are important regulatory regions in genes. This accumulation of mutations could contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders. The human brain undergoes intricate developmental processes, meticulously guided by genetic blueprints. However, DNA damage can occur during these stages, potentially leading to irreversible mutations in nerve cells if not properly repaired. This study demonstrates that Polβ is essential in preventing a specific type of mutation known as insertion-deletion (indel) mutations near CpG sites, regions of the genome with high gene regulatory activity. These sites undergo dynamic changes in methylation, a chemical modification of DNA, during brain development. In the absence of Polβ, indel mutations near CpG sites increased approximately ninefold. This research highlights a previously unknown role of Polβ in safeguarding the integrity of the genome during brain development. The findings suggest that deficiencies in Polβ could contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders arising from accumulated mutations. This research provides a new molecular basis for understanding the origin of brain developmental disorders and may contribute to preventative techniques in the future. We believe this finding offers a new perspective on the causes of neurodevelopmental disorders and opens up exciting avenues for neuroscience, cancer, and aging research."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers found there was a significant, positive relationship between the two, concluding that highly sensitive people are more likely to experience depression and anxiety compared to those who are less sensitive. In the study, sensitivity was defined as a personality trait that reflects people's capacity to perceive and process environmental stimuli such as bright lights, subtle changes in the environment and other peoples' moods. Often overlooked in mental health studies and clinical practice, which tend to focus on neuroticism and its association with mental health conditions, this research shows that understanding a person's sensitivity level is important and can have therapeutic implications. For example, people with more sensitive personality traits may be more likely to benefit from treatment plans which involve techniques such as applied relaxation and mindfulness, which can also prevent relapse. Tom Falkenstein, psychotherapist and PhD student at Queen Mary University of London "In addition, our findings could help improve treatment for these individuals. Around 31% of the general population are considered highly sensitive, and, as our findings show, are more likely to respond better to some psychological interventions than less sensitive individuals. Therefore, sensitivity should be considered when thinking about treatment plans for mental health conditions. Our work shows it is crucial that the awareness of sensitivity is improved among mental health care professionals, so clinicians and practitioners can recognise the trait in their patients, and tailor treatment to their sensitivity." "This is the first meta-analysis providing robust evidence that highly sensitive people are more prone to common mental health problems. Our results provide further evidence that sensitive people are more affected by both negative and positive experiences and that the quality of their environment is particularly important for their well-being." The systematic review and meta analysis of 33 studies was carried out by an academic team from several universities including Queen Mary University and the University of Surrey.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tumor angiogenesis, a critical process in cancer progression, is characterized by the formation of new blood vessels that sustain tumor growth by supplying oxygen and nutrients. Understanding the diverse sources and mechanisms of endothelial cell development is essential for improving anti-angiogenic therapies, which aim to block blood vessel formation and, consequently, hinder tumor proliferation. This review delves into the origins of endothelial cells in both normal and tumor angiogenesis, revealing that while normal angiogenesis is typically a structured and regulated process, tumor angiogenesis is notably chaotic and disorganized. Additionally, cancer-associated fibroblasts and immature dendritic cells may transdifferentiate into vascular ECs within the tumor microenvironment. Although anti-angiogenic agents have been a pivotal element in cancer treatment, the limited efficacy and resistance of these therapies pose significant challenges. The review outlines the mechanisms of drug resistance, which include adaptive angiogenesis, alternative pathway activation, and genetic heterogeneity within endothelial cells. This resistance often results in the incomplete inhibition of blood vessel growth, allowing tumors to adapt and continue proliferating. Innovations in therapy must consider the heterogeneous nature of tumor vasculature to overcome resistance and enhance clinical outcomes. This review offers a nuanced understanding of endothelial cell biology in tumors. By focusing on the origins and adaptive mechanisms of tumor vasculature, it sets the stage for the development of more precise and effective therapeutic strategies to combat cancer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study warns that contamination from laboratory reagents could be misleading scientists worldwide in their hunt for emerging infectious diseases. Researchers found that silica membranes-commonly used in nucleic acid extraction kits-can harbor parvoviruses and other viral contaminants, creating false virus–host associations in metagenomic sequencing (mNGS) data. These misleading links can affect clinical diagnostics, zoonotic surveillance, and public health responses. In mNGS analyses of patient samples from multiple regions in China, the team detected dozens of parvovirus sequences that closely matched viruses previously attributed to bats, birds, pangolins, and other animals. Follow-up investigations revealed that these sequences originated not from patients but from the silica columns and certain sampling tubes used in laboratory workflows. Testing across 28 commercial kits showed contamination from 13 different viral families, with Parvoviridae being the most frequent. To address this widespread problem, the researchers developed the Panoramic Virus Discovery Data Chain (PVDDC)-a high-quality, traceable dataset integrating viral genomic data, laboratory workflows, reagent records, and host associations. Combining big data curation with large language model ChatGPT‐4o, PVDDC standardizes virus–host relationships and enables contamination tracing. By applying this framework, the team found that many parvoviruses linked to humans in public databases lack robust experimental evidence and may instead be artifacts of reagent contamination. Importantly, the PVDDC framework is not limited to parvoviruses-it can be adapted to investigate and mitigate contamination for a wide range of viral taxa, making it a versatile tool for improving the reliability of mNGS-based pathogen surveillance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rapid mixing accessories designed to conduct stopped flow measurements are utilized to characterize interactions and reactions occurring in solution. Reactants are expelled from syringes, mixed, and injected into a flow cell. If one of the reactants exhibits fluorescence, this phenomenon can be utilized to track the interaction. However, intensity-based methods can be affected by fluctuations in the detected signal, such as those resulting from photobleaching. While this can be avoided by utilizing the fluorescence lifetime, data collection times have constrained its usage. The recent introduction of significantly low deadtime electronics, combined with high repetition rate excitation sources, now facilitates efficient and rapid measurement of fluorescence decays. In such cases, the interaction of a fluorescent curcuminoid mixture is monitored with serum albumin via a stopped flow accessory on the DeltaFlex platform with DeltaDiode excitation at 100 MHz. A typical stopped flow accessory is presented schematically in Figure 1. A stop limits the volume entering the syringe and can be utilized to generate an electronic signal to initiate data collection, if configured. Schematic representation of a stopped flow set up. Mixing reactions occurring on the millisecond timescale can be tracked with this method. Previous studies involving fluorescence have utilized intensity-based approaches. However, fluctuations in excitation source intensity and sample photobleaching can affect these types of measurements. Until recently, instrumentation lacked the efficiency to obtain data on these timescales. However, the introduction of significantly low deadtime electronics, combined with high repetition rate excitation sources, now makes such measurements viable. The kinetic TCSPC measurement mode, available in both the DeltaFlex and DeltaPro platforms, allows the acquisition of up to 10,000 time‐resolved fluorescence decays, with each histogram seamlessly collected in as little as 1 ms. For short data collection times, this level of efficiency is necessary to achieve adequate data quality. DeltaFlex with stopped flow accessory entering via a “split” sample chamber lid. Using the DataStation control software, data acquisition can be initiated either via an external TTL signal from the stopped flow accessory (if configured) or manually within the software, in the kinetic TCSPC measurement mode. The examination of curcuminoid interactions with proteins holds significance, as these compounds are being promoted for their potential health benefits. The role of serum albumin in the blood makes it a suitable model protein for observing this interaction. In this experiment, a syringe was filled with a solution of curcuminoid in DMSO/buffer, with the other reactant syringe containing serum albumin in buffer. In this solvent mixture, the curcuminoids possess weak fluorescence and display a short fluorescence lifetime. To maximize photon collection, a repetition rate of 100 MHz was employed, and a 2 ms collection time per decay was utilized. Data acquisition was initiated in DataStation to provide a “background”, and the reactants were manually expelled. This plot can be used to calculate kinetic rates if necessary. Change in average fluorescence lifetime with time. The excitation source was a DD‐395L operating at 100 MHz with decay histograms collected every 2 ms. Due to the limited photostability of curcuminoids, photostability is a risk when using these compounds in a small-volume flow cell with a high-intensity (and repetition rate) excitation source. This is demonstrated in a second measurement (conducted under similar settings), employing 5 ms per decay data collection time for the acquisition of the 10,000 time‐resolved fluorescence decay curves. Comparison between intensity and lifetime data obtained from a stopped flow measurement with data collected every 5 ms. However, it is worth noting that the fluorescence lifetime remains stable. The influence of photobleaching has obvious implications if this kinetic process were to be analyzed with the intensity-based measurement. This was operated in the kinetic TCSPC measurement mode, aided by the use of a high repetition rate excitation source combined with significantly low dead time electronics for efficient data collection.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Covid infection, particularly in women, may lead to blood vessels aging around five years, according to research published in the European Heart Journal on 18th August, 2025. Blood vessels gradually become stiffer with age, but the new study suggests that Covid could accelerate this process. Researchers say this is important since people with stiffer blood vessels face a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, including stroke and heart attack. The study was led by Professor Rosa Maria Bruno from Université Paris Cité, France. Since the pandemic, we have learned that many people who have had Covid are left with symptoms that can last for months or even years. However, we are still learning what's happening in the body to create these symptoms." Bruno added, "We know that Covid can directly affect blood vessels. We believe that this may result in what we call early vascular ageing, meaning that your blood vessels are older than your chronological age and you are more susceptible to heart disease. If that is happening, we need to identify who is at risk at an early stage to prevent heart attacks and strokes." The study included 2,390 people from 16 different countries (Austria, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Mexico, Norway, Turkey, UK and US) who were recruited between September 2020 to February 2022. Researchers assessed each person's vascular age with a device that measures how quickly a wave of blood pressure travels between the carotid artery (in the neck) and femoral arteries (in the legs), a measure called carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV). Researchers also recorded demographic information such as patient's sex, age and other factors that can influence cardiovascular health. After taking these factors into consideration, researchers found that all three groups of patients who had been infected with Covid, including those with mild Covid, had stiffer arteries, compared to those who had not been infected. an increase of around 0.5 meters per second is "clinically relevant" and equivalent to ageing around five years, with a 3% increased risk of cardiovascular disease, in a 60-year-old woman. Professor Bruno added, "There are several possible explanations for the vascular effects of Covid. The virus uses these receptors to enter and infect cells. Our body's inflammation and immune responses, which defend against infections, may be also involved. Women mount a more rapid and robust immune response, which can protect them from infection. However, this same response can also increase damage to blood vessels after the initial infection. "Vascular ageing is easy to measure and can be addressed with widely available treatments, such as lifestyle changes, blood pressure-lowering and cholesterol-lowering drugs. In an accompanying editorial, Dr Behnood Bikdeli from Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA, and colleagues said: "Although the acute threat of the COVID-19 pandemic has waned, a new challenge emerged in its aftermath: post-acute COVID-19 syndrome. Defined by the World Health Organization as symptoms appearing three months post-infection and lasting at least two months, studies suggest that up to 40% of initial COVID-19 survivors develop this syndrome. "This large, multicentre, prospective cohort study enrolled 2390 participants from 34 centres to investigate whether arterial stiffness, as measured by PWV, persisted in individuals with recent COVID-19 infection. […] sex-stratified analyses revealed striking differences: females across all COVID-19-positive groups had significantly elevated PWV, with the highest increase (+1.09 m/s) observed in those requiring ICU admission. The question is whether we can find modifiable targets to prevent this in future surges of infection, and mitigate adverse outcomes in those afflicted with COVID-19-induced vascular ageing."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A top-level review of clinical evidence confirms ginger's broad health benefits, from anti-inflammatory and antidiabetic effects to easing nausea in pregnancy, with potential as a safe, natural therapy. Review: Pharmacological properties of ginger (Zingiber officinale): what do meta-analyses say? In a recent systematic review published in Frontiers in Pharmacology, researchers at Burrell College of Osteopathic Medicine and Mercer University School of Medicine in the United States collated and synthesized five high-quality clinical publications (meta-analyses) to investigate the effects of ginger (Zingiber officinale) on inflammation, blood sugar, and other physiological metrics, thereby informing its use as a functional food. Review findings confirm that ginger supplementation significantly reduces key markers of inflammation, lowers blood glucose and glycohemoglobin (HbA1c) in type 2 diabetes (T2D), and improves antioxidant status. It has also been shown to alleviate pregnancy-associated nausea effectively. However, it did not significantly reduce vomiting episodes, and vitamin B6 was significantly more effective at improving overall nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) symptom scores in some trials. These findings support ginger's potential as a generally safe and multifaceted therapeutic agent for various common health conditions, though limitations in study quality and consistency remain. Human history is full of examples of ancient cultures leveraging herbs and spices as more than just flavor enhancers, but also to promote health and treat illness. Ginger, with its characteristic pungent flavor derived from bioactive compounds like gingerols and shogaols, remains one of the most celebrated. Modern science has sought to validate these claims, exploring ginger's potential to manage conditions like type 2 diabetes (T2D), oxidative stress, and pregnancy-associated nausea and vomiting (NVP). Meta-analyses, reviews that pool the results of multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and reanalyse this pooled data holistically, address between-study confounds and provide more substantial evidence. The present systematic review attempts to address these knowledge gaps by conducting a "review of reviews" designed to consolidate the highest evidence on ginger's therapeutic effects. Publications for inclusion in the review were identified via a custom keyword search of several credible online scientific repositories (PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Cochrane, and ISI Web of Science) from January 2010 to the end of March 2025. Subsequently, title, abstract, and full text screening were employed to assess study applicability. Only five meta-analyses were ultimately included from more than 2,000 initially identified records. The review focused on the associations between ginger consumption or supplementation and four key health outcomes: inflammation, T2D, oxidative stress, and NVP. Data extractions comprised crucial quantitative findings and conclusions from each of these papers. The present review established ginger's physiological benefits across all four areas of focus. A meta-analysis by Morvaridzadeh et al. (2020), which included 16 RCTs, found that ginger supplementation led to significant reductions in key inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP; Mean Difference = -5.11), high-sensitivity CRP (MD = -0.88), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) (MD = -0.85). These markers demonstrate validated associations with a wide range of chronic diseases. However, inter-study heterogeneity was very high (I² > 89%), which limits the strength of these conclusions. The meta-analysis by Zhu et al. (2018) of 10 RCTs revealed ginger's powerful effect on glycemic control. Supplementation was observed to significantly lower fasting blood glucose (MD = -21.24 mg/dL, P < 0.001) and, significantly, also reduced glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (MD = -1.00, P < 0.001), a key indicator of long-term blood sugar management. These findings were supported by low heterogeneity, increasing their reliability. The meta-analysis of 12 RCTs by Sheikhhossein et al. (2021) showed improved antioxidant status following ginger supplementation. The spice significantly reduced levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) (MD = -1.45, P = 0.001), a marker of lipid damage, while simultaneously increasing the activity of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase (GPx) (MD = 1.93, P = 0.029). However, it did not significantly increase total antioxidant capacity (TAC). For nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, a meta-analysis by Viljoen et al. (2014) of 12 RCTs found that ginger was significantly more effective than placebo at reducing nausea symptoms (P = 0.0002). However, it did not have a statistically significant effect on the frequency of vomiting. This limitation was not consistently highlighted across all studies. A separate meta-analysis by Gaur et al. (2022) found that while ginger and vitamin B6 had comparable effects on vomiting, vitamin B6 was significantly better at improving total NVP symptom scores. Ginger also increased the risk of belching, a statistically significant side effect. Notably, the typical ginger supplementation doses used in these trials ranged from 500 to 1,500 mg daily for NVP and 1 to 3 g daily for anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antidiabetic effects, highlighting a lack of standardization even in clinical research, let alone consumer supply. The present systematic review synthesized the results of five meta-analyses and found that ginger is a generally safe and potentially effective therapeutic agent with a moderate to strong evidence base. Review findings robustly support its use as an effective anti-inflammatory, an adjunct therapy for managing T2D, a potent antioxidant, and a safe remedy for pregnancy-related nausea. However, its effects on vomiting are not consistently significant, and vitamin B6 appears more effective overall for NVP symptoms.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research from the Charles Perkins Centre at the University of Sydney has uncovered a new biological pathway that may help explain why people with type 2 diabetes are more prone to developing dangerous blood clots, potentially paving the way for future treatments that reduce their cardiovascular risk. A protein called SEC61B has been found to be significantly increased in the platelets of people with type 2 diabetes. Importantly, the researchers showed that blocking SEC61B activity with an antibiotic – anisomycin – reduced platelet clumping in human samples and animal models. People living with type 2 diabetes are vulnerable to increased risk of blood clots. These exciting findings identify a whole new way to reduce this risk and help prevent life-threatening complications like heart attack and stroke." Associate Professor Freda Passam from the Central Clinical School, University of Sydney "Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death in this group, partly due to the heightened activity of platelets – the tiny blood cells that help form clots. This heightened platelet sensitivity to clotting also makes traditional anti-coagulant treatments less effective in people with type 2 diabetes, limiting the options to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease." The research team used advanced proteomic techniques to study human and mouse platelets, discovering that SEC61B contributes to calcium leakage from stores of the mineral within platelets, which in turn makes platelets more reactive. While treatments targeting SEC61B are still in early stages, the researchers believe pre-clinical trials in animals could begin within 1–2 years, with potential therapies for patients on the horizon in the next decade. SEC61B regulates calcium flux and platelet hyperreactivity in diabetes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A research team led by Dr. Juyeon Jung at the Bio-Nano Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB), has developed a nanobody-based technology that can precisely identify and attack only lung cancer cells, opening new possibilities for cancer therapy. This breakthrough addresses the limitations of conventional chemotherapy by reducing harmful side effects while maximizing cancer cell-killing efficiency. Current chemotherapies often attack healthy cells as well, leading to severe side effects such as hair loss, nausea, and immune suppression, and frequently fail to deliver drugs precisely to cancer cells, reducing treatment effectiveness. To overcome these challenges, the team developed the A5 nanobody - a miniature antibody that binds specifically to CD155, a protein found in high abundance on lung cancer cells. The A5 nanobody is roughly 10 times smaller than conventional antibodies, enabling it to penetrate deep into tissues. It binds selectively to cancer cells without affecting healthy cells, inhibiting lung cancer cell migration and invasion by more than 50%. In experiments, A5-LNP-DOX delivered up to three times more drug into cancer cells than conventional methods, significantly enhancing cancer cell death while leaving healthy cells largely unharmed. Tests in animal models and patient-derived organoids showed tumor size reductions of 70–90% and substantial increases in cancer cell death markers. No damage was detected in major organs such as the liver, heart, or kidneys, indicating a highly safe treatment profile. Our study presents a new therapeutic strategy capable of precisely targeting cancer cells and delivering drugs effectively. We expect this nanobody-based approach to serve as a versatile platform for treating not only lung cancer but also a variety of other cancers, contributing greatly to the advancement of precision medicine." Established in 1985, KRIBB focuses on advancing scientific knowledge in areas such as molecular biology, genomics, bioinformatics, synthetic biology, and aging-related studies. This research was supported by the Basic Research Program of the Ministry of Science and ICT(MSIT) and the Technology Commercialization Support Program of the Korea Agency of Education, Promotion and Evaluation for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries(IPET), as well as KRIBB Research Initiative Program.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study reveals that probiotics curb drug-resistant bacteria in premature babies, but antibiotics still drive resistance genes to spread, underscoring the urgent need for safer treatment strategies in NICUs. Study: Impact of early life antibiotic and probiotic treatment on gut microbiome and resistome of very-low-birth-weight preterm infants. In a recent study published in the journal Nature Communications, researchers determined how early antibiotic exposure and routine probiotic supplementation influence the gut microbiome, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), and multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogen dynamics in very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) preterm infants. About one in ten babies is born early, and VLBW infants under 1500 g begin life fragile. In Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs), broad-spectrum antibiotics can be lifesaving, yet they may disrupt the gut community that trains immunity and blocks harmful microbes. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends probiotics containing specific bacterial strains for very preterm, exclusively human milk-fed infants, prompting a practical question: can routine probiotics offset antibiotic risks? Hospitals also face MDR infections that endanger fragile newborns. Understanding how probiotics and antibiotics shape the resistome (the collection of ARGs) can guide safer care, and hence, further research is needed. This controlled sub-study from the Baby-Associated Microbiota of the Intestine (BAMBI) observational cohort followed 34 VLBW preterm infants under 33 weeks' gestation, all exclusively fed human milk or donor breastmilk, split into probiotic-supplemented (“PS”, receiving Bifidobacterium bifidum and Lactobacillus acidophilus [Infloran®]) and non-supplemented cohorts. Within each cohort, some infants received short empirical antibiotics (benzylpenicillin and/or gentamicin for a median of 3 days), while others did not. Fecal samples were collected weekly during weeks one to three. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing generated paired-end reads for assembly, and genome-resolved analyses reconstructed metagenome-assembled genomes alongside cultured isolates, enabling strain-level tracking. To probe horizontal gene transfer (HGT), the team quantified plasmid replicons, modeled candidate transfer events, and performed an ex vivo infant-gut experiment using preterm-derived Enterococcus faecium donor strains and a plasmid-free, gentamicin-sensitive laboratory recipient. Infant fecal slurry lacking Enterococcus served as matrix; selective plating on gentamicin and confirmatory whole-genome sequencing (WGS) verified acquired resistance. Culture work targeted Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, Klebsiella, and Escherichia species to complement sequencing. Across three weeks, the probiotic-supplemented cohort was dominated by Bifidobacterium, driven by the administered Bifidobacterium bifidum, with active replication (Index of Replication (iRep) > 1.5), while the non-supplemented cohort showed higher representation of early-life pathobionts such as Klebsiella, Escherichia, Enterococcus, and Staphylococcus. Functional pathway profiles diverged between cohorts beginning in week two, tracking these taxonomic differences. Genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides, macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramins, beta-lactams, trimethoprim, and tetracyclines were common, but fluoroquinolone and colistin resistance signatures were confined to non-supplemented infants. Notably, a colistin resistance gene (mcr-9.1) appeared in one non-supplemented sample, predating its formal discovery and underscoring hidden circulation of last-resort determinants. Short empirical antibiotics did not produce large alpha-diversity shifts, yet early tilts toward Klebsiella or Enterococcus were observed, especially in week one. Correlation analyses linked higher Bifidobacterium abundance with fewer ARGs, whereas Enterococcus and Staphylococcus tracked with higher ARG loads. MLST highlighted clinically relevant sequence types (STs), including Escherichia coli ST1193 and Klebsiella pneumoniae ST432; Enterococcus faecalis and coagulase-negative staphylococci (e.g., S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus) also included STs previously linked to neonatal units. Predicted HGT events were more frequent after antibiotic exposure, showing that even short courses can favor the movement of mobile elements. Related Enterococcus strains circulated among unrelated infants within the same hospitals, consistent with nosocomial transmission. The ex vivo infant-gut model provided mechanistic support: a 137-kb plasmid carrying an aminoglycoside resistance gene transferred from Enterococcus faecium donors to a plasmid-free recipient, conferring gentamicin resistance, confirmed via WGS. Probiotics tilted the gut toward beneficial microbes and away from ARG-rich pathobionts, though they did not eliminate HGT risk, while antibiotic stewardship remained critical to curb plasmid-mediated spread of resistance in the nursery. To summarize, in VLBW preterm infants, probiotic supplementation fostered Bifidobacterium-rich communities, reduced ARG burden, and limited MDR features compared with no probiotics. Yet Enterococcus persisted as a key reservoir, and short antibiotic courses increased the likelihood of HGT, particularly plasmid-mediated movement of resistance genes. Practically, pairing evidence-based probiotics with antibiotic stewardship and infection control can help protect this population. Longer follow-up and multi-site trials are needed to refine dosing, duration, and strain choice to maximize benefits while minimizing resistance risks.
