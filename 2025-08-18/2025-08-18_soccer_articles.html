Christian Pulisic put AC Milan on top over Bari, scoring the second goal in the 2-0 victory to open the 2025-26 Coppa Italia.

In the 48th minute, Pulisic slammed home a turnaround shot off a give-and-go with Santiago Giménez in the box. It was the USMNT forward's first goal in the knockout competition between Italy's top divisions — Serie A, Serie B, and Serie C. Bari is a Serie B club.

Pulisic was subbed off in the 66th minute, replaced by fellow National Team player Yunus Musah.

The first round victory pushes Milan into the second round of the tournament, where it'll face Serie A opponent U.S. Lecce Sept. 24.

AC Milan's Serie A schedule commences this coming weekend with a match against US Cremonese on Aug. 23. Last season, Pulisic led the club with 11 goals in league play.

The Turkey international's costly error against Arsenal has further underlined the Red Devils' need to sign a new No.1 before the window closes

Manchester United's lack of a reliable goalkeeper has been the elephant in the room throughout the summer transfer window, and on Sunday against Arsenal it started swinging its trunk around while making a deafening trumpet sound. Thousands of heads fell into their hands at Old Trafford when Altay Bayindir palmed Declan Rice's corner back towards his goal-line and onto the grateful head of Ricardo Calafiori - and to think that some United fans thought that Andre Onana missing the game was a good thing!...

Bayindir's error cost United at least a point from a game that Ruben Amorim justifiably claimed his side should have won, and thus gave the coach another strong argument to make to sporting director Jason Wilcox about the need to sign another 'keeper. Although he would never say it publicly, it seems evident that Amorim does not truly trust Onana or Bayindir, or indeed third-choice Tom Heaton.

He did not exactly give a stern defence of Onana when he made two massive errors against Lyon last season, and indeed dropped him for the following game at Newcastle to take the Cameroonian out of the firing line. Nor did Amorim properly defend Bayindir's abilities on Sunday, only pointing to when he last faced Arsenal in January's FA Cup tie. The Turkey goalkeeper did do himself proud that day, saving Martin Odegaard's penalty in normal time and proving the hero in the shootout, but it was practically the only good performance he has produced since signing for United from Fenerbahce - where fans grew so frustrated with him that one hurled a water bottle at him. Bayindir has conceded 21 times in his 12 games with United, and made at least three errors that have directly led to goals.

So with just two weeks to go until the transfer window closes, GOAL takes a look at the goalkeepers United should be looking to sign so they no longer have to rely upon Onana and Bayindir...</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>No doubt, Fulham will feel a bit up against it heading into the club's Premier League opener, away at Brighton. Nicknamed “Jedi,” he's proven capable of containing Bukayo Saka and Mohamed Salah on one end before dependably squaring crosses right into his striker's stride. He gutted out an injury to his right knee until season's end, finishing third in the fan-voted Player of the Season pageant after a 10-assist campaign. On Thursday, 48 hours before a trip to the AmEx, Silva confirmed that Robinson would not be available for selection as he works back from an offseason surgery on that vital plant-leg knee. So, too, would Ryan Sessegnon, leaving the Portuguese manager without his two top options at left back. Mauricio Pochettino may still be envying Silva's situation. It's hardly a new phenomenon that the U.S. men's national team is dangerously thin at left back. In fact, the program went over a decade with makeshift solutions, forcing players like DaMarcus Beasley and Fabian Johnson to own the role despite spending their careers up until that point further afield. While U.S. Soccer can't take credit for Robinson's development, his commitment was a clear end to holding the left side of the back line together with duct tape and chewing gum. While Robinson has amassed a tidy 50 caps to date, he's been absent for the last four camps under Pochettino, a 12-game sample from which the coach has learned plenty about his player pool. He's had his initial trust in Diego Luna validated by a star-making turn at the Gold Cup. Mexico is back on the ascent, although that's a bit more of a subplot than usual as both nations will abstain from World Cup qualifying this cycle. And, more relevant to today's news via Silva: he doesn't have a clear alternative to Robinson at left back. Unlike other USMNT mainstays like Gio Reyna, Pochettino and Robinson have already logged a bit of collaboration. When an ailment kept Robinson out for the Nations League's business end in March, it became a calamity: Panama targeted out-of-position Max Arfsten and, later, Joe Scally, exploiting the latter's lack of awareness to score a last gasp winner in a 1-0 semifinal upset. Scally went on to start the third-place game, putting in such a poor shift that he got a halftime hook. John Tolkin, of recently relegated Holstein Kiel in Germany, has made five appearances, while Scally and DeJuan Jones have each appeared twice in the role. None have made a terribly compelling case for further looks. Throughout the Gold Cup, Arfsten and Tolkin — as indicated by their higher utilization — were the two options on Pochettino's squad. His attacking contributions were that of an ideal wingback, logging assists and chipping in goals as an auxiliary threat from wide. Tolkin, largely as a substitute, has at least spent his career in the role since debuting with his boyhood New York Red Bulls. His issues more closely mirror the struggles recently seen from young left backs George Bello, Kris Lund and Sam Vines: bona fide left backs, but unable to prove themselves at the international level. Unlike other spots, there's no alternative who hasn't been tested and is flying under the radar. The closest to matching that mold is Caleb Wiley, the Chelsea prospect who earned three caps in 2023 and 2024 but hasn't been in a national team camp since Pochettino took charge. While it's impressive for a 20-year-old to have amassed 135 club appearances, mostly with Atlanta United before the club from London came calling, his first loan with Strasbourg was inconclusive. There's Scally shifting over from right back (and Sergiño Dest before him, the first-choice option in that spot), who fancy themselves to put in a shift on the left. Even then, it weakens the right back contingent that is seemingly three players deep: Dest, Scally, Alex Freeman. If Robinson's recovery timetable will keep him out of the next international camp spanning from Sept. 1-9 (the fifth-to-last camp before the 2026 World Cup), those speculative alternatives may get another chance to log starts and fortify their cases for inclusion. Jeff Rueter  is a senior soccer writer for The Athletic who covers the game in North America, Europe, and beyond. No matter how often he hears the Number 10 role is "dying," he'll always leave a light on for the next great playmaker.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lionel Messi will turn 39 by the time the 2026 FIFA World Cup kicks off, and there have been question marks over his availability for the tournament. The Argentina skipper has missed several recent national team matches due to injury. With less than a year to go before the World Cup, there are doubts over whether Lionel Scaloni will pick him for the showpiece event, where Argentina are also the defending champions. Messi was key for Argentina in Qatar, as they defeated France in penalties to clinch the title. Recently, in an interview with La Nacional, Angel Di Maria was asked about Messi's availability for the World Cup. The former Real Madrid winger had a straightforward reply. It's like when Diego (Maradona) was there.” “It's them, and there's no one else. He's a phenomenon—let's not waste the chance to keep watching him. I never watched MLS, and now I have a season ticket just to watch it,” he added. Messi recently returned from injury on Sunday, as he came off the bench and scored in Inter Miami's 3-1 win vs LA Galaxy. He also set up Luis Suarez for his team's third goal. After the match, head coach Javier Mascherano stated that sometimes Messi needs to slow down, so that he can be injury-free and also due to his age. He is happiest when he's on the field, but sometimes we have to slow him down. He knows his body better than anyone, and it's about regaining the right sensations for what's ahead,” he said.</p>

Brace yourselves, because FIFA is cooking up another stroke of...genius? According to The Guardian biennial Club World Cup could be starting in 2029 — that's every two years, folks. Just when you thought the football calendar couldn't get any more crammed, it's looking to shoehorn in yet another tournament, much to the unbridled joy of... well, mostly Real Madrid and any club that missed out on this year's colossal cash injection. Outside of that, many were still not sold on the concept thanks to it feeling largely unnecessary. Naturally, other European behemoths are now practically drooling over those Saudi-funded revenue streams and want in on the action. Liverpool, in particular, were reportedly gutted, having met the qualifying criteria only to be unceremoniously snubbed because FIFA decreed two English teams were quite enough (Chelsea and Manchester City, those coveted spot-holders). While FIFA sources are currently playing a masterful game of coy regarding a 2027 tournament, they've got their eye on 2031 for another grand old bash. Their hands are tied until 2030, thanks to a rather inconvenient memorandum of understanding with the European Clubs Association. Of course, this whole two-year shindig is ruffling some serious feathers. World Leagues, a rather vocal lobby group that includes the Premier League, is already squaring up to sue FIFA for "abuse of dominance" – essentially, for not asking nicely before redecorating everyone's schedules. Premier League chief executive Richard Masters weighed in with a perfectly reasonable point: FIFA is supposed to regulate the global game and international football, not crash the club party. In a move that's either utterly genius or pure, unadulterated madness, FIFA might even contemplate scrapping the June international break to make room for this shiny new Club World Cup. UEFA, predictably, is clutching its pearls because that's precisely when it hosts the Nations League finals. It's a delicate dance of power, money, and who can shout the loudest. Oh, and because FIFA loves consistency (sometimes), they're also mulling over upping the Club World Cup from 32 to a staggering 48 teams, just like the men's and women's World Cups. It's also planning formal bidding processes for future tournaments, with Qatar, Spain, and Morocco already lining up, presumably with their wallets wide open. Don't get used to the summer off because the Club World Cup is about to get a whole lot bigger and a whole lot more frequent. It will be interesting to see where the conversation about player welfare fits into all this, with high-profile players like Rodri, Alisson, and more already speaking out about them playing too many games.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea's summer has been the subject of much debate among fans and pundits ever since the end of last season. The Blues played at the Club World Cup through June and July, had just a few weeks off and then returned for a friendly double header last weekend before their Premier League campaign kicked off against Crystal Palace yesterday afternoon. No team has even really had to deal with a summer like that before – and Chelsea did it all on the back of an exceptionally long season. However things were far more sluggish against Palace yesterday. Enzo Maresca was asked about this in his press conference yesterday, and denied his team had looked fatigued in comparison to their opponents, who had had a more conventional preseason: “I don't think so, because until the end we competed. “For sure, they already played, I think, seven, eight games. So the real game for us was today. It's true that a lot of our players have had this exceptional summer, but there are also squad players and new additions who haven't had quite the same punishing schedule, and a squad like ours should be able to compete at a high level despite all this.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Liverpool beat Bournemouth 4-2 at Anfield while City stunned Wolves 4-0 despite playing away from home. Arne Slot's side looked to start their season in a positive fashion as they went 1-0 up in the first 45 minutes through Hugo Ekitike. Liverpool doubled their lead on 49 minutes through Cody Gakpi, but Bournemouth were not giving up easily as they bounced back midway through that second period. Antoine Semenyo showcased his qualities as he bagged a brace on 64 and 76 minutes to make it 2-2. However, Liverpool got their mojo back as Federico Chiesa regained their lead on 88 minutes, before Mohamed Salah sealed the game in added time. Man City had a more convincing result as they scored four without reply despite having to play away from home. Erling Haaland bagged a brace in that game, while the other two goals were netted by new boys, Tijjani Reijnders and Rayan Cherki. On Sunday, Arsenal also picked up all three points, but it was far from a comfortable match for Mikel Arteta's side. Facing a hungry United team, Arteta's men were forced to play more on the counter, though they did snatch a lead on 13 minutes through Riccardo Calafiori. Man United might feel undone with the result as they were dominating much of the proceedings, but couldn't seem to finish their chances. Nevertheless, Arsenal managed to defend well and see off the match with a slender win over their arch-rival. Meanwhile, the recently crowned FIFA Club World Cup champions, Chelsea, struggled to get going as they were held to a goalless draw by Crystal Palace. The Blues can't seem to break down their opponent's defense, as Palace ease on to pick up a point on their travel.</p>
