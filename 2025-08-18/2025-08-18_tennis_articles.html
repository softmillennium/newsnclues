In the latest instalment of what was expected to be another classic match between male tennis' top two players, Sinner visibly struggled from the off and was broken three times by Alcaraz before retiring at 5-0 down in the first set. The world No 1 told officials "I feel really bad, I feel so sorry for the fans" before embracing with Alcaraz to confirm his decision and now faces a race to recover in time for his US Open title defence in New York, with the tournament starting this Sunday live on Sky Sports. I thought I would get better during the night but it got worse," said Sinner, who held his stomach at times during the 23 minutes of play.

Sinner is the defending US Open champion in the men's singles but should be ready for Flushing Meadows given he retired from illness, rather than an injury. The intense heat in Cincinnati caused a lot of fatigue throughout the two-week tournament as several players pulled out and some were sick. It is possible this also led to Sinner's issues but former Grand Slam doubles champion Ryan Harrison said on Sky Sports Tennis' coverage that the Italian should not be concerned about his US Open title defence. It's not something I would be overly worried about, given that the US Open is two weeks off and you get a day off after each match," said Harrison.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fresh off a four-set win over Carlos Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final, Jannik Sinner was clearly not himself on Monday in a rematch of the rivals and the top two players in the world. Sinner retired with apparent illness in the first set of Monday's Cincinnati Open final against Alcaraz after digging a 5-0 deficit. "From yesterday, I didn't feel great. But I couldn't handle more." First-round matches are scheduled to start next Monday. Sinner is the defending US Open champion and is in search of his third Grand Slam victory this year after winning Wimbledon and the Australian Open. Sinner looked out of sorts from the outset under the mid-afternoon sun during an 88-degree afternoon in Cincinnati. Sinner served first and spotted Alcaraz a 40-0 lead in the first game before Alcaraz took a 1-0 lead. Sinner started his second serve with a double fault en route to another 40-0 deficit before Alacaraz broke him again for a 3-0 lead. Sinner then called for a bag of ice during the break between games. On his third service game, Sinner doubled faulted while trailing 40-30 as Alcaraz secured his third break and a 5-0 lead.</p>

MASON, OH ‚àí The stage was set for an epic Cincinnati Open men's singles final between the ATP's top 2 players in Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz.

Instead, fans saw just 23 minutes of play as top-ranked ATP phenom Jannik Sinner retired after just five games due to illness.

Sinner received medical attention after having his serve broken for the third time in the opening set. Shortly after, he retired.

"I'm super, super sorry to disappoint you," Sinner said in his on-court interview. Sinner was one of several players who exited the tournament early due to illness.

Alcaraz, 22, becomes the youngest man to win the Cincinnati Open title since Andy Murray in 2008.

The world No 1 Sinner was seen telling the umpire: ‚ÄúI feel like I can collapse at any moment‚Äù as he retired. We're hearing that Jannik Sinner could have been suffering from an illness during the Cincinnati Open final. The umpire announced it as so, instead of an injury. Will be recover in time for the US Open Jannick Sinner's full quotes after pulling out of the Cincinnati Open final injured - handing Carlos Alcaraz the win. Is his dream of retaining the US Open over? "Usually I start with the opponent but today I have to start with you guys," he said. From yesterday I didn't feel great. "I tried to come out and make it at least a small match but I couldn't handle more. "I know some of you on Monday maybe had to work or do something else, so I'm very very sorry. Not the way you wanted to win but it's amazing what kind of season you're producing. "You and your whole team are doing amazing. But Alcaraz's first thought was to console his opponent. Sinner looked devastated courtside as seen below. He had his head in his hands after being forced to retire injured while 5-0 down. We now have an agonizing wait to find out what Jannik Sinner's US Open future holds. He seemed to suggest he wouldn't be there with some of his comments in that interview. Stay with us throughout the afternoon, plenty to keep you up-to-date on! "It's always been a great tournament for me," he added. "We just feel more comfortable on site, having our time between matches. "Thank you for the week, it's been a pleasure. "Every practice and match, I've felt the love. Carlos Alcaraz spoke after Jannik Sinner was forced to retire at the Cincinnati Open. "I can't say anything you don't know already, you are truly a champion. "It has been one of the warmest tournaments we've played," he added. "See you again next year, hopefully in better shape." "From yesterday I didn't feel great, but it came out worse. Sinner was almost in tears as he announced his couldn't carry on. Does he fear his US Open dream is over already? What a gutwrenching blow for the World No1. "I'm just so sorry for the fans." Jannik Sinner looks dejected at the Cincinnati Open. He's pulled out of the final while 5-0 down to Carlos Alcaraz. The Italian was being destroyed before his retirement. He never really looked comfortable out there. He was getting work done of his leg by the physio when his retirement was announced by the umpire. Extraordinary drama ahead of the US Open. Sinner was 5-0 down and being destroyed. He went over to his chair before the physio rushed on. Sinner is looking to defend his US Open title next week. He's now a HUGE doubt for New York! The match is over, Carlos Alcaraz wins! Sinner is serving, but it's getting worse as he goes 0-30 down. He smashes a huge serve to grab some advantage back. Some lovely Alcaraz hands takes it to 15-40. A monstrous Sinner serve down the middle gets one back at 30-40. 5-0 to Alcaraz, we're on for a donut set here! Sinner wins the first point, but a huge ace makes it 15-15. Alcaraz then repeats it to take the advantage. A few more big serves that Sinner can't get back. Then goes to 0-30 as he crashes another one into the net, it's like watching me play at present (Very bad). Some incredible defence by Alcaraz somehow forces another error, it goes to 0-40! Sinner gets his first points of the game, taking it to 15-15. He then smashes one out, a sloppy start from the Italian. A HUGE return down the line from a Alcaraz serve sees it go to 30-30, though. Some heavy hitting from both men takes it to deuce, Jannik has a chance to break back instantly. But Alcaraz wins two points on the bounce. A sloppy start for Sinner as he goes 0-30 with two errors. It then heads to 0-40 as he crashes one into the net. Alcaraz is hitting the ball well early doors. Sinner hits another one out and the Spaniard has broken to nil! Sinner and Alcaraz are both having a warm up hit. We should be in for a classic here. Stay with us, we're moments away. The crowd are being shown a very upbeat introduction. They are just having a quick warm-up and sorting themselves out. The pre-match event is underway, with both players being introduced. Not a full house over in Cincinnati by any means. A lot of spare seats so far, but it'll surely pick up as the game gets underway. It's also VERY hot with the sun shining on a fine Monday afternoon. We're not far away from the start of what's sure to be another classic. Two young men at the top of their game going head-to-head once again. Who have you got coming out on top? Around 10 minutes until the start of play. Alcaraz's route to the final involved navigating a tough draw. He also needed a three-set win against Damir Dzumhur. The Spaniard has an even bigger test against Sinner today. Both players will be looking to win today to go into the US Open in top form. That's before the first-round begins this coming weekend. Jannik Sinner is looking to defend his title on Arthur Ashe going into the start of September. Can he gain the mental advantage today? Carlos Alcarav spoke ahead of renewing his rivalry with Sinner today. "We always bring our best tennis," he said. "I will try and adjust my game better and correct what I did wrong in our last match. "I want to be ready with my 100%.</p>

The winners will face the 24-time grand slam champion Novak Djokovic and Olga Danilovic if they overcome Mirra Andreeva and Daniil Medvedev. Meanwhile, the six-time Wimbledon doubles champion Gordon Reid says wheelchair tennis must keep proving its value to tournaments to help close the gap in prize money. Reid and his partner, Alfie Hewett, are preparing for the US Open, which last week announced a large increase in winnings. Unfortunately, Edmund's ascent into the world's top 50 corresponded with a knee injury that required three operations and kept him off the tour for almost two years. In a statement issued by the Lawn Tennis Association, Edmund said: ‚ÄúThe last five years have taken a toll with three surgeries and other injuries [and] my body is telling me it's finally reached the end point. Edmund, who defeated Novak Djokovic at the ATP Masters in 2018, made progress in his latest comeback attempt but decided the Nottingham Challenger final defeat against Jack Pinnington Jones last month would be his last match. I spent four or five years trying to come back and was never fully able to reach my goal. Reid and Hewett, who have won six titles at Flushing Meadows, with Hewett also winning four singles titles, have been a big driving force in the improvement in wheelchair tennis. ‚ÄúIt's been 20 years since we started, so in terms of the age of the slams themselves, we're very fresh, very new,‚Äù Reid said. ‚ÄúAs much as we want to see an increase and the gap in the prize money closing, we also need to prove we're adding something, adding value to the tournament.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz will have to do it the hard way if they are to triumph in the US Open's revamped mixed doubles tournament on Tuesday and Wednesday. The wildcard pairing has been drawn against top seeds Jack Draper and Jessica Pegula at Flushing Meadows, while Serbian pair Novak Djokovic and Olga Danilovic could await in the quarter-finals. Alcaraz will not have much time to prepare, either, amid controversy surrounding the scheduling of his Cincinnati Open final against Jannik Sinner. Express Sport provides all the latest tennis updates below... You can check out at any time. British ace Lloyd Glasspool has officially become the new world No. Glasspool and his partner, Julian Cash, went on a 22-match winning streak which spanned titles at Queen's, Eastbourne, Wimbledon, and Toronto, before losing in the Cincinnati semi-finals over the weekend. "It's an amazing feeling, it's something to tell the grandkids," Glasspool said after becoming the top-ranked doubles player. But I think it is a good reflection of the year we've had. 1 team as well, me and Jules, we've had such a great year, such a good past couple months, I think it's deserved." Jodie Burrage got her US Open qualifying campaign off to a winning start, blitzing Patricia Maria Tig 6-4 6-0. During his breakthrough 2018 season, Edmund reached the Australian Open semi-final, stunned Novak Djokovic in Madrid, lifted his maiden title in Antwerp, and reached a career-high ranking of No. But Edmund's career was derailed by injuries and he had three surgeries from 2020 to 2021. He has now ended his career, admitting the time was right. Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner must see each other more often than they see their families at this rate. Alcaraz has a winning 8-5 record against Sinner, but the world No. 1 beat him to win Wimbledon just a few weeks ago. And the Spaniard is excited to renew their rivalry on Monday. "I'm really looking forward to playing against him again. Thanks to him, I get the best out of myself in tennis," Alcaraz said after winning his semi-final on Saturday. "It's also great for the fans to watch our matches. Their match will be played not before 6pm local time. But Swiatek is still in the US Open mixed doubles draw with Casper Ruud, and they're due to play their first-round match around 12pm local time in New York on Tuesday. It will be a race against time for Swiatek to get to Flushing Meadows by the time her Cincinnati final and post-match duties are over. Paolini was set to partner with Lorenzo Musetti in the US Open mixed doubles tournament but she has pulled out, and Musetti will now play alongside Caty McNally. It remains to be seen whether Swiatek suddenly skips the tournament too. She and Ruud are due to face the all-American pairing of Frances Tiafoe and Madison Keys second on Arthur Ashe Stadium. Casper Ruud has hailed Novak Djokovic as the greatest athlete of all time ahead of the US Open. "I don't want to compare because it's stupid, but if you take Novak's athleticism next to Brady, Brady's the GOAT, don't get me wrong, but I think Novak would crush him in most of the physical tests that you can do. "And then again, LeBron would maybe crush Novak in certain physical, so I don't know, but for me, Novak is the greatest athlete that ever lived.‚Äù Daniil Medvedev has spoken out about his dislike towards early matches, warning he could opt to skip them later in his career. Like: ‚ÄòYeah, I didn't wake up. Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu's partnership in the US Open mixed doubles could be in doubt, according to The Sun. They face first-round and quarter-final matches tomorrow, but Alcaraz is in the Cincinnati Open final against Jannik Sinner today. It takes two hours to fly to New York, and he may have to jey across on the day of their opening match against Jack Draper and Jessica Pegula. Nick Kyrgios was initially paired with Naomi Osaka for the US Open's mixed doubles, but he is no longer taking part. Osaka will now play with Gael Monfils, and they will face Caty McNally and Lorenzo Musetti in their opening match tomorrow. Kyrgios missed the entire grass season with a knee injury, and the same problem ruled him out of Washington, Toronto, and Cincinnati. New footage has emerged of Novak Djokovic requiring treatment on his troubled right thigh during practice ahead of the US Open. The Serb is currently training in Montenegro, having not competed since his thigh hampered him in his Wimbledon semi-final defeat against Jannik Sinner. Djokovic is expected to feature in the US Open's revamped mixed doubles tomorrow, but he doesn't appear fully fit ahead of chasing a record-breaking 25th Grand Slam. Novak Djokovic's recent practice session\ud83e\udd14It looks he still has some issues on his thigh before the US Open?\ud83d\ude25(Toronto's tournament direction clarified that he withdrew due to injury\u2193 )Again, I have to say, when Zimaglia worked for him solely, Novak never won a title\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\udc4b pic.twitter.com/4S8ScaxyYu We have a bumper evening of tennis in store, with both men's and women's Cincinnati Open finals taking place. Iga Swiatek and Jasmine Paolini's clash will follow, potentially starting at around 11pm. 6 has partly credited his decision to leave X (formerly Twitter). "Now, two years have passed, and I've never read anything on that social network again. He added: "I prefer to watch the highlights of certain matches. Currently, I watch a lot of the tennis matches I used to watch, whether it's from the tournament I'm playing in or even from a Challenger tournament that's happening that week. "I have a team that helps me keep my feet on the ground; they would never let me get my head full of nonsense." Jasmine Paolini has warned Iga Swiatek that she is ready to "fight" ahead of the Cincinnati Open final. Paolini, who beat Veronika Kudermetova in three sets in her semi, said: "It's been really tough against her. Tennis fans are baffled as to why the Cincinnati Open final between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner is being played on a weekday. Sinner himself has admitted that the new schedules can be confusing. And now I lost a little bit of the view of when does actually a finalist [plays], because it used to be always Sunday. Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz will have earned it if they win the US Open's revamped mixed doubles this weekend. The dream pairing will face top seeds Jack Draper, Raducanu's fellow Brit, and Jessica Pegula, playing on home turf, tomorrow. Should they progress, 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic and fellow Serb Olga Danilovic could await in the quarter-finals. Alcaraz won't have much time to prepare, given he faces Jannik Sinner in the Cincinnati Open final today. Welcome to Express Sport's live coverage of all things tennis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you'd like to follow our fantastic tennis coverage, click here. 1 on both the men's and women's tours. Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz's fourth encounter in a final this season is up first in Mason, Ohio, at 3 p.m. 1, as he is defending only 50 points after a Alcaraz's shock second-round exit to Botic van de Zandschulp last year. Their final is followed by Iga ≈öwiƒÖtek vs. Jasmine Paolini, not before 6 p.m ET. 2 with the title, and despite that result leaving a near-3,300 point gap to world No. A title for ≈öwiƒÖtek would take her just over 500 points behind Sabalenka in the ‚Äúrace‚Äù for world No. Should Paolini win the title, Sabalenka's position will feel rather more secure. With a Grand Slam on the horizon, tournaments such as the Cincinnati Open are always at risk of some players having one eye on their next event. It is an important event, because it is the last chance most players have to sharpen up ahead of the U.S. Open, but those same players also won't take any chances with their fitness. The 86-degree temperatures and high humidity played a part: France's Arthur Rinderknech appeared to collapse against Felix Auger-Aliassime of Canada before retiring from their third-round match last Monday, and the conditions worsened any fatigue held over from previous tournaments. Frances Tiafoe, who lives for the U.S. Open, had to pull out against Holger Rune in the fourth round because of a back problem, taking no chances. Canadian Open finalist Karen Khachanov posted a statement referring to not taking risks after retiring against Alexander Zverev, while Washington D.C. runner-up Alejandro Davidovich Fokina said that ‚Äúnot taking time off or skipping weeks has caught up with me.‚Äù The WTA draw saw no mid-match retirements, but there were four walkovers, with players pulling out before starting their match. Two were seeds: Marta Kostyuk withdrew from her match against Iga ≈öwiƒÖtek with a wrist injury, and Dayana Yastremska pulled out of hers against Coco Gauff due to illness. One player who did not retire, despite being unable to compete properly, was Zverev. Zverev, who has type 1 diabetes, reported dizziness during his quarterfinal against Ben Shelton and then faded in the second set of his semifinal against Alcaraz. Still, he played on despite having no chance of moving to the ball, with Alcaraz completing a 6-4, 6-3 victory despite serving four double faults to concede a break early in the second set. The retirements and player withdrawals at the Cincinnati Open created fertile ground for a surprise player to have a run. In doing so, he took out world No. 9 Holger Rune, last year's U.S. Open finalist Taylor Fritz, rising phenom Jo√£o Fonseca, and Flavio Cobolli, who last month reached the Wimbledon quarterfinals. A sustained, astonishing top level defined Atmane's run, as he punished his opponents with pummeled inside-out forehands, pinpoint serves and a general policy of all-out attack. In a year when wild card Victoria Mboko has won the Canadian Open, another wild card, Lo√Øs Boisson, has reached the French Open semifinals, and qualifier Learner Tien has made it to the Australian Open fourth round, this was different. All of those players had staggering underlying records on the second and third rungs of the tennis circuit, while Atmane has produced an old-fashioned heater. His home crowd had booed him at the French Open for a perceived lack of effort against 38-year-old Richard Gasquet, who was playing his last event, and he lost in the first round of Wimbledon qualifying to then-world No. He was 5-14 on the ATP Tour going into this tournament. 69 in the rankings, after pushing Sinner harder than most top-20 and even top-10 opponents have done this year. He'll still have to go through qualifying if he wants to maintain this sudden and wholly surprising jolt of momentum at the U.S. Open, but if he makes it, he could be a nightmare first-round draw for just about anyone. One of the advantages of the extended 12-day 1000-events is that there are more days to play with for rain delays and other unexpected disruptions. Scheduling matches should, barring complete disaster, not be controversial. Not so in Mason, where world No. 31 Anna Kalinskaya posted on social media, bemoaning the scheduling for her quarterfinal against ≈öwiƒÖtek. A rain delay and a tight three-set match meant she beat Ekaterina Alexandrova in the early hours of Thursday morning, not getting to bed until 4 a.m. She was then scheduled for the 11 a.m. slot on Friday. ‚ÄúHow can the WTA and tournament expect athletes to perform their best when the scheduling is this unfair?‚Äù Kalinskaya wrote. ‚ÄúHow does the tournament and WTA expect me to recover and continuously adjust my sleep pattern, which is one of the most important aspects of recovery?‚Äù Kalinskaya still had a day off between matches, even though that is not enough to totally correct the body-clock issues that she described. ≈öwiƒÖtek played C√Ærstea in the first match on Thursday, while Kalinskaya and Alexandrova played last. When Kalinskaya and ≈öwiƒÖtek did meet in the slot the former wanted to avoid, she was well beaten, losing 6-3, 6-4. üìà T√©rence Atmane moves up 67 places from No. üìà Anna Kalinskaya reenters the top 32 after rising three spots from No. 31, giving herself a seeding for the U.S. Open. üìâ Holger Rune drops out of the top 10, falling two places from No. üìâ Leylah Fernandez drops seven places from No. 36, also losing a seeding for the U.S. Open. üìçNew York: U.S. Open mixed doubles featuring Carlos Alcaraz, Emma Raducanu, Venus Williams, Jannik Sinner. üìçWinston-Salem, N.C.: Winston-Salem Open (250) featuring Stefanos Tsitsipas, Gabriel Diallo, Sebastian Korda, Stefan Dostanic. üìçNew York: U.S. Open mixed doubles featuring Carlos Alcaraz, Emma Raducanu, Venus Williams, Jannik Sinner. üìçMonterrey, Mexico: Monterrey Open (500) featuring Linda Noskov√°, Diana Shnaider, Sofia Kenin, Leylah Fernandez. üìçCleveland: Tennis in the Land (250) featuring Clara Tauson, Lo√Øs Boisson, Maya Joint, Hailey Baptiste.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US Open mixed doubles event is different in every way you could imagine in 2025, but that's a good thing. Only two days are required to complete the event, which will serve as an appetizer for the US Open singles tournament, which gets underway next week. The winning duo will take home a $1 million prize, which is higher than most prize purses for mixed doubles major tournaments. The 16 teams will play over two days. The semifinals and championship match will be on Wednesday night. All matches are best-of-three, like normal doubles events, but to fit the event into two days, only four games are required to win a set. No advantage scoring will be used as well. Only the championship match will be played in a traditional format with six games needed to win a set. American Jessica Pegula and Jack Draper of Great Britain are the top-seeded duo. They face Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu in the first round. Three all-American teams are entered in the draw. Venus Williams will also participate in the event alongside fellow American Reilly Opelka. Jannik Sinner, Alexander Zverev and Taylor Fritz are among the top-ranked men's singles players participating in the event. This isn't a traditional doubles event, and because most of the players do not have extensive mixed doubles experience, the tournament is wide open and any of the 16 teams could win the event.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The ATP Tour has come under much scrutiny recently after a wave of criticism regarding their scheduling. Recently, the ATP tour was told their schedule does not work, after numerous high-profile players withdrew from the Canadian Open. All players cited injury as the reason for their withdrawals. While Gaudenzi acknowledged the difficulty a tournament faces when key players withdraw, he maintained that player participation at Masters 1000 events has been ‚Äòstrong' in recent years. Gaudenzi, who also discussed the calendar complexity and playing commitments during the interview, said: ‚ÄúWithdrawals are part of professional sport, especially in one as physically demanding as tennis. In this case, both Jannik and Carlos had deep runs to the finals of both Roland Garros and Wimbledon‚Äîan incredible achievement. ‚ÄúWith only a two-week turnaround between Wimbledon and Toronto this year, the schedule was particularly tight. ‚ÄúIn general though, when you step back and look at the data across recent years, player participation at the Masters 1000 level remains very strong. ‚ÄúWe need to assess the impact of reforms over time, using the full picture‚Äîattendance, viewership, player participation, compensation, and commercial performance. After Jannik Sinner contests the Cincinnati Open final against Carlos Alcaraz on Monday evening, he will then need to make an extremely quick trip to New York to compete in the US Open Mixed Doubles tournament. Sinner, who is partnered with Katerina Siniakova, is expected to play in the tournament, which will run from Tuesday to Wednesday. For any athlete, this turnaround is extremely quick. Both Sinner and Iga Swiatek are playing in their respective Cincinnati Open finals, and both are potentially being expected to play in New York the following day.</p>

Raducanu, 22, is partnering five-time Grand Slam winner Carlos Alcaraz, while Draper, 23, will play with American Jessica Pegula after their original partners, Tommy Paul and Paula Badosa, both withdrew. Organisers were heavily criticised in February after announcing that the mixed doubles competition would be a standalone event on 19-20 August - before the singles tournament begins on 24 August. The 16 pairs involved will compete for $1m (¬£749,077) at Flushing Meadows. Italian Sinner, 24, who is also a wildcard entrant, has been re-paired with Czech Katerina Siniakova after his partner, American Emma Navarro, withdrew. Just four games will be required to win a set in matches before the final, with no-advantage scoring (four points will be needed to win a game) and 10-point match tie-breaks instead of a third set throughout.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Defending Cincinnati Open champion Aryna Sabalenka defeated Jessica Bouzas Maneiro in straight sets to set up a highly anticipated quarterfinal match with Elena Rybakina, who beat Madison Keys in a battle of Top 10 players Wednesday night. Two nights after outlasting Emma Raducanu in a three-hour thriller, Aryna Sabalenka needed half that time to get the better of Jessica Bouzas Maneiro in their fourth-round match Wednesday night. Rybakina came out on top in her own fourth-round match, a Top 10 clash against Madison Keys, 6-7(3), 6-4, 6-2 to set up the second meeting of 2025 between her and Sabalenka. After a relatively routine first set, nothing came easy for Sabalenka in the second. ‚ÄúJessica is a great player,‚Äù Sabalenka said after the match. I'm super happy to get this win in straight sets. I didn't want to stay here for three hours, sorry guys.‚Äù It's the third straight season she has tallied 50 or more wins. She also becomes the first player to reach at least four consecutive Cincinnati quarterfinals since Simona Halep, who made six straight from 2013 to 2018. That moment came Wednesday night in a Top 10 showdown against Keys, who had defeated Rybakina at the Australian Open earlier this year in three sets. It was Rybakina claiming victory in a three-set thriller this time around, and in the process, she becomes just the second Top 10 player since 1990 to claim three comeback wins en route to a Tier 1/WTA 1000 quarterfinal. Quarters up next üîõElena Rybakina moves into the quarterfinals after defeating Keys 6-7, 6-4, 6-2.#CincyTennis pic.twitter.com/nmvYz4UkNS The victory over Keys is Rybakina's second Top 10 win of 2025, after coming from a set down to defeat Paula Badosa in Dubai in February. While Rybakina is coming off a big win, it's Sabalenka who holds the edge in this oft-played rivalry. However, one stat that favors Rybakina ahead of Friday's quarterfinal: Neither player has won two in a row in the last six matches of this series. Defending Cincinnati Open champion Aryna Sabalenka defeated Jessica Bouzas Maneiro in straight sets to set up a highly anticipated quarterfinal match with Elena Rybakina, who beat Madison Keys in a battle of Top 10 players Wednesday night.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rajeev Ram and Nikola Mektic capped off a sensational run at the Cincinnati Open on Sunday, holding their nerves to beat Lorenzo Musetti and Lorenzo Sonego in the final and claim the men's doubles title. With the win, Ram, at 41 years and four months, became the second-oldest men's doubles champion in Cincinnati, after 42-year-old Daniel Nestor, who won in 2015 alongside Edouard Roger-Vasselin. This is our third tournament together, even though we've known each other for three decades, probably. Thank you so much, I can't thank you enough, and it was a pleasure playing this week," Mektic said to Ram during the trophy presentation ceremony. Mektic, meanwhile, won his 11th Masters 1000 title ‚Äî the most by an active player in men's doubles. Earlier, on reaching the final, he became the third active doubles player, after Rohan Bopanna and Mate Pavic, to reach finals of all nine ATP Masters 1000 events. "We've known each other a really long time... We've played some great matches against each other. It's so nice to have him [Mektic] on my side of the net," Ram said. 25 in the ATP Live Doubles Teams Rankings. Ram, a six-time major champion, has won three of his career Slams in New York. Mektic, on the other hand, is a former finalist, having reached the summit clash in 2020 with Wesley Koolhof, losing 5-7, 3-6 to Mate Pavic and Bruno Soares.</p>

Swiatek also has an easier time attacking Paolini's kick second serve, especially with her excellent backhand return.When they met earlier this year on grass in Bad Homburg, Paolini tried to flatten out her strokes, crash the net, and take more risks. She made the points competitive, but only managed four games.‚ÄúJasmine, well, she plays fast, but with a lot of spin, and she has a lot of variety in terms of going to the net as well,‚Äù Swiatek said after her semifinal win on Sunday.That victory, over Elena Rybakina, was an impressive one.

If Paolini is going to hang her hat on anything coming into Sunday, it should probably be her one close defeat to Swiatek, last fall at the BJK Cup. While Paolini couldn't close it out, she was able to impose her will from the ground and at net for significant stretches.The Italian was playing for her country in that match, and she would eventually lead the team to the title. Can she find that focus and motivation for herself? So far in this tournament, she has had it. Paolini edged Maria Sakkari in two tiebreakers in her opening round, came back from a set down to beat Coco Gauff in the quarters, and stopped Veronika Kudermetova's momentum in the third set in the semis.‚ÄúThat was the key: Forget, go back and fight, and stay in the present,‚Äù she says.She'll need all of her fighting, and possibly forgetting, skills against Swiatek. But with Paolini, who didn't break through on tour until she was past 25, hope springs eternal.‚ÄúIt's been really tough against her,‚Äù she admitted of her record against Swiatek.
