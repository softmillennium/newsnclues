                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>HUNTR/X and Saja Boys each boast two songs in the Global 200's top five. HUNTR/X's “Golden” adds a fifth nonconsecutive week at No. Meanwhile, HUNTR/X earns its second top five Global 200 hit, as “How It's Done” jumps 8-5. In between the trio's two top five entries, Saja Boys rise 4-3 with “Soda Pop,” which returns to its best placement, and 5-4 with “Your Idol,” which has also reached No. Both songs are performed by Andrew Choi, Neckwav, Danny Chung, Kevin Woo and samUIL Lee. Since the Global 200 began in September 2020, four elite albums — by two superstars — other than the KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack have generated as many as four concurrent top five hits. Taylor Swift monopolized the entire top five in the debut chart weeks for her LPs The Tortured Poets Department (May 4, 2024), 1989 (Taylor's Version) (Nov. 11, 2023) and Midnights (Nov. 5, 2022), while Drake held Nos. 2-5 the week that Certified Lover Boy made its chart start (Sept. 18, 2021). U.S. charts rank songs based on streaming and sales activity culled from more than 200 territories around the world, as compiled by Luminate. U.S. chart comprises data from territories excluding the United States. Chart ranks are based on a weighted formula incorporating official-only streams on both subscription and ad-supported tiers of audio and video music services, as well as download sales, the latter of which reflect purchases from full-service digital music retailers from around the world, with sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites excluded from the charts' calculations. “Golden” leads the Global 200 with 117.8 million streams (down less than 1% week-over-week) and 14,000 sold (up 7%) worldwide in the week ending Aug. 14. 2 after 10 weeks on top beginning in May. U.S. with 86.1 million streams (down 1%) and 7,000 sold (up 8%) outside the U.S. 1 starting in May; BLACKPINK's “Jump” repeats at No. 4 high; and “Your Idol” rises 8-5, returning to its best rank.

For the past 25 years, the best political satire in America hasn't been found in newspapers, or in comedy clubs, or on movie screens or live theater stages. Its home has been Comedy Central‘s “The Daily Show,” which premiered in 1996 and, under the leadership of host Jon Stewart in the early 2000s, became an astonishingly perceptive, enlightening, and (most importantly) hilarious forum for processing the daily news. The program has gone through several iterations over the years, including a nine-year period during which Stewart left the show and was replaced first by Trevor Noah and then a series of guest hosts. Stewart came back at the beginning of 2024 under the condition that he would only host Mondays, with the rest of the week anchored by a different host from a rotating bench of senior correspondents that includes Ronny Chieng, Jordan Klepper, Michael Kosta, and Desi Lydic (Josh Johnson was promoted to the lineup just a few weeks ago). Related Stories Next Month on Hulu and Disney+, Original Shows and Movies Take Center Stage Seth Rogen on Planning ‘The Studio' Season 2 Cameos: ‘If One Person Says No, We Have to Throw the Entire Episode Away' Without losing any of its wit, “The Daily Show” has sneakily become a source not only for comedy but catharsis, as the empathetic, razor-sharp ensemble finds ways every single night of making sense out of some of the most senseless, horrifying, and sometimes merely stupefying events most of us have encountered in our lifetimes. IndieWire sat down for a roundtable discussion with Chieng, Klepper, Kosta, and Lydic to discuss their approach to blending comedy and information, how they respond to the speed of the Trump-era news cycle, and their feelings about the state of late night comedy in the wake of Stephen Colbert (a former “Daily Show” correspondent himself) getting cancelled by CBS. IndieWire: One of the things that amazes me about “The Daily Show” is that every episode is a finely crafted jewel of satire — yet by its very nature you must come into the office every morning with no idea of what you're going to be covering that night. How do you create each episode on such a tight turnaround? There's been a lot of change, which meant the show had to figure out its structure and the ways in which it worked best so that you could have somebody come in and hit the ground running. And I feel like with the Trump news cycle and how everything changes so quickly, the structure has been solidified and evolved to a place that's really effective right now. Starting a day, I get up with some ideas. But as soon as you arrive, there's a meeting with Justin Melkmann and a few of the other producers just to get a sense of the news they've collected, so there are the five or six stories you have in your head and you immediately get 30 other stories thrown at you. We have a quick conversation and pick a handful from that, then we watch clips and get a better sense of not only here's what's happening, but here's what's interesting, here's what's funny. Ronny Chieng:  These are processes which have been developed over 25 years of making a show, and they've been refined constantly to the point where even lunchtime is optimized for comedy writing. “The Daily Show” developed its own language for joke writing. Everyone has shorthand for what we need to insert at any given time. Desi Lydic:  The team is so incredible in terms of gathering all of the stories and the footage, so you're armed with everything that you could possibly want to talk about. We have a studio production team that's watching stuff throughout the weekend, leading up to the week. If there's something that Trump continues to talk about, like water pressure or something, if studio production doesn't have it, the digital team has it. It's a testament to the machine and how everyone is so accustomed to collaborating and working with each other. Michael Kosta: When I host,  I remind the audience every day that we showed up that morning with a blinking cursor on a blank computer screen. We don't go to some writing retreat for seven months and come up with the show. If I'm not on time to my morning meeting, we're rushing all day until 5:00 p.m. So you do have to be very aware of that machine. How often do you have a show prepared and then have to pivot at the last minute because of some piece of late-breaking news? It happened the last time Trump was in office, but it's definitely happening a lot more often now. Kosta:  You can't be as precious with the words when you're coming up with things a lot quicker, but I think it's really fun. When we do a quick change of the whole first act, it reminds me of when we do our live shows, which we do after presidential debates and midterms. If a light falls and hits us in the head, that's going to be on the show that night. Klepper:  The rotating host thing also allows us some freedom in our narrative structures. A lot of times Jon comes in on Monday and gives an overarching editorial take on what's happened over the last week or the last couple days, which opens up our Tuesday response and gives us more flexibility in responding to Trump news that breaks. The news is constantly changing and you can never catch up to it, and I think everybody has to figure out a way in which they can adapt and improvise. It gives you the freedom to find something new, and that's been really exciting in this past year. I'm guessing that for many of you the interview aspect was new, what was the learning curve like for that final section of each episode? Lydic:  I did not have experience doing that before other than going out into the field and interviewing in character, which is a whole other thing. That can be really fun comedically, but when someone comes into the studio you generally want to be a little more welcoming and supportive. We all got advice from Jon on that, and his very simple advice was that you have to find something that you're interested in about your guest. I want to make sure our guest gets promoted and the audience really understands what it is that they've done. Some of these people that come on have done tremendous things like climbed Mount Everest or passed gun legislation, really difficult things that need to be promoted and shared. I want to make sure they're welcomed and celebrated. Every wannabe amateur dumbass podcast out there is essentially doing an interview show, so what are you bringing that's different? We have to get jokes in there, but he have to showcase them so that if they're saying something important, people will read their book or watch their documentary. It's a difficult skill to be entertaining and get enough out of the guests for people to want to continue the conversation, because we can't possibly cover all their expertise in the segment. For example, Jordan, you go deep into MAGA country and strike a really interesting balance of poking fun at people's contradictions and absurdities without actually looking down at them. It's an unbelievably tricky thing to pull off. So I am a part of this world. Again, I go out there looking for hypocrisy, looking for humor, but the thing I get to do that traditional journalism doesn't is I get to wear my bias on my sleeve, and I also get to repeat my question over and over and over again. Listen to somebody and build off of what they're saying. The most interesting moments are not making a joke about something somebody says. The most interesting moments are where you give them the space to say that thing that is contradictory to the thing they said just a few minutes ago. And it also happens to be the thing that they tell their buddies at the bar, but they won't tell CNN. So our job is to go out there and create a space that feels different than CNN, that feels like they're not fighting and trying to win but that they're trying to communicate something to their buddy at the bar. That leads to a broader question for all of you, which is how much you find your own beliefs and positions challenged or broadened by the work you do on the show. I remember I met with this water dowser, this old man who had these antennas and he walked around and he would find wells of water. And I'd say, “How are you finding the wells?” And he would say, “I'm feeling for the vibrations underneath the ground.” Then we met with a scientific geologist who finds water for a living. And I said, “How do you find it?” He goes, “We feel for vibrations in the ground.” I'm like, “That's the same shit as that guy!” Then that opened my mind like, is this dowser shit real? Lydic:  I think my perspective has definitely shifted in terms of what I think we can mine comedy from. I think that the news has become increasingly more frightening and overwhelming and anxiety inducing, and this show has forced me to find the humor in all of it. There are so many days when I read a story and head into a week of work and think, I don't know how we're going to make this funny. And somehow there is some hypocrisy exposed or some politician or legislator that does something that we can laugh about. Somehow there's a take that I find or the room finds and we figure out a way, because we have to, it's our job. Sorry, I just treated this like a therapy session. Chieng:  When Jon Stewart came back, he told everybody, “Our allegiance is to the comedy. We're just here to do comedy and make fun of the hypocrisy.” That was a very clarifying thing for me, and I think that's when the show is at its best — when it's making fun of institutions and hypocrisy on either side. I guess everyone assumes the show has a certain point of view, but I'm willing to bet money that whatever people think our point of view is is actually wrong. It's always fun when we are able to make jokes on both sides that people don't expect, because a lot of comedy comes from doing the unexpected. I'm not sure if my political view has shifted, but my view towards comedy has definitely evolved to be more fearless and to have less of an allegiance to any one side. Which, by the way, makes it more impactful when we do go after people. You can have your political bias, but what is happening right here over my shoulder is objectively stupid and insane. And we're constantly dealing with images of ICE deportations and what's happening in the Middle East, mixed with the chaos and the dumbfuckery of a Donald Trump press conference. So it is a fascinating conversation each morning: what do we think we can comment on and should comment on and where is it the right place for us to add humor? We're constantly in a conversation not only with ourselves, but also with the audience that we perform this in front of. Speaking of scary times, a few weeks ago the entire landscape of late night lost a major component when Stephen Colbert's show was canceled. How do you see the future of late night comedy? Klepper:  I grew up as such a big fan of Colbert. He's part of our family here at “The Daily Show,” and the idea of that show ending is heartbreaking. We're all super big fans of that show, we're all huge fans of late night, the genre. “The Daily Show” has grown and expanded and we're getting more viewers than in the last decade. In many ways, more people are engaging with “The Daily Show” than ever have before, and the show itself has figured out ways to connect with people beyond just the 30 minutes that it's on television. It connects in all these other ways, and frankly, I think it's more important to do that now in this chaotic time where people want to look to a source who can have a conversation with them in real time. I think “The Daily Show” has been doing that for 30 years. Lydic:  Yeah, I think the thing that gives me hope is knowing that “The Daily Show” has been around for almost 30 years and has been through a number of historical changes, cultural changes, a pandemic, strikes, host changes, presidencies, elections, and so far we've been able to maintain our point of view and our service to comedy and I sure hope that we get to continue to do that. I'm hopeful that we will one way or another. Chieng:  I think that it's a very American form, late night. Late night is woven into the American aesthetic. If America — where we have the craziest politics, the most money in entertainment, the most talented comedy writers — if America can't do political satire, no one can.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Here's another big deal that the new David Ellison-led Paramount is working on: Legendary is in talks for a new multi-picture global theatrical distribution deal (sans China) with the Melrose Ave lot. I hear that as far as the Legendary-Paramount slate goes, co-financing is up for discussion, contingent on projects at hand. What titles will be released is still TBD. Paramount Motion Picture heads Josh Greenstein and Dana Goldberg have a plan to increase the annual output of features to 15 a year. Legendary currently doesn't have an exclusive theatrical deal with any major studio per se, however, its Monsterverse and Dune franchises remain parked at Warner Bros, as well as the Ryan Reynolds-Jason Momoa live-action animation hybrid movie Animal Friends, which is set for release on May 1, 2026. Also, let's not forget that Warners and Legendary both lay claim to this year's massive success A Minecraft Movie, which made more than $955 million worldwide; that movie is the second highest-grossing MPA title YTD after Disney's $1 billion-grossing Lilo & Stitch. There's also the Alejandro G. Iñárritu-Tom Cruise movie at Warner Bros. Legendary's business with Warner Bros continues even with this new Paramount deal, and sources say there will be more features announced between the two. Legendary had a theatrical output deal with Sony that ended in December. Its run at Warners was much better box office-wise than Sony, where they had The Book of Clarence ($6M gross off a $40M production cost) and The Machine ($11M off a $20M production cost). Legendary's deal was a global pact that had the Culver City, CA studio marketing and releasing its slate sans China, where Legendary East handled all marketing and distribution on its movies. It's no irony that Ellison's new chief of comms Melissa Zukerman has a long history with Legendary's Joshua Grode and production boss Mary Parent; Zukerman repped the production finance company when she was at Principal Communications.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple TV+'s The Studio has already made history with its 23 Emmy nominations being the most ever for a debut season of a comedy series, and tied for the most ever in a single season of any comedy series. A lot of that credit should go directly to the actors, since fully 10 of those nominations are in the acting categories including no less that five out of six in the Guest Actor Comedy Series category. So, with that kind of support from their fellow actors, it is only natural that even on the eve of final Emmy voting beginning, six actors from The Studio gathered at the new Meryl Streep Theatre at SAG-AFTRA headquarters in L.A.'s Wilshire district to join me for a rollicking Apple TV+ x Deadline: ‘The Studio' Q&A  in front of a packed audience of about 100 SAG TV Nominating Committee members (the total overall that makes nominations are 2,500 randomly chosen SAG-AFTRA members). Watch out conversation here, and scroll down for photos from the event. The event Saturday was presented by Apple TV+ in association with Deadline and featured star/co-creator/writer/director/and executive producer Seth Rogen, who plays studio head Matt Remick and who has personally received four nominations including Lead Actor in a Comedy Series; Kathryn Hahn, who plays marketing head Maya Mason and is nominated for Supporting Actress Comedy; Chase Sui Wonders as studio exec Quinn Hackett; Bryan Cranston up for Guest Actor as Chairman Griffin Mill and Remick's boss; Keyla Monterroso Mejia as assistant Petra; and Dewayne Perkins as another studio employee, Tyler. I pointed out it is a shame the Emmys don't have an ensemble category like SAG does because this entire cast is worthy of recognition. As for all the Emmy glory, Rogen said he was surprised. But not shockingly, Hollywood's somewhat of an ego-driven industry. And maybe that's not lost on me,” he said. “But honestly, I was actually very worried that people within the industry would feel as though we weren't representing it properly or that our sentiments towards it would be vastly different than their sentiments. I was actually quite aware that a lot of people in the industry would watch the show, and or at least check it out.” As for the inspiration for the show and where they get their ideas, it was right in front of them, Rogen says. “I'd say it's entirely based on our experiences or on people we met with, pretty much all the heads of every studio, while we were writing the show, and we're continuing to meet with them as we write the second season on the show,” he admitted. Hahn, whose physical look for the show is hilarious and calls it her “armor” as a marketer, says there wasn't one person in Hollywood she has based her character on, though she gets plenty of people guessing who it is anyway. “So I wouldn't say anyone specific, but I certainly also have gotten phone calls or texts from people asking me if it was them,” she laughed. “I mean, every lot has these named parking spaces that in this exclusive-like titular thing of ‘This is reserved for XYZ',” she said. Cranston, whose character in the two-part season-finale gets accidentally stoned out of his mind, found the wild comic situations refreshing to do. “So there's like the 14th take of these scenes outside where I'm on the fountain in Vegas with Aphrodite or whoever it is. And I just wanted to make the writers laugh or watching. So I'm orally copulating the statue and I mean, I am just thinking this is never going to be in and they're going to choose something else.” (Spoiler alert: they put it in). “So every time we did a scene, collectively or individually, it was like, yeah, let's get these plot points in. We need to say this or do that. That kind of freedom then stimulates us because it is warranted and welcomed.” Cranston as studio kingpin Griffin Mill (he suggested they make him 82 years old) is one of five nominated for Guest Actor in a Comedy Series and is considered the frontrunner in the category for a character that really shows his go-for-broke comic chops. But consider the names competing against him from their cameos on the show: Martin Scorsese, Dave Franco, Anthony Mackie and Ron Howard — who are all playing themselves. In fact, though he has been nominated 14 times for Emmys as a producer or director and won three statuettes, this represents the first time that Howard has received an Emmy acting nomination in a career that started in front of the cameras as a child actor in the late '50s. You know, it was, ‘Give the kid a break',” Rogen laughs. “He's been acting since his credited name was Little Ronny Howard. Like he had the weird ‘little' in his name. So it took that big fight scene, to finally, unleash the rage.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Sunday, Zoë Kravitz gave Swift's album her seal of approval, telling Extra she's already obsessed with it. Then, on Monday, after placing a countdown on her website, Swift unveiled two new vinyl variants for the album, which feature imagery different than the one she shared last week as The Life of a Showgirl was announced. Zoë Kravitz confirms she has heard "bits" of her pal Taylor Swift's album "The Life of a Showgirl" and says there are "no skips"! The records with that cover artwork are being dubbed “The Shiny Bug Edition,” with fans being able to choose between a “wintergreen and onyx marbled” vinyl color and a “violet shimmer marbled” vinyl (both of which are already sold out).

And then, the harsh reality of the Nixonian “silent majority” reasserted itself, upending hopes of a genuine revolution with a reactionary backlash that rapidly disillusioned idealistic youth. “So now, less than five years later,” he writes, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark — that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.” Related Stories ‘Good Boy' Trailer: A Horror Movie Told Entirely from a Dog's Point of View Is One of the Year's Best Next Month on Hulu and Disney+, Original Shows and Movies Take Center Stage Fittingly, one of the most piercing such depictions came from Italian auteur Michelangelo Antonioni, whose “Zabriskie Point” relocates many of the modern anxieties of his native Italian work to the flailing American protest movement and finds in the oppressive environment of Death Valley an echo of the volcanic Mediterranean isle central to his breakthrough “L'Avventura.” The film begins with familiar sights of the implosion of 1960s counterculture: student activists have succumbed to factionalism that leaves them wide open to police suppression, and the trio of young leads — dropout/possible cop killer Mark (Mark Frechette), drifter Daria (Daria Halprin), and rich kid Lee (Rod Taylor) — meet and form a listless polycule that, in one hallucinatory sequence, expands outward into an orgy of young people entwined all over the hills. Antonioni's critical distance from this mass display makes something of a grim parody of the Sexual Revolution, suggesting that its liberatory possibilities have been forgotten in the name of titillating distraction. Antonioni builds his critique to a mesmerizing finale in which Daria drifts in a traumatized haze into a modernist cliffside house designed by architect Paolo Soleri, an Italian-born American transplant who pioneered an ecological vision of architecture that in many ways represents the possible fulfillment of Antonioni's own search for spiritual harmony between nature and the exponential human progress of modernity. But that possibility is literally dynamited in a vision Daria has of the home abruptly blown to smithereens, the destruction replayed in slo-mo to the crashing squeals of early Pink Floyd, itself a collapse of psychedelic rock's utopian ideals into acid-casualty freak-out. Hoping to find in America what he could not in either Italy nor Mod England, Antonioni instead sees a final, Boschian vision of obliteration to consume the false promise of the 20th century. The slowly waning energy and sudden rapture of “Zabriskie Point” is mirrored in Monte Hellman's existentialist road movie, “Two-Lane Blacktop.” Hellman's film strips everything from the characters to their vehicle down to its essence: James Taylor and Dennis Wilson play amateur racers identified only as “The Driver” and “The Mechanic,” who crisscross the nation's highways in a car they've equally shorn of every unnecessary accoutrement and aesthetic marker that impedes pure, functional speed. Eventually, the group falls into an ambitious cross-country race challenged by G.T.O. The Driver and Mechanic see right through the man's clear bluster and lack of actual racing know-how, but they form a strange bond with the man, becoming less competitors than loose companions. Perhaps the recognize their own directionless wanderlust in G.T.O., whose age and weariness breaks the film of a narrow commentary on disenchanted Baby Boomers and into a larger portrait of American malaise. “The thing is, you gotta keep moving,” G.T.O. tells one of many hitchhikers he picks up throughout the film and regales with a different life story, summarizing the shark-like instinct for constant motion that compels him as much as the three younger leads. No such release categorizes Bob Rafelson's “Five Easy Pieces,” in which Robert Dupea (Jack Nicholson), the prodigal son of an abandoned upper-crust family to which he must return upon news of his father's (Ralph Waite) failing health. Nicholson, hair prematurely thinning but possessed of a boyish spark he retained well into his elder years, is perhaps the ultimate symbol of a certain kind of developmental stasis among the Boomer generation. And while he would ultimately come to be seen as a rebellious figure on-screen, it's here that one gets the clearest view of the underlying secret of so many of his most famous characters: Their refusal to conform or obey is ultimately an impotent gesture against forces larger than themselves. We meet Robert already starting to fray from the everyday torments of traffic-slowed commutes and precarious job security, and he largely vents his frustrations on his girlfriend, Rayette Dipesto (Karen Black), whom he alternately insults and defends for her provincialism. Her desire to settle down triggers the same flight impulse that sent Robert away from his family, and only in a tender but one-sided scene where the man confesses his existential confusion to his stroke-addled father does he find a way to articulate his anxieties. The previous year, Rafelson's production company scored a landmark counterculture hit with “Easy Rider,” which depicted hippie dropouts like western antiheroes eventually destroyed by a system that cannot tame them. “Five Easy Pieces” offers Robert no blaze of glory, only increasing isolation in a country that resembles Edward Hopper's bleakest, loneliest paintings. One of the last bastions of radical cinema was the independent Art Theatre Guild, which produced and distributed two films in 1970 that captured Japan's own retreat from possible change toward aesthetic and political conservatism. Nagisa Ōshima's “The Man Who Left His Will on Film” begins with student filmmaker Motoki (Kazuo Goto) witnessing the suicide of rival colleague Endo (Kazuya Horikoshi), who leaves behind reels of film documenting his final days and possible clues about what prompted his death. Compared to the director's more detached, Brechtian movies of the preceding decade (e.g. “Night and Fog in Japan,” “Double Suicide”), his 1970 feature is almost oppressively first-person, sinking ever deeper into Motoki's paranoid need to find some kind of reason in Endo's death even as more and more clues arise to suggest that the other student's death may be nothing more than the protagonist's hallucination. Endo's footage consists merely of poetic glimpses of city streets and landscapes, but its very lack of overt political intent convinces Motoki that there must be some hidden key to Endo's demise. Perhaps he is right, but such abstruse, personal means of expression preclude wider understanding, and Ōshima suggests conflict within leftist movements not only over particular goals but the inability to balance collectivist struggle with the equal need for individual artistic vision. Simlarly to Ōshima's film, ATG stalwart Yoshishige Yoshida's “Heroic Purgatory” also captures the self-defeating infighting among radical groups, though if anything Yoshida uses even more experimental techniques than his peer. Shoda's possible daughter behaves in ways both desperately longing and ruinously malevolent, and her antics come to symbolize the irreconcilable urges of political activists wishing to grow a collective political vision while succumbing to internal violence driven by individual ego. Jacques Rivette's mammoth 12-hour “Out 1” plays as a distended paranoid thriller, replacing the taut sensory overload of Alan J. Pakula with an almost comical lack of outward incident. Gradually, a sense of unease arises, but it's difficult to articulate what causes and whether clues to a larger conspiracy are real or just disconnected things ascribed meaning by those seeking to find some overriding logic in a world that feels increasingly unmoored and random. It is Alexandre's poisonously revanchist worldview that gives the film its title, referring as it does to the simplistic manner in which he perceives his exasperated lovers Marie (Bernadette Lafont) and Veronika (Françoise Lebrun). Despite his sexual relationship with both women, the young man looks from a modern vantage point like an eerie precursor to today's incels and manosphere misogynists, compensating for his own feeling of powerlessness against the system by reasserting retrograde gender hierarchy to feel some sense of control. Even so, it's hard not to notice that the collective movements of the previous decade are now replaced by far smaller acts of individual resistance, a daily grind of trench warfare just to hold position in stalemated territory. IndieWire's ‘70s Week is presented by Bleecker Street's “RELAY.” Riz Ahmed plays a world class “fixer” who specializes in brokering lucrative payoffs between corrupt corporations and the individuals who threaten their ruin. IndieWire calls “RELAY” “sharp, fun, and smartly entertaining from its first scene to its final twist, ‘RELAY' is a modern paranoid thriller that harkens back to the genre's '70s heyday.” From director David Mackenzie (“Hell or High Water”) and also starring Lily James, in theaters August 22.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Hollywood continues its incessant blood-sucking reliance on draining old intellectual property in lieu of supporting fresh ideas and stories, Sharon Stone is taking a righteous stand against the recently announced Basic Instinct reboot. “I mean, go ahead, but good fucking luck,” Stone said with a laugh on Today when asked about the project, which Amazon MGM Studios announced earlier this summer. Like many reboots, there are, technically, good reasons to dip back into the Basic Instinct well: The original — directed by Paul Verhoeven and starring Stone and Michael Douglas — was a massive hit upon release and remains a milestone in the erotic thriller genre. But as Stone noted on Today, the last effort to revive the series in 2006 with Basic Instinct 2 did not go well. The film (in which Stone reprised her iconic role as Catherine Tramell) was a commercial and critical flop. Trump Pledges Unconstitutional Order to Limit Mail-In Voting After Putin Chat Soulshine at Sea 3 Original Event Canceled After Dispatch, Maggie Rose, More Pull Out Russia Is Pumping Out Disinformation That Looks Like Legitimate News Reports There's no timeline yet for the Basic Instinct reboot, nor is it fully clear what the film will be about. After the project was announced in July, a source told The Wrap that the film will be “anti-woke,” with Eszterhas sharing a statement of his own: “To those who question what an 80-year-old man is doing writing a sexy, erotic thriller: the rumors of my cinematic impotence are exaggerated and ageist. I call my writing partner the TWISTED LITTLE MAN, and he lives somewhere deep inside me. As for Stone, she currently has a supporting role in Nobody 2, Bob Odenkirk's action franchise.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Summer vacation looks good on longtime HGTV star Alison Victoria, who's been turning heads with her latest social media posts, full of photos from a 2025 getaway to Greece alongside her filmmaker beau, Brandt Andersen. In two separate posts on August 16 and 17, Victoria — whose new show, “Sin City Rehab,” premieres in September — shared multiple photos of herself posing in a hot pink string bikini at the beach. Fans flooded the 43-year-old designer's posts with compliments and questions about how she stays so fit. Over 8,000 followers liked Victoria's first post, which she captioned, “Postcards from Spetses 🇬🇷💙🩵.” Spetses is a small island that Vogue has called “the Greek elite's favorite holiday hotspot.” Victoria's post included photos of her on the shoreline, a video of her diving into the water, a collection of seashells, a snapshot of her enjoying a meal in a yellow bikini, scenic views, and an image of her and Andersen's legs intertwined as they sunbathed. The “Windy City Rehab” star thanked one fan who wrote, “I've followed you for years and I have to say, this is the happiest I've ever seen you and I'm so happy for you because you deserve it!! Fans and friends flooded the post with compliments, with many calling the pics “stunning,” including Victoria's fertility doctor, Roohi Jeelani. One fan wrote, “My favorite HGTV designer! Seriously post a video based on workouts and nutrition! Victoria's second post from Greece, on August 17, began with a pic of her sunbathing in her pink bikini while floating on a bright yellow inner tube. Fans celebrated her pics on that post too, with one writing, “looking amazing girlie!! Other pics Victoria shared included Greek design elements like charming doors and windows, picturesque scenes of boats on the water, and multiple shots of her and Andersen snuggling. The couple went Instagram official in June 2024, when Victoria shared multiple photos with him at the Daytime Emmy Awards in Los Angeles, when “Windy City Rehab” was nominated for an Emmy.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last year, the pop sensation performed a three-smash medley – “Please Please Please,” “Taste” and “Espresso” – and won song of the year for “Espresso.” Carpenter is up for eight awards this year, including video of the year (“Manchild”) from her upcoming album Man's Best Friend. Alex Warren, Busta Rhymes, J Balvin featuring DJ Snake, Ricky Martin and sombr are also set to perform on the show. The 2025 VMAs, hosted by LL COOL J, will air live coast-to-coast from New York's UBS Arena on Sunday, Sept. 7, at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT. Warren and sombr are both nominated for best new artist at the VMAs. Both are almost certain to be nominated in that category at the Grammys, as Carpenter was last year. Last year's VMA winner for best new artist, Chappell Roan, went on to win the Grammy in that category. (This year's other VMA nominees for best new artist are Ella Langley, Gigi Perez, Lola Young and The Marías.) 1 smash “Ordinary.” Sombr is also nominated for best alternative for his hit “back to friends,” one of three songs of his on the current Billboard Hot 100 (along with “Undressed” and “12 to 12”). Martin will be honored with the inaugural Latin Icon Award. Martin's award honors a four-decade career that launched Latin music and culture into the mainstream. On the 1999 telecast, he performed “She's All I Ever Had” and his hip-swiveling global smash “Livin' La Vida Loca.” The latter video won five awards: best pop video, best dance video and three International Viewer's Choice awards. Busta made his first VMAs appearance in 1997, when he presented best dance video alongside Martha Stewart. His most recent appearance was performing an extended hits medley in 2021. Busta received a Global Icon award at the 2024 MTV EMAs. J Balvin returns to the VMAs with his latest hit “Zun Zun,” joined by Latin stars Justin Quiles and Lenny Tavárez. He'll then team up with producer DJ Snake – making his first VMAs appearance – for the live premiere of their collab “Noventa.” Balvin, who last performed on the VMAs in 2022, is hoping to take home his sixth Moon Person this year. That would break him out of a tie with Martin as the leading Latin award winner in VMA history. Additional performers, presenters and special guests will be revealed in the coming weeks. Lady Gaga leads the nominations for the 2025 MTV Video Music Awards with 12 nods, followed closely by her “Die With a Smile” duet partner Bruno Mars, who has 11 nods. MTV has yet to announce this year's recipient of the Video Vanguard Award, but Billboard's Andrew Unterberger listed eight likely candidates – in ascending order of perceived likelihood. The 2025 MTV VMAs are executive produced by Bruce Gillmer, Den of Thieves co-founder Jesse Ignjatovic, and Barb Bialkowski. Wendy Plaut is executive in charge of celebrity talent. Lisa Lauricella is executive in charge of music talent. This marks Toffler's return to the show following a decade-long absence.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Like so many accused rapists and abusers, Andrew Tate is going on the offensive with lawsuits of his own. As such, Tate declared on Twitter/X that he's allocated $400 million “To battle Google, Meta, TikTok”; “Every single girl who lied about me”; “The BBC, all mainstream media across Australia UK and US”; and “Every twitter account that defamed me.”  To Tate, “It's good vs evil and I will lose my entire fortune in this fight.” We can only hope! The Tates were booted off both platforms in 2022 (they'd been kicked off of Twitter even earlier, but were allowed back on by Elon Musk). At the time, Meta confirmed to NPR “that Tate had been banned from its platforms for violating its policies regarding dangerous individuals and organizations and hate speech.” Similarly, a spokesperson for TikTok told the outlet, “Misogyny is a hateful ideology that is not tolerated on TikTok. Undeterred, Tate seeks over $50 million from each tech company for his troubles. Last week, Tate also filed a countersuit against his ex-girlfriend regarding her allegations that he sexually assaulted her earlier this year at  Beverly Hills hotel, per Deadline. That suit claims her “smear campaign” resulted in Tate losing “sponsorships, cancelled business deals and irreversible damage to his global reputation.” Spoiler Space: Tragedy doesn't actually bring anyone together in Weapons By Matt Schimkowitz August 11, 2025 | 12:00pm JEZEBELThese GOP Politicians Are in Too Much 'Dadgum' Danger to Go Outside, Live at Home, or Use a Seatbelt ENDLESS MODEThe Video Game History Foundation's Directors Discuss Its Library and the Acquisition of Computer Entertainer</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Produced by Brett Gurewitz, “All My Friends Are So Depressed” is the band's first original song since releasing 40 oz. Watch the accompanying video, directed by Jaxon Whittington and frontman Barry Johnson, below. “The first line I came up with for this song was ‘Lord above in a Tecate truck' after passing a Tecate delivery truck with Jesus shit all over it on the freeway driving back to Long Beach after a show in Fresno,” Johnson said in a press statement. “While searching for a line that rhymed with ‘Lord above in a Tecate truck' I came up with ‘Why even exist? and the concept of ‘All My Friends Are So Depressed' was born.” He continued: “It's kind of my take on what I imagine Lana Del Rey lyrics are like. Instead of icy, detached, cool '50s Americana, it's all dirty shag carpet, bong rips, Peter Frampton Comes Alive, key lime pie, and suicidal ideations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kate Wyler is back for another round of high-intensity diplomacy on Netflix's The Diplomat. Starring Keri Russell, the series sees a career U.S. diplomat thrust into the role of ambassador to the U.K., as Russell's Kate Wyler struggles to keep her frequently on-the-rocks marriage to Hal (Rufus Sewell) from interfering with her work. Returning after season two's finale, which saw “a terribly flawed woman” become president, the series continues to look like a product of another time, where politicians had shame and faced consequences for their actions. Though with Allison Janney's flawed woman ascendant, the show may build its political fantasy around our reality. Or, as our writer Saloni Gajjar said of season two, it'll be back for more pulpy thrills this time around. Will Kate Wyler win the day and save democracy? Find out when The Diplomat returns on October 16.

After a shorter, six-episode second season, The Diplomat‘s third season will feature eight episodes, which Netflix describes as follows: “In season three of The Diplomat, Ambassador Kate Wyler lives the particular nightmare that is getting what you want. None of this slows Hal's campaign to land Kate the vice presidency. Sewell previously teased that things soon get complicated in season three. Also it changes dynamics that might have been in danger of playing out. The Diplomat has already been renewed for a fourth season at Netflix. The cast includes Ali Ahn, Ato Essandoh, Celia Imrie, Nana Mensah and Miguel Sandoval.

Oscar-winning actress Helen Mirren is weighing in on the James Bond debate, and she's made her stance clear. “I'm such a feminist,” the legendary Brit told Saga Magazine in a new interview alongside her The Thursday Murder Club co-star Pierce Brosnan, famed for his stint as Ian Fleming's iconic spy. I adore the world of James Bond,” he said, “It's been very good to me. And I'm just a member of the audience now, sitting back, saying: ‘Show us what you're going to do.

Wilson for a reported $1 billion earlier this year. “I'm hoping that, being a Bond fan for so many years, it will be imbued into me and I will be able to produce something that's the same but different, and better, stronger and bolder,” Knight told BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast earlier this month. Speculation about who might succeed Daniel Craig as Bond is rife, with Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Jacob Elordi, Tom Holland and Harris Dickinson among the hottest names to be thrown around. Of course, the woman-wooing MI6 agent is a role some believe should not exclude female actresses, too.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This week, Scout Willis, daughter of Demi Moore and Bruce Willis, was spotted in Los Angeles walking arm in arm with actor Thomas Doherty, sparking fresh dating buzz. But his relaxed look didn't stop the duo from turning heads. Willis, who has been steadily carving her own path in music with her debut album “Scout LaRue,” was previously linked to musician Jake Miller. Doherty, on the other hand, has a resume full of both roles and romances. The Scottish-born actor first made major waves in Disney's “Descendants” franchise before stepping into the Upper East Side with HBO's “Gossip Girl” reboot. His love life has been equally public, especially after dating “Descendants” co-star Dove Cameron for nearly four years before their 2020 breakup. Cameron later went on to open up about the relationship, admitting that the relationship had “f–ked me up” during an interview with Entertainment Tonight. Doherty also briefly dated model Yasmin Wijnaldum and, more recently, reality star Georgia Hassarati from “Too Hot to Handle.” So, whether Willis and Doherty are truly just friends or testing the waters of something more, their L.A. night out has fans buzzing. Mostly because, according to Willis' Instagram, it looked pretty fun. But, for Scout, the timing marks a lighter chapter as she continues supporting her father, Bruce, amid his health battle with frontotemporal dementia. For Doherty, the outing adds yet another layer to his already headline-ready personal life. Romance or not, these two know how to make an entrance, and Hollywood is watching.</p>
