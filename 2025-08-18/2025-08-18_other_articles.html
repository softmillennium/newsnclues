                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A community for discussion related to Unidentified Flying Objects. We aim to elevate good research while maintaining healthy skepticism. A few weeks ago I posted about resurrecting the 100 foot Cold War radar at RAF and adapting AI tracking methods from self-driving research into a passive radar system for scanning the skies. To test it properly, I invited a mix of people into the bunker: my investors, critics, retired MOD radar experts, and even a journalist from the Mail Online. The outputs were fed into two separate AIs trained to call out any anomalies or weak points. Everyone there from military veterans to investors agreed they hadn't seen anything quite like it. Based on our testing, if there is anything in the sky within its range, it will be seen whether it has a transponder or not and the accuracy of the eclipse is around 30meters!! That said, the experts strongly advised holding back immediate open release because of how quickly it could be misused. There is a website where you can request access and help beta test. I did have to put an access-request wall up today following advice from a 'third party', but the list is open if you want to join. For me this project was always about experimenting with AI and radar mathematics, building on the work we originally did for autonomous vehicles, and then handing it over for others to take further. In the next few days there will be a “light” version available for download. You'll be able to run scans yourself, and if you network it with others running the same instance through our WebSockets, it becomes what I'm told is a surprisingly powerful civilian radar tool. Please use it responsibly avoid undue surveillance without cause or permission. My primary focus remains on my company and day job, but I'll still be around on weekends to support the backbone and answer questions. I'll also provide access to one of my AIs trained extensively on radar systems, though I'm currently waiting for Defense Department confirmation that I can share it publicly in case any of the older documents it was trained that may fall under the Official Secrets Act. I'm truly grateful for the support so far, and I'll continue to post updates on the official website or here depending on what people prefer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A research team at the University of Oxford set out to make language models sound warmer and more empathetic, but ran into some unexpected side effects. They used a dataset of 1,617 conversations and 3,667 human-LLM message pairs, all biased toward warmer, more empathetic responses. The warmer models were more likely to reinforce conspiracy theories, repeat false information, and give questionable medical advice. The original models had error rates between 4 and 35 percent, but the "warmer" versions saw those rates rise by an average of 7.43 percent. This pattern held true for every architecture and model size the team tested. The researchers called it "a systematic rather than model-specific phenomenon." There was another side effect: the warmer models became much more likely to agree with users, even when the users were wrong. This tendency was especially strong when users expressed emotions. The effect was most dramatic when users showed sadness; in those cases, the reliability gap between warmer and original models nearly doubled to 11.9 percent. When users expressed admiration instead, the gap shrank to 5.23 percent. These versions proved at least as reliable, and sometimes even improved by up to 13 percent. Even simple system prompts nudging models toward warmth produced similar, though smaller and less consistent, effects compared to full fine-tuning. The team says these findings matter for building and governing human-like AI systems. They reveal a fundamental trade-off: optimizing for one positive trait can undermine another. Current evaluation practices, the researchers argue, might miss risks like these, since standard benchmarks don't pick up on them. They call for new development and oversight frameworks as AI systems become more involved in everyday life. The debate over warm vs. cold LLM behavior isn't just theoretical. In April, OpenAI rolled back a GPT-4o update because it flattered users too much and encouraged problematic behavior. When OpenAI later released GPT-5, it was criticized for being too "cold" compared to the "warmer" GPT-4o. But as this study suggests, those changes may come at the cost of reliability.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of the most iconic contemporary fantasy TV shows, Supernatural, was a star-maker for Jared Padalecki, but his replacement series deserves recognition as well. Padalecki was a huge part of what made Supernatural work, and his chemistry and brotherly relationship with his co-star, Jensen Ackles, kept fans on the edge of their seats for all fifteen seasons, from 2005 to 2020. However, this doesn't mean that Padalecki hasn't been busy since Supernatural ended, taking on interesting new roles and proving that he can be more than Sam Winchester, tackling characters who are completely different. Premiering only a year after Supernatural finally came to an end, and on the same network, it was clear that Walker was intended to be Padalecki's next long-running series, though this didn't turn out to be the case. Both Padalecki and Ackles have ventured into new genres, trying to move past the pull of Supernatural and cement themselves as actors to watch in the TV space outside fantasy. In Walker, Padalecki plays Cordell Walker, the protagonist and Texas Ranger who has to readjust to normal life and investigations after spending several years undercover, away from his family. While the interest in and popularity of the original series helped bolster Walker in its early years, there were certain aspects of the series that didn't live up to our expectations. The formulaic, episodic structure of Walker worked in the 1990s and early 2000s, but television is now inundated with similar projects, and Walker didn't set itself apart from the many works that engage with comparable themes. When Walker season 5 was canceled, it didn't come as a shock to most viewers, as Walker had been losing steam in the later years, failing to justify its continued existence. There are doubtlessly problems with Walker, but the negative reception that the series received from day one wasn't fair. It didn't help that there are so many reboots and revivals on TV today that Walker premiered to plenty of preconceived notions about the quality of the series. While Walker was never going to be a prestige drama, the writing sometimes came off as lazy and predictable, and Padalecki's series deserved better than this. The actor will be reunited with Ackles and Mischa Collins in The Boys, which will appeal to fans of both shows and give Padalecki a memorable guest spot. His other recent guest appearance on Fire Country also helped to remind audiences of Padalecki's skill. Supernatural is a television series that follows brothers Sam and Dean Winchester, who were raised by their father to hunt and combat supernatural entities after losing their mother to a demonic force. Traversing the American landscape in their '67 Chevy Impala, they face numerous paranormal threats. Alongside Padalecki stars Molly Hagan, Keegan Allen, Violet Brinson, and Kale Kulley. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Osgood Perkins, the director of Longlegs and The Monkey, is releasing a new horror movie called Keeper soon, which just got a new trailer. EXCLUSIVE: Helluva Boss star Richard Horvitz explains how he "always knew" the show would end up on Prime Video after beginning on YouTube. FBI season 8 needs a reset to correct one of its biggest current story issues, and the series' most underrated character provides the perfect fix. Jason Statham's masterpiece, which made over $760 million at the box office, is now taking over Netflix's Top 10 chart in the United States. Thing and Lurch have been vital figures since the beginning of The Addams Family, but Wednesday season 2 shows that they deserve better.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists are on high alert as an unidentified object has been detected speeding towards Earth. The nature of this object remains a mystery, but one expert suggests it could be extraterrestrial in origin. Harvard professor, Professor Loeb, has been outspoken about the potential existence of spaceships in the cosmos, and now speculates that this object could be a "mothership". What we know so far about this unidentified flying object First spotted on July 1, if the object turns out to be an alien vessel, Loeb estimates that such a craft would arrive on Earth between November 21 and December 5, 2025. This so-called 'interstellar' object is only the third of its kind ever observed in our solar system. 3I/ATLAS is currently zooming towards the inner solar system at a staggering speed of 135,000 miles per hour. It's also expected that the object will vanish behind the sun in September, and won't reappear in telescope view until November or December. Loeb cautions that this might indicate extraterrestrial presence – since the object could simply be evading Earth's detection systems and observational equipment. We better be prepared for both possibilities and verify that all interstellar objects are just rocks." He even proposed this bizarre trajectory – which contradicts the natural flow of the solar system – might represent a "defensive manoeuvre," as though an alien vessel were attempting to dodge a particular path. The mysterious object will also cruise past Venus, Mars and Jupiter. He was puzzled by the object's absence of a "tail". Comets viewed through telescopes display a distinct tail composed of dust. Most alarmingly, Loeb hinted the spacecraft might even be "hostile". He recommended we transmit a message to the potential ET visitors through radio waves. However, he has now reversed course, suggesting this could be seen as a threat to unknown visitors. Chris Lintott, an astronomer at the University of Oxford, has rejected his assertions, labeling them "absolute nonsense". He told Live Science that the theory about an alien probe is an "insult to the exciting work that is being done to understand this object". They added that we shouldn't worry, as this is still 130 million miles away.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Self-proclaimed medium and psychic Sylvia Browne has gone viral after some of her shockingly bad predictions resurfaced online. The TV personality died in 2013 at 77 years old, but her impact and many wildly incorrect predictions are still debated to this day. As noted by The Daily Mail, Browne went viral during the COVID-19 pandemic when people rediscovered an eerie prediction she made in her 2004 book End of Days. While some pointed to this as evidence of Browne's prophetic skills, others referred to the many other incidents where the TV psychic had made completely wrong and, often, dangerously insensitive, predictions, including several to the families of missing people. One infamous prediction happened during a 2004 appearance on The Montel Williams Show, when Browne told Louwanna Miller that her missing daughter, Amanda Berry, was “not alive,” explaining to the distraught mother, “Your daughter's not the kind who wouldn't call.” Berry was found alive in 2013 after she escaped years of captivity by Ariel Castro. Unfortunately, Miller had passed away in 2005, believing Browne “98 per cent” that her daughter was dead. There is no such place as Kokouro, Japan, and the girl's remains were later discovered in Texas. This happened again in 2002 when Browne told the mother of a missing woman that her daughter was in Hollywood working as a stripper. To this day, social media users still talk about Browne and her controversial career. “Special place in hell for people who exploit traumas of others for their own personal gain,” wrote one X user on Sunday (August 17). “Sylvia Browne was basically clickbait in human form,” said another. she used to be on Montel Williams all the time.. dont ask me what just made me think of her phony ass.. it was a random thought. such a shame that she was scamming all those people,” another added. One X user wrote, “I just want to know why Montel Williams kept bringing that lying a** b***h Sylvia Browne on his show, just telling them people anything.” ‘I don't mind going outside my comfort zone, but this was another level,' says Hemsworth of the high-stakes series, which sees him in pursuit of methods for a longer life.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In an unexpected twist, one of Connecticut's legendary fright stops has a fresh keeper. These overnight packages will allow dark tourism enthusiasts to immerse themselves in the paranormal environment while reflecting on its significance in American horror folklore.By opening the site again, Monroe could see an increase in visitors drawn by the Warrens' enduring legacy. Believers claim it carries a dangerous presence, and paranormal lore warns that those who mock or disrespect it could face misfortune.While its notoriety has been amplified by the success of The Conjuring films, experts have stressed the need to separate movie fiction from historical record. Government archives confirm that the Warrens' early investigations were never scientifically verified, and sceptics argue that their stories were dramatised to fuel interest.Despite scepticism, Annabelle continues to intrigue travellers. They argue that the artefacts were never meant for public entertainment but rather for careful study in a controlled environment.Recent tragedies have added weight to these warnings. The death of a paranormal investigator earlier this year, while unrelated to Annabelle, was linked by some believers to the doll's supposed curse. Experts, however, dismiss such connections as coincidences, cautioning against sensationalising tragedy.Town officials in Monroe have also expressed the need for strict oversight. With the property located in a residential neighbourhood, any renewed public operation must comply with safety, traffic, and zoning requirements to avoid repeating past conflicts.Separating Fiction from RealityDark tourism thrives on the tension between legend and fact. While stories about cursed objects and restless spirits may lack scientific proof, they provide cultural insight into how communities interpret fear and mortality.Tourism experts stress that the Annabelle doll, the Warrens' cases, and similar stories are best approached as folklore enriched by pop culture. These narratives, while not grounded in verified fact, help preserve an alternative layer of American history—one shaped by superstition, religious belief, and the human need to explain the unknown.For many travellers, this blend of entertainment and history is precisely what makes such attractions compelling. The Warrens' legacy, fictionalised in blockbuster films, continues to draw curiosity and ensures that their Monroe home remains one of New England's most iconic sites.A Revival of Dark Tourism in ConnecticutThe reopening of the Warrens' home and museum is poised to revitalise paranormal tourism in Connecticut. Visitors will be able to engage with artefacts tied to famous cases, tour a home that once housed two of America's most well-known ghost hunters, and perhaps spend a night in an atmosphere steeped in legend.While sceptics dismiss the paranormal elements as fiction, the cultural and historical value of the site cannot be ignored. It reflects the ways in which myth becomes woven into local history, transforming ordinary spaces into landmarks of intrigue.For those planning a visit, the museum represents more than just entertainment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Photo: Ray Szymanski inside the Arnold House at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, which TAPS declared officially haunted following a 2008 investigation. The internationally acclaimed author will present on paranormal activity at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base at the Ypsilanti Library, Michigan Avenue Branch, on Thursday, September 25, 2025. The presentation, entitled “ET, Spirits, & Men in Black: The Spooky Side of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,” will focus on widespread reports of paranormal phenomena and reliable witness testimony to unusual happenings at the base, which has long been linked in UFO lore to crash wreckage and unexplained events. “This is a very different talk than my normal presentations,” Szymanski said, noting the program's exclusive focus on Wright-Patterson. Earlier this year, he delivered an invited presentation to a well-known UFO group in Cremona, Italy. As part of ongoing collaboration among UFO researchers, his books are being translated into Italian. The first title, Swamp Gas My Ass (SGMA), is expected to be released in Italian by the end of 2025, with Fifty Shades slated to follow. Szymanski will return to Michigan in March 2026 to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Dexter and Hillsdale “Swamp Gas” UFO events of March 20 and 21, 1966. Those talks will be held at the Dexter District Library on the exact anniversary dates and will feature newly revealed witness testimony never before shared publicly. Registration for those events will open shortly after New Year's Day 2026 on the Dexter Library website.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump baffled social media users on Sunday morning by sharing just one word on his Truth Social platform, reigniting the amusing "covfefe" conversation from 2017 and generating fresh conspiracy theories regarding the Russia-Ukraine war. Given that he's not recognised for employing Italian expressions, it seemed improbable that Trump meant to write "bella" with double L's, signifying "beautiful." California Governor Gavin Newsom's press team seized the moment to declare triumph over Trump, with whom he's been engaged in an ongoing social media rivalry in recent weeks, stating: "We broke Donald Trump." Back in 2017, Trump shared the word "covfefe" on Twitter, mystifying commentators and social media users whilst sparking numerous memes and jokes targeting the president's mental sharpness. On Sunday morning, his "bela" message produced a comparable result. Trump detractor George Conway suggested that "bela" was a "blend" of "covfefe." The Lincoln Project, a conservative organisation frequently critical of Trump, declared that Trump had unleashed the latest "covfefe." While many found amusement in the post, others interpreted it as a cryptic message with profound implications for the president's trump card in his largely unsuccessful mediation between Russia and Ukraine, reports the Irish Star. "TRUMP JUST POSTED 'BELA,'" one X user penned. They went on to explain that "Bela" represents Belarus, described as "the hinge between NATO and Russia." Another user responded: "In Eastern Europe, Bela is a card game where you shout it when you play the King and Queen of trumps together. It's the strongest pair, and you only get the points if you announce it out loud. He posted it right after Putin briefed Belarus's Lukashenko on their summit. If symbolic, it could mean a new power alliance being put on the table," they said." Trump, who promised during his 2024 campaign that he would resolve the Ukraine-Russia conflict on Day 1 of his presidency, has made scant progress towards achieving peace. Putin seemed to disregard Trump's recent threats of imposing harsh sanctions on Russia unless steps were taken towards a ceasefire, continuing to attack Ukrainian troops on Friday night following their meeting in Alaska. Trump and Vice President JD Vance are set to meet with Zelensky at the White House on Monday, following their previous encounter which saw a heated and embarrassing exchange inside the Oval Office.
