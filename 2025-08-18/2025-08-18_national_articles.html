                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>(Old Orchard Beach Police Department via AP, File) This image provided by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement shows Jon Luke Evans. (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) via AP, File) OLD ORCHARD BEACH, Maine (AP) — A Maine police officer arrested by immigration authorities has agreed to voluntarily leave the country, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Monday. ICE arrested Old Orchard Beach Police Department reserve Officer Jon Luke Evans, of Jamaica, on July 25, as part of the agency's effort to step up immigration enforcement. Officials with the town and police department have said federal authorities previously told them Evans was legally authorized to work in the U.S. The representative did not provide other details about Evans' case. Evans' arrest touched off a dispute between Old Orchard Beach officials and ICE. E-Verify is an online system that allows employers to check if potential employees can work legally in the U.S. “The town reiterates its ongoing commitment to meeting all state and federal laws regarding employment,” Chard said in a statement. “We will continue to rely on the I-9 Employment Eligibility Verification form and the E-Verify database to confirm employment eligibility.” ICE's detainee lookup website said Monday that Evans was being held at the Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, Rhode Island. However, a representative for Wyatt said Evans had been transferred to an ICE facility in Burlington, Massachusetts. ICE officials did not respond to requests for comment on the discrepancy. ICE officials said in July that Evans overstayed his visa and unlawfully attempted to purchase a firearm.</p>

The owner says his employees were asked for immigration status by ICE and then he was told that the truck's tires were bad and it would have to be towed, though he insists it recently passed DC inspection. Snowden, left, shows James Maseno of Grandal, Md., how to take a selfie next to an M-ATV infantry mobility vehicle, outside the Union Station in Washington, Monday, Aug. 18, 2025. WASHINGTON (AP) — Joining forces from three other Republican-led states, the Mississippi National Guard will deploy 200 troops to Washington as part of the Trump administration's ongoing federal policing and immigration overhaul in the nation's capital. Tate Reeves said in a statement Monday that he has approved the deployment of approximately 200 Mississippi National Guard Soldiers to Washington, D.C. West Virginia said it was deploying 300 to 400 troops, South Carolina pledged 200 and Ohio said it will send 150 in the coming days, deployments that built on top of President Donald Trump's initial order that 800 National Guard troops deploy as part of the federal intervention. Trump's executive order that launched the federal operation declared a “crime emergency” in the District of Columbia and initiated a takeover Washington's police department. The administration has ordered local police to cooperate with federal agents on immigration enforcement, orders that would contradict local laws prohibiting such collaboration. has been under siege from thugs and killers, but now, D.C. is back under Federal Control where it belongs,” Trump wrote on his social media website a day after issuing his order. “The focus should be on violent crime,” Bowser continued. “Nobody is against focusing on driving down any level of violence. And so if this is really about immigration enforcement the administration should make that plain.” National Guard members in the District of Columbia have been assisting law enforcement with tasks including crowd control and patrolling landmarks such as the National Mall and Union Station. Their role has been limited thus far, and it remains unclear why additional troops would be needed. Federal agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Secret Service and other agencies have patrolled high traffic areas around the capital over the last week. The White House has touted various arrests that local police and federal agents have made across the city since Trump's executive order. The White House has touted the surge of agents on social media and posted pictures of people arrested by local and federal officers. “Washington, DC is getting safer every night thanks to our law enforcement partners,” Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on social media. In total, there have been nearly 400 arrests—and we are not slowing down.” Bowser said Monday that she had asked D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith to seek answers from the administration about the use of masked police. “It's very important to us that agents be identified,” Bowser said. “There's no reason for a law enforcement official to be masked.” Over the weekend in Washington, protesters pushed back on federal law enforcement and National Guard troops fanning out in the city.

Fox News correspondent Mark Meredith reports on the efforts being made by Texas Republicans to restructure the state's district map, leaving their Democrat counterparts 'furious,' on 'Special Report.' Judges for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Louisiana's request to allow it to enforce its long-stalled congressional redistricting map, delivering a near-term blow to Republicans in the state by ruling that it amounts to an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. They also affirmed the district court's ruling that the map in question violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act by, "'packing' Black voters into a small number of majority-Black districts, and ‘cracking' other Black communities across multiple districts, thereby depriving them of the opportunity to form effective voting blocs." Judges on the panel also rejected the state's contention that conditions in Louisiana have changed enough to render race-conscious remedies obsolete. Black Louisiana voters and civil rights advocates mass outside the Supreme Court in March 2025 ahead of oral arguments in Louisiana v. Callais, centered on the state's congressional map. "There is no legal basis for this proposition, and the state offers no evidence that conditions in Louisiana have changed" enough to negate that need, the court said in its ruling. Still, any relief for plaintiffs from the appeals court ruling is likely to be short-lived. The Supreme Court in March heard oral arguments in Louisiana v. Callais, which also centers on the legality of Louisiana's redistricting map and whether race should be considered a factor in drawing new congressional districts. Oral arguments then focused heavily on whether Louisiana's redistricting efforts were narrowly tailored enough to meet constitutional requirements and whether race was used in a way that violated the law, as the appellees alleged.

(Ricky Carioti /The Washington Post via Getty Images) Earlier this month, justices ordered both parties to file supplemental briefs by mid-September, outlining in further detail arguments for and against Louisiana's proposed map and whether the intentional creation of a second majority-Black congressional district "violates the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments to the U.S. It also comes at a pivotal time in the U.S., as new and politically charged redistricting fights have popped up in other states ahead of next year's midterm elections. An envelope containing a 2020 census letter is seen in this May 21, 2020 photo. The first version, which included only one majority-Black district, was blocked by a federal court in 2022. But it was almost immediately challenged by a group of non-Black plaintiffs in court, who took issue with a new district that stretched some 250 miles from Louisiana's northwest corner of Shreveport to Baton Rouge, in the state's southeast. They argued in their lawsuit that the state violated the equal protection clause by relying too heavily on race to draw the maps and created a "sinuous and jagged second majority-Black district." The intense court fights in Louisiana underscore the broader redistricting battles playing out in Republican- and Democrat-led states across the country, as they spar over new congressional maps with an eye to the looming midterm elections. In Texas, tensions reached a fever pitch after Democratic state legislators fled the Lone Star State to block Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's ability to convene a legislative quorum to pass the state's aggressive new redistricting map, which would create five additional Republican-leaning districts. Gavin Newsom responded by introducing a new map of his own that favors Democrats. The move highlights how both parties are engaged in aggressive redistricting battles, with Republican-led states pushing maps to defend the GOP's slim House majority and Democrats seeking to expand their own advantages. As with most midterms following a new president's election, 2026 is expected to serve as a referendum on the White House — raising GOP concerns that they could lose control of the chamber. Gavin Newsom speaks during a news conference on Thursday, Aug. 14, 2025, in Los Angeles. Kathy Hochul, for her part, vowed at a press conference earlier this month to explore "every option" in redrawing state lines. "We are at war," Hochul said, speaking alongside the Texas Democrats who fled to her state.

Egyptian Foreign Minister Bader Abdelattay said on Monday that his Qatari counterpart Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani arrived in Cairo and joined talks on restarting ceasefire negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Mustafa, right, and Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty, second right, visit Palestinian Mohammed Abu Dakkah, from Gaza Strip, who receives medical care at Arish hospital, in Arish, Egypt, Monday, Aug. 18, 2025. RAFAH, Egypt (AP) — Hamas said Monday it has accepted a new proposal from Arab mediators for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip that would still need Israel's approval, as Gaza's Health Ministry said the Palestinian death toll from 22 months of war has passed 62,000. U.S. President Donald Trump meanwhile appeared to cast doubt on the long-running negotiations that Washington has mediated as well. Israel announced plans to reoccupy Gaza City and other heavily populated areas after ceasefire talks appeared to break down last month, raising the possibility of a worsening humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, which experts say is sliding into famine. Hundreds of thousands took part in mass protests on Sunday calling for their return. Abdelatty spoke to journalists during a visit to Egypt's Rafah crossing with Gaza, which has not functioned since Israel seized the Palestinian side in May 2024. Abdelatty said Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani had joined the talks, which include senior Hamas leader Khalil al-Hayya, who arrived in Cairo last week. Abdelatty said they are open to other ideas, including for a comprehensive deal that would release all the hostages at once. The official said it is almost identical to an earlier proposal accepted by Israel, which has not yet joined the latest talks. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video addressing the Israeli public that reports of Hamas' acceptance of the proposal showed that it is “under massive pressure.” Netanyahu has vowed to continue the war until all the hostages are returned and Hamas has been disarmed, and to maintain lasting security control over Gaza. Hamas has said it will only release the remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal. Around 20 of the hostages still in Gaza are believed by Israel to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefires or other deals. It does not say how many were civilians or combatants, but says women and children make up around half the dead. The ministry said 1,965 people have been killed while seeking humanitarian aid since May, either in the chaos around U.N. convoys or while heading to sites operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, an Israeli-backed American contractor. Witnesses, health officials and the U.N. human rights office say Israeli forces have repeatedly fired toward crowds of people seeking aid. Israel says it has only fired warning shots at people who approached its forces. GHF says its armed contractors have only used pepper spray or fired into the air on rare occasions to prevent deadly crowding. Experts have warned that Israel's ongoing offensive is pushing Gaza toward famine, even after it eased a complete 2 1/2-month blockade on the territory in May. Gaza's Health Ministry said Monday that five more people, including two children, died of malnutrition-related causes. It says at least 112 children have died of malnutrition-related causes since the war began, and 151 adults have died since the ministry started tracking adult malnutrition deaths in June. Israel has rejected such allegations, saying it allows in enough food and accusing the U.N. of failing to promptly deliver it. U.N. agencies say they are hindered by Israeli restrictions and the breakdown of law and order in the territory, around three-quarters of which is now controlled by Israel. Australian Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke defended the move, saying: “If you are coming to Australia to spread a message of hate and division, we don't want you here.” In response, Israel revoked the visas of Australian representatives to the Palestinian Authority and told the Israeli Embassy in Australia to “carefully examine” any official visa applications from Australia to Israel, Foreign Minister Gideon Saar wrote on X. Australia joined 27 other Western-allied nations in a joint statement last month calling for an end to the war and joined a smaller circle of countries in sanctioning two far-right Israeli government ministers accused of inciting violence against Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Fox News correspondent Mark Meredith reports on President Donald Trump's plans to annul prior climate policy on ‘Special Report.' FIRST ON FOX: A prominent pro-energy group is calling on the Trump administration to investigate what it suspects is a coordinated "national lawfare campaign" by left-wing climate activists aimed at influencing thousands of judges on how to approach climate litigation. In a letter sent this week to Attorney General Pam Bondi, Power the Future Founder and Executive Director Dan Turner warned that the Federal Judicial Center, in partnership with the Environmental Law Institute's Climate Judiciary Project, is engaged in "behind-closed-doors advocacy" for climate lawfare. "Specifically, Power The Future is concerned that the FJC is actively assisting in a campaign which boasts of having ‘educated' approximately two thousand judges, including federal judges, on how to approach climate" litigation," the letter explains. "'Climate' litigation actually seeks in part to impose federal energy (rationing) policy through the courts, even though policy ‘must be addressed by the two other branches of government.' The FJC enlisted in this campaign by hosting seminars for judges with speakers drawn exclusively from the world of plaintiffs' witnesses or historic amicus brief filers in support of the plaintiffs." (Brian A. Jackson/South Florida Sun Sentinel; Ronen Tivony/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) A Fox News Digital review in December shows that several CJP expert lawyers and judges have close ties to the curriculum and are deeply involved in climate litigation, while the group attempted to distance itself at the time, saying, "CJP doesn't participate in litigation, support or coordinate with any parties in litigation, or advise judges on how they should rule in any case." "One February 2021 email from a plaintiff's witness who ELI arranged to serially brief judges on ‘climate' litigation, Dr. Don Wuebbles, references 'the kind of issues that Judge Tatel raised towards counteracting arguments from nonbelievers' in catastrophic man-made global warming." Wuebbles hit back against claims there were "cozy ties" between judges and climate activists in comments to Fox News Digital, calling the Power the Future letter a "highly distorted look at what we do as scientists," while defending that he is a "PhD atmospheric scientist and professor…," not an "activist." Wuebbles did explain that he has helped "educate judges on the science of climate change" when asked by the courts across his career. But the truth should still come out for all Americans to be aware of, including judges and the courts. As part of this, the misinformation of contrarians needs to be responded to by responses demonstrating the real state of the science and what the actual measurements and scientific analyses really show us — that is what we do as scientists. The letter to the DOJ included other FOIA'd emails, including one dated March 23, 2021, that was sent by CJP founder Paul Hanle to "a serial presenter, plaintiff's expert witness Dr. Ben Santer" regarding presenting a climate science lecture to more than 100 judges. "Hanle later thanked Santer for Santer's presentation ‘to a large group of judges — perhaps one to two hundred,' stating, in relevant part, ‘I would venture you convinced many who did not know before that the science has moved far and fast and the scientific case is underpinned by very strong evidence.' Hanle added, ‘Your approach is very effective with judges.'" While another email, sent by an ELI official to both Hanle and Santer, the official says, "that [the judge] connected this material to her own docket …[is] [j]ust what we want to see!" "You certainly had an impact on her," Hanle said. Santer told Fox News Digital in an emailed comment Monday when asked about the correspondence that his job is to "improve scientific and public understanding of the nature, causes, and impacts of climate change." "I've done this job for over 35 years, through my research in ‘climate fingerprinting' and through public lecturing to a variety of different audiences. Judges are one of those audiences, along with professional societies, Rotary Clubs, universities, schools, and conservative organizations like the Pacific Club, Jonathan Club, and Bohemian Grove," he wrote. "As of today, U.S. climate scientists still have the freedom to educate U.S. citizens on the reality and seriousness of climate change. While it still exists, I intend to continue serving as a ‘serial presenter' on climate science," he continued. When approached for comment on the matter, FJC's Deputy Director Clara Altman said it had not worked with ELI since 2020, after holding a series of seminars in coordination with the group the year prior. "The Federal Judicial Center conducted a series of small one-day seminars with the Environmental Law Institute for fewer than 100 judges in total in 2019 and early 2020. The Federal Judicial Center has not done any programs with ELI since. In all its programs, the Center strives to present content objectively and from a range of views," Altman said, adding that FJC is not affiliated with NJC. A climate protester scales the Wilson Building as part of an Earth Day rally against fossil fuels on April 22, 2022. Fox News Digital reported in July that CJP organized a years-long, nationwide online forum with jurists to promote favorable information and litigation updates regarding climate issues — until the email-styled group chat was abruptly made private last year. The listserv was established after CJP coordinated with the National Judicial College to establish its first cohort of judges who took part in a "Judicial Leaders in Climate Science" program in 2022. The listserv, which included at least five judges from across the nation and CJP leaders, was active from September 2022 to May 2024, and facilitated correspondence between the group's members as they traded links on climate studies, congratulated one another on hosting recent environmental events, shared updates on recent climate cases that were remanded to state courts and encouraged participation in other CJP meet-ups. A handful of other judges responded to Laster's video and message, praising it as "great work." Following Fox News Digital's reporting on the listserv, CJP's website received a facelift that included removing one of the judge's names and his favorable testimony of the group's work and anonymized the names of other judges who praised CJP as an "essential" resource for jurists. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, questions Pam Bondi, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to be attorney general, during her Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing in Hart building on Wednesday, Jan. 15, 2025. Recent changes to CJP's website were made to protect privacy and prevent baseless criticism and harassment," the spokesperson told Fox News Digital in August when asked about the website revamp. "The programs in which CJP participates are no different than other judicial education programs, providing evidence-based training on legal and scientific topics that judges voluntarily choose to attend," the spokesperson continued. News of CJP's outreach comes as the U.S. has seen a sharp uptick in climate-related lawsuits in recent years — including cases targeting oil giants Shell, BP and ExxonMobil for allegedly using "deceptive" marketing and downplaying the risks of climate change. Lawsuits have also been brought against state governments and federal agencies, including the Interior Department, for allegedly failing to address pollution risks or protect against the harms of climate change, according to the plaintiffs. Conservative lawmakers have meanwhile put CJP under the public's microscope for alleged "lawfare," most notably Sen. Ted Cruz, who said during a Senate subcommittee hearing in June that there is a "systematic campaign" launched by the Chinese Communist Party and American left-wing activists to weaponize the court systems to "undermine American energy dominance." CJP, Cruz said, is a pivotal player in the "lawfare" as it works to secure "judicial capture." Judicial communications with climate activists over litigation and environmental issues date back years. In 2019, a federal judge hit "reply all" to an email chain with 45 other judges and court staff about an invitation to a climate seminar hosted by the Environmental Law Institute. Colleagues later chastised the judge for sharing "this nonsense" and suggested it was an ethics violation, though others defended the judge's decision, saying flagging the event was not unethical.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said he will bring “honesty” to the 2026 elections through an executive order eliminating mail-in ballots and voting machines. Trump has long opposed voting by mail or electronically, particularly since his 2020 election loss. During his second presidential run, he repeatedly said there was widespread voter fraud. Countries with right-wing governments, such as Italy, also offer limited mail-in voting. The U.S. has had a form of mail-in voting for centuries. Countries such as Russia, France, and Portugal do not allow in-country mail-in voting. Trump recently said Russian President Vladimir Putin agrees that mail-in voting is not “honest.” He also predicted that his effort to remove mail-in voting and voting machines would be opposed by Democrats “BECAUSE THEY CHEAT AT LEVELS NEVER SEEN BEFORE” and that they are “unelectable” without them. Eight states and the District of Columbia allow their elections to be entirely run by mail-in voting. Twenty-eight states allow mail-in voting without an excuse, and 14 others require a reason to vote absentee or by mail. He said in 2020 that mail-in voting was primed to encounter foreign influence. The Dems talk of foreign influence in voting, but they know that Mail-In Voting is an easy way for foreign countries to enter the race,” Trump said. Many of Trump's claims about the rigged election process came from quick Republican leads on election night that evaporated when more Democratic mail-in votes cut into leads across the country. Experts believe voter fraud is rare in the U.S. and almost never influences an election's outcome.</p>

Several European heads of state arrived at the White House on Monday ahead of their meeting with President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. NATO general secretary Mark Rutte and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also arrived to the White House. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy arrived to the White House for his high-stakes meeting with President Donald Trump wearing more formal attire than his typical relaxed wardrobe. Zelenskyy is back in Washington, D.C., Monday to meet with Trump following the U.S. president's historic meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin Friday in Alaska to discuss the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. The Putin meeting did not yield a peace agreement, with Trump now urging Ukraine to accept a land swap deal with Russia, arguing it is the most efficient way to end the war. The meeting Monday also includes European leaders such as French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Finnish President Alexander Stubb. Zelenskyy has previously come under fire and questioning regarding his public attire, which has routinely included him sporting dark green T-shirts, sweatshirts and other relaxed military-style outfits, as opposed to suits. Excerpt from an article by Fox News' Emma Colton You're at the highest level in this country's office, and you refuse to wear a suit," one reporter asked Zelenskyy when he visited the White House in February. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is greeted by US President Donald Trump (L) upon arrival at the White House West Wing in Washington, DC, on August 18, 2025. European leaders join Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in talks with US President Donald Trump on August 18, as they try to find a way to end Russia's offensive. Zelensky is set to join a cohort of European heads of state who are also visiting the White House on Monday in solidarity with Ukraine. Trump has urged Zelenskyy to pursue a peace deal floated by Russian President Vladimir Putin that would see Ukraine cede some of its territory. The Ukrainian leader wore an all-black outfit with a thick outer suit and tie. The group includes Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, White House Chief of Staff Susan Wiles, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, and Special Envoy Keith Kellogg. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will also be present. President Donald Trump's foreign policy agenda is set to take center stage again this week, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visiting the White House on Monday as Washington continues efforts to broker peace between Moscow and Kyiv. The White House has yet to release details of the meeting but has acknowledged that key European allies will accompany Zelenskyy. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Finnish President Alexander Stubb all confirmed their plans to attend. Over the weekend, Zelenskyy acknowledged his last White House visit — cut short by a shouting match with both Trump and Vice President JD Vance — and told reporters in Brussels he hopes Monday's meeting "will be productive" rather than a repeat of February's encounter. The upcoming meeting comes on the heels of Trump's summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Anchorage on Friday, where the U.S. leader shifted from demanding a ceasefire to calling for a final peace deal. Trump discussed some of the details of his meeting with Putin during a phone call with Zelenskyy from Air Force One. President Donald Trump said Sunday that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy could end the war with Russia "almost immediately" if he wanted. Trump's comments come ahead of his scheduled meeting with Zelenskyy and several European leaders in Washington, D.C. on Monday. "President Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight," Trump said in a post on Truth Social. No getting back Obama given Crimea (12 years ago, without a shot being fired! NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and Finnish President Alexander Stubb confirmed Sunday they would attend the meeting in Washington. Their joint presence underscores Europe's push to present a united front as Russia's war drags on. Zelenskyy met von der Leyen in Brussels ahead of the Trump talks to set priorities for the White House meeting, focusing on long-term military aid, Ukraine's EU ambitions, and bolstering transatlantic solidarity against Russian aggression. Von der Leyen said at a joint press conference she was glad to join Zelenskyy and other leaders in Washington on Monday. President Donald Trump was tight-lipped after his high-stakes summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday but offered some key insight into the meeting to Fox News' Sean Hannity in an exclusive interview. He noted, however, that "we did make a lot of progress." Not prepared to share what the sticking point was Pressed by Hannity to share what the "one big issue you don't agree on" that kept the leaders from walking away with a ceasefire deal, Trump declined to share. I guess somebody's going to go public with it, they'll figure it out, but no, I don't want to do that, I want to see if we can get it done." The president said he would be open to attending a trilateral meeting with the presidents of Ukraine and Russia, saying, "If they'd like, I'll be at that meeting. They're going to set up a meeting now between President Zelenskyy and President Putin and myself, I guess, not that I want to be there, but I want to get it done." World-renowned hostage negotiator Chris Voss spoke with The New York Times' David Marchese in a Saturday podcast interview, where he discussed how President Donald Trump demonstrates empathy. Voss, a former longtime hostage negotiator for the FBI, was asked by Marchese whether he believes Trump and his administration "demonstrate empathy." Marchese followed up on the hostage negotiator's response, asking, "What makes you say that?" Now, my view is that's smart for a number of reasons. First of all, if you agree to take out the head of a country, you're declaring there's open season and fair is fair, which means they're free to come after you," he explained. Not necessarily agreeing, not being on their side, but if empathy is understanding how somebody sees it, I think he has a highly evolved sense of it." Fox News' Bret Baier will sit down for an exclusive interview with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday night following his meeting with President Donald Trump at the White House. Zelenskyy is scheduled to meet with Trump alongside several top European leaders, including U.K. Prime Minister Kier Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friederich Merz and others. Trump has urged Zelenskyy publicly to pursue a peace deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin that would see Ukraine lose some of its territory. EXCLUSIVE: First Lady Melania Trump wrote a "peace letter" to Russian President Vladimir Putin telling him "it is time" to protect children and future generations around the globe, Fox News Digital has learned. Fox News Digital exclusively obtained the "peace letter" the first lady penned to Putin, which  President Trump hand-delivered to the Russian leader before their summit in Alaska, Fox News Digital has learned. "Every child shares the same quiet dreams in their heart, whether born randomly into a nation's rustic countryside or a magnificent city-center. They dream of love, possibility, and safety from danger." "Undeniably, we must strive to paint a dignity-filled world for all—so that every soul may wake to peace, and so that the future itself is perfectly guarded," read the letter. "A simple yet profound concept, Mr. Putin, as I am sure you agree, is that each generation's descendants begin their lives with a purity—an innocence which stands above geography, government, and ideology." "Mr. Putin, you can singlehandedly restore their melodic laughter," the first lady wrote. "Such a bold idea transcends all human division, and you, Mr. Putin, are fit to implement this vision with a stroke of the pen today," she wrote. President Donald Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday, and their negotiations have set the stage for what Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy can expect from his meeting at the White House on Monday. He is now calling for a larger peace deal to end the war entirely, with Putin having offered peace if Ukraine will agree to cede some of its territory. Trump has spent the weekend urging Ukraine to accept such a deal saying the U.S. would also give Ukraine security assurances moving forward. NATO general secretary Mark Rutte and `European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are also set to join. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will likely opt for a more formal look when he meets with President Donald Trump in Washington, D.C., on Monday, according to a designer who has previously collaborated with the European leader. "Tomorrow he most likely will not appear in a polo," Ukrainian designer Elvira Gasanova told Fox News Digital. Having previously come under fire for his informal attire, Zelenskyy is likely to choose "a more serious look — though less symbolic," according to Gasanova. "After the recent ‘no suit' drama, he will likely approach this question differently," she said. That meeting with Trump and Vice President JD Vance escalated into a heated exchange between the three leaders over what "cards" Ukraine holds and whether Zelenskyy has expressed sufficient gratitude to the United States. You're at the highest level in this country's office, and you refuse to wear a suit," one reporter asked Zelenskyy at the time. Unlike many politicians, the Ukrainian president does not have personal stylists, according to Gasanova, who is the founder of Ukrainian fashion brands GASANOVA and DAMIRLI. Gasanova said she has previously designed clothing items for both Zelenskyy and Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reaffirmed on Sunday that Kyiv will not offer territorial concessions to Moscow, underscoring his hard line as the Kremlin's three-and-a-half-year conflict drags on. "The constitution of Ukraine makes it impossible to give up territory or trade land," Zelenskyy said during a press conference at the European Commission on Sunday. In short, losing Donbas would strip Ukraine of a key economic lifeline and hand Moscow new leverage over Kyiv. "Since the territorial issue is so important, it should be discussed only by the leaders of Ukraine and Russia at the trilateral [talks with] Ukraine, United States, Russia," Zelenskyy said, adding that Moscow has not acknowledged hosting a joint meeting with Kyiv and Washington. Steve Witkoff, the U.S. Special Envoy for Peace Missions, said Moscow showed new readiness for peace at the Alaska summit, calling Putin's commitments “robust” concessions. “The Russians agreed on enshrining legislative language that they would attest to not attempting to take any more land from Ukraine after a peace deal, where they would attest to not violating any European borders.” He explained that Trump shifted focus from an immediate ceasefire to pursuing a broader peace agreement. European leaders later praised Trump's efforts to “stop the killing in Ukraine” and push for a lasting settlement. Former Vice President Mike Pence urged President Donald Trump to act swiftly against Russia, saying tougher sanctions are needed alongside negotiations. On CNN's State of the Union on Sunday, Pence said Trump often uses a “velvet glove” approach with dictators, but “the hammer needs to come, and it needs to come immediately.” He pressed Trump to call Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., to move forward on a secondary sanctions bill that enjoys broad support. “The combination of engagement, but also making it clear to Putin that we are prepared to take actions that would literally break his economy even while we redouble our commitment to the security of Ukraine,” Pence said. While crediting Trump for pursuing peace, Pence warned against delays. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy heads into a high-stakes White House meeting with President Donald Trump on Monday, as Washington considers security guarantees for Kyiv and debate intensifies over whether land concessions to Russia could end the war. Zelenskyy will be flanked by key European allies at the White House, a diplomatic overture that signals Europe's determination to rally behind Ukraine. Over the weekend, the Ukrainian leader acknowledged his last White House visit – cut short by a shouting match between Trump and Vice President JD Vance – and told reporters in Brussels he hopes Monday's meeting "will be productive" rather than a repeat of February's encounter. The upcoming meeting comes on the heels of Trump's summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Anchorage on Friday, where the U.S. leader shifted from demanding a ceasefire to calling for a final peace deal. Secretary of State Marco Rubio rejected claims that President Donald Trump is backing Vladimir Putin's demand for Russia to take control of Ukraine's Donbas. He stressed that only Kyiv can decide its territorial future. Rubio described Trump's Alaska summit with Putin as producing “progress,” but warned talks could unravel if Washington imposes further sanctions. “The minute you put additional sanctions on him [Putin]… peace talks are no longer possible,” he said. He argued that Trump is the only leader capable of brokering a settlement, while European partners must provide security guarantees. “If one side gets everything they want, that's not a peace deal. The White House meeting grew tense in its final approximate 10 minutes, after Vice President JD Vance said that peace would be reached between Russia and Ukraine through U.S. diplomacy efforts. "I've actually watched and seen the stories and I know that what happens is you bring people, you bring them on a propaganda tour," Vance continued. President Donald Trump is hosting an unprecedented lineup of top European leaders at the White House on Monday as they discuss how to end the war in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will of course be present, but the leaders of Europe's most powerful countries will be joining him. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Finnish President Alexander Stubb are also scheduled to attend the White House meetings, as well as NATO general secretary Mark Rutte and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Trump remarked that it is a "great honor" for the U.S. to host so many prominent world leaders. Their joint presence underscores Europe's determination to present a united front as the West seeks to end Russia's war without compromising Ukraine's security or sovereignty. Before departing for Washington, Zelenskyy met with von der Leyen at the European Commission in Brussels to discuss priorities for the White House talks, focusing on long-term military aid, Ukraine's ambitions to join the EU, and bolstering transatlantic security. "We will continue to support you for as long as it takes," von der Leyen said, adding that the EU backs a trilateral meeting between Ukraine, Russia and the United States. The White House has yet to release details of the meeting set for Monday, August 18, but has acknowledged that key European allies will accompany Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Finnish President Alexander Stubb all confirmed their plans to attend. Over the weekend, Zelenskyy acknowledged his last White House visit — cut short by a shouting match with both Trump and Vice President JD Vance — and told reporters in Brussels he hopes Monday's meeting "will be productive" rather than a repeat of February's encounter. Following the explosive geopolitical meeting earlier this year, several world leaders showed their support for Zelenskyy including Macron who said, "There is an aggressor: Russia. We must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war." This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip is a “red line” and Cairo will not allow any party to risk Egypt's national security or sovereignty, Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty said on Monday. In an exclusive interview with CNN in the northern Egyptian town of Al-Arish, close to the Gaza border, Abdelatty said that Egypt is working through “different channels, with one objective, to alleviate the burden and suffering of Palestinians,” adding that mass Palestinian emigration from Gaza would not be tolerated by his country. “We will not accept it, we will not participate in it, and we will not allow it to happen,” Abdelatty told CNN, adding that displacement is guaranteed to be a “one way ticket” for Palestinians out of Gaza, which would lead to the “liquidation” of their cause altogether. The Israeli government has never given a detailed vision of what will happen to Gaza after the war but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly advocated for moving Palestinians from Gaza to other countries, particularly after US President Donald Trump floated the idea early this year. But even after Trump appeared to cool on the proposal, Israeli officials have embraced it. Cairo has come under intense public pressure to alleviate the suffering of Palestinians and has repeatedly blamed Israel for blocking aid as thousands of trucks remain stranded at its border. Asked whether the war places the Egypt-Israel peace treaty at risk, Abdelatty said Cairo is “respecting and honoring (its) commitments according to the peace treaty,” but added that “any kind of displacement would be a big risk and we will not allow any single party to risk our national security and our sovereignty… in our border.” Egypt was the first Arab nation to recognize Israel in 1979. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said last week  that talks are underway with several countries about taking in displaced Palestinians. The countries involved are South Sudan, Somaliland, Ethiopia, Libya, and Indonesia, a senior Israeli official told CNN. In exchange for taking in some of Gaza's population of more than two million people, the official said the countries are looking for “significant financial and international compensation.” South Sudan rejected earlier reports that it was in discussions about the resettlement of Palestinians, saying they were “baseless.” Indonesia said it was ready to take in 2,000 Palestinians from Gaza for treatment but that they would return to Gaza once they recovered. Earlier this year, Somaliland also said there were no such talks. “Unfortunately, we don't have a partner in Israel right now for peace and the two-state solution,” he said. Israel's far-right ministers, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, have called for an expansion of the war in Gaza and the emigration of Palestinians from the enclave, which critics have said amounts to ethnic cleansing. Abdelatty said negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage deal are, however, ongoing, adding that “we reached a sort of understanding on most of the building issues” with regards to the latest proposal submitted by US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff. Last month, the US and Israel recalled their negotiating teams from Qatar, where talks had been taking place, with Witkoff saying the latest response from Hamas “clearly shows a lack of desire to reach a ceasefire.” The Egyptian foreign minister said Cairo is in favor of a comprehensive deal that ends the war, brings back hostages, releases Palestinian prisoners and allows aid to flow in. Israel's demand to immediately disarm Hamas is, he said, an “impossible” condition at this stage of the talks. How can we do it on the ground?” he said, adding that Israel has tried to eliminate the group through a 22-month bombardment campaign and still failed. “We need to push now (for a deal),” Abdelatty said. On Monday, CNN saw dozens of aid trucks lining the roads to the Rafah crossing with Gaza, where many convoys have remained idle for weeks or even months, often causing essential food aid to spoil. Another driver, Mohamed Fawzy, told CNN he was carrying ICU beds that were rejected four times by Israeli authorities.</p>

Food and Drug Administration commissioner Marty Makary, right, and Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, left, attend a Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) Commission Event in the East Room of the White House, Thursday, May 22, 2025, in Washington. WASHINGTON (AP) — When the Food and Drug Administration needs outside guidance, it normally turns to a trusted source: a large roster of expert advisers who are carefully vetted for their independence, credentials and judgment. Instead, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary has launched a series of ad hoc “expert panels” to discuss antidepressants, menopause drugs and other topics with physicians and researchers who often have contrarian views and financial interests in the subjects. Former agency officials worry the meetings are skirting federal rules on conflicts of interests and transparency, while promoting fringe viewpoints that align with those of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. “These meetings are a chance to advance RFK's pet peeves — talc, antidepressants, fluoride — with people who have been handpicked,” said Dr. Peter Lurie, a former FDA official who is now president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest. A spokesperson for Kennedy did not answer specific questions about the panels, but said they represent an effort to “apply rigorous, evidence-based standards to ingredient safety and modernize regulatory oversight.” The panels kicked off in May with a meeting on talc, the soft mineral sometimes added to makeup, baby powder and other consumer goods. The meeting echoed thousands of lawsuits alleging talc has contributed to ovarian cancer and other illnesses, and included two experts who testified in those cases. And federally funded studies haven't shown a link to cancer. A July meeting on the safety of antidepressants during pregnancy also featured doctors who have testified in class action lawsuits, alongside other experts who allege the drugs cause autism, birth defects and other conditions — links that are not supported by science. Nearly 80 researchers sent a letter to the FDA this month objecting to the “two-hour meeting of hormone proponents” and calling for an official advisory committee meeting. The FDA has more than 30 panels composed of experts specializing in various drugs, vaccines, food ingredients and other products. A comment period open to the public is also required. Additionally, FDA scientists usually publish a detailed memo explaining their position on the topic. Former FDA lawyers say the agency could expose itself to legal challenges if it tries to use Makary's informal panels as the basis for regulatory decisions. “The information in these panels could be used in litigation and presented as coming from experts or representing some intellectual consensus that doesn't exist.” During his confirmation hearings he suggested, without evidence, that the drugs contribute to school shootings. The FDA's recent session cataloged many unsubstantiated theories about the drugs, often based on animal studies, including that they contribute to autism, birth defects and miscarriages. Several participants had served as expert witnesses against drugmakers, including in lawsuits alleging that they cause homicidal behavior. Antidepressants carry pregnancy warnings about risks of excess bleeding and lower birth weight for newborns. But psychiatric experts say those risks are far outweighed by the well-documented harms of untreated depression in mothers, which can lead to pregnancy complications, substance abuse and suicide. “I tell people I'm working with that the best thing they can do for themselves and their baby is to get the treatment that they need,” said Dr. Nancy Byatt of University of Massachusetts' Chan Medical School. FDA has not disclosed how panelists were selected for the meetings. The views they expressed largely echoed those of Makary, who has argued that current warning labels overstate hormone therapy risks and don't reflect possible benefits for some women, such as reducing heart disease and cognitive decline. But guidance from the FDA and other top federal authorities specifically advises against using the drugs to prevent chronic conditions due to a lack of clear benefit. The drugs are only FDA-approved for specific menopause symptoms, including hot flashes. All estrogen drugs still carry boxed warnings about the higher rates of stroke, blood clots and cognitive problems among women taking the medications. But some doctors — including those at FDA's meeting — say the warnings are exaggerated and should be removed from at least some products, such as low-dose creams typically used for vaginal dryness. It's unclear whether the FDA will move ahead with those changes or heed calls for an official advisory meeting — a step that Kennedy's critics say would be in keeping with his pledge for “radical transparency.” “But that's the antithesis of what's going on in these cases.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Francis Ford Coppola's recent road show for Megalopolis is an attempt to dictate its legacy—and a misunderstanding of how fandom works. Francis Ford Coppola had a plan—or seemed to have one, at least. Billed as “An Evening with Francis Ford Coppola,” the event earlier this month was the last stop in a six-city road tour meant to honor Megalopolis by indulging in an in-depth study of its themes. Movies have been resuscitated before: Now-beloved films such as The Rocky Horror Picture Show, The Princess Bride, and The Big Lebowski have for decades been embraced by audiences after being overlooked during their initial releases. But as much as Megalopolis fits the vague outlines of notoriety that could one day make it a cult classic—Coppola's epic film, which envisioned America as a retro-futuristic version of the Roman empire, was critically derided, dramatically underperformed at the box office, and endured a shaky behind-the-scenes production that involved the director plopping down $120 million of his own money—its revival feels different. Indeed, the response to Coppola's cross-country tour came off less like the beginnings of an underground fan base, and more like a film community tolerating an auteur's exhaustive defense of his work. “The Coppola thing's a bit unusual,” Jamie Sexton, a film professor studying cult cinema at Northumbria University, in England, told me. The director seems to be a one-man army who's attempting, Sexton said, “to facilitate a cult following.” Of course, the notion of a “cult film” has grown nebulous over time: Many movies that have been bestowed the title, such as Blade Runner and This Is Spinal Tap, gained widespread popularity anyway, and the proliferation of streaming services makes it easier for people to discover nearly any movie on their own. (The film is currently unavailable to stream in North America.) Rather than wait for reevaluations of it to emerge over time, Coppola initiated the conversation from his end. Read: The Megalopolis that Francis Ford Coppola wanted to make The director, who wore mismatched socks onstage, beseeched his audience to ask him anything. One attendee pressed him to discuss the allure of organic architecture. Another thrust a hand into the air for a two-part question: First, did Coppola have anything to share about a third cut of Apocalypse Now, and second, could Coppola please sign the custom Harley-Davidson motorcycle he'd designed to honor the director's filmography? Coppola answered most queries patiently, but always turned back to the guiding principles on his whiteboard. No formula exists for that process, but the building—and maintaining—of underground-hit status, Sexton told me, requires audiences to take full control of a work's legacy. Regardless of cinematic quality, such projects tend to be transgressive in some compelling manner, enough to inspire devotion: They're thematically controversial, stylistically challenging, or simply enjoyable in ways that fans want to passionately defend. “Like, I have access to something that the sheep do not.” Viewers grant these movies a rarefied status by continuously rallying behind them and pushing for them to be reconsidered by critics and mainstream audiences. When studios try to mobilize niche fandoms, however, by rereleasing much-memed movies, fast-tracking sequels, and coining portmanteaus, that interest seldom translates into sustainable, influential communities. But none of it proves that Megalopolis has finally won audiences over. Some of that involves direct participation, which, for many cult films, can turn into rituals: During screenings of The Room, audiences toss plastic spoons at the screen. During The Rocky Horror Picture Show, they sing along. Spontaneous responses such as that may indicate the beginnings of a cult legacy. But for all of Coppola's insistence that his film's themes are hugely relevant to today's society, answering the question of whether a movie as strange and ambitious as Megalopolis will truly find a fervent audience, Sexton said, requires patience: “For me, there has to be some kind of endurance beyond the buzz.” An upcoming making-of documentary will further test the film's potential longevity. After all, Sexton pointed out, “he doesn't have to do this.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last week, FBI Director Kash Patel declassified and released internal FBI interview notes from a former House Intelligence Committee staffer who first accused Schiff in 2017 of directing illegal leaks of classified information about Trump and Russia. But that didn't stop Trump from using the claims as a basis to call on Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate the California Democrat. “I'm looking at Pam because I hope something's going to be done about it,” Trump said while speaking at the Kennedy Center on Wednesday. Schiff's lawyer blasted media reports of a grand jury investigation, calling the claims “transparently false, stale, and long debunked.” CNN reported this month that the Justice Department opened a grand jury investigation into New York Attorney General Letitia James over the civil actions she brought against Trump and the National Rifle Association. That came after the Trump administration launched an investigation into allegations of mortgage fraud against James, similar to those leveled against Schiff. Trump has a long history of attacking Schiff, going back to 2017 and the Russia investigation. He's accused the California Democrat of treason and called for his prosecution on numerous occasions. Trump's calls last year to prosecute Schiff and the other members of the House January 6 committee prompted outgoing President Joe Biden to issue a preemptive pardon to everyone who served on the panel. Trump's attacks helped Schiff become a household name and a fundraising juggernaut in Democratic circles for his work investigating and impeaching Trump, leading up to his successful Senate campaign in 2024. Schiff has long embraced his role as a MAGA villain, making it clear — often through defiant speeches — that he has no intention of backing down. When House Republicans voted to censure Schiff in 2023 over his allegations about Trump and Russia, he called it a “badge of honor.” “Ever since I led his first impeachment, he's threatened me with jail and prosecution and called me a traitor and accused me of treason, blah, blah, blah,” Schiff said last month on CBS' “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.” “So, I just want to direct this, if this is the right camera,” he continued, turning to face the camera directly for full effect: “Donald, piss off.” Schiff is also making preparations for a legal fight. Preet Bharara, the high-powered former US attorney for the Southern District of New York, this month was named as Schiff's personal attorney, issuing a statement on Schiff's behalf earlier this month following reports that the Justice Department had tapped DOJ official Ed Martin to investigate mortgage allegations against Schiff and James. “Any supposed investigation led by him would by the very definition of weaponization of the justice process,” Bharara said. Martin, who was tapped as director of the Justice Department's Weaponization Working Group in May after his confirmation to be US attorney for the District of Columbia fizzled out, appeared Sunday on Fox News to talk about the probes, suggesting the investigations of Schiff and James could be far-reaching. “These referrals are criminal referrals significant enough that they would warrant using all the tools,” Martin said Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo.” “If somebody did something wrong, we're not only going to hold them accountable, we're also going to look at everything else that they've been doing.” The new documents declassified and publicized last week came from interviews the FBI conducted with a former intelligence committee staffer in 2017, 2019 and 2023 as part of an investigation into classified leaks. The interview notes, known as 302s, were declassified and sent to Congress last week by Patel — who himself was a senior aide on the intelligence committee in 2017 working for then-Chair Devin Nunes. The FBI notes, which were obtained by CNN, were first reported by Just the News, a site run by conservative journalist John Solomon, who along with Patel was named as Trump's representative to the National Archives in 2022. Now Congress can see how classified info was leaked to shape political narratives — and decide if our institutions were weaponized against the American people,” Patel wrote on X, sharing Solomon's story. Schiff stated the information would be used to indict President Trump.” The Justice Department also confidentially obtained phone and email records of multiple journalists as part of the probe, including from CNN. But a former senior congressional official with firsthand knowledge told CNN that characterization was false. The former intelligence committee staffer did not respond to CNN's requests for comment. “These baseless smears are based on allegations that were found to be not reliable, not credible, and unsubstantiated from a disgruntled former staffer who was fired by the House Intelligence Committee for cause in early 2017,” the spokesperson said. “This is an effort by Kash Patel — who listed me as his top enemy in his book — to try and silence me. The FBI's decision, beginning in 2017, to secretly obtain the records of members of Congress, congressional staffers and reporters sparked outrage when it was disclosed in 2021 — including from Patel himself, who was also a Republican staffer on the committee when his records were secretly obtained. Patel filed a lawsuit in 2023 over the move against Trump's prior top DOJ and FBI appointees, including former FBI Director Christopher Wray. The suit was dismissed by a federal judge last fall. CNN's Annie Grayer and Sylvie Kirsch contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Texas House Democrats who fled their state to stall a Republican redistricting effort returned on Monday, ending their 15-day holdout. And while they have vowed to keep fighting, their presence allowed the House to establish the two-thirds quorum that will be needed to advance new congressional maps in a push backed by President Donald Trump. “But we're gonna become friends by the time this is over, we're gonna have some good Mexican food together. I am gonna try to get away at some point or another.” Now that Democrats have returned to the Texas Capitol in Austin, the GOP-dominated legislature is expected to quickly advance new congressional maps aimed at creating five more Republican-leaning seats ahead of next year's midterm elections. Democrats had fled to blue states — including Illinois, New York and Massachusetts — as they faced civil arrest warrants pushed by GOP officials in Texas to force them back into the House chamber. “We killed the corrupt special session, withstood unprecedented surveillance and intimidation, and rallied Democrats nationwide to join this existential fight for fair representation — reshaping the entire 2026 landscape,” said state Rep. Gene Wu, who leads Democrats in the Texas House. Our return allows us to build the legal record necessary to defeat this racist map in court, take our message to communities across the state and country, and inspire legislators across the country how to fight these undemocratic redistricting schemes in their own statehouses.” It's part of the party's effort to hold onto its narrow House majority in next year's midterm elections — one that also includes lobbying GOP officials in Indiana and Missouri to change their maps to turn Democratic-held seats into favorable ground for Republicans, and could see the party add more GOP-leaning seats in Ohio, which is required by state law to redistrict. The Texas effort has set off a nationwide gerrymandering arms race. Gavin Newsom has vowed retribution, proposing a measure that would trigger new maps that could help Democrats pick up five more seats in the state — but only if Texas moves forward with its redistricting plan. California would have to introduce its proposed new maps to neutralize the Texas effort, they said, and Burrows would have to adjourn the first special session Abbott had called. Both of those conditions were met on Friday. This week marks a flashpoint in an escalating and unprecedented fight over redistricting, with the country's two most populous states taking center stage and control of the US House during the second half of Trump's term potentially at stake. California Democratic lawmakers could take just three days to advance new congressional maps intended to offset Republican redistricting efforts in Texas. Legislation asking voters to approve the new maps is expected to be introduced Monday when lawmakers return to Sacramento from their summer recess, with final passage as early as Thursday, according to a person familiar with the Democratic planning. It will be heard in several committees along the way. In pushing Texas and other states to redraw their congressional lines mid-decade, Republicans have undertaken extraordinary efforts to preserve their unified hold on power in Washington, prompting Democrats to consider equally unorthodox countermeasures. They argue they brought national attention to the GOP-led redistricting in Texas and helped create the momentum for California's counteroffensive and calls in New York and other Democratic-led states to redraw their maps. But their options to stop Republicans were always limited, short of staying out of Texas for the next year-plus. Greg Abbott vowed that he would keep calling special sessions until the new maps passed. The state Senate, which passed a redistricting bill in the first special session, will go through a similar process. The GOP's proposal would create five new districts friendlier to Trump and Republicans ahead of the midterm elections. It would likely force Democratic US Reps. Greg Casar and Lloyd Doggett to run against each other in a redrawn district. GOP leaders have not laid out a timeline for final passage of the new map, but it could come as soon as this week. When California lawmakers return from their summer recess on Monday, Democrats there will take the first step toward redrawing congressional boundaries to give them a greater chance at winning five additional seats — an extraordinary move intended to counteract Texas' mid-decade redistricting. Unlike in Texas, the legislation under consideration will also require voter approval to override a constitutionally mandated independent redistricting commission. Lawmakers will have to move quickly; the California secretary of state's office gave the legislature a Friday deadline to make the November ballot, and bills must be in print for 72 hours before they can be voted on. Democrats are expected to formally introduce the legislation Monday, with final passage pegged for Thursday. Because lawmakers are proposing to change the state constitution, two-thirds of each chamber must vote in favor of it to pass. Democrats hold three-quarters of the seats in both chambers. California legislators will consider three bills this week. It would only take effect if another state chooses to redraw its maps and it would return the commission's power after the 2030 election. The constitutional amendment requires a two-thirds vote in each chamber but doesn't need Newsom's signature before going before voters. The other two bills will need the governor's signature and, in order to take effect immediately, will also require two-thirds majorities. California Republicans, who have little power in Sacramento to slow the redistricting push, are nevertheless closely monitoring how Democrats proceed. GOP lawmakers are anticipating Democrats will put forward a package of legislative proposals that will not only advance the new maps but also outline how they intend to hold and pay for a statewide election in less than three months, a person close to the Republican caucus told CNN. A victory could help Democrats win back the US House next year and give Newsom a boost in the next presidential primary. But some significant opposition to the proposed referendum is already forming. Arnold Schwarzenegger on Friday posted a picture of himself working out while wearing a T-shirt that said “F*** the politicians/Terminate gerrymandering.” The caption read: “I'm getting ready for the gerrymandering battle.” Munger spent more than $12 million in 2010 to entrench the independent redistricting commission in the state constitution, and he will fight any efforts to circumvent it, his spokeswoman Amy Thoma Tan said in a statement responding to California Democrats on Thursday. “Two wrongs do not make a right, and California shouldn't stoop to the same tactics as Texas,” Thoma Tan said. “Instead, we should push other states to adopt our independent, non-partisan commission model across the country. That's how we can protect and defend democracy.” Newsom's approach has also led to a divide among good government groups that have traditionally opposed gerrymandering. While the League of Women Voters continues to urge California lawmakers to reject the redistricting push, leaders at Common Cause have said they will not proactively reject “counterbalancing” efforts done in response to other states. The group said Wednesday it would not oppose redistricting pushes that are proportional responses to other states, involve public participation and have a set expiration date, among other criteria. “We welcome the governor to adopt our fairness criteria,” said Omar Noureldin, the organization's senior vice president of policy and litigation strategy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The court hearing on behalf of detainees held at the controversial makeshift immigration detention center dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” seeking to allow them to meet with attorneys, ended Monday without an immediate ruling from the judge. A court hearing on behalf of detainees held at the controversial makeshift immigration detention center dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” seeking to allow them to meet with attorneys has begun. The attorneys from groups including the ACLU, the US Immigration Law Counsel and Florida Keys Immigration filed a lawsuit against Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and other officials in July, saying the defendants “blocked detainees held at the facility from access to legal counsel” and are preventing “people detained in civil immigration custody at Alligator Alcatraz from communicating with legal counsel and from filing motions with the immigration court that could result in their release from detention.” The Department of Homeland Security has denied the allegations, telling CNN in a statement Sunday the “facility maintains a physical space for attorneys to meet with their clients,” and that attorneys may also request to speak with detainees they represent via email. “The government has banned in-person legal visitation, any confidential phone or video communication, and confidential exchange of written documents,” the ACLU said in the news release about the lawsuit, describing several instances of attorneys turned away after attempting to meet with their clients. What we know about the lawsuits that could shut down ‘Alligator Alcatraz' US District Judge Rodolfo Ruiz II, who was nominated by President Donald Trump, appeared skeptical of those arguments. “Alligator Alcatraz” is purportedly run by the state of Florida under a partnership with local agencies and the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement under a federal program known as the 287(g) program. Deep in the marshy wetlands of the Florida Everglades, “Alligator Alcatraz” has been mired with controversy since the start, with reports of hundreds of migrants confined in cages amid sweltering heat, bug infestations and meager meals. “These are all things that have never really been seen at other detention facilities.” Other alleged violations of constitutional rights include officers “pressuring detainees to sign voluntary removal orders without the opportunity to speak to counsel,” said Cho, and a detainee who was deported after their bond hearing was canceled because immigration courts said they don't have jurisdiction over people who are held in “Alligator Alcatraz.” “These are fundamental constitutional rights, and the fact that it's been happening for such a long time has had a huge impact on the people who are being held at this facility,” Cho said. “Alligator Alcatraz cannot end up being a black hole where people disappear.” The hastily built detention center is about an hour's drive west of Miami. The temporary camp is built on an airstrip and made up of repurposed FEMA trailers and tents, surrounded by a fence. On Thursday, DeSantis announced a new immigrant detention center called “Deportation Depot” in northern Florida. The facility will likely be ready in about two to three weeks, Florida Division of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie said, and it is expected to house around 1,300 detainees. This is a developing story and will be updated. CNN's Rafael Romo and Maxime Tamsett contributed to this report.</p>
