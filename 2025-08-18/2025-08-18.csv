Beauty queen Nadeen Ayoub will become the first woman to represent the Palestinian people at the Miss Universe pageant.
    


            The Miss Universe Organization (MUO) said in a statement sent to CNN on Sunday that it was “pleased to confirm” that Ayoub would compete in the Miss Universe 2025 competition, which takes place in November.
    


            “The Miss Universe Organization proudly welcomes delegates from across the globe, celebrating diversity, cultural exchange, and the empowerment of women,” the statement reads.
    


            “Ms. Ayoub, an accomplished advocate and model from Palestine, embodies the resilience and determination that define our platform,” it adds.
    


            Ayoub will join competitors from more than 130 other countries and territories at the 74th Miss Universe final, which will be held on November 21 in Bangkok, Thailand.

            “We look forward to welcoming Ms. Ayoub on the Miss Universe stage, where she will proudly represent Palestine, standing alongside contestants from every corner of the world,” MUO said in the statement.
    


            Ayoub, now 27, was crowned Miss Palestine back in 2022, according to Abu Dhabi-based news outlet The National.
    


            Posting on Instagram on Thursday, Ayoub said she wanted to be a voice for the Palestinian people.
    


            “I am honored to announce that for the first time ever, Palestine will be represented at Miss Universe,” she wrote in the caption.
    


            “As Palestine endures heartbreak — especially in Gaza — I carry the voice of a people who refuse to be silenced. I represent every Palestinian woman and child whose strength the world needs to see,” Ayoub added.
    


            “We are more than our suffering — we are resilience, hope, and the heartbeat of a homeland that lives on through us.”
    


            The decision to include a Palestinian entry in the beauty pageant comes amid growing international criticism of Israel's war in Gaza.

            At least 62,004 people have been killed in the strip since the start of the conflict in October 2023, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said in a statement published Monday.
    


            Authorities in Gaza do not distinguish between civilians and Hamas fighters when reporting casualty figures, but the health ministry and the United Nations say the majority of deaths are women and children. 



            As the war continues, a growing number of countries are pledging to recognize a Palestinian state, with more than 145 nations now joining the call for international recognition.
    


            Most recently, Australia, Canada and France announced plans to recognize a Palestinian state at the United Nations General Assembly meeting in September, while the United Kingdom has conditionally said it will recognize it if Israel does not meet criteria that include agreeing to a ceasefire in Gaza.

            As negotiations over a potential deal to end the war in Ukraine intensify, much of the discussion has centered around a part of the country's east that has long been at the heart of Russia's goals.
    


            The Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk - collectively known as the Donbas - were an industrial powerhouse in the Soviet era, a place of coal mines and steel mills.
    


            But the Donbas region also has rich farmland, important rivers and a coastline on the Sea of Azov.
    


            Historically the Donbas was the most “Russian” part of Ukraine, with a significant minority of Russian speakers. On multiple trips to the area 10 years ago, it was clear there was little love for the distant government in Kyiv among some of its people.
    


            It was here that Putin began efforts to destabilize Ukraine in 2014, after the annexation of Crimea. Pro-Russian militia, some of them well-equipped with tanks, popped up across the region, quickly taking the cities of Luhansk and Donetsk from what was then an ill-prepared and poorly motivated Ukrainian military.
    


            For almost eight years the breakaway enclaves saw combat, at times fierce, between the Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian forces, leaving more than 14,000 people dead, according to Ukrainian figures.
    


            At least 1.5 million Ukrainians have left the Donbas since 2014. More than three million are estimated to be living under Russian occupation. Moscow distributed hundreds of thousands of Russian passports to people in the separatist-controlled areas of the Donbas.
    


            But Putin wanted more. On the eve of the full-scale Russian invasion in February 2022, he said that the so-called civilized world “prefers to ignore it as if there were none of this horror, genocide that almost four million people are being subjected to” and recognized Luhansk and Donetsk as independent states.
    


Later that year Moscow unilaterally – and illegally – annexed both after sham referenda, along with the southern regions of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, despite only partially occupying them.
    


            For the Kremlin, there's a huge difference between withdrawing from occupied land (as the Russians did  when they pulled back from much of northern Ukraine in 2022) and giving up areas formally absorbed into the motherland – especially for a leader like Putin who is fixated with a “greater Russia.”



            Analysts say that at the current rate it would still take Russian forces several years to complete the occupation of what has been annexed. Equally, there is little chance  Ukraine can recover much of what it has already lost: almost all of Luhansk and more than 70% of Donetsk.
    


            But Kyiv still holds the “fortress belt” of industrial cities, railways and roads that is a significant barrier to Putin's forces: places like Sloviansk, Kramatorsk and Kostiantynivka.
    


            For Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to give up the rest of Donetsk, territory many Ukrainian soldiers have given their lives to defend, would be political suicide. About three-quarters of Ukrainians object to giving up any land to Russia, according to the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology.
    


            To retreat from the rest of Donetsk would also leave the vast open plains of central Ukraine vulnerable to the next Russian offensive, as Zelensky has repeatedly pointed out, as well as being an unconstitutional surrender of Ukrainian land.
    


            For Zelensky's European allies, it would also transgress a key principle: that aggression cannot be rewarded with territory and that Ukrainian sovereignty must be protected.
    


            As it was in 2014, the Donbas remains the crucible of Putin's ambitions in Ukraine – and the greatest test for Europe as it tries to cling on to a rules-based international order.

Russian oil supply to Hungary has been halted after Ukraine targeted the key Druzhba pipeline system, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has said.

Moscow has informed Budapest that Russian experts are working to restore an ""essential” transformer station targeted by a Ukrainnian strike, Szijjarto said.

Druzhba is one of the world's longest networks, transporting crude some 4,000km from Russia and Kazakhstan to refineries in the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia.

Szijjarto wrote in a post on X on Monday that “this latest strike against our energy security is outrageous and unacceptable.”

It is not yet clear when deliveries of oil through the pipeline could resume, he added.

The diplomat reiterated that the Ukraine conflict is “not our war” and that “as long as we [Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government] are in charge, Hungary will stay out of it.”

Unlike most other EU capitals, which supported Kiev after the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022, Budapest took a neutral stance and refused to supply weapons to the government of Vladimir Zelensky. It also consistently called for peace and criticized Western sanctions against Russia as ineffective and more harmful to those who impose them.

Ukraine has repeatedly targeted Russian energy infrastructure throughout the conflict, including the Druzhba system and the TurkStream pipeline, which supplies natural gas to Turkish customers and several European countries, including Hungary, Serbia, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Greece.

The previous attack on Druzhba occurred last Wednesday, with Kiev confirming that it had sent drones to strike a key distribution station in Bryansk Region, western Russia.

Moscow has condemned Ukrainian attacks on civilian energy infrastructure many times as acts of terrorism.

Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky could bring the fighting with Russia to a halt “immediately” by agreeing to a settlement that rules out NATO membership and entails territorial concessions, US President Donald Trump has said.



Zelensky has been summoned to the White House for a meeting on Monday to discuss the potential peace proposal. According to reports, the plan could involve Kiev giving up its remaining positions in Donbass while freezing battle lines elsewhere in exchange for a halt to hostilities. 



Zelensky “can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social network on Sunday.



“Remember how it started. No getting back Obama-given Crimea (12 years ago, without a shot being fired!), and NO GOING INTO NATO BY UKRAINE. Some things never change!!!” he added.



Trump was referring to the events of 2014, when the administration of then-US President Barack Obama did not intervene after Crimea voted to reunite with Russia following a Western-backed coup in Kiev.



The US president argues concessions may be needed for peace, but Zelensky insists Crimea and other regions remain Ukrainian and has rejected any compromise.

The meeting comes shortly after Trump's talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, their first face-to-face encounter since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022. Both leaders voiced cautious optimism that discussions could help move toward a resolution of the hostilities between Moscow and Kiev.



Moscow has repeatedly stated that any settlement should see Ukraine abandoning its NATO ambitions, undergoing demilitarization and denazification, and recognizing the new territorial reality on the ground, including the status of Crimea, Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson, and Zaporozhye regions, all of which have voted to become parts of Russia.



Putin said any settlement must address Russia's concerns, adding that restoring a fair balance in Europe is essential for lasting peace.



On Sunday, US special envoy Steve Witkoff told Fox News that Washington and its European allies were considering offering security guarantees to Ukraine outside the framework of NATO.

ROME, August 18. /TASS/. Russian President Vladimir Putin is a great negotiator who is thinking about the world order for the next 20 years, Former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said.

""Putin is an excellent negotiator. He received a red carpet welcome and strengthened his personal relationship with [US President Donald] Trump in Alaska, but he had no intention of concluding a ceasefire agreement [for the Ukraine conflict] there. As far as I know him, he is aiming for a new Yalta. Putin is considering what the world order will be like for the next twenty years,"" Renzi said in an interview with the Corriere della Sera newspaper.

Renzi served as Italy's prime minister between 2014 and 2016. During his tenure, he held several bilateral meetings with the Russian leader.

The meeting between President Vladimir Putin of Russia and President Donald Trump of the United States took place at a military base in Alaska on August 15. The meeting lasted over three hours, with the two leaders first holding a one-on-one conversation in a car on their way to the venue of the talks. Their closed-door negotiations also involved Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Kremlin Aide Yury Ushakov, as well as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump's Special Envoy Steve Witkoff.

Putin told the media after the talks that the parties had focused on resolving the Ukraine conflict. The Russian leader also called for turning the page in bilateral relations and resuming cooperation. Putin invited Trump to visit Moscow. The US leader, in turn, pointed to progress in the negotiation process but noted that the parties had not been able to agree on all issues.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

BERLIN, August 18. /TASS/. German Minister of Foreign Affairs Johann Wadephul criticized the idea of sending German troops to Ukraine.

Wadephul insisted that Ukraine needs security guarantees and that Germany must play ""an important role"" in bringing peace. However, he spoke against the deployment of German troops to Ukraine in a Table Media podcast. ""We focused on NATO territory like no others did,"" he said. Also, he noted, the Bundeswehr established a permanent brigade in Lithuania.

""Combining this with the deployment of troops in Ukraine would be too much of a burden,"" he argued. However, he emphasized that German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius will have to look closer at the issue. ""It does not mean that we cannot provide Ukraine with military or technical assistance in alternative ways,"" he claimed.

Germany's top diplomat was ""moderately optimistic"" regarding potential talks on Ukraine. ""The fact that these negotiations were held at such a level means that it will not be easy for the interested parties to step back and do nothing,"" Wadephul said, commenting on the Russia-US summit in Anchorage.

Later on Monday, US President Donald Trump will hold a meeting with Vladimir Zelensky in Washington. A number of European leaders will also be traveling to the United States. Among other things, Washington will discuss possible security guarantees for Ukraine, NBC News reported.

On August 15, a meeting between Russian and US Presidents Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump took place at a military base in Alaska. The meeting lasted about three hours. In a statement to the press following the talks, Putin said that the settlement of the Ukrainian conflict was the main topic of the summit. The Russian leader also called for turning the page in bilateral relations and resuming cooperation as he invited Trump to visit Moscow.

MOSCOW, August 18. /TASS/. Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) thwarted a terrorist attack on the Crimean Bridge planned by Ukrainian special services, the FSB Public Relations Center reported.

This is the second time the Ukrainian special services have tried to stage a terrorist attack on the Crimean Bridge since the beginning of 2025.

TASS has compiled the key facts about the thwarted terrorist attempt known so far.

Officers of Russia's Federal Security Service traced a Chevrolet Volt with a powerful improvised explosive device inside, and the bomb was defused.

The car arrived in Russia from Ukraine via a number of countries.

The vehicle crossed the Russian-Georgian border at the Verkhny Lars international checkpoint in North Ossetia.

In the Krasnodar Region, the car was to be handed over to another driver, who had to drive it onto the Crimean Bridge.

The driver was to become an unwitting suicide bomber, the Kiev regime intended to use him as a pawn.

Officers detained persons involved in the delivery of the car to Russia.

A criminal investigation into the new terrorist attempt has been opened.

The head of the Republic of Crimea, Sergey Aksyonov, thanked the FSB officers who prevented the terrorist attack.

Kiev's actions were aimed at derailing negotiations on resolving the Ukraine conflict, said Rodion Miroshnik, the Russian Foreign Ministry's ambassador-at-large overseeing the Kiev regime's crimes.

This is the second time the Ukrainian special services have tried to use a car with explosives for sabotaging the Crimean Bridge since the beginning of 2025.

On April 2, Belarusian security officers detained a minibus carrying more than 500 kg of synthetic explosives smuggled through the Belarus-Poland border to the Union State of Russia and Belarus.

During the investigation, accomplices of the planned crime were detained, including an unaware driver who was also supposed to become a ""suicide bomber"" while driving to the Crimean Peninsula via the Crimean Bridge.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Economists doubt US duties will bring about a resurgence of US factory jobs, notably due to Trump's erratic tariff rollout

Donald Trump's hugely disruptive trade war is setting the stage for a manufacturing renaissance in the US, administration officials say. Outside the White House, many economists are skeptical.

Global trade experts point to many reasons they believe the president's tariffs will fail to bring about a major resurgence of manufacturing, among them: Trump's erratic, constantly changing policies, his unfocused, across-the-board tariffs, and his replacing Joe Biden's carrot-and-stick approach to brandish sticks at the world.

“I think [Trump's tariffs] will reduce the competitiveness of US manufacturing, and will reduce manufacturing employment,” said Michael Strain, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute (AEI). “They're raising the costs of production to US manufacturing companies, and that makes manufacturers less competitive. There will be some winners and some losers, but the losers will outnumber the winners.”

The president and his aides insist that higher tariffs on more than 100 countries – making goods imported from overseas more expensive – will spur domestic manufacturing. “The ‘Made in USA' label is set to resume its global dominance under President Trump,” the White House spokesperson Kush Desai claimed recently.

But few economists see that happening. Ann E Harrison, an economics professor and former dean of the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, said the erratic, on-again-off-again rollout of Trump's tariffs has already gone far to doom the president's hopes of inspiring a huge wave of manufacturing investment.

“For the policy to be successful, it has to be consistent over a long period,” she told the Guardian. “People need to believe it's going to last. Some factories take five years to plan and build. You're talking a long-term play. But Trump keeps changing his mind. Even over the last six months, we've had very little consistency.

“The other problem is that he's old, and no one is sure he's going to be around that long. These policies need to be consistent, and that's not happening.”

Economists point to another question mark that is causing corporate executives to think twice about building factories in the US. In May, the US court of international trade ruled that Trump's blanket tariffs are illegal – a decision that is under appeal.

Strain, at the AEI, said: “When you add into the equation the erratic nature of President Trump's tariff regime, when you add the question of its questionable illegality, when you add that none of this is going through Congress, when you add that even when the US secures a ‘deal' with another country, it's not really a deal, there are major outstanding questions.”

France doesn't think its alcohol exports will be hit by tariffs as part of the European Union's agreement to pay 15% tariffs, noted Strain. “That's a big question mark that would never go unresolved in any regular, traditional trade deal,” he said. “That's all part of the massive uncertainty we're seeing.”

The Biden administration used deliberate industrial policies to boost several strategic industries, most notably semiconductors and electric vehicles, including a 100% tariff on EVs from China and 25% on lithium-ion EV batteries, as well as subsidies to buy EVs and build EV-related factories. The policies resulted in a surge in new factories to build semiconductors, electric vehicles and EV components.

Biden “said we care about semiconductors and national security, and what he'd try to do is get actual investors to invest in it”, said Dani Rodrik, an economist specializing in trade and industrial policy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, who predicted Trump's blanket tariffs will prove less successful in inspiring investment. “If you really want to increase manufacturing and employment in the US, you'd go about it in a very different way, through industrial policies that first identify specific segments you care about.”

When China, Japan and South Korea adopted policies to build their electronics and auto industries, they insisted that the corporations that benefited from those policies compete with foreign companies to help make them globally competitive. “For industrial policy to succeed, it has to work to promote more competition,” said Harrison, at the Haas School of Business. “The problem with tariffs is they do just the opposite. They restrict competition.”

Susan Helper, an economist at Case Western Reserve University who worked on industrial policy in the Biden and Obama administrations, said Trump's tariff rates on some countries and markets – like 15% on the EU, Japan and South Korea – are too low to spur much investment, questioning why a company would build a major factory to circumvent such a duty.

“A [semiconductor fabrication] plant, that's a billion dollars. You need to get a payback and that takes several years,” Helper said. “If the tariffs are 145% [as Trump once imposed on China], that's attractive for building a plant. But if they fall back to 15%, then it's really hard to get a return on your investment.”

The administration boasts that several of its trade deals have specific commitments to spur huge manufacturing investment. It says its deal with the EU includes a $600bn investment pledge; with Japan, a $550bn investment pledge; and with South Korea, $350bn. Jamieson Greer, US trade representative, wrote in the New York Times: “These investments – 10 times larger than the inflation-adjusted value of the Marshall Plan that rebuilt Europe after World War II – will accelerate US reindustrialization.”

But these supposed pledges have attracted skepticism. After all, this president claimed during his first term that “the eighth wonder of the world” was being built in Wisconsin after FoxConn pledged to invest $10bn and create 13,000 jobs at an electronics plant. But that promise fell embarrassingly short.

Many economists question whether the EU, Japan or South Korea can force corporations to make a specific investment in the US. Indeed, a European Commission spokesperson said the bloc had expressed “aggregate intentions” that are “in no way” binding. “These large numbers really sound like window dressing, some round numbers they're throwing around,” said Harvard's Rodrik.

“Some include investments you were already going to make, and some are aspirational,” said Todd Tucker, a trade and industrial policy expert at the Roosevelt Institute. “Once we've had time to evaluate whether the investment happens or not, Trump will be on to the next press cycle.”

In recent years, manufacturing employment has been trending downward – not just in advanced industrial countries, but also in China, as new technologies enable factories to churn out goods more efficiently, with fewer workers. That trend raises questions whether Trump's trade policies can increase factory jobs in the US.

The US is past its manufacturing peak, Berkeley's Harrison noted. “That was actually during World War Two, and it has been declining ever since,” she said. “I don't see manufacturing's share of the economy or manufacturing employment reversing.”

She added: “If the question is, are you going to bring about a major resurgence in manufacturing employment, it's not just unlikely, the answer is no. More and more manufacturing is robot-driven and not done by people.”

Auto industry officials in the US complain that Trump's 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum have increased their costs and injured their competitiveness. “In manufacturing, for every one job in steel production, there are 80 jobs that use steel,” the AEI's Strain said. “So putting tariffs on imported steel might help that one guy, but you're hurting the other 80 people.”

A study by Federal Reserve economists found that the tariffs Trump imposed in his first term were actually associated with a reduction in factory jobs nationwide, because increased input costs and retaliatory tariffs outweighed import protection from tariffs.

Helper, at Case Western Reserve University, warned that the US auto industry would be hurt badly by Trump's mishmash of tariffs coupled with his slashing subsidies for EVs. “Trump's policies are setting the auto industry up to be an island of backwardness,” she said. “The rest of the world is going to be making EVs, but we're going to be focused on making really high profits on pickup trucks that will be bad for the climate and won't sell in the rest of the world.

“We'll have a great, competitive position in large, gas-guzzling pickups, but we'll fall further behind in EVs. That's a very risky and dangerous path.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Presidents, PMs and heads of Nato and European Commission to accompany Ukraine's leader at White House

Russia-Ukraine war – latest news updates

European leaders arrive in Washington on Monday before Volodymyr Zelenskyy's meeting with Donald Trump in the Oval Office, in a show of support for the Ukrainian president. It comes amid expectations that Trump will try to bully Zelenskyy into accepting a pro-Russia “peace plan” that would include Kyiv handing territory to Moscow. The Europeans have been described as Zelenskyy's “bodyguards”, with memories fresh of the mauling he received in February during his last Oval Office visit. So, who are they?

Secretary general of Nato

Rutte has a proven record of flattering Trump for strategic purposes, using language that some allies find cringe-making. In June he referred to the capricious US president as “Daddy” in an attempt to avoid disastrous outbursts at the Nato summit. Rutte has repeatedly praised Trump in public, including in a recent interview on Fox News, and credits him for pushing Nato members to spend 3.5% of their GDP on defence. The US had carried the burden of European security for too long, Rutte has said – music to Trump's ears.

President of the European Commission

Von der Leyen is a staunch supporter of Ukraine who backs Kyiv's EU membership. For Trump, she is a reminder of Europe's combined importance as an economic bloc. The US struck a trade deal with the EU three weeks ago, and Trump hailed the relationship as “the biggest trading partnership in the world”. On Sunday she hosted Zelenskyy in Brussels. She said a post-peace-deal Ukraine had to become “a steel porcupine, indigestible for potential invaders”, with no limits on its armed forces.

UK prime minister 

Starmer has performed a balancing act when it comes to Trump, keeping him on side while advocating for Ukraine. So far, this tactic has worked. The US president has gone out of his way to emphasise their good relations, despite Starmer's “liberal” outlook. Both men have an incentive to preserve this rapport ahead of Trump's state visit next month to the UK. Meanwhile, Starmer and Zelenskyy have developed a warm personal relationship, hugging in February outside Downing Street after Zelenskyy's previous, disastrous Oval Office meeting, and again last week. The prime minister stresses territorial integrity, which contradicts Trump's “peace deal” that involves Russia taking more Ukrainian land.

President of Finland 

Stubb represents a small European state but he will be in Washington because he has managed to establish an unexpectedly warm relationship with Trump. The Finnish leader cultivated his access to the US president by hastily polishing his rusty golfing skills before an impromptu trip to Florida in March for a round with Trump, on the recommendation of the Republican senator Lindsey Graham. Stubb's message on the putting green: you can't trust Vladimir Putin. Finland sees parallels between Ukraine's plight and its own history, the Soviet Union having invaded in 1939, saying it needed Finnish territory.

French president

Macron combines French economic and military clout with a proven ability to get on with Trump, symbolised by their intense handshakes. In the lead-up to Russia's 2022 invasion, Macron flew to Moscow to reason with Putin. He has since become a key diplomatic ally for Ukraine. Asked on Sunday whether Putin wanted a genuine peace deal, Macron replied: “No.” He said Ukraine needed a strong army and security guarantees if a lasting settlement was to be achieved. The French president will want to persuade Trump that his post-Alaska-summit plan to stop the fighting is a non-starter, and against Ukraine and Europe's long-term security interests.

German president

Merz has cut a sure-footed figure on the world stage since taking office in May, including largely holding his own in an Oval Office face-off with Trump over the summer. He has emerged as a crucial partner for Zelenskyy, who was often frustrated with Merz's slow-moving predecessor, Olaf Scholz. Berlin has clout as one pillar of the French-German axis at the heart of the EU. It is also a major financial donor to Kyiv. Merz's task in the Oval Office is to persuade Trump not to act hastily and “over the heads of Ukrainians and Europeans”, as he put it last week.

Prime minister of Italy

Meloni has broken off from her holiday to fly to Washington, a sign that Trump's Russia-friendly “peace plan” marks a moment of danger for Europe. She will be a useful bridge in the Oval Office meeting, as a European far-right leader whom Trump counts as a friend. Meloni has spent time at Mar-a-Lago, the US president's Florida home, and was the only European leader invited to his inauguration in January. At the same time, she strongly supports Kyiv's sovereignty. In July she hosted a Ukraine recovery conference in Rome, designed to help the country rebuild when Russia's war finally ends.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Former officials say firing of BLS commissioner emblematic of president's battle against established facts and history

Donald Trump is waging a war on truth by firing top officials who present facts he finds unpalatable, while he banks on key loyalists at executive agencies to bolster his policies and powers by “rewriting history's narrative” and squelching dissent, say scholars and former officials.

Trump's penchant for rejecting facts in an authoritarian style was especially revealed in August by his sudden firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, charging without evidence that her latest report was “totally rigged”, just hours after she released data undercutting his rosy economic boasts, say critics.

The firing was emblematic of Trump's expanding battle against people and policies that challenge the US president's often conspiratorial views about truth such as his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden, which Trump last fall falsely blamed again on “fraud”.

From the justice department to the Environmental Protection Agency to other key agencies, Trump loyalists have pushed falsehoods and taken radical steps to promote Trump's policies and what a Trump adviser in 2017 dubbed “alternative facts”. In doing so, Trump and his top allies are acting in an authoritarian style by revising history, rejecting facts and widely accepted science, critics add.

“The irony in firing the widely respected economist and BLS commissioner Erika McEntarfer is that the commissioner has very little to do with the actual production of the figures Trump says were ‘rigged',” said Peter Shane, who teaches constitutional law at New York University.

“‘Rigged', in Trump-speak, just means ‘unfavorable to Trump'. To the extent the firing had an actual purpose, it was not to reform [the] BLS, but to send a message to all agency heads that the release of unflattering information, no matter how routine or how objective, would put their jobs in jeopardy,” Shane added.

Little wonder that Trump on 11 August announced he was nominating EJ Antoni, an economist at the rightwing Heritage Foundation who has been a vocal critic of the BLS, to replace her, and boasted that he “will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST AND ACCURATE”.

Scholars, ex-justice department officials and even some conservatives say Trump's and his loyalists attacks on truth have increased in his second term in dangerous ways, since he has avoided choosing the kinds of aides who before served as guardrails against some of his instincts to revise history and promote radical policies.

“The difference between Trump 1 and Trump 2 is that he now has no guardrails … Now Trump is surrounded by people who want to be like him. He learned his lesson of not having people around him who would say no to him,” said George Conway, a lawyer and board president of the Society for the Rule of Law, a group that includes several ex-justice department officials with Republican pedigrees who have been critical of Trump's authoritarian-style moves.

Conway added: “He's always tried to create his own set of facts. None of this is new. It's part of Trump's conspiratorial mindset.”

Shane stressed: “Sabotaging independent sources of knowledge, flooding communications media with disinformation, and rewriting history's narrative to conform to ideology rather than fact are hallmarks of authoritarianism.”

Shane's points are underscored by multiple Trump and administration actions, including Trump's counter-factual charges that crime in Washington was “out of control” despite data released early this year that showed violent crime in DC was at a 30-year low.

Still, flanked by several cabinet members, Trump held a press conference to declare a “public safety emergency” and put DC police under temporary federal control, while deploying 800 national guard troops to America's capital.

Elsewhere, Trump loyalists at the EPA moved this month to rescind its key 2009 endangerment finding, which has underpinned regulatory efforts to fight climate change since the Barack Obama administration as the agency increasingly rejects widely accepted scientific facts.

Likewise, the justice department impaneled a grand jury in August to investigate a conspiratorial charge by Trump's director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, that Obama and some of his aides engaged in a “treasonous conspiracy” by launching inquiries in 2016 into Russian efforts to influence that election to help Trump win.

In another battle royale against facts, the health secretary and vaccine sceptic, Robert F Kennedy Jr, has stepped up efforts to block some vaccines that scientists regard as crucial weapons in fighting Covid and other diseases.

Critics say Trump's moves to undermine facts have been escalating in dangerous ways.

“From government agencies to universities, the president is wielding the cudgel of federal money and the threat of presidential power to intimidate people whose data and ideas don't support him,” said the Princeton political historian Julian Zelizer.

Zelizer said: “While many presidents have been critical of economic data [such as Herbert Hoover], this is a new level of hostility. Someone says something he does not like, that person is removed. The point is to create fear so that others think twice before saying something that is harmful to the administration.”

Shane of NYU warned that Trump's administration allies have mimicked his actions.

“Trump's top officials, many of whom lack the experience, judgment, intellect and temperament to do their jobs properly, know Trump's playbook and are determined to remain where they are … Everyone around Trump sees he has paid very little cost for his perfidy. They're following the boss.”

Leaders at key agencies have followed Trump's playbook of attacking facts and widely accepted science with regulatory moves to undermine climate change science and alternative fuels.

The EPA, as well as the interior and energy departments, has stepped up efforts to throttle spending and regulations to expand wind and solar energy; Trump has attacked green energy as part of his conspiratorial view that climate change is a “hoax”, while aggressively promoting his fossil fuel agenda of “drill, baby, drill”.

“The Trump team has launched an all-of-government assault on wind and solar,” said Michael Gerrard, who runs the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University.

Gerrard said: “When Obama's EPA issued the endangerment finding in 2009 there was a ton of scientific evidence supporting it. There are now 10 tons. There are a few ounces on the other side, but Trump's EPA is seizing on the ounces as an excuse to wipe out our strongest legal tool to fight climate change.

“The EPA, the energy and interior departments, and even the Federal Aviation Administration, are using all available tools, and making up some new ones, to suppress these sources of clean power.”

Other experts and scientists are alarmed too that Kennedy has stepped up efforts to block vaccines he has long castigated without real evidence as dangerous.

Earlier this month, Kennedy announced in a statement the ending of 22 projects worth $500m to develop mRNA technologies that have been used in vaccines to combat respiratory viruses such as Covid and the flu.

In response to Kennedy's move, Trump told reporters that “we're on to other things” and said the administration was focused now on “looking for other answers to other problems, to other sicknesses and diseases”.

Trump, a former champion of the Covid vaccines, seems to have ignored several recent moves by Kennedy which health experts have sharply criticized. In July, Kennedy abruptly fired a 17-member CDC panel that recommends vaccines, and replaced it with a smaller committee that boasts some known vaccine sceptics.

Further, Kennedy has balked at offering strong support for vaccinations even as the CDC reported 1,356 measles cases as of this month, the highest total of annual cases since 2000, when the United States declared measles eliminated.

On a legal battlefront, former prosecutors say truth and facts are under assault at the justice department, which increasingly has acted without solid evidence of misconduct to investigate Trump's declared foes, such as the former FBI director James Comey and ex-CIA director John Brennan.

Trump in July baselessly accused Obama of “treason” for his administration's inquiry into Russian influence efforts to help Trump win in 2016. The move came despite multiple reports, including one from the bipartisan Senate intelligence panel, concluding that Moscow mounted a drive to boost Trump.

Trump's comments followed Gabbard's release of classified materials that did not support his allegations, say critics. Yet the attorney general, Pam Bondi, then impaneled a grand jury to investigate the charges as Gabbard requested.

Some legal scholars see a pattern with earlier Trump tactics to fudge facts and revise history and warn of the justice department's marked politicization under Trump and Bondi. The Columbia law professor and ex-federal prosecutor Daniel Richman said: “The announcement of a grand jury investigation into Obama and Biden officials [is] just the latest effort to support a false narrative with the presence of official action.”

From a historical perspective, critics say the Trump administration's assaults on truth and facts will do long-term damage.

“The United States did not put a man on the moon or invent the transistor, the internet, the polio vaccine, or [on the negative side] the atomic bomb by ignoring or making up facts,” said Gerrard.

“All these achievements resulted from scientists doing the very hard work of discovering truths about the physical world and using them in brilliant ways.

“A country that instead ignores facts it doesn't like and invents falsities can achieve very little beyond satisfying those who share the leaders' ideology. We are on a dangerous path to mediocrity, or worse.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Their bright feathers and graceful movements have fascinated humans for centuries. These magnificent creatures belong to the pheasant family and are found in regions across Asia and Africa. Let's explore peacocks' unique characteristics and cultural significance.
There are three main species of peacock: the well-known Indian peafowl, native to South Asia; the endangered green peafowl from Southeast Asia; and the rare Congo peafowl, found in African rainforests. Although the term “peacock” technically refers only to males, many people use it for both sexes. Male peacocks display their colorful tail feathers, which

  APD occurs when the brain cannot properly interpret auditory information, despite one's hearing ability being fully functional. This can lead to difficulties in understanding speech, particularly in noisy environments or when someone speaks quickly. People with this condition often need things repeated or take longer to respond in conversations.

Russia is redeploying its troops to Zaporizhzhia Oblast to make a new push in the partially occupied southeastern Ukrainian region, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi told RBC-Ukraine in an interview published on Aug. 18.

""The goal is to break through our defenses and advance deep into (our) territory. Their goal, of course, is (occupying) the entire region,"" Syrskyi said.

Moscow currently occupies about 70% of Zaporizhzhia Oblast, but the regional capital, Zaporizhzhia, remains under Ukrainian control.

""As of today, low-intensity operations are continuing there (in Zaporizhzhia Oblast). However, in pursuit of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's goals and instructions, the occupiers are also trying to deliver a powerful blow, which was initially planned a year ago,"" he said.

According to Syrskyi, the situation on the front line is difficult, with Russian forces focusing on the area near Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast and in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Other priority areas for Russia may be the area near Novopavlivka in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast and around Lyman in Donetsk Oblast.

Zaporizhzhia Oblast, located in southeastern Ukraine, borders Dnipropetrovsk Oblast to the north, Donetsk Oblast to the east, and Kherson Oblast to the south. It is also home to the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, the largest nuclear facility in Europe.

Russian forces also occupy parts of Donetsk, Luhansk, and Kherson oblasts, territories Moscow illegally claimed to have annexed in 2022.

Putin has earlier demanded Ukraine's withdrawal from the Ukrainian-controlled parts of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts and a ban on NATO membership as preconditions for peace negotiations. Most recently, the demands have reportedly narrowed to Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. 

Ukraine's Southern Defense Forces spokesperson Vladyslav Voloshyn said earlier this year that Russia had intensified assault operations in the Zaporizhzhia sector, ramping up pressure on Ukrainian positions in the south.

A U.S.-made M113 armored personnel carrier bearing Russian and American flags was filmed storming Ukrainian positions in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Russian propaganda media outlet RT claimed on Aug. 18.

Allegedly sent by Russian soldiers of the 70th Motorized Rifle Regiment of the 42nd Guards Division, the video likely shows an M113 that was supplied to Ukraine by its Western allies. and captured by Russian forces during fighting. 

The video was shared by Russian propaganda media just days after U.S. President Donald Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska in what Moscow cast as the end of its international isolation. 

Andriy Yermak, head of Ukraine's Presidential Office, condemned the video as ""the height of insolence.""

""Russians are using the symbols of the United States in their own terrorist, aggressive war involving the killing of civilians,"" Yermak wrote on Telegram.

The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the footage.

Russian propaganda outlets have increasingly praised Trump as a pragmatic peacemaker while portraying Ukraine, Europe, and the U.K. as obstructionist. 

Russian media frequently amplify Trump's past claims that either President Volodymyr Zelensky or former U.S. President Joe Biden ""provoked"" Russia's war, a narrative that shifts blame from Moscow.

The RT footage appeared shortly after Trump praised his Aug. 15 summit with Putin as ""10 out of 10,"" even though no peace agreement was reached. Trump said he and Putin agreed on ""many points,"" including the possibility of territorial swaps between Russia and Ukraine.

In recent statements, Trump claimed Zelensky could end the war ""almost immediately"" if he agreed to concessions, making clear that Ukraine would not be allowed to join NATO or reclaim Crimea under any deal he might broker with Moscow.

The footage was allegedly filmed in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, where Russia is preparing to make a new push, redeploying troops from other sectros of the front, according to Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi. 

About 70% of the region is under Russian occupation, including the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest nuclear facility.

Russia declared the illegal annexation of the entire Zaporizhzhia Oblast, along with three other Ukrainian regions, in September 2022, following sham referenda. 

Russian President Vladimir Putin had earlier demanded Ukraine's withdrawal from the Ukrainian-controlled parts of Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, Luhansk, and Kherson oblasts as preconditions for peace negotiations. Most recently, the demands have reportedly narrowed to Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford recently declared on CNN that in Canada, U.S. President Donald Trump is the “most disliked politician in the world . . . because he has attacked his closest family member.” In January, just before Mark Carney announced his leadership bid for the Liberal Party, he appeared on The Daily Show and told Americans that Canada and the United States could be “friends with benefits.” Are prominent U.S. leaders making time for media appearances to defend Canada as their “closest family member”?

Believing that trading partners are family, or friends even, betrays our leaders' wide-eyed view of the world that not even historical precedent appears able to shake. It has invited complacency and deepens the damaging economic consequences when trade relationships evolve or break apart.

If there is one long-term takeaway for Canadian leaders from Mr. Trump's assault on Canada's access to U.S. markets, it's realizing that countries we trade with are neither family nor friends, but jurisdictions that do business with us – business that is transactional, situational and evolving.

We have had Donald Trump-like figures before who upended our economy and who we should have already learned this lesson from. One of the first was Robert Peel, who was the British prime minister between 1841 and 1846. Unlike Mr. Trump, he was a protectionist-turned-free-trader.

In 1842, he cut tariffs on British timber imports that gave Canadian timber preferential access to British markets. Consequently, our timber exports fell. In 1846, Mr. Peel dropped Britain's protectionist tariffs on grain, ending Canada's preferential grain market access that had been in place since 1815. 

Lumber producers praise federal plan to diversify markets amid trade war with U.S.

Three years later, Canada's then Governor-General, Lord Elgin, reported that property in Montreal and “in most of the Canadian towns . . . had fallen by 50 per cent in value” and that “three-fourths of the commercial men are bankrupt.”

By 1854, the search for a market to replace lost share in Britain was secured through a reciprocity deal with the U.S. that removed duties on fish, timber, coal and grain just as railways began to boom in Canada, opening more efficient transportation routes to move Canadian goods south. The good times lasted 12 years.

U.S. President Andrew Johnson cancelled the trade deal in 1866, given growing protectionist sentiment in the U.S. and popular belief that the deal was benefitting Canadians more than Americans. The abrogation of the 1854 trade agreement helped cement efforts to create what we now know as Canada through Confederation in 1867, a project that was expected to create one national economy to help compensate for lost trade with the U.S.

Today's interprovincial trade barriers measure the success of that intention.

There are plenty of other past examples. The U.S. Fordney-McCumber Act in 1922 slapped an average 40-per-cent tariff on imports. This was followed by the American Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in 1930, and in 1971, President Richard Nixon's administration imposed a 10-per-cent tariff on many Canadian goods crossing the border.

Opinion: Ottawa can't let our canola industry – a true Canadian success story – fade away

The present isn't any friendlier than the past. Last week, China took hostage Canada's multibillion-dollar canola export trade, imposing 75.8-per-cent duties on Canadian canola seed. This is a transparent attempt to force the federal government to backtrack on Ottawa's 100-per-cent tariff on Chinese-made electric vehicles.

Equally transparent is China's goal of crushing our EV sector through the sale of cheap EVs produced using low-wage work, heavily subsidized, stolen or misappropriated IP, and as Human Rights Watch has documented, forced labour.

Canada has negotiated many trade agreements with other countries, yet, those deals are often more sizzle than steak. As trade experts noted earlier this year in Policy Magazine, “Today, Canada has more comprehensive trade agreements than any other G7 country. But having a trade agreement is one thing; leveraging it is another. Utilization rates of these agreements have remained low. . .”

The 2017 Canada-EU Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement is an example. It has yet to win full ratification by all EU member states. The obstacles are material. Differing approaches to environmental, agricultural and digital regulations and standards are persistent barriers. The Europeans seem not to care, given all the Canadian interprovincial trade barriers that also complicate EU trade with Canada.

In Britain, objections to Canada's dairy and supply management systems as well as rules of origin closed the doors on free trade. Trade negotiations with Britain collapsed in 2024.

The world isn't made up of countries that want to trade with Canada because they are our family or friends. It's comprised of countries who only value how Canada can serve their economic needs and political agendas. It's time we admitted to that reality. Doing so will at the very least reduce the shock when trade deals go sideways.

Vancouver Whitecaps' Thomas Müller yells to his team during the second half of an MLS soccer match against the Houston Dynamo in Vancouver, B.C. on Sunday.ETHAN CAIRNS/The Canadian Press

Thomas Müller's Major League Soccer debut was almost perfect. 

Almost. 

The German soccer icon came off the bench for the Vancouver Whitecaps on Sunday and put the ball into the back of the net just minutes later. 

Then the offside flag went up.

“I think the moment when I scored the goal was amazing. The noise in the stadium and then also the reaction of my teammates, that was a great start for me,” Müller said. “In the end, the result was a little bit disappointing. But that's the game. That's the game.”

The Whitecaps (13-6-7) settled for a 1-1 draw with the Houston Dynamo (7-11-8).

Hours before kickoff, hundreds of fans gathered at Terry Fox Plaza outside BC Place to welcome Vancouver's newest star. 

Many in the crowd were clad in crisp new Whitecaps jerseys emblazoned with Müller's No. 13, while others wore the red kit he formerly sported at Bayern Munich. At least two people wore lederhosen, a nod to the World Cup winner's Bavarian roots, and several German flags lined the barriers.

Muller signed with the Whitecaps on Aug. 6 after playing 17 seasons for Bayern in the German Bundesliga. There, he became a household name, scoring 250 goals across all competitions and helping the club to 33 titles, including 13 league championships.

He also excelled on the international stage, winning the 2014 World Cup with Germany and taking home the Golden Boot from the 2010 tournament after notching five goals and three assists.

The 35-year-old attacking midfielder joined the 'Caps after his contract with Bayern was not renewed. He will remain with the club through the 2025 season on a deal that includes a Designated Player option for the 2026 campaign. 

Expectations for Müller were high on Sunday night, said Whitecaps head coach Jesper Sorensen, despite his limited time acclimating to a new team.

“First and foremost, it's about blending him together with his teammates,” the coach said. “I think he did very well. I think he has a high football IQ so he understands where to position himself and which spaces to attack.”

The sold-out crowd of 26,031 rose to their feet before kickoff Sunday when Müller was introduced on the big screen. He replied by standing and clapping for the crowd before taking his seat on the sidelines. 

Fans had another reason to cheer early in the game after Vancouver midfielder Jayden Nelson was taken down inside the penalty area by Griffin Dorsey. 

Referee Jon Freemon pointed at the spot and people rose to their feet as Brian White lined up to take the penalty in the sixth minute. The American striker then rolled a low shot into the bottom right corner of the net as Houston 'keeper Jonathan Bond dove in the opposite direction. 

The goal was White's team-leading 13th of the season. 

Boisterous cheers emanated through the crowd in the 61st minute when Müller came on for homegrown talent Jeevan Badwal.

Three minutes later, the German soccer legend blasted a shot into the back of the Houston net from the top of the penalty area. The play was quickly whistled down for being offside.

“Of course, everybody had hoped for the result of the magic moment that came when Thomas put the ball in the back of the net,” Sorensen said. “Unfortunately, it was a very narrow offside. But you know, that's what can happen.”

Houston spoiled Müller's welcome party in the 91st minute when Amine Bassi slipped a pass to Artur at the top of the penalty area and the central midfielder sailed a shot in past the outstretched fingertips of Vancouver 'keeper Yohei Takaoka to level the score at 1-1. 

“You have little bit of a feeling that you lost the game even though you didn't,” Sorensen said. 

Müller said the pace and intensity of his first MLS match were high, but there are areas away from the ball where he sees room for improvement. 

“In the end, we have to take the result, and we have to take our game and improve it in the next couple of weeks,” Muller said. “I'm now fresh into this team, I'm new into the league. I need a few weeks to figure out what's right or wrong. But to be honest, I feel very good after this game.”

Sunday's game capped a whirlwind week for Müller. 

Hundreds of fans were on hand to welcome him when he touched down at Vancouver International Airport on Wednesday and on Thursday a crush of media greeted him at an introductory press conference. He got his first taste of Vancouver weather on Friday when rain soaked his first training session with the team. 

“The first days were busy, but in a positive way,” Müller said. “I learned a lot about the culture. I met very nice people. I had a very warm welcome in this city, and also to the whole club. I was enjoying it a lot, and I want to continue our way to more. So I'm excited.” 

Life in Vancouver is a change from Munich for the soccer star.

Though the sport's popularity continues to boom throughout Canada, Müller is not yet a local celebrity in Vancouver — and he's enjoyed a tiny taste of anonymity in recent days. 

“When I walk through the city, it's nice to meet some people cheering for the Whitecaps, but it's also nice to go to the supermarket and buy my own stuff. I can relax a little bit between the lemons and the blueberries,” he said. “But I'm here to lead this team to something special.”

Whitecaps defender Tristan Blackmon left the game at halftime with knee pain. … Midfielder Ali Ahmed came on for Vancouver in the 61st minute. It was his first game action since spraining his ankle while playing for Canada at the CONCACAF Gold Cup nearly two months ago. … Kenji Cabrera came on in the 91st minute, making his home debut for the 'Caps. 

Vancouver: The Whitecaps host St. Louis City SC on Saturday. 

Houston: The Dynamo host the San Jose Earthquakes on Saturday.

Norway's wealth fund, the world's largest, is divesting from Israeli firms, joining a wave of nations pressuring Netanyahu over Gaza. Can global sanctions, asset sales and boycotts force a shift in Israel's war strategy?

Israel's government has remained notably silent over Norway's decision on August 11 to partially divest investments in several Israeli companies, triggered by ethical concerns over the war in Gaza.

Norway's $2 trillion (€1.71 trillion) sovereign wealth fund said it would withdraw investments from 11 firms linked to Israel and terminate contracts with asset managers operating in the country. The fund launched an urgent review after media reports that it had invested in a firm that makes parts for Israeli military fighter jets.

While Israel's media labeled Norway's move ""deeply troubling"" and ""politically motivated,"" some analysts think Israeli officials are deliberately keeping a low profile for fear of emboldening the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which has campaigned against Israel for the past two decades.

From its founding in 2005, BDS has achieved a series of symbolic and material wins by pressuring institutions, corporations and governments to cut ties with Israeli entities involved in the occupation of the Palestinian Territories.

Israel and the US regularly accuse the Palestinian-led movement of antisemitism. The Bundestag, Germany's lower house of parliament, even passed a resolution on BDS, first in 2019 and reaffirming in 2024, calling the movement ""antisemitic"" and banning it from receiving public funds.

BDS gained new momentum after Israeli forces launched a military operation in Gaza following the October 7, 2023, attacks led by the Palestinian militant group Hamas. The movement led to significant divestments from AXA and Scotiabank, prompting the exits of Samsung Next, the South Korean tech giant's venture fund, and 7-Eleven from Israel. 

A BDS-organized consumer backlash also hit McDonald's and Pret, while several cities and universities in the United States also passed resolutions to cut ties with Israeli-linked firms, driven by BDS campaigns.

Although Norway's divestment alone is expected to have a limited economic impact on Israel, economist Benjamin Bental from Israel's University of Haifa warned that it could set a dangerous precedent.

""[Norway is sending] a signal about the activities of Israeli firms that it doesn't like, which others may follow,"" Bental told DW. ""Once the dam is broken, if it becomes a flood, it will be of very significant importance.""

Norway's sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, held shares in 65 Israeli companies at the end of 2024, valued at around $1.95 billion (€1.67 billion). It still holds stakes in nearly 50 Israeli firms.

The fund, an arm of Norway's central bank, said it is actively reviewing these holdings to ensure compliance with international law. It now plans to manage all Israeli projects in-house and limit future investments to companies in Israel's equity benchmark index.

The BDS Movement hailed Norway's decision as a ""major ethical victory."" The LO trade union, one of Norway's most influential labor organizations, has lobbied the government to take firmer action. The union's members recently voted in favor of a full economic boycott of Israel.

Norway's announcement follows a steady trickle of divestments across Europe. In April last year, Ireland's ISIF strategic investment fund divested from six Israeli firms. Several councils in the United Kingdom have also passed motions requiring their pension funds to exit their Israeli investments. 

Many of the decisions were linked to Israel's settler scheme in the Occupied West Bankand East Jerusalem, which the United Nations and European Union consider illegal under international law. Israel recently announced the most significant expansion of settlements in the occupied West Bank in decades, with Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz saying the move ""prevents the establishment of a Palestinian state.""

Dany Bahar, senior fellow at the Centre for Global Development, a Washington D.C.-based think tank, believes the impact of boycotts and divestments on Israel's growth and ability to fight the war remains modest.

""[The BDS boycotts and divestments] haven't happened at a scale that could make a dent in the Israeli economy,"" Bahar told DW. ""They are nothing compared to the tariff that Trump put on Israel,"" which he said was the ""worst boycott"" Israel has ever received.

In April, US President Donald Trump declared that Israeli goods entering the US would be subject to a 17% tariff, despite Israel eliminating all tariffs on US imports. The figure was later reduced to 15%.

Referring to Norway's asset sale, Bahar argued that the broader investment landscape in Israel remains resilient and that market forces would likely override the decision.

""Somebody else is going to buy these investments because they are good companies. Israel has a lot to export to the world in terms of knowledge and products. Investors know that,"" he said.

Despite trepidation among some investors due to geopolitical tensions and BDS campaigns, foreign investments in Israel have rebounded significantly from a slump in 2023. In 2024, the scope of net investments by nonresidents was about $27 billion compared to only $8 billion in 2023, according to the Bank of Israel.

This resilience underscores Israel's robust economic fundamentals and deep ties to global markets. Yet, mounting international pressure — highlighted by Norway's recent decision — signals a growing push to hold Israel accountable for its actions in Gaza and the West Bank through targeted sanctions.

In his final year in office, former US President Joe Biden imposed sanctions on 19 Israeli settlers and eight entities for West Bank violence, which Trump reversed in January. Over 30 states, including Texas and Florida, have anti-BDS laws, barring state agencies from working with entities boycotting Israel.

The UK, France and Canada have placed curbs on Israeli settlers accused of violence, including travel bans and freezing assets. The EU has also blacklisted far-right Israeli groups involved in attacks on Palestinians. Washington, meanwhile, has blocked property and financial access for individuals linked to the unrest.

Nine other countries, including South Africa, Bolivia, and Malaysia, have gone further, imposing full economic sanctions against Israel. These steps include banning arms sales and stopping shipments of fuel that could be used by the military.

Germany, traditionally one of Israel's closest allies, announced this month a halt to all military exports that could be used in Gaza ""until further notice,"" citing the worsening humanitarian crisis.

The EU is also considering whether to curb Israel's access to the €95 billion ($111 billion) Horizon Europe research fund, blaming human rights violations in Gaza. The plan is currently stalled by a lack of consensus, with France, Spain, Ireland and Slovenia urging Brussels to do more, while Germany, Italy and Hungary oppose sanctions.

Bental warned that EU sanctions ""would have serious effects on the ability of Israeli firms to function."" Nearly a third of Israel's exports go to the EU, which he said contributes roughly 1% of Israel's GDP. 

Bahar echoed the concern, but pointed to Israel's deep-rooted role in global innovation and trade as a reason why any further pressure from the international community may be limited in scope.

""Whatever you think of Israel and the war, the country is very skilled in terms of engineers and developers. The economy is so embedded in the global economy that it's not that easy to decouple from Israel,"" he told DW.

Hundreds of opponents of the Moscow regime have fled Russia and are now stuck in countries where they aren't safe. Many hope to come to Germany on a humanitarian visa, but Berlin has just suspended these visa programs.

Some 300 Russians and Belarussians may be prevented from obtaining visas for Germany after Berlin suspended its humanitarian visa programs at the end of July, according to the Ark project (Kovcheg).

Founded in March 2022, The Ark supports Russians fleeing persecution by the Russian authorities, in particular opponents of Russia's war against Ukraine.

In all these cases, visas had already been approved by the German Foreign Office — but the Ministry of the Interior has stopped them from being issued.

One of those affected is Alexei Moskalev, a Russian man who was persecuted in his homeland because of a drawing his young daughter did in school. The drawing showed Russia firing rockets at Ukraine, with a mother standing in front of a child, holding up a hand to ward them off.

Masha Moskaleva from the Russian region of Tula was 13 years old when she did the drawing in an art class in the spring of 2022, not long after the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The drawing was seized on by the international media after the Russian authorities took an interest in it.

According to the girl's father, Alexei Moskalev, the school administration reported the drawing to the police, and Masha was interviewed by members of Russia's domestic intelligence service, the FSB.

In 2023, Moskalev was sentenced to two years in prison. The court found him guilty of discrediting the army in anti-war comments he was said to have made on a Russian social network, Odnoklassniki. State authorities sent his daughter Masha to an orphanage before later handing her over to her mother, who had been estranged from the family for several years.

Moskalev left Russia after his release from prison in October 2024, as he was in danger of being arrested again. ""When I was in prison, in Vladimir Putin's dungeons, FSB officers came to see me twice,"" he says. ""They always stressed, at the end of our conversation, 'We're not going to leave you alone, even after you're released.'""

Anton K. (name changed for security reasons) left Russia at the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Back home, the former activist and journalist worked with publications branded ""foreign agents"" by the authorities. Today, he works for an online medium whose editor-in-chief is in custody, accused of inciting terrorism.

Anton K. also took part in anti-Kremlin protests, and was arrested many times in consequence. Russia's ""Center for Combating Extremism"" took his fingerprints so that, if necessary, it could find him more easily.

Like Alexei Moskalev, Anton K. is also currently in one of the CIS states. The Commonwealth of Independent States is an organization of Soviet Union successor states, and in addition to Russia it consists of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.

Lawyer Anastasia Burakova is the founder of Kovcheg, the Ark Project that supports Russian dissidents abroad. She told DW that it was dangerous for opponents of the regime to stay in these countries long-term. ""There's always the risk of an extradition request from Russia if a person is wanted in a politically motivated case,"" Burakova says.

""There are abduction attempts, like those we've seen in Armenia, but there are also successful abductions, as in Kyrgyzstan; those people ended up in Russian prisons.""

Anton K. and Alexei Moskalev were very aware of these risks, so they applied for humanitarian visas for Germany, along with some 300 other Russians and Belarusians. German authorities can issue this visa to independent journalists, activists, and politicians who are persecuted in their home countries.

According to The Ark, around 2,600 people from Russia have been granted these visas for Germany in the past three-and-a-half years of the war. ""More than 2,600 people have been given the chance to come to a safe place, to evade a Russian prison sentence, torture, and persecution for their civil society activism and their opposition to the war,"" Anastasia Burakova stresses.

At the end of July this year, Germany's Ministry of the Interior announced that it was suspending the humanitarian visa program. The reason given was the coalition contract between the governing parties, the CDU/CSU and the SPD, which refers to a toughening of migration policy.

Anton K.'s visa was almost in the bag. At the beginning of July, he was invited to present his passport at the German embassy in order to receive the visa. However, at this point the procedure was broken off. Anton's passport is still at the embassy.

Alexei Moskalev had a similar experience. He says the German Foreign Office had already approved his visa, but because of the new government's decision, he hasn't received it. It has been more than six months since he submitted the required documents.

The German Ministry of the Interior told DW that the governing parties' coalition agreement included the intention to ""terminate voluntary federal admission programs as far as possible,"" and said they were currently examining how this could be implemented with regard to the various programs.

""We cannot preempt the outcome of this review,"" it stated. ""Until a decision is made, procedures for the admission of persons in order to safeguard the political interests of the Federal Republic of Germany under Section 22, Paragraph 2 of the Residence Act are also generally suspended, meaning that, in principle, new admissions will not be declared nor visas issued, except in urgent cases."" The ministry added that exceptions could be made ""in particularly special individual cases.""

Anastasia Burakova hopes that this wording means that it will indeed make exceptions. It will become clear in practice what exactly the German authorities regard as ""urgent cases,"" she says.

In August of this year, there were 1,043 people categorized by the Russian human rights organization Memorial as political prisoners in Russia. According to the independent Russian news portal The Bell, which operates outside the country, around 700,000 people have left Russia since the start of its all-out war against Ukraine.

Times Square was evacuated and locked down after a bomb scare on Monday.

Officers responded to reports of a suspicious package left outside a police facility at 10.32am on Monday between West 43rd Street and 7th Avenue.

“Upon arrival, officers observed a suspicious package in front of the New York Police Department facility,” a New York Police Department (NYPD) spokesman said.

They added: “NYPD Emergency Service Unit and Bomb Squad were requested and did respond to the location.”

NYPD officials said at 11.56am that the package was determined to be “non-hazardous” and the investigation was now closed.

A spokesman told The Telegraph that roads would shortly reopen to pedestrians and cars.

Videos shared on social media showed Times Square, which is usually thronging with tourists and performers, completely empty apart from several police vehicles during the evacuation.

Times Square subway station was also evacuated as police officers investigated the cylinder device, according to the New York Post.

The scare comes at a time of increased international tensions.

Earlier this year the NYPD stepped up security at places of worship after the US launched strikes on Iran in June.

Weeks later, ahead of the July 4 weekend, Kathy Hochul, the New York governor, warned that lone wolf actors remained “the greatest potential threat” and urged residents to report anything suspicious.

The decision was announced after Laura Loomer posted a video of injured and ill Gaza children arriving in the U.S.

The State Department announced this weekend that it is suspending visitor visas for Palestinians from Gaza to enter the U.S. after right wingers raged about children entering the country to receive medical care — often for injuries caused by Israel with the U.S.'s backing.

“All visitor visas for individuals from Gaza are being stopped while we conduct a full and thorough review of the process and procedures used to issue a small number of temporary medical-humanitarian visas in recent days,” the State Department said in a statement on X.

The announcement came after right wing influencer Laura Loomer complained about the program, specifically highlighting work by the nonprofit organization HEAL Palestine. She asserted on X that the U.S. should not be accepting any refugees from Palestine — even though HEAL Palestine only arranges temporary visas for children to receive medical care. 

Loomer posted a video showing young children being cheered by people waving Palestinian flags as they arrive at San Francisco's airport with their families. Loomer said that the video was “exclusive” and that she “obtained video footage” for her report, though the video was originally posted online on HEAL Palestine's Instagram account, and received over half a million likes. 

Still, Loomer claimed that the video was evidence of the Trump administration going back on its pledge to not accept Palestinian refugees. This is a lie that nonetheless took hold on the right. 

HEAL Palestine condemned the State Department's decision in a statement, and emphasized that it is not bringing children over as part of a refugee resettlement program.

“HEAL Palestine is an American humanitarian nonprofit organization delivering urgent aid and medical care to children in Palestine, including sponsoring and bringing severely injured children to the U.S. on temporary visas for essential medical treatment not available at home. After their treatment is complete, the children and any accompanying family members return to the Middle East,” the group said.

Indeed, medical evacuation is the last hope for an estimated 11,000 Palestinians in Gaza, including 4,500 children, who require it, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has estimated. With Israel's systematic destruction of Gaza's health system — and decades of medical blockades by Israeli occupation — thousands in Gaza have no treatment options within the Strip for diseases like cancer or treatment for severe injuries caused by Israeli bombings. 

HEAL Palestine has brought 63 injured children, aged 6 to 15 years old, from Gaza to the U.S. for treatment, with 148 evacuees total, according to the group. These are children who have lost limbs or suffered severe burns, likely as a result of Israeli attacks, while others have chronic conditions. “All are severely malnourished,” the group said.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended the visa suspensions in an interview with CBS on Sunday, accusing the groups helping Palestinians acquire visas of being affiliated with Hamas, without evidence.

“First of all, it's not just kids. It's a bunch of adults that are accompanying them,” he said, likely referring to the children's family members.

Advocates for Palestinian rights have said that the State Department's decision is cruel.

“Blocking Palestinian children injured by American weapons from coming to America for medical treatment is the latest sign that the intentional cruelty of President Trump's ‘Israel First' administration knows no bounds,” said Nihad Awad, the ​​Council on American-Islamic Relations' national executive director. 

“It is also deeply ironic that the Trump administration would ban Palestinian children seeking treatment while rolling out the red carpet for racists and indicted war criminals from the Israeli government,” Awad went on.

Humanitarian groups have pleaded with international partners to welcome Palestinians for treatment as Israel has denied the vast majority of requests for medical evacuations, no matter how dire the cases. Most countries are refusing to allow Palestinians to evacuate, MSF says, while Israel has imposed a number of arbitrary restrictions on approving evacuations.

“We are looking for countries — we really want them to open their doors to accept more and more cases because those patients are dying inside Gaza,” said Hani Isleem, the group's project coordinator for medical evacuations in Gaza.

France was one of those countries, but earlier this month also froze its program to allow Palestinians to flee Gaza amid the genocide after a Palestinian student was suspended from her university due to allegations that she made antisemitic posts online.

The president suggested he may seek to ban both mail-in voting and voting machines before next year's midterm elections.

In his latest full-frontal assault on democratic access and voting rights, President Donald Trump early Monday said he will lead an effort to ban both mail-in ballots and voting machines for next year's mid-term elections — a vow met with immediate rebuke from progressive critics.

“I am going to lead a movement to get rid of MAIL-IN BALLOTS, and also, while we're at it, Highly ‘Inaccurate,' Very Expensive, and Seriously Controversial VOTING MACHINES, which cost Ten Times more than accurate and sophisticated Watermark Paper, which is faster, and leaves NO DOUBT, at the end of the evening, as to who WON, and who LOST, the Election,” Trump wrote in a social media post infested with lies and falsehoods.

Trump falsely claimed that no other country in the world uses mail-in voting — a blatant lie, according to International IDEA, which monitors democratic trends worldwide, at least 34 nations allow for in-country postal voting of some kind. The group notes that over 100 countries allow out-of-country postal voting for citizens living or stationed overseas during an election.

Trump has repeated his false claim — over and over again — that he won the 2020 election, which he actually lost, in part due to fraud related to mail-in ballots, though the lie has been debunked ad nauseam. He also fails to note that mail-in ballots were very much in use nationwide in 2024, with an estimated 30% of voters casting a mail-in ballot as opposed to in-person during the election in which Trump returned to the White House and Republicans took back the US Senate and retained the US House of Representatives.

Monday's rant by Trump came just days after his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who Trump claimed commented personally on the 2020 election and mail-in ballots. In a Friday night interview with Fox News, Trump claimed “one of the most interesting” things Putin said during their talks about ending the war in Ukraine was about mail-in voting in the United States and how Trump would have won the election were it not for voter fraud, echoing Trump's own disproven claims.

Trump said Monday he would sign an executive order on election processes, suggesting that it would forbid mail-in ballots as well as the automatic tabulation machines used in states nationwide. He also said that states, which are in charge of administering their elections at the local level, “must do what the Federal Government, as represented by the President of the United States, tells them, FOR THE GOOD OF OUR COUNTRY, to do.”

Marc Elias, founder of Democracy Docket, which tracks voting rights and issues related to ballot access, said any executive order by Trump to end mail-in voting or forbid provenly safe and accurate voting machines ahead of the midterms would be “unconstitutional and illegal.”

Such an effort, said Elias, “would violate the Constitution and is a major step to prevent free and fair elections.”

A judge says ICE can ban toothbrushes at 26 Federal Plaza even though they're routinely provided at other facilities.

A judge says ICE can ban toothbrushes at 26 Federal Plaza even though they're routinely provided at other facilities.

A federal judge says Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials can deny toothbrushes to immigrants detained at a federal courthouse in Manhattan. 

On August 8, the American Civil Liberties Union, Make the Road New York, and the New York Civil Liberties Union sued the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and others for detaining people in inhumane conditions inside the Manhattan federal courthouse located at 26 Federal Plaza.

People have been detained for days at a time in crowded cells that are supposed to hold people for 12 hours, at most. There are no beds or showers, and ICE officials have refused to provide them with toothbrushes, period products, medication, or a change of clothes, and denied them access to their attorneys. Many of the people detained at 26 Federal Plaza were arrested when they showed up to court for mandatory immigration check-ins or hearings. 

After the lawsuit was filed, the judge granted the plaintiffs' request for a temporary restraining order and directed the government to provide detainees with sleeping mats, as well as “adequate supplies of” toothbrushes and toothpaste, soap, towels, toilet paper, and “feminine hygiene” products. The judge also ordered the defendants to ensure detainees have access to their lawyers.

But just days later, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan walked back some of his order after receiving a letter from the Manhattan U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton, who warned that “providing toothbrushes, rather than teeth-cleaning wipes, presents a potential safety concern for other aliens in custody as well as ICE personnel because toothbrushes can be readily improvised as weapons.” 

The U.S. Attorney's claim makes little sense. People in immigration detention facilities, as well as jails and prisons, routinely have access to toothbrushes. In the plaintiffs' response to Clayton's letter, the groups note that the 2025 ICE National Detention Standards states that each detainee “shall receive, at a minimum” one tube of toothpaste and one toothbrush. 

“There is no basis to deny individuals detained at 26 Federal Plaza basic hygiene products that are customarily made available at other immigration detention facilities across the country,” the groups wrote to the court. “Individuals in immigration custody routinely are provided with toothbrushes, and ICE's own policies provide for them.”

Immigrants held at 26 Federal Plaza have described horrific conditions where they were denied the most basic necessities. 

“I was losing my head in there,” Geovani Maradiaga Ochoa told the court in a statement. “It was like being in hell.”

ICE arrested Ochoa when he arrived for an immigration check-in in the Bronx. 

“When I arrived at my check-in with my wife and children, I was led into the back office alone where about five ICE officers were waiting for me,” he said. “They pushed me against the wall, tied my hands, and then took my personal belongings. I asked the officers if I could at least say goodbye to my wife and children but they told me no.”

Ochoa was sent to 26 Federal Plaza where he was detained for six days. During that time, he was not allowed to shower or brush his teeth. He slept on the floor and used his shoes as pillows. There were only two toilets for everyone in the cell to use, about 30-40 people. 

After almost a week at 26 Federal Plaza, Ochoa was transferred to Arizona, then Washington State and Texas. On July 19, he was deported, leaving behind his wife and young children, who are all U.S. citizens. Ochoa had lived in the United States for 20 years.

For the high command of the People's Liberation Army, Xi Jinping's third term as China's president has been a period of almost operatic tumult. Altogether, at least 21 senior officers have been removed since Xi started his third term in 2022, including three of the seven members of the Central Military Commission, the supreme military body of the Chinese Communist Party. Many of the members of the PLA's most senior ranks, including the defense minister and the officer who oversaw just about every general officer promotion for over a decade, have been disgraced. By the end of his tenure, Xi could well exceed the mercurial Mao Zedong in his body count of officers who have been purged.

Although Xi oversaw military purges earlier in his career and even imposed a sweeping overhaul of the PLA's command structure in 2015, this recent shakeup has raised eyebrows since many of the affected men were Xi's putative allies rather than potential political rivals. The ousting of senior officers who were once considered untouchable has fed a flurry of rumors that Xi is losing his grip over the PLA—and even prompted more extreme claims that Xi's own political demise might be imminent.

But rather than Xi's diminution, the recent moves more likely reflect Xi's continued dominance of the military. Much like a Mafia don, Xi has shown that he considers even his associates to be disposable. More important, the staggering political casualties reflect that he is losing patience with his military rather than his control over it. The moves demonstrate his continued dissatisfaction with the PLA's high command and can be seen as part of an ongoing process of achieving his larger goals of bending the military to his will. Indeed, Xi wants to ensure he can employ violence with confidence, but Xi's confidence seems to be the rarest and most precious commodity for an otherwise well-resourced military.

Xi sees his military agenda as a centerpiece of his legacy. Whereas Xi's predecessors focused their political firepower primarily on advancing major economic reforms, some of the most dramatic reforms of the Xi era have occurred in the military. Two goals have driven his unforgiving management of the PLA. His paramount aim is ensuring the military is thoroughly politicized and thus willing to fulfill its role as the ultimate guarantor of the party's rule should it be challenged by internal unrest. And Xi also wants a military that can fight if he needs it to do so, including against the U.S. military.

In other words, Xi's iron grip on the military not only endures, it is also indicative of his obsession with breaking the PLA's insularity and endemic corruption and ensuring that, should he need to bet the regime on the military's prowess, it will not fail.

The recent purges of He Weidong, the vice chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), and Admiral Miao Hua, the director of the Political Work Department, have garnered the most attention in the rumor mill. The two men overlapped with Xi in Fujian Province earlier in their careers and were believed to enjoy a special relationship as a result. But He is now missing (he hasn't been seen in public since March), and Miao was removed from his post in November 2024.

Analysts have gravitated to two hypotheses. The more mundane is that these purges reflect embarrassingly poor judgment by Xi in his choice of subordinates. The more extravagant is that they reflect a burgeoning movement among disaffected party and military leaders who now seek to challenge or even remove Xi.

Neither of these hypotheses stands up to scrutiny, however. Both share the unlikely premise that these purges have somehow loosened Xi's grip on the military. If the political turmoil inside the PLA was in fact embarrassing to Xi, it would be covered up rather than publicly acknowledged, as most of these cases have been. If the party excels at nothing else, it is adept at propagandizing and protecting the leadership's image, particularly Xi's.



Moreover, if Xi were in fact in political trouble with the military, the question would be: Why now? After a decade of seemingly supine obeisance, there is no obvious reason why the military leadership would suddenly rouse itself to oppose Xi. The PLA actively thwarted the efforts of Xi's predecessors when they tried to reform the high command. But so far, the PLA has not only succumbed to Xi's sweeping reforms, it also seems to be earnestly preparing for Xi's order to provide military options for a Taiwan contingency by 2027.

Historically, the PLA has been loath to wade too deeply into politics. Even after filling the administrative vacuums left by the Cultural Revolution or the turmoil of the 1989 Tiananmen crisis, the military was content to relinquish its political role and go “back to the barracks.” Indeed, Leninist regimes tend to effectively inoculate themselves against the prospect of military coups that bedevil other authoritarian systems because of their reliance on purges and political commissars to enforce party discipline.

Rather than a split between Xi and the PLA, it seems more likely that the recent purges are the result of an intramural game of thrones within the PLA. Xi still has close ties to key senior officers, after all, especially CMC Vice Chairman General Zhang Youxia, whom Xi has known for decades and whose father was close friends with Xi's father. Xi has even allowed Zhang to remain CMC vice chairman after he exceeded the party's informal retirement age—a remarkable and clear sign of Xi's trust in him. Zhang has also survived Xi's anticorruption campaign unscathed despite having previously run the PLA's Equipment Development Department, which has been a focal point of the most recent round of purges.

The ousted officers, by contrast, could simply be in the outer orbit of Xi's political circle. And given that corruption is such a widespread reality of life in the PLA, especially since Xi initiated his pricey military modernization program, the recently purged officers may have miscalculated that their ties to Xi would allow them to line their pockets with impunity.

The scale and drama of these machinations in the high command, however, raise deeper questions about why Xi has been so fixated on the military—and so ruthless in his management of it. His biography offers some clues.

As the son of a leader who played a major role in China's civil war, Xi was more comfortable with military affairs than his two predecessors—both of whom were engineers with little prior exposure to the military. Xi's immediate predecessor, Hu Jintao, had few if any identifiable allies among senior PLA officers and struggled to exercise full control over the military. Since many of his fellow princelings served in the senior ranks, however, Xi was better attuned to the politics within the military. And he had a greater appreciation for the political importance of the PLA, intuitively understanding that control of the military was indispensable for his ability to dominate Chinese politics.

Yet in 2010 when Xi became a member of the CMC and the Chinese Communist Party's heir apparent, he was probably alarmed by what he discovered at PLA headquarters. Thanks to the domination of generals loyal to former leader Jiang Zemin, who sustained his influence throughout the Hu era (2002–12), the PLA had become an insular and unwieldy institution that was spending more time protecting its own parochial interests than operating as a joint force globally or even regionally.



Indeed, Xi started his tenure as commander in chief by promulgating the idea that the PLA needed to be prepared “to fight and win battles,” a turn of phrase that rather patronizingly implied that the PLA was not currently prepared to do so. Xi also likely found that behind the wall of PLA insularity, there was extensive corruption. As one of Xi's princeling allies famously commented, corruption had become so rife in the PLA that “only our own corruption can defeat us.”

The insularity of the PLA is hard to fathom from afar. It is a sprawling, opaque, and technologically advanced empire unto itself within the party apparatus, and even civilian Communist Party leaders often can't understand, penetrate, or control it. Although the Communist Party has a monopoly on the use of force, the PLA has a near monopoly on military expertise. Unlike in the United States, there is no cadre of civilian experts on military affairs either inside or outside the PLA. There is no equivalent to the Pentagon's Office of the Secretary of Defense, which helps ensure civilian control of the military.

Paradoxically, this has bred an increasing degree of professionalism: senior officers in the PLA are neutral experts focused on warfighting and not on politics. Although an apolitical military appeals to democracies such as the United States, this trend would have startled rather than mollified Xi. In the Chinese political system, the military is supposed to be thoroughly politicized: virtually all officers are required to be members of the Chinese Communist Party and both senior commanders and the rank and file devote considerable time to ideological education and other tasks that are ancillary to military proficiency. In fact, the PLA's chief periodical regularly publishes diatribes against the notion of an apolitical military. That focus stems in large part from the PLA's primary mission and its true raison d'être—protecting the CCP and its rule, not defending the Chinese state per se.

In 2011, a mere year into Xi's tenure on the CMC, the question of whether the PLA would serve as guarantor of the party became acute because of the Arab Spring. In the face of public discontent, security forces across the Middle East melted away and regimes fell. During China's 1989 pro-democracy movement, the PLA's support for quashing the protesters in Tiananmen Square rested on a narrow consensus; many senior PLA officers opposed martial law and the military was paralyzed for a month before paramount leader Deng Xiaoping could sway the outcome. After the Arab Spring, one could imagine senior CCP leaders asking, “If Tiananmen happened today, would the PLA again save the party?”

Xi was likely not assured. The command structure of the PLA at the time looked like a joint force at first glance, with each service having a representative on the party's supreme military body—but in fact, this structure made it even more difficult to control the high command since no officer had the authority to corral the various service chiefs. For any civilian leader, this state of affairs would be troubling. But for a Leninist leader like Xi, it was unacceptable.

Soon after becoming commander in chief, Xi initiated a risky blitzkrieg against the military chieftains who had turned the PLA into a near state within a state. He arrested and purged two retired but influential vice chairmen of the CMC for accepting bribes before purging several other senior officers across a wide swath of the PLA. He then went on to diminish the role of the PLA's Ground Force, which had traditionally enjoyed a dominant position in the PLA, through a major overhaul of the PLA's command structure. (Unlike their brethren in the navy or the air force, the ground forces did not consider themselves a mere service among several in the PLA. Rather, they were the PLA itself because they had conquered China for the Communist Party.)

Xi's reforms wrested operational control from the services and handed it over to a novel command structure that is streamlined and reflects Xi's dual emphasis on strict party control and joint operations. Today, the Ground Force, which has been somewhat clumsily renamed the People's Liberation Army Army, must operate as a peer with its fellow services, which in many ways are at the forefront of the PLA's dramatic military modernization.

This is a marked shift from just 20 years ago, when the ground forces still dominated the PLA's priorities and institutions. The “Army Army” no longer dominates membership of the CMC, and the Joint Theater command staff and the other services now receive a greater share of the budget, especially for weapons acquisitions. Those services have grown, meanwhile, while the army has been cut by almost 500,000 since 2010.

The sheer scope and scale of the institutional reforms that Xi imposed on the PLA a decade ago are not to be underestimated. They are tantamount to the U.S. military experiencing both the 1947 National Security Act, which subjugated the Navy and War Departments to a unified Department of Defense, and the 1986 Goldwater-Nichols Act, which sought to oust the service chiefs from the operational chain of command, simultaneously. Although the United States has a long tradition of civilian control of the military, both reforms provoked intense public hostility as well as opposition from the high command, including the famous “Revolt of the Admirals” in 1949 when navy officers publicly opposed the Truman administration's defense policy.

Given the audacity of Xi's purges and reforms, many analysts have expected—or even hoped for—some kind of backlash against Xi for more than a decade. Yet Xi made these extensive renovations to the high command with no visible sign of dissent. By going straight for the metaphorical jugular of the PLA, Xi flipped on its head the oft-used phrase that Chinese leaders “kill the chicken to scare the monkeys.” Instead of purging the protégés of PLA elites to send a message to the top, he decapitated the leadership itself. It was a gamble, but the moves effectively bludgeoned resistance and seemed to enhance Xi's stature.

Indeed, power in Chinese politics tends to accrue like compound interest rather than depreciate, and the potential for opposition to Xi has dissipated rather than coalesced over time. This dynamic was most vividly on display at the last party congress, in 2022, when Xi not only evicted the already marginalized allies of his predecessor Hu from the leadership lineup but also had Hu himself physically removed from the proceedings while Xi looked on impassively. Twice in his tenure, Xi has even hauled the entire high command to historic revolutionary sites where Mao institutionalized the party's control of the military, reinforcing the military's role as the armed wing of the Communist Party.

Xi's focus on reforming the PLA is often portrayed in the West as a myopic obsession with unification with Taiwan. But it is more symbolic than that. Throughout his tenure, Xi has demonstrated a keen fondness for centenary celebrations, and 2027 will mark the 100th anniversary of the creation of the PLA. Serendipitously for Xi, 2027 will also coincide with the start of his potential fourth term in office, and Xi and the military will inevitably use the occasion to publicly extol the considerable advances the PLA has made toward his objectives. Behind closed doors, however, Xi is likely to remain relentless in pushing the PLA to do more.

Xi's overbearing approach to the PLA not only ensures Xi's military objectives, it also serves his political objectives. Keeping senior officers uncertain about their career prospects and reliant on Xi for their promotions and livelihoods allows Xi to cultivate multiple channels of information from within the PLA so that he can puncture that wall of insularity and triangulate what he hears from different sources. This tactic is especially important as the PLA modernizes to conduct twenty-first-century warfare and becomes even more impenetrable for senior party civilian leaders.

For many observers, Xi's approach may seem counterproductive. Stringent management of the PLA and the relentlessness of Xi's anticorruption campaign is probably both humiliating and demoralizing for senior officers. Yet Xi probably sees such suffering among the high command as having a salutary effect. Xi's own father was ousted from power and imprisoned multiple times during his long career in the CCP—trials that seem to have deepened his loyalty to the party rather than undermined it.

For more than 40 years, the PLA has been a peacetime military unbloodied by actual conflict. Without challenges or tests of loyalty, Xi knows it is at risk of growing complacent. He wants a military that is inured to such trials and ready to take on the most difficult missions, whether that is punishing its purported compatriots in Taiwan and fending off a potential U.S. intervention, or even employing violence to protect the party from its fellow citizens. As Xi noted in his first speech to the PLA after becoming commander in chief, the Soviet Union fell because “nobody was man enough to stand up and resist.” Xi is obsessed with ensuring that the PLA's men would resist if need be—but he is still not confident they would.

 Daniel S. Hamilton and Angela Stent

Russia's aggression against Ukraine and other neighbors is transforming the Black Sea into Eurasia's strategic frontier. Russia has disrupted flows of energy, food, and other commodities; generated millions of migrants; and heightened insecurity not just in Ukraine but also across the entire Black Sea region. These efforts constitute part of a much longer and larger strategy. Russia does not merely seek to dominate Ukraine. It wants to render each of the other five states that border the Black Sea—as well as Moldova, which borders Romania and Ukraine and whose waters flow into the sea—subservient to its interests so that it can exercise veto power over choices these countries make. Moscow also aspires to use the Black Sea as a platform from which to project power and influence throughout the Middle East, the Mediterranean, and the Caucasus.

Russia's quest to become the dominant force in the Black Sea is an essential element in its strategy to reassert itself as a great power. The Kremlin believes that a failure to establish a commanding presence in the region would leave Russia exposed to Western encroachment, render it less able to influence adjoining areas and disrupt commodity exports that are critical to the Russian economy. Turkey poses the greatest obstacle to Russian objectives in the region because it is the only Black Sea state that Russia has not historically dominated and it is a NATO member. But even after the end of the Cold War, the Kremlin retained considerable levers of influence over the former Soviet empire's Black Sea space in Bulgaria, Georgia, Moldova, Romania, and Ukraine.

In recent decades, Russia has sought to further subordinate these states to Moscow through a combination of persuasion and coercion. Increasing Russia's Black Sea presence is also at the heart of President Vladimir Putin's decades-long plan to resurrect the country's maritime power. He prioritized modernizing the Black Sea Fleet, whose interventions proved critical in supporting Russia's Mediterranean Squadron and its 2015 intervention in Syria. Putin has ignored internationally recognized borders to seize a great expanse of Black Sea coastline, including Georgia's territory of Abkhazia in 2008, Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014, and the Ukrainian part of the Sea of Azov coast in 2022. Although Ukraine has prevented Russia from taking all of its Black Sea coast, Moscow has deployed naval mines as well as blockaded and bombed Ukrainian ports to sever Ukraine's sea access and minimize the presence of other navies.

While the world has focused on Russia's battle for Ukraine, Moscow has often advanced these goals under the radar—extending the war, skirting sanctions, disrupting markets, and enhancing its influence in the Middle East and North Africa. Other key leaders should work with Black Sea countries to build a region more resilient to Russian pressure. Failing to do so will likely prolong the war, further enable Russia's massive human rights violations, exacerbate refugee flows, and provoke turbulence in global energy and commodity markets. Regional insecurities are, in turn, likely to spill over into the Caucasus, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean.

For centuries, the Black Sea has served as a critical junction for the movement of people and commodities. Russia has long believed that controlling the sea is essential for its security: in 1783, Catherine the Great annexed Crimea from the Ottoman Empire to increase the Russian Empire's control over the Black Sea. Throughout much of the nineteenth century, Russia competed with the Ottoman Empire and Europe's major powers for influence in and around the sea. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union became the region's leading power. Turkey was its main competitor, but Moscow came to dominate all the other Black Sea coastal states.

After the Soviet Union collapsed, in 1991, Russia's regional role changed dramatically. Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine became independent countries and pursued closer ties to the West. Bulgaria and Romania joined NATO in 2004 and the European Union in 2007. As a result, Russia lost its access to parts of the Black Sea coastline. In March 2014, Putin justified the annexation of Crimea by warning that otherwise, “NATO ships would have ended up in the city of Russian navy glory, Sevastopol.” Between 2014 and 2022, the Kremlin tripled the amount of Black Sea coastline under its de facto control and strengthened its influence by wielding a combination of military, diplomatic, economic, energy, and disinformation tactics.

Today, the Black Sea is a central hub for Russia's energy trade: Russian oil and oil products account for most of the cargo flowing out of Novorossiysk, the largest port in Russia and the Black Sea basin and the fifth-largest in Europe. The country's remaining westward pipeline gas routes run under the Black Sea to Turkey and then on to southeastern Europe. The sea is also vital to Russian agriculture: Russia routes almost all of its grain exports and a significant proportion of its fertilizer and other agricultural goods through its ports there. These flows enable Moscow to increase revenue, create new markets, establish trading systems less reliant on the U.S. dollar, and gain influence in recipient countries.

Russia now employs a variety of interference tactics to swing Black Sea states toward Moscow. Hard power, of course, remains a crucial element of its strategy, and not only in Ukraine. The 1991–93 civil war in Georgia unsettled that country's political life and granted Moscow opportunities for influence; in 2008, Russia invaded and defeated Georgia in a brief war and recognized the separatist enclaves of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent states. About eight percent of Georgians have been internally displaced because of that invasion and other Russian efforts to exploit the country's ethnic conflicts.



But military campaigns are not the only way Russia has sought to bring the Black Sea region to heel. The Kremlin has frequently used disinformation to persuade populations in post-communist countries to align with Russia over what the Kremlin calls pro-Western elites, appealing to people disillusioned with their governments' failures. Moscow has also supported pro-Russian political parties, interfered in elections, and sought to carry out coups against incumbents.

And historically, Russia has leveraged Bulgaria, Moldova, and Ukraine's dependence on Russian energy to influence each country's elites. Moscow cut all gas transit through Ukraine to Europe several times before its initial 2014 incursion and shut off gas supplies to Bulgaria in 2022 and Moldova in early 2025. It has restricted food flows, banning wheat exports to Georgia or limiting Moldovan wine exports to Russia, for instance, to discipline Georgia and Moldova when it believes that either is diverging from Moscow's priorities. And Russian interference extends to the cultural: the Russian Orthodox Church appeals to its counterparts abroad to battle “satanic” or “woke” Western culture. The Kremlin also deploys espionage and sabotage to destabilize these societies.

Moscow's 2022 invasion of Ukraine both accelerated its efforts to dominate the Black Sea and revealed the benefits of the groundwork it laid earlier to solidify control. Its ability to disrupt maritime traffic has scrambled regional energy flows: although Russia's gas exports to Bulgaria, Romania, and Ukraine have declined significantly since February 2022, its exports to Georgia and Turkey have increased substantially as each of those countries has refused to join sanctions on Russia. Turkey has become the world's largest buyer of Russian refined oil products. Many of these imports are relabeled in Georgia and Turkey and then reexported to circumvent the European Union's import ban.

The sea has also become a major staging area for Russia's “shadow fleet” of unregistered ships, which it uses to circumvent Western sanctions. Russia has used its access to the Black Sea to disrupt its agricultural competitors. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev calls food Russia's “silent weapon.” The Kremlin has stolen Ukrainian agricultural products and bombed Ukraine's farmlands, agricultural infrastructure, and ports to undercut a primary source of Kyiv's revenue and gain new markets for Moscow.

Russia's efforts to destabilize other Black Sea states are a tale of uneven successes and setbacks. The region's weakest links are Georgia and Moldova. Russian forces are stationed in each country's breakaway regions, and broader domestic discontent provides fertile ground for subversive Russian tactics. Georgia's ruling party, Georgian Dream, has turned toward Russia, suspending accession negotiations with the EU in November 2024 and later introducing legislation that represses freedom of speech and assembly. Although a large segment of Georgian society opposes these moves, the party has managed to win successive elections; many Georgians fear that if the country continues along a pro-EU path, Russia will invade again. Intimidation apparently works. The victory of pro-Western candidates in recent Moldovan and Romanian elections illustrates the limits of Russian interference, but the Kremlin is working hard to manipulate Moldova's fall 2025 parliamentary elections to boost pro-Russian parties.



Moscow has secured access to key grain markets at Ukraine's expense, but flexing its agricultural power has aggravated tensions with recipient countries. African leaders have told Putin that the war has created food insecurity: in July 2023, for instance, the Kenyan diplomat Korir Sing'Oei called Russia's withdrawal from a pact that allowed Ukraine to export grain through the Black Sea “a stab on the back.” Although Moscow has managed to leverage the sea to evade sanctions, generate revenue, and access critical technology, that effort has required developing elaborate and inefficient trading and shipping schemes, and some Black Sea countries have also sought alternative energy sources. The war in Ukraine has also forced Moscow to contend with the largest outflow of its own people since the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution.

Ukraine's success in denying sea control to Russia and inflicting heavy damage on its Black Sea Fleet has crimped Moscow's influence over nearby regions. So did Turkey's decision to close the Turkish straits to Russian military vessels days after Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Ankara has complex ties with Moscow: Turkey is a significant trading partner and purchaser of Russian oil, as well as a key transit route for Russian gas. Yet Ankara's choice to close the Turkish straits not only limited Moscow's ability to wage naval war against Ukraine; it also stopped Russia from using the sea to project naval power in the Mediterranean and the Middle East.

Moscow remains a significant player in the South Caucasus but has lost its role as the regional hegemon; Turkey now plays a much more important regional role than it did before 2022. Until 2023, Russia acted as Armenia's protector in its conflict with Azerbaijan over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, but when Azerbaijan attacked Armenia in 2023, Russia, its military overextended, did not come to Armenia's assistance. After decades of fighting, in August 2025, Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a peace agreement to end the conflict—but they signed it at the White House, not the Kremlin, highlighting the limits of Russian influence in the region. Strains to its military capabilities also forced Moscow to prioritize its war in Ukraine over its support for the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. After the ouster of Assad's regime last December, the Kremlin is scrambling to regain influence with Damascus's new leadership. It needs such influence: the loss of Russia's Khmeimim Air Base and Tartus Naval Base in Syria would complicate Moscow's efforts to expand its operations in the Mediterranean and Africa. And Russia now faces rising competition in the Black Sea and Central Asia from China and the European Union, each of which is building out its economic and political presence.

Policymakers seeking to exploit Moscow's mixed record in the Black Sea must overcome several challenges. The region's post-communist countries continue to struggle, leaving them vulnerable to Russian influence. The end of U.S. foreign assistance programs in Ukraine and other states in the region geared toward fighting corruption, supporting an independent news media, and promoting economic development, health, and good governance has left a gap that only EU and NATO allies can fill. EU accession negotiations with Moldova and Ukraine are moving slowly and face opposition from some member states.

The EU and NATO have each put forth new strategies for the region, but both face obstacles to implementation. Brussels's plan is full of good intentions but lacks concrete commitments and has no budget. NATO has focused on defending its northeastern flank, even though Russia's last three invasions have taken place in the Black Sea, not the Baltic. In the past three years, EU and NATO countries have prioritized their own resilience strategies; now they must develop plans to stabilize vulnerable Black Sea partners.

Brussels must mobilize funding to match the ambitious rhetoric it presented in May 2025 on a so-called connectivity agenda with Black Sea states and the Caucasus, Eurasia, and the Middle East. The EU should forge West-East corridors that link the Mediterranean, Black, and Caspian Seas––circumventing Russia and including Turkey, which EU plans have thus far avoided. Additionally, members of the Three Seas Initiative, which seeks to build digital, energy, and transport links between the Adriatic, Black, and Baltic Seas, should invite Ukraine and Moldova to become full members

Black Sea states should further develop their own considerable energy resources. Bulgaria, Georgia, and Romania are already constructing an underwater Black Sea energy cable that would bypass Russia and directly connect Azerbaijan's renewable energy resources to Europe's energy grid. Romania's recent offshore gas discoveries, once fully exploited, could lead Bucharest to become the EU's largest gas producer. Turkey's Sakarya gas field holds similar promise. The war has limited Ukraine's ability to exploit its gas resources, but in peacetime, EU and U.S. energy companies and international financial assistance could help the country become a major gas producer.

Turkey will be central to any strategy to prevent Russia from controlling the Black Sea. Ankara often diverges from its NATO allies on the nature of regional challenges: it has armed Ukraine and refused to recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea, for instance, but maintains lucrative commercial ties with Moscow. European and U.S. policymakers should recognize this complexity and build on shared interests such as strengthening regional supply chains and infrastructure links as well as upholding freedom of navigation and curbing Russian expansionism in the Black Sea.

Turkey opposes a formal NATO maritime presence in the sea involving countries outside its immediate coastal region. But Ankara is offering concrete material support for Bulgaria's and Romania's defense modernization efforts. By 2030, NATO plans to make its installation near Constanta, Romania, its principal Black Sea site and its largest base in Europe. The alliance could bolster its forward presence by improving air defense capabilities and deploying additional forces to its multinational battle groups in Bulgaria and Romania. NATO could rotate ships and allied maritime groups in the Black Sea complemented by regular air patrols and exercises. Enhanced intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance could better monitor Russian activities.

The United States has an interest in a Europe that is whole, free, and at peace—and thus in enhancing freedom in the Black Sea region. Strengthening U.S. support for NATO and EU initiatives can have an outsize impact at relatively low cost. Following the Trump-Putin Alaska summit, however, it is unclear whether Trump will exert pressure on Russia to end the conflict, which may continue for some time. Yet halting Moscow's expansionist aims must start with ending that war. Russia's targeting of civilian infrastructure has already pushed millions from their homes and entrenched Russian domination in occupied Ukrainian lands.

The Kremlin is likely to persist in these efforts until international actors understand that the fight for Ukraine is also a fight for the future of the Black Sea. Efforts to end the war must be paired with a robust strategy to prevent Moscow's dominance in the greater Black Sea region. North American and European policymakers should prioritize initiatives designed to improve the region's democratic governance and economic development and assure the secure production and transit of commodities. If such steps fail to stabilize the region, Russia's aggression in Ukraine may well extend to Moldova and Georgia and could even balloon into a direct confrontation with NATO states that border the Black Sea—the consequences of which would ripple across markets worldwide and threaten an even wider variety of U.S. and European interests.

            The displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip is a “red line” and Cairo will not allow any party to risk Egypt's national security or sovereignty, Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty said on Monday.
    


            In an exclusive interview with CNN in the northern Egyptian town of Al-Arish, close to the Gaza border, Abdelatty said that Egypt is working through “different channels, with one objective, to alleviate the burden and suffering of Palestinians,” adding that mass Palestinian emigration from Gaza would not be tolerated by his country.
    


            “We will not accept it, we will not participate in it, and we will not allow it to happen,” Abdelatty told CNN, adding that displacement is guaranteed to be a “one way ticket” for Palestinians out of Gaza, which would lead to the “liquidation” of their cause altogether.
    


            The Israeli government has never given a detailed vision of what will happen to Gaza after the war but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly advocated for moving Palestinians from Gaza to other countries, particularly after US President Donald Trump floated the idea early this year. But even after Trump appeared to cool on the proposal, Israeli officials have embraced it.
    


            Egypt is Gaza's only access to the outside world as Israel has blockaded the territory from the land, sea and air. Cairo has come under intense public pressure to alleviate the suffering of Palestinians and has repeatedly blamed Israel for blocking aid as thousands of trucks remain stranded at its border.
    


            Asked whether the war places the Egypt-Israel peace treaty at risk, Abdelatty said Cairo is “respecting and honoring (its) commitments according to the peace treaty,” but added that “any kind of displacement would be a big risk and we will not allow any single party to risk our national security and our sovereignty… in our border.”
    


            The minister's warnings are some of the harshest since Israel said last week that it is in talks with several countries about taking in Palestinians displaced by the war.
    


            “If the Israelis manage to displace them, I can assure you that will be the end of the Palestinian cause,” the foreign minister said.
    


            Egypt was the first Arab nation to recognize Israel in 1979.
    


Israel is in talks to possibly resettle Palestinians from Gaza in South Sudan



            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said last week  that talks are underway with several countries about taking in displaced Palestinians.
    


            The countries involved are South Sudan, Somaliland, Ethiopia, Libya, and Indonesia, a senior Israeli official told CNN. In exchange for taking in some of Gaza's population of more than two million people, the official said the countries are looking for “significant financial and international compensation.”
    


            It's unclear how advanced any of these discussions are and whether they are likely to come to fruition. South Sudan rejected earlier reports that it was in discussions about the resettlement of Palestinians, saying they were “baseless.” Indonesia said it was ready to take in 2,000 Palestinians from Gaza for treatment but that they would return to Gaza once they recovered.
    


            Earlier this year, Somaliland also said there were no such talks.
    


            Abdelatty said that while Egypt maintains contact with Israel on the security and intelligence levels, it hasn't seen a desire from the political establishment to conclude the war.
    


            “Unfortunately, we don't have a partner in Israel right now for peace and the two-state solution,” he said. “We have ministers in the Israeli cabinet right now who do not believe in the two-state solution.”
    


            Israel's far-right ministers, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, have called for an expansion of the war in Gaza and the emigration of Palestinians from the enclave, which critics have said amounts to ethnic cleansing.
    


            Abdelatty said negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage deal are, however, ongoing, adding that “we reached a sort of understanding on most of the building issues” with regards to the latest proposal submitted by US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff.
    


            Last month, the US and Israel recalled their negotiating teams from Qatar, where talks had been taking place, with Witkoff saying the latest response from Hamas “clearly shows a lack of desire to reach a ceasefire.”
    


            The Egyptian foreign minister said Cairo is in favor of a comprehensive deal that ends the war, brings back hostages, releases Palestinian prisoners and allows aid to flow in. Israel's demand to immediately disarm Hamas is, he said, an “impossible” condition at this stage of the talks.
    


            “Israel is insisting on disarming Hamas now. Who will do it? How can we do it on the ground?” he said, adding that Israel has tried to eliminate the group through a 22-month bombardment campaign and still failed.
    


            “We need to push now (for a deal),” Abdelatty said. There is currently a delegation from Hamas in Cairo, he said, and talks are ongoing with the Qataris, the Americans and the Israelis.
    


            “We can have a deal if we have political will.”
    


            On Monday, CNN saw dozens of aid trucks lining the roads to the Rafah crossing with Gaza, where many convoys have remained idle for weeks or even months, often causing essential food aid to spoil.
    


            Abdelatty said that there are 5,000 trucks on the Egyptian side of the crossing waiting to enter the blockaded strip, but that “the Israelis are not allowing them to enter.”
    


            Three truck drivers told CNN they've been waiting for more than a week for a greenlight to enter.
    


            Medhat Mohamed, a father of three, had his truck turned back Wednesday after a rejection by the Israeli military, he said, adding that he has spent the past three weeks parked along the Egyptian side of the border.
    


            “Once you're here with your truck you cannot leave,” Mohamed told CNN. “Either your aid gets approved and you leave or you stay next to your truck – that might take weeks, or even months”
    


            He said it was the little he could do to help Gaza's starving population.
    


            “This is not about money - we can get a lot of money from work in Cairo. We're here because we want to help in any way we can the people in Gaza.”
    


            Another driver, Mohamed Fawzy, told CNN he was carrying ICU beds that were rejected four times by Israeli authorities.
    


            Amal Imam, the executive director of the Egyptian Red Crescent, told CNN the beds, along with the rest of aid rejected, had received pre-approval by Israeli authorities but had been rejected for containing metals and plastic.

            In the first Trump administration, then-Rep. Adam Schiff led the House's investigations into Donald Trump, first as the top Democrat on the intelligence committee's probe into Russian election interference and then as the lead investigator of the withholding of Ukraine aid that led to the president's first impeachment.
    


            When Trump was out of office, Schiff was a member of the House committee that investigated his attempts to overturn the 2020 election and the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.
    


            Now, with Trump back in the White House and Schiff in the Senate, the president is using the full force of the federal government to try to turn the tables on his longtime nemesis.
    


            Last week, FBI Director Kash Patel declassified and released internal FBI interview notes from a former House Intelligence Committee staffer who first accused Schiff in 2017 of directing illegal leaks of classified information about Trump and Russia.
    


            The allegations from the former staffer had already been investigated in Trump's first term by federal prosecutors, who questioned the staffer's credibility. But that didn't stop Trump from using the claims as a basis to call on Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate the California Democrat.
    


            “I'm looking at Pam because I hope something's going to be done about it,” Trump said while speaking at the Kennedy Center on Wednesday. “It was a hoax created by the Democrats, but in particular, Schiff, crooked Hillary, the whole group.”
    


            And last month, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, a Trump ally, referred Schiff to the Justice Department over allegations of mortgage fraud. Schiff's lawyer blasted media reports of a grand jury investigation, calling the claims “transparently false, stale, and long debunked.”
    


            The attacks on Schiff are the latest example of how Trump and his government have carried out a campaign of retribution against a wide swath of the president's perceived political enemies, ranging from former Trump officials to members of Congress to the prosecutors who brought cases against Trump while he was out of office.
    


            CNN reported this month that the Justice Department opened a grand jury investigation into New York Attorney General Letitia James over the civil actions she brought against Trump and the National Rifle Association. That came after the Trump administration launched an investigation into allegations of mortgage fraud against James, similar to those leveled against Schiff. (James' attorney said they were “baseless and long-discredited allegations.”) Trump has called for James to be prosecuted for years, too.
    


            Trump has a long history of attacking Schiff, going back to 2017 and the Russia investigation. He's accused the California Democrat of treason and called for his prosecution on numerous occasions.
    


            Trump's calls last year to prosecute Schiff and the other members of the House January 6 committee prompted outgoing President Joe Biden to issue a preemptive pardon to everyone who served on the panel.
    


            Trump's attacks helped Schiff become a household name and a fundraising juggernaut in Democratic circles for his work investigating and impeaching Trump, leading up to his successful Senate campaign in 2024.
    


            Schiff has long embraced his role as a MAGA villain, making it clear — often through defiant speeches — that he has no intention of backing down. When House Republicans voted to censure Schiff in 2023 over his allegations about Trump and Russia, he called it a “badge of honor.”



            “Ever since I led his first impeachment, he's threatened me with jail and prosecution and called me a traitor and accused me of treason, blah, blah, blah,” Schiff said last month on CBS' “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.”
    


            “So, I just want to direct this, if this is the right camera,” he continued, turning to face the camera directly for full effect: “Donald, piss off.”
    


            Schiff is also making preparations for a legal fight. Preet Bharara, the high-powered former US attorney for the Southern District of New York, this month was named as Schiff's personal attorney, issuing a statement on Schiff's behalf earlier this month following reports that the Justice Department had tapped DOJ official Ed Martin to investigate mortgage allegations against Schiff and James.
    


            “Any supposed investigation led by him would by the very definition of weaponization of the justice process,” Bharara said.
    


            Martin, who was tapped as director of the Justice Department's Weaponization Working Group in May after his confirmation to be US attorney for the District of Columbia fizzled out, appeared Sunday on Fox News to talk about the probes, suggesting the investigations of Schiff and James could be far-reaching.
    


            “These referrals are criminal referrals significant enough that they would warrant using all the tools,” Martin said Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo.” “If somebody did something wrong, we're not only going to hold them accountable, we're also going to look at everything else that they've been doing.”
    


            The new documents declassified and publicized last week came from interviews the FBI conducted with a former intelligence committee staffer in 2017, 2019 and 2023 as part of an investigation into classified leaks. The interview notes, known as 302s, were declassified and sent to Congress last week by Patel — who himself was a senior aide on the intelligence committee in 2017 working for then-Chair Devin Nunes.
    


            The FBI notes, which were obtained by CNN, were first reported by Just the News, a site run by conservative journalist John Solomon, who along with Patel was named as Trump's representative to the National Archives in 2022.
    


            “We found it. We declassified it. Now Congress can see how classified info was leaked to shape political narratives — and decide if our institutions were weaponized against the American people,” Patel wrote on X, sharing Solomon's story.
    


            The staffer, whose name is redacted from the notes and whom CNN is not naming because he hasn't made the allegations publicly, told investigators that he believed Schiff and Democratic staffers on the committee were leaking classified information about Trump and Russia in 2017.
    


            In the 2023 interview, the staffer accused Democrats on the committee of “treasonous” activity, going further than his prior interviews. According to the notes, the staffer alleged that at a 2017 staff meeting, “Schiff stated the group would leak classified information which was derogatory to President of the United States President Donald J Trump. Schiff stated the information would be used to indict President Trump.”
    


            While these FBI interview notes contained new details about the allegations of leaks coming from the House Intelligence Committee, the staffer's allegations were already investigated by the FBI during the first Trump administration as part of a leak probe into numerous media reports containing classified intelligence from 2017.
    


            In fact, the information the staffer provided to the FBI drove the Justice Department's investigative steps in the leak probes — including obtaining the phone and email records of Schiff, California Rep. Eric Swalwell, multiple congressional staffers and their spouses, according to a Justice Department inspector general report on the investigations released last year. The Justice Department also confidentially obtained phone and email records of multiple journalists as part of the probe, including from CNN.
    


            But the inspector general found that prosecutors in the US attorney's office for the District of Columbia conducting the investigation concluded the former staffer “had little support for their contentions that certain individuals could be leaking classified information and may not have been credible.”
    


            In subsequent search warrants, the inspector general wrote, “the Department noted that the Committee Witness was of ‘unknown reliability.'”
    


            The staffer who brought the leak allegations to the FBI was fired from the committee in 2017, which he told other aides happened because “there was an expectation of leaking and he refused to participate,” according to the FBI interview notes.
    


            But a former senior congressional official with firsthand knowledge told CNN that characterization was false. The congressional official says the staffer was fired for cause stemming from travel-related incidents that dated back before 2017.
    


            The former intelligence committee staffer did not respond to CNN's requests for comment.
    


            A spokesperson for Schiff said the allegations that the California Democrat leaked classified documents were “absolutely and categorically false” and an attempt by the Trump administration to detract from the uproar over the Jeffrey Epstein files.
    


            “These baseless smears are based on allegations that were found to be not reliable, not credible, and unsubstantiated from a disgruntled former staffer who was fired by the House Intelligence Committee for cause in early 2017,” the spokesperson said.
    


            The staffer also alleged that Swalwell — a former member of the intelligence committee who was removed from the panel with Schiff in 2023 by then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy — was a source of leaks from the committee.
    


            “A particularly sensitive document … viewed by a small contingent of staff, as well as Schiff and Representative Eric Swalwell,” the staffer told the FBI, according to the 302s. “Within 24 hours of (the House Intelligence Committee) reviewing the document the information contained in the document appeared in the press.”
    


            Asked about the allegations, Swalwell shared with CNN text messages that the staffer sent years later in 2021, saying that he hoped the California Democrat stayed on the intelligence committee and requesting to be connected to Swalwell's political staff.
    


            “This is an effort by Kash Patel — who listed me as his top enemy in his book — to try and silence me. It won't work,” Swalwell said.
    


            The leak investigations from 2017 were ultimately closed with no charges filed, according to the inspector general.
    


            The FBI's decision, beginning in 2017, to secretly obtain the records of members of Congress, congressional staffers and reporters sparked outrage when it was disclosed in 2021 — including from Patel himself, who was also a Republican staffer on the committee when his records were secretly obtained.
    


            Patel filed a lawsuit in 2023 over the move against Trump's prior top DOJ and FBI appointees, including former FBI Director Christopher Wray. The suit was dismissed by a federal judge last fall.

            Texas House Democrats who fled their state to stall a Republican redistricting effort returned on Monday, ending their 15-day holdout.
    


            Once the Democrats return to the Texas Capitol in Austin, the GOP-dominated legislature will have the two-thirds quorum necessary to advance new congressional maps aimed at creating five more Republican-leaning seats ahead of next year's midterm elections.
    


            A plane carrying Democrats who departed Chicago on Monday morning landed in Austin a little more than an hour before the Texas House was set to reconvene, a source familiar with the matter said.
    


            Democrats had fled to blue states — including Illinois, New York and Massachusetts — as they faced civil arrest warrants pushed by GOP officials in Texas to force them back into the House chamber.
    


            “We killed the corrupt special session, withstood unprecedented surveillance and intimidation, and rallied Democrats nationwide to join this existential fight for fair representation — reshaping the entire 2026 landscape,” said state Rep. Gene Wu, who leads Democrats in the Texas House.
    


            “We're returning to Texas more dangerous to Republicans' plans than when we left. Our return allows us to build the legal record necessary to defeat this racist map in court, take our message to communities across the state and country, and inspire legislators across the country how to fight these undemocratic redistricting schemes in their own statehouses.”
    


            At President Donald Trump's urging, Gov. Greg Abbott and Republicans who control the state House and Senate launched the effort to redraw the state's congressional districts mid-decade — a break from most states' typical practice of redistricting once a decade, after the completion of the US Census.
    


            It's part of the party's effort to hold onto its narrow House majority in next year's midterm elections — one that also includes lobbying GOP officials in Indiana and Missouri to change their maps to turn Democratic-held seats into favorable ground for Republicans, and could see the party add more GOP-leaning seats in Ohio, which is required by state law to redistrict.
    


            The Texas effort has set off a nationwide gerrymandering arms race. In California, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has vowed retribution, proposing a measure that would trigger new maps that could help Democrats pick up five more seats in the state — but only if Texas moves forward with its redistricting plan.
    


            Texas House Democrats had laid out two conditions to return to the state. California would have to introduce its proposed new maps to neutralize the Texas effort, they said, and Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows would have to adjourn the first special session Abbott had called. Both of those conditions were met on Friday.
    


            Abbott called a second special session, which began immediately after the adjournment of the first one. But the House is blocked from doing business until enough Democrats return to the chamber to provide the quorum required under its rules.
    


            This week marks a flashpoint in an escalating and unprecedented fight over redistricting, with the country's two most populous states taking center stage and control of the US House during the second half of Trump's term potentially at stake.
    


            California Democratic lawmakers could take just three days to advance new congressional maps intended to offset Republican redistricting efforts in Texas.
    


            Legislation asking voters to approve the new maps is expected to be introduced Monday when lawmakers return to Sacramento from their summer recess, with final passage as early as Thursday, according to a person familiar with the Democratic planning. It will be heard in several committees along the way.
    


            In pushing Texas and other states to redraw their congressional lines mid-decade, Republicans have undertaken extraordinary efforts to preserve their unified hold on power in Washington, prompting Democrats to consider equally unorthodox countermeasures.
    


            Texas House Democrats have said they plan to fight the redistricting bill on the floor, laying out their case against the measure ahead of expected legal challenges in the coming months.
    


            They argue they brought national attention to the GOP-led redistricting in Texas and helped create the momentum for California's counteroffensive and calls in New York and other Democratic-led states to redraw their maps.
    


            But their options to stop Republicans were always limited, short of staying out of Texas for the next year-plus. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott vowed that he would keep calling special sessions until the new maps passed.
    


            Once a quorum is met, the legislative process to approve the congressional maps will kick off, including consideration in the redistricting committee and debate and votes on the floor. The state Senate, which passed a redistricting bill in the first special session, will go through a similar process. The Senate's redistricting committee approved the map on Sunday night after holding a public hearing on the issue.
    


            The GOP's proposal would create five new districts friendlier to Trump and Republicans ahead of the midterm elections. It would likely force Democratic US Reps. Greg Casar and Lloyd Doggett to run against each other in a redrawn district.
    


            GOP leaders have not laid out a timeline for final passage of the new map, but it could come as soon as this week.
    


            When California lawmakers return from their summer recess on Monday, Democrats there will take the first step toward redrawing congressional boundaries to give them a greater chance at winning five additional seats — an extraordinary move intended to counteract Texas' mid-decade redistricting.
    


            Unlike in Texas, the legislation under consideration will also require voter approval to override a constitutionally mandated independent redistricting commission. Lawmakers will have to move quickly; the California secretary of state's office gave the legislature a Friday deadline to make the November ballot, and bills must be in print for 72 hours before they can be voted on.
    


            Democrats are expected to formally introduce the legislation Monday, with final passage pegged for Thursday. Because lawmakers are proposing to change the state constitution, two-thirds of each chamber must vote in favor of it to pass. Democrats hold three-quarters of the seats in both chambers.
    


            The State Assembly returns at 1 p.m. PT (4 p.m. ET). The State Senate reconvenes an hour later.
    


            California Republicans, who have little power in Sacramento to slow the redistricting push, are nevertheless closely monitoring how Democrats proceed. GOP lawmakers are anticipating Democrats will put forward a package of legislative proposals that will not only advance the new maps but also outline how they intend to hold and pay for a statewide election in less than three months, a person close to the Republican caucus told CNN.
    


            Gov. Gavin Newsom, a likely contender for the Democrats' presidential 2028 nomination, is already planning for a statewide campaign to support a referendum. A victory could help Democrats win back the US House next year and give Newsom a boost in the next presidential primary.
    


            But some significant opposition to the proposed referendum is already forming. Former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger on Friday posted a picture of himself working out while wearing a T-shirt that said “F*** the politicians/Terminate gerrymandering.” The caption read: “I'm getting ready for the gerrymandering battle.”
    


            Charles Munger Jr., the son of the late Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman, has signaled he intends to fight the Democratic-led initiative. Munger spent more than $12 million in 2010 to entrench the independent redistricting commission in the state constitution, and he will fight any efforts to circumvent it, his spokeswoman Amy Thoma Tan said in a statement responding to California Democrats on Thursday.
    


            “Two wrongs do not make a right, and California shouldn't stoop to the same tactics as Texas,” Thoma Tan said. “Instead, we should push other states to adopt our independent, non-partisan commission model across the country. That's how we can protect and defend democracy.”
    


            Newsom's approach has also led to a divide among good government groups that have traditionally opposed gerrymandering. While the League of Women Voters continues to urge California lawmakers to reject the redistricting push, leaders at Common Cause have said they will not proactively reject “counterbalancing” efforts done in response to other states. The group said Wednesday it would not oppose redistricting pushes that are proportional responses to other states, involve public participation and have a set expiration date, among other criteria.
    


            Leaders at the organization said they would determine whether to oppose the California push after the full proposal has been released and judged against its rubric.
    


            “We welcome the governor to adopt our fairness criteria,” said Omar Noureldin, the organization's senior vice president of policy and litigation strategy. “And if the maps that are proposed in the process that's laid out in its totality meet that fairness criteria, then we won't oppose it.”

[Breaking news update, published at 12:33 p.m. ET]



            The court hearing on behalf of detainees held at the controversial makeshift immigration detention center dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” seeking to allow them to meet with attorneys, ended Monday without an immediate ruling from the judge.
    


            The judge said he would rule as soon as possible.
    


[Original story, published at 10:13 a.m. ET]



            A court hearing on behalf of detainees held at the controversial makeshift immigration detention center dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” seeking to allow them to meet with attorneys has begun.
    


            The hearing began at 10 a.m. ET.
    


            The attorneys from groups including the ACLU, the US Immigration Law Counsel and Florida Keys Immigration filed a lawsuit against Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and other officials in July, saying the defendants “blocked detainees held at the facility from access to legal counsel” and are preventing “people detained in civil immigration custody at Alligator Alcatraz from communicating with legal counsel and from filing motions with the immigration court that could result in their release from detention.”
    


            The lawsuit also aims to ensure there is updated information about the location of the detainees at “Alligator Alcatraz.”
    


            “The U.S. Constitution does not allow the government to simply lock people away without any ability to communicate with counsel or to petition the court for release from custody. The government may not trample on these most fundamental protections for people held in its custody,” Eunice Cho, senior counsel with the ACLU's National Prison Project and the lead attorney in the case, said in a news release.
    


            The Department of Homeland Security has denied the allegations, telling CNN in a statement Sunday the “facility maintains a physical space for attorneys to meet with their clients,” and that attorneys may also request to speak with detainees they represent via email.
    


            At a hearing last month, attorneys for the ACLU urged the judge to move forward with the lawsuit as quickly as possible, alleging that staff at the detention center were pushing the detainees to self-deport without access to counsel.  The ACLU also reminded the court that “removal flights” from the facility had already taken place.
    


            “The government has banned in-person legal visitation, any confidential phone or video communication, and confidential exchange of written documents,” the ACLU said in the news release about the lawsuit, describing several instances of attorneys turned away after attempting to meet with their clients.
    


What we know about the lawsuits that could shut down ‘Alligator Alcatraz'



            Monday's hearing in Miami, Florida, is the latest in the case against the federal and state officials whose attorneys have argued the lawsuits were not filed in the correct federal court district.
    


            US District Judge Rodolfo Ruiz II, who was nominated by President Donald Trump, appeared skeptical of those arguments. The judge also said there was “confusion” about who runs the detention camp.
    


            “Alligator Alcatraz” is purportedly run by the state of Florida under a partnership with local agencies and the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement under a federal program known as the 287(g) program.
    


            Deep in the marshy wetlands of the Florida Everglades, “Alligator Alcatraz” has been mired with controversy since the start, with reports of hundreds of migrants confined in cages amid sweltering heat, bug infestations and meager meals.
    


            “What is happening at the facility is anomalous for many reasons, not only the way that it was built and where it's been built, the legal authority and the confusion about who is running the detention facility and whose custody people are in,” Cho told CNN. “These are all things that have never really been seen at other detention facilities.”
    


            The state of Florida has pushed back, saying conditions at the camp are in “good working order” and that claims to the contrary are false.
    


            Cho explained the goal of their case is make sure “basic constitutional rights” of detainees are being upheld, including the “basic right to be able to speak to their lawyers and the basic right to be able to petition the government for release from custody.”
    


            Other alleged violations of constitutional rights include officers “pressuring detainees to sign voluntary removal orders without the opportunity to speak to counsel,” said Cho, and a detainee who was deported after their bond hearing was canceled because immigration courts said they don't have jurisdiction over people who are held in “Alligator Alcatraz.”
    


            “These are fundamental constitutional rights, and the fact that it's been happening for such a long time has had a huge impact on the people who are being held at this facility,” Cho said.
    


            “Alligator Alcatraz cannot end up being a black hole where people disappear.”
    


            The hastily built detention center is about an hour's drive west of Miami. The temporary camp is built on an airstrip and made up of repurposed FEMA trailers and tents, surrounded by a fence.
    


            This lawsuit against the facility is one of two working its way through the federal court system – the other was filed by environmentalists suing to stop the facility's operations due to its close location to the marshlands that serve as a crucial source of freshwater and drinking water for South Florida.
    


            On Thursday, DeSantis announced a new immigrant detention center called “Deportation Depot” in northern Florida. The facility will likely be ready in about two to three weeks, Florida Division of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie said, and it is expected to house around 1,300 detainees.
    


This is a developing story and will be updated.

            Hurricane Erin is a sprawling Category 4 storm churning in the Atlantic Monday after exploding in strength at a historic rate this weekend.
    


            The storm's enormous footprint is becoming the biggest concern as it brings heavy rain and gusty winds to islands far from its center and threatens to drive life-threatening rip currents and towering waves toward the eastern US coastline and Bermuda, all without making landfall.
    


            Erin's outer rain bands lashed Puerto Rico over the weekend, triggering flash flooding and power outages, and started impacting the southeast Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands early Monday. Rough seas and large swells from the hurricane will reach much of the US East Coast and Bermuda starting Tuesday, with conditions expected to worsen through midweek.
    


            North Carolina's Outer Banks is one region that could get hit particularly hard.
    


            “Even though Erin is expected to remain far offshore, the threat to life from rip currents and high surf along our beaches is very real,” the National Weather Service office in Morehead City, North Carolina, warned.
    


            Erin is forecast to curve north-northeast between the US East Coast and Bermuda this week, remaining out over the water but growing even larger in size. The hurricane's influence will be felt not through direct landfall, but through water: large, pounding surf, dangerous currents and coastal flooding during high tides.
    


            Erin will remain a powerful major hurricane – Category 3 or greater – through at least midweek.
    


            On Sunday, Dare County in North Carolina — home to much of the Outer Banks — issued a local state of emergency, which includes a mandatory evacuation order for Hatteras Island.
    


            “Portions of N.C. Highway 12 on Hatteras Island will likely be impassable for several days,” a county news release warned, noting coastal flooding and ocean overwash are expected from Tuesday through Thursday.
    


            Nearby Hyde County also issued a local state of emergency and mandatory evacuation order for Ocracoke Island “due to the anticipated flooding impacts,” according to a Sunday news release.
    


            Extensive beach erosion is likely, with waves of 20 feet or more forecast this week, according to the National Weather Service. Erosion is a huge hazard for the Outer Banks' beachfront homes.
    


            Multiple homes have collapsed into the ocean in recent years, including at least three around this time last year from Hurricane Ernesto's waves. At least two homes in Rodanthe are “very, very vulnerable” to collapse this week, Cape Hatteras National Seashore Superintendent Dave Hallac told CNN affiliate WRAL.
    


            The rip current risk will climb sharply Tuesday through Thursday from Florida to New England – even under sunny skies.
    


            So far this year, 44 people have died from rip currents and other surf-zone hazards in the US, according to the National Weather Service. Rip currents usually take more lives each year than lightning, hurricanes and tornadoes combined, the service says, behind only heat and flooding.
    


            With peak summer crowds still flocking to the coast, officials are urging beachgoers to stay out of the water when rip current alerts are in effect.
    


            “This is not the week to swim in the ocean,” Dare County Emergency Management said in its evacuation order. “The risk from surf and flooding will be life-threatening.”
    


            The outer bands of Erin continue to produce rain in Puerto Rico, with up to 2 additional inches possible through Monday night, according to the National Hurricane Center.
    


            A flood watch remains in effect for the island through Monday evening, according to the National Weather Service. Erin left 100,000 people without power, Gov. Jenniffer González-Colón said Sunday.
    


            Additional rainfall of up to 6 inches is forecast over the Turks and Caicos and the eastern Bahamas through Tuesday, according to the hurricane center. Flash flooding, landslides and mudslides are possible.
    


            Tropical storm warnings are in effect for the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeast Bahamas. A tropical storm watch is in place for the central Bahamas.
    


            Bermuda also lies in Erin's path of influence, with forecasters expecting the island to see very rough seas and possibly tropical storm–force winds later this week.
    


            Erin's impact began over the weekend, when it logged one of the fastest rapid intensification bursts on record in the Atlantic. In just over a day, the storm jumped from a tropical storm to a Category 5 hurricane, peaking at 160 mph on Saturday as it feasted on exceptionally warm water and favorable atmospheric conditions.
    


            It then eased to Category 3 while undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle – a structural reset where a new, larger eyewall forms and steals energy from the old one. Winds dip during the swap, but the storm usually grows in size.
    


            When the eyewall replacement finished, Erin re-intensified to Category 4, with a larger wind field.
    


            The hurricane's rapid intensification over the weekend was a stark reminder of how quickly storms can strengthen in a warming climate. It's also unusual to see a Category 5 storm form so early in the season, particularly outside of the Gulf or Caribbean.
    


            Erin is the Atlantic's first hurricane of the season. Four other systems roamed the Atlantic basin before Erin — Andrea, Barry, Chantal and Dexter — but none were stronger than a tropical storm.
    


            The hurricane center has already identified a tropical wave behind Erin that has a medium chance of developing into a tropical depression or tropical storm within the next seven days. It's too early to say whether this system will materialize or where it may go, but forecasters are watching it closely.
    


            Despite Erin churning up cooler waters beneath the surface, there's still plenty of warm water for storms to tap into as sea surface temperatures remain well above average. They aren't quite as warm as the record levels reached in 2023 and 2024, but are still far warmer than they'd be in a world that wasn't heating up.
    


            August is when the tropics usually come alive: The busiest stretch of the season typically spans from mid-August to mid-October. Forecasters expect above-average tropical activity this year.

WASHINGTON (AP) — When the Food and Drug Administration needs outside guidance, it normally turns to a trusted source: a large roster of expert advisers who are carefully vetted for their independence, credentials and judgment.

But increasingly, the agency isn't calling them.

Instead, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary has launched a series of ad hoc “expert panels” to discuss antidepressants, menopause drugs and other topics with physicians and researchers who often have contrarian views and financial interests in the subjects.

Former agency officials worry the meetings are skirting federal rules on conflicts of interests and transparency, while promoting fringe viewpoints that align with those of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

“These meetings are a chance to advance RFK's pet peeves — talc, antidepressants, fluoride — with people who have been handpicked,” said Dr. Peter Lurie, a former FDA official who is now president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest. “Nobody would put forward these panels as representing the general scientific opinion on these topics.”

A spokesperson for Kennedy did not answer specific questions about the panels, but said they represent an effort to “apply rigorous, evidence-based standards to ingredient safety and modernize regulatory oversight.”

The panels kicked off in May with a meeting on talc, the soft mineral sometimes added to makeup, baby powder and other consumer goods. The meeting echoed thousands of lawsuits alleging talc has contributed to ovarian cancer and other illnesses, and included two experts who testified in those cases.




Under FDA regulations, the ingredient is still considered safe when carefully tested for the presence of asbestos. And federally funded studies haven't shown a link to cancer.

A July meeting on the safety of antidepressants during pregnancy also featured doctors who have testified in class action lawsuits, alongside other experts who allege the drugs cause autism, birth defects and other conditions — links that are not supported by science.

The meeting concluded with all but one of the experts calling for a new boxed warning — the most serious type — about antidepressant risks for mothers and developing babies.

A meeting on estrogen-based drugs for menopause took the opposite approach: Experts urged the removal of a long-standing warning.

Most of the physicians at that meeting prescribe the hormones or are involved with a pharmaceutical industry campaign opposing the warning label.

Nearly 80 researchers sent a letter to the FDA this month objecting to the “two-hour meeting of hormone proponents” and calling for an official advisory committee meeting.

The FDA has more than 30 panels composed of experts specializing in various drugs, vaccines, food ingredients and other products.

Their meetings are subject to strict government transparency rules in terms of scheduling, panel composition and disclosure of any financial conflicts. A comment period open to the public is also required. Additionally, FDA scientists usually publish a detailed memo explaining their position on the topic. 

The latest FDA meetings haven't included those elements.

Former FDA lawyers say the agency could expose itself to legal challenges if it tries to use Makary's informal panels as the basis for regulatory decisions.

But that may not be the aim of the meetings.

“They seem more designed as a forum to put a stamp of approval on predetermined opinions,” said Genevieve Kanter, a health policy specialist at the University of Southern California. “The information in these panels could be used in litigation and presented as coming from experts or representing some intellectual consensus that doesn't exist.”

Antidepressants have long been a target of Kennedy, an attorney and outspoken critic of pharmaceutical companies. During his confirmation hearings he suggested, without evidence, that the drugs contribute to school shootings.

The FDA's recent session cataloged many unsubstantiated theories about the drugs, often based on animal studies, including that they contribute to autism, birth defects and miscarriages.

Several participants had served as expert witnesses against drugmakers, including in lawsuits alleging that they cause homicidal behavior. All but one of the other panelists have criticized the drugs in books, articles, interviews or other forums.

“It's never been possible to identify a group of people who do particularly well on antidepressants,” said Dr. Joanna Moncrieff, a British psychiatrist, author and co-founder a group critical of mainstream psychiatric medicine.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists called the panel “alarmingly unbalanced” and full of “outlandish and unfounded claims.”

Antidepressants carry pregnancy warnings about risks of excess bleeding and lower birth weight for newborns.

But psychiatric experts say those risks are far outweighed by the well-documented harms of untreated depression in mothers, which can lead to pregnancy complications, substance abuse and suicide.

“I tell people I'm working with that the best thing they can do for themselves and their baby is to get the treatment that they need,” said Dr. Nancy Byatt of University of Massachusetts' Chan Medical School.

FDA has not disclosed how panelists were selected for the meetings. Last month's session on hormone therapies for menopause included doctors who consult for drugmakers or promote the medications in their practices.

The views they expressed largely echoed those of Makary, who has argued that current warning labels overstate hormone therapy risks and don't reflect possible benefits for some women, such as reducing heart disease and cognitive decline.

“Hormone replacement therapy for women is basically a modern-day miracle,” Makary told a podcast host last year.

But guidance from the FDA and other top federal authorities specifically advises against using the drugs to prevent chronic conditions due to a lack of clear benefit. The drugs are only FDA-approved for specific menopause symptoms, including hot flashes.

Discussions around hormone therapy reflect ongoing debate about a landmark study of two different hormone regimens in more than 26,000 postmenopausal women. The research was halted more than 20 years ago because scientists discovered that the risk of serious health problems outweighed the benefits. All estrogen drugs still carry boxed warnings about the higher rates of stroke, blood clots and cognitive problems among women taking the medications.

But some doctors — including those at FDA's meeting — say the warnings are exaggerated and should be removed from at least some products, such as low-dose creams typically used for vaginal dryness. Makary raised the possibility of also removing the warning from higher-dose pills, patches and sprays.

It's unclear whether the FDA will move ahead with those changes or heed calls for an official advisory meeting — a step that Kennedy's critics say would be in keeping with his pledge for “radical transparency.”

“If you really wanted to be transparent about these issues you'd put together a balanced panel of experts, who have been carefully screened for conflicts and you'd invite the public in,” Lurie said. “But that's the antithesis of what's going on in these cases.”

NEW YORK (AP) — Russian leader Vladimir Putin agreed at his summit with President Donald Trump that the United States and its European allies could offer Ukraine a security guarantee resembling NATO's collective defense mandate as part of an eventual deal to end the war, a U.S. official said Sunday.

Trump envoy Steve Witkoff, who took part in the talks Friday at a military base in Alaska, said it “was the first time we had ever heard the Russians agree to that” and called it “game-changing.”

“We were able to win the following concession: that the United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in NATO,” Witkoff told CNN's “State of the Union.” 

Witkoff offered few details on how such an arrangement would work. But it appeared to be a major shift for Putin and could serve as a workaround to his deep-seated objection to Ukraine's potential NATO membership, a step that Kyiv has long sought.

It was expected to be a key topic Monday as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and major European leaders meet with Trump at the White House to discuss ending the 3 1/2-year conflict.

“BIG PROGRESS ON RUSSIA,” Trump said Sunday on social media. “STAY TUNED!”

On Sunday night, however, Trump seemed to put the onus on Zelenskyy to agree to concessions.

“President Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight,” he wrote. “Remember how it started. No getting back Obama given Crimea (12 years ago, without a shot being fired!), and NO GOING INTO NATO BY UKRAINE. Some things never change!!!”




Article 5, the heart of the 32-member transatlantic military alliance, says an armed attack against a member nation is considered an attack against them all.

What needed to be hammered out at this week's talks were the contours of any security guarantees, said Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who also participated in the summit. Ukraine and European allies have pushed the U.S. to provide that backstop in any peace agreement to deter future attacks by Moscow.

“How that's constructed, what we call it, how it's built, what guarantees are built into it that are enforceable, that's what we'll be talking about over the next few days with our partners,” Rubio said on NBC's “Meet the Press.” 

It was unclear, however, whether Trump had fully committed to such a guarantee. Rubio said it would be “a huge concession.”

The comments shed new light on what was discussed in Alaska. Before Sunday, U.S. officials had offered few details even as both Trump and Putin said their meeting was a success.

Witkoff also said Russia had agreed to enact a law that it would not “go after any other European countries and violate their sovereignty.”

“The Russians agreed on enshrining legislatively language that would prevent them from — or that they would attest to not attempting to take any more land from Ukraine after a peace deal, where they would attest to not violating any European borders,” he said on “Fox News Sunday.”

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, speaking in Brussels alongside Zelenskyy, applauded the news from the White House as a European coalition looks to set up a force to police any future peace in Ukraine.

“We welcome President Trump's willingness to contribute to Article 5-like security guarantees for Ukraine and the ‘coalition of the willing' — including the European Union — is ready to do its share,” she said.

Zelenskyy thanked the U.S. for signaling that it was willing to support such guarantees but said much remained unclear.

“There are no details how it will work, and what America's role will be, Europe's role will be and what the EU can do — and this is our main task: We need security to work in practice like Article 5 of NATO,” he said.

French President Emmanuel Macron said the substance of security guarantees to secure any peace arrangement will be more important than whether they are given an Article 5-type label.

At the White House meeting, Macron said European leaders will ask the U.S. to back their plans to beef up Ukraine's armed forces with more training and equipment and deploy an allied force away from the front lines.

“We'll show this to our American colleagues, and we'll tell them, ‘Right, we're ready to do this and that, what are you prepared to do?'” Macron said. “That's the security guarantee.”

Witkoff and Rubio defended Trump's decision to abandon a push for a ceasefire, arguing that the Republican president had pivoted toward a full peace agreement because so much progress had been made at the summit.

“We covered almost all the other issues necessary for a peace deal,” Witkoff said, without elaborating. “We began to see some moderation in the way they're thinking about getting to a final peace deal.”

Rubio, appearing on several TV news shows Sunday, said it would have been impossible to reach any truce Friday because Ukraine was not there.

“Now, ultimately, if there isn't a peace agreement, if there isn't an end of this war, the president's been clear, there are going to be consequences,” Rubio said on ABC's “This Week.” “But we're trying to avoid that.”

Rubio, who is also Trump's national security adviser, also voiced caution on the progress made.

“We're still a long ways off,” he said. “We're not at the precipice of a peace agreement. We're not at the edge of one. But I do think progress was made towards one.”

Among the issues expected to dominate Monday's meeting: What concessions Zelenskyy might accept on territory.

In talks with European allies after the summit, Trump said Putin reiterated that he wants the Donetsk and Luhansk regions that make up the Donbas, European officials said. It was unclear among those briefed whether Trump sees that as acceptable.

Witkoff said the Russians have made clear they want territory as determined by legal boundaries instead of the front lines where territory has been seized.

“There is an important discussion to be had with regard to Donetsk and what would happen there. And that discussion is going to specifically be detailed on Monday,” he said.

Zelenskyy has rejected Putin's demands that Ukraine give up the Donbas region, which Russia has failed to take completely, as a condition for peace.

In Brussels, the Ukrainian leader said any talks involving land must be based on current front lines, suggesting he will not abandon land that Russia has not taken.

“The contact line is the best line for talking, and the Europeans support this,” he said. “The constitution of Ukraine makes it impossible, impossible to give up territory or trade land.”

OWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) — The numbers Scottie Scheffler is compiling have been drawing comparisons with Tiger Woods. The world's No. 1 player had a Tiger-like moment with the trophy on the line and a club in his hand Sunday in the BMW Championship.

His 82-foot chip on the 17th — the hardest hole in the final round at Caves Valley — landed about 60 feet short and rolled the rest of the way, picking up speed, losing speed dropping on the final turn. The birdie all but wrapped up another win, his fifth PGA Tour title this year.

It was reminiscent of Woods delivering magic to overshadow his sublime skill, his chip-in from behind the 16th green at the Memorial, his chip-in for eagle in the World Cup in Japan. 

Scheffler already had erased a four-shot deficit against hard-luck Robert MacIntyre in five holes. He was clinging to a one-shot lead on the 17th, a daunting par 3 with a back right pin and water right. 

Scheffler was in the left rough, the safe spot, facing a shot that a dozen players had chipped over the green.

“I knew it was just going to be really fast, and do my best to get it down there and give myself a good look for par,” he said. “When it came out, it came out how we wanted to and then it started breaking and it started looking better and better.

“And yeah, it was definitely nice to see that one go in.”

Scheffler closed with a 3-under 67 for a two-shot victory and became the first player since Woods — there's that name again — in 2006 and 2007 to win at least five times on the PGA Tour in consecutive years.




MacIntyre didn't make a birdie until the 16th hole but stayed in the game after losing his big lead, mostly when Scheffler began missing short putts. 

MacIntyre pulled within one shot of the lead going to the 17th when Scheffler worked his magic and had to settle for another runner-up finish to a memorable shot, just like he did at Oakmont when J.J. Spaun holed a 65-foot birdie putt to clinch the U.S. Open.

MacIntyre was in the scoring room when he watched Spaun and applauded it. He was alongside Scheffler at the BMW Championship, staring in disbelief but angry at his poor play off the tee that cost him the big lead early.

“When he's pitched that in on 17 and then he's hit the perfect tee shot on 18, it's pretty much game over just then. You're playing for second place at that point,” MacIntyre said.

“He's the better player on the day. I'm just really pissed off right now,” he said. “Right now I want go and smash up my golf clubs, to be honest with you.”

MacIntyre made 18 birdies in the first 45 holes of the tournament and only two over the last 27 holes. He closed with a 73 and got some consolation prizes that didn't mean much in the moment. He cracked the top 10 in the world for the first time, going to No. 8. 

Scheffler's chip-in elicited the loudest cheer of the day. The most satisfying shot came on the 15th, when his lead was down to one shot after a three-putt. MacIntyre from the fairway hit into 7 feet. Scheffler was in a deep bunker and hit 8-iron to 6 feet.

MacIntyre missed. Scheffler made.

“That was a really important shot in the tournament, one that I think will fly a little bit under the radar,” he said.

The season is not over for Scheffler, who leads the 30 players who advanced to the Tour Championship at East Lake with a chance to become the first repeat FedEx Cup champion since the series began in 2007.

All 30 players at East Lake can win the $10 million first-place check. The field includes Harry Hall, the only player who played his way into the top 30 on Sunday, and even that was tense. Hall made bogey on the par-5 16th — the easiest hole on the course — and then went long and left at the 17th. He also chipped in for birdie and was safe going up the 18th.

Rickie Fowler was on the verge of getting back to East Lake only to twice miss the green from the fairway on the back nine, leading to bogey on the 14th and double bogey on the 15th, and knocked him out of the top 30.

Fowler finished with a 5-foot par putt — had he missed, Michael Kim would have been in the Tour Championship. Instead, the 30th spot went to Akshay Bhatia, despite making four bogeys on the back nine and feeling as though he had blown it.

MacIntyre squandered a big chance, too.

He showed plenty of grit on Saturday playing in the final group with Scheffler. But on the opening hole, Scheffler drilled his drive down the middle and hit to 6 feet for birdie, while MacIntyre missed the fairway and a 6-foot par putt. It was an early statement.

MacIntyre missed another fairway at the second and made bogey. He went from the fairway to a bunker on the short par-4 fifth, a two-shot swing when the Scotsman failed to get up-and-down for par and Scheffler made birdie.

And then Scheffler took the lead with a wedge to 6 feet for birdie on No. 7.

It looked like it would be a runaway at that point as Scheffler never seemed to miss — except when he had a chance to extend the lead. He missed birdie chances of 5 feet at No. 8 and 8 feet at No. 10. He botched a simple up-and-down at the 12th and three-putted from 18 feet on the 14th. Each chance kept MacIntyre in the hunt.

And then came one chip on the 17th, a knockout punch.

Scheffler, who finished at 15-under 265, has 18 career titles in the last three years and six months since his first PGA Tour title in Phoenix.

Israeli strikes continued across Gaza on Monday even as Egyptian and Qatari mediators began holding talks with Hamas in their latest effort to broker a ceasefire in the Strip. The Health Ministry in Gaza meanwhile said the Palestinian death toll from 22 months of war has passed 62,000.

Egyptian Foreign Minister Bader Abdelattay said on Monday that his Qatari counterpart Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani arrived in Cairo and joined talks on restarting ceasefire negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

RAFAH, Egypt (AP) — Hamas said Monday it has accepted a new proposal from Arab mediators for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip that would still need Israel's approval, as Gaza's Health Ministry said the Palestinian death toll from 22 months of war has passed 62,000.

U.S. President Donald Trump meanwhile appeared to cast doubt on the long-running negotiations that Washington has mediated as well. “We will only see the return of the remaining hostages when Hamas is confronted and destroyed!!! The sooner this takes place, the better the chances of success will be,” he posted on social media.

Israel announced plans to reoccupy Gaza City and other heavily populated areas after ceasefire talks appeared to break down last month, raising the possibility of a worsening humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, which experts say is sliding into famine.

Plans to expand the offensive, in part aimed at pressuring Hamas, have sparked international outrage and infuriated many Israelis who fear for the remaining hostages taken in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that started the war. Hundreds of thousands took part in mass protests on Sunday calling for their return.




Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty said mediators are “exerting extensive efforts” to revive a U.S. proposal for a 60-day ceasefire, during which some of the remaining 50 hostages would be released and the sides would negotiate a lasting ceasefire and the return of the rest.

Abdelatty told The Associated Press they are inviting U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff to join the ceasefire talks.

Abdelatty spoke to journalists during a visit to Egypt's Rafah crossing with Gaza, which has not functioned since Israel seized the Palestinian side in May 2024. He was accompanied by Mohammad Mustafa, the prime minister of the Palestinian Authority, which has been largely sidelined since the war began.

Abdelatty said Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani had joined the talks, which include senior Hamas leader Khalil al-Hayya, who arrived in Cairo last week. Abdelatty said they are open to other ideas, including for a comprehensive deal that would release all the hostages at once.

Bassem Naim, a senior Hamas official, told the AP that the militant group had accepted the proposal introduced by the mediators, without elaborating.

An Egyptian official, speaking to the AP on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive talks, said the proposal includes changes to Israel's pullback of its forces and guarantees for negotiations on a lasting ceasefire during the initial truce. The official said it is almost identical to an earlier proposal accepted by Israel, which has not yet joined the latest talks.

Diaa Rashwan, head of the Egypt State Information Service, told the AP that Egypt and Qatar have sent the Hamas-accepted proposal to Israel.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video addressing the Israeli public that reports of Hamas' acceptance of the proposal showed that it is “under massive pressure.”

Netanyahu has vowed to continue the war until all the hostages are returned and Hamas has been disarmed, and to maintain lasting security control over Gaza. Hamas has said it will only release the remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal.

Hamas-led militants abducted 251 people and killed around 1,200, mostly civilians, in the attack that ignited the war. Around 20 of the hostages still in Gaza are believed by Israel to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefires or other deals.

Gaza's Health Ministry said the Palestinian death toll from the war had climbed to 62,004, with another 156,230 people wounded. It does not say how many were civilians or combatants, but says women and children make up around half the dead.

The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals. The U.N. and many independent experts consider its figures to be the most reliable estimate of wartime casualties. Israel disputes its toll but has not provided its own.

The ministry said 1,965 people have been killed while seeking humanitarian aid since May, either in the chaos around U.N. convoys or while heading to sites operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, an Israeli-backed American contractor.

Witnesses, health officials and the U.N. human rights office say Israeli forces have repeatedly fired toward crowds of people seeking aid. Israel says it has only fired warning shots at people who approached its forces. GHF says its armed contractors have only used pepper spray or fired into the air on rare occasions to prevent deadly crowding.

Experts have warned that Israel's ongoing offensive is pushing Gaza toward famine, even after it eased a complete 2 1/2-month blockade on the territory in May. Gaza's Health Ministry said Monday that five more people, including two children, died of malnutrition-related causes.

It says at least 112 children have died of malnutrition-related causes since the war began, and 151 adults have died since the ministry started tracking adult malnutrition deaths in June.

Amnesty International on Monday accused Israel of “carrying out a deliberate campaign of starvation.”

Israel has rejected such allegations, saying it allows in enough food and accusing the U.N. of failing to promptly deliver it. U.N. agencies say they are hindered by Israeli restrictions and the breakdown of law and order in the territory, around three-quarters of which is now controlled by Israel.

In a separate development, far-right Israeli lawmaker Simcha Rothman accused Australia of antisemitism after it denied him a visa for a speaking tour. Rothman is a member of the Religious Zionism party, which supports the continuation of the war, the mass relocation of Palestinians through what it describes as voluntary migration and the reestablishment of Jewish settlements in Gaza.

“The Australian government's decision to deny me the opportunity to come and speak to my people, due to expressing simple and clear positions, is clear and blatant antisemitism that gives a boost to terrorism,” Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported Rothman saying.

Australian Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke defended the move, saying: “If you are coming to Australia to spread a message of hate and division, we don't want you here.”

In response, Israel revoked the visas of Australian representatives to the Palestinian Authority and told the Israeli Embassy in Australia to “carefully examine” any official visa applications from Australia to Israel, Foreign Minister Gideon Saar wrote on X.

Australia joined 27 other Western-allied nations in a joint statement last month calling for an end to the war and joined a smaller circle of countries in sanctioning two far-right Israeli government ministers accused of inciting violence against Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. ___

Fox News national correspondent Jeff Paul reports from Tel Aviv on protests calling for an end to the Israel-Hamas war on 'Fox News Live.'

FIRST ON FOX – Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a U.S.-backed aid group that has delivered more than two million boxes containing nearly 125 million meals to Gaza, is unveiling a pilot program enabling families to reserve aid parcels in advance. 

The foundation said that as more aid flows into Gaza, families will now be about to use the program to secure their parcels in advance, ""bringing more ease, dignity, and order to the collection process."" Under the current set-up at distribution sites, the GHF noted that younger, more fit men often outpace women, children, older men and people with disabilities to access aid, which is collected on a first-come, first-served basis.

""This is real progress,"" GHF Executive Director John Acree said in a statement. ""It both demonstrates that GHF's model is working and reflects our commitment to adapting to the needs of those we serve and delivering on President Trump's call for innovation to get more humanitarian aid into the hands of the people who need it most in Gaza.""

The voluntary new pilot program, designed to provide ""safe, predictable access to GHF's food aid parcels,"" launched on Sunday in the Saudi Neighborhood with 350 participants and is expected to scale up to full implementation in the coming weeks as the foundation works to develop additional distribution sites. 

GHF said the new system, which includes women-only days and lanes and community-based distribution, has long been requested by the community and is modeled on programs used by humanitarian organizations in Gaza and around the world. GHF said the pilot is the latest example of the foundation's ongoing efforts to ""meet the very dynamic needs on the ground."" 

Under the new system, a trained local worker invites beneficiaries to participate. Those who voluntarily opt into the program will have their photo taken and receive an identification card with their photo and a unique number. GHF said beneficiaries have the option to create a profile online, where they can input information such as household size.

The foundation said a box of aid will be set aside on specific days for each participant, ""eliminating the need to partake in the rush."" 

""It has always been our plan to offer a way for families to reserve aid in advance and guarantee access, just as other aid organizations do,"" Acree said. ""Until now, however, conditions on the ground have made implementation of such a program impossible. But with more aid flowing into Gaza and GHF's deliveries helping stabilize food availability, conditions are improving. We are proud to take this step to deliver on the requests of the community and make distributions easier and more reliable for the people we serve.""

Aid will continue to be available on a first-come, first-served basis to those who choose not to participate, according to the foundation. GHF said all data is securely stored and never shared.

GHF said the new system also enables the foundation to communicate directly with participating households about distribution times, special deliveries and urgent updates, ""allowing the organization to adapt quickly to community needs.""

Since the GHF began its operations on May 27, the organization has partnered with local Palestinian aid workers and non-governmental organizations to deliver nearly 125 million meals to Gazans. 

Last month, during a visit to Scotland, President Donald Trump addressed the ongoing hunger crisis in Gaza and the urgency of getting food into the enclave immediately, while doing it safely and securely.

""The United States recently, just a couple of weeks ago, we gave $60 million.… No other nation gave money,"" Trump said at the time, as he urged other nations ""to step up."" 

At least $30 million in U.S. contributions to Gaza have been channeled through the U.S.- and Israeli-backed GHF. 

In July, GHF spokesperson Chapin Fay told Fox News Digital that the foundation ""has one exclusive mission: to feed the people of Gaza in a way that prevents Hamas from being able to steal or loot or divert the aid.""

Several European heads of state arrived at the White House on Monday ahead of their meeting with President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.


Among the group were U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friederich Merz, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Finnish Prime Minister Alexander Stubb.

NATO general secretary Mark Rutte and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also arrived to the White House.

The group is preparing to launch discussions over how to end the war in Ukraine.









Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy arrived to the White House for his high-stakes meeting with President Donald Trump wearing more formal attire than his typical relaxed wardrobe.

Zelenskyy was seen shaking Trump's hand while wearing all black, including a button-down black shirt and jacket. 

Zelenskyy is back in Washington, D.C., Monday to meet with Trump following the U.S. president's historic meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin Friday in Alaska to discuss the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. The Putin meeting did not yield a peace agreement, with Trump now urging Ukraine to accept a land swap deal with Russia, arguing it is the most efficient way to end the war.

The meeting Monday also includes European leaders such as French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Finnish President Alexander Stubb. 


Zelenskyy has previously come under fire and questioning regarding his public attire, which has routinely included him sporting dark green T-shirts, sweatshirts and other relaxed military-style outfits, as opposed to suits. 

Excerpt from an article by Fox News' Emma Colton

""Why don't you wear a suit? You're at the highest level in this country's office, and you refuse to wear a suit,"" one reporter asked Zelenskyy when he visited the White House in February. ""Do you own a suit?""

Axios reported that the White House allegedly asked Ukrainian officials prior to the meeting if he would wear a suit to the meeting.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy arrived at the White House to engage in peace talks with President Donald Trump on Monday.

Zelensky is set
 to join a cohort of European heads of state who are also visiting the White House on Monday in solidarity with Ukraine. Trump has urged Zelenskyy to pursue a peace deal floated by Russian President Vladimir Putin that would see Ukraine cede some of its territory.

Zelenskyy has so far rejected such plans.

The Ukrainian leader wore an all-black outfit with a thick outer suit and tie.





President Donald Trump has selected several top U.S. officials to participate in his meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday.

The group includes Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, White House Chief of Staff Susan Wiles, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, and Special Envoy Keith Kellogg.

The group is set to meet with Zelenskyy and several top leaders from Europe, including the heads of state for the U.K., France, Germany, Italy and Finland. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will also be present.






President Donald Trump's foreign policy agenda is set to take center stage again this week, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visiting the White House on Monday as Washington continues efforts to broker peace between Moscow and Kyiv.

The White House has yet to release details of the meeting but has acknowledged that key European allies will accompany Zelenskyy.


NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Finnish President Alexander Stubb all confirmed their plans to attend.

Over the weekend, Zelenskyy acknowledged his last White House visit — cut short by a shouting match with both Trump and Vice President JD Vance — and told reporters in Brussels he hopes Monday's meeting ""will be productive"" rather than a repeat of February's encounter.

The upcoming meeting comes on the heels of Trump's summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Anchorage on Friday, where the U.S. leader shifted from demanding a ceasefire to calling for a final peace deal. Trump discussed some of the details of his meeting with Putin during a phone call with Zelenskyy from Air Force One.


This is an excerpt from an article by Fox News' Amanda Macias






President Donald Trump said Sunday that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy could end the war with Russia ""almost immediately"" if he wanted. 

Trump's comments come ahead of his scheduled meeting with Zelenskyy and several European leaders in Washington, D.C. on Monday.

""President Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social. ""Remember how it started. No getting back Obama given Crimea (12 years ago, without a shot being fired!), and NO GOING INTO NATO BY UKRAINE. Some things never change!!!""


NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and Finnish President Alexander Stubb confirmed Sunday they would attend the meeting in Washington.

Their joint presence underscores Europe's push to present a united front as Russia's war drags on.

Zelenskyy met von der Leyen in Brussels ahead of the Trump talks to set priorities for the White House meeting, focusing on long-term military aid, Ukraine's EU ambitions, and bolstering transatlantic solidarity against Russian aggression.

Von der Leyen said at a joint press conference she was glad to join Zelenskyy and other leaders in Washington on Monday.

Trump called it a ""great honor.""

President Donald Trump was tight-lipped after his high-stakes summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday but offered some key insight into the meeting to Fox News' Sean Hannity in an exclusive interview.

Here are the key takeaways from Trump's highly anticipated meeting with the Russian leader as shared with Hannity.

1. ‘No deal until there's a deal'

Trump told Hannity that ""as far as I'm concerned, there's no deal until there's a deal."" He noted, however, that ""we did make a lot of progress.""

2. Putin ‘wants to see it done'

The president noted to Hannity that he believes Putin is not only open to peace but that he ""wants to see it done."" 

3. Not prepared to share what the sticking point was


Pressed by Hannity to share what the ""one big issue you don't agree on"" that kept the leaders from walking away with a ceasefire deal, Trump declined to share. He said, ""No, I'd rather not. I guess somebody's going to go public with it, they'll figure it out, but no, I don't want to do that, I want to see if we can get it done."" 

4. Up to Zelenskyy and Europe

After taking such a major step as to physically meet with the Russian president, Trump said it is now ""up to [Ukrainian] President [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy to get it done and maybe the European nations, they have to get involved a little bit.""

5. Trump open to trilateral meeting


The president said he would be open to attending a trilateral meeting with the presidents of Ukraine and Russia, saying, ""If they'd like, I'll be at that meeting. They're going to set up a meeting now between President Zelenskyy and President Putin and myself, I guess, not that I want to be there, but I want to get it done."" 

This is an excerpt from an article by Fox News' Peter Pinedo 





World-renowned hostage negotiator Chris Voss
 spoke with The New York Times' David Marchese in a Saturday podcast interview, where he discussed how President Donald Trump demonstrates empathy.

Voss, a former longtime hostage negotiator for the FBI, was asked by Marchese whether he believes Trump and his administration ""demonstrate empathy.""

""I think he has a highly evolved understanding of how other people see things,"" he replied.

Marchese followed up on the hostage negotiator's response, asking, ""What makes you say that?""

According to Voss, Trump's decision to bomb Iran's nuclear sites rather than taking out the nation's leader revealed to the hostage negotiator the president's empathetic side.


""The reporting was that Israel was thinking about trying to take out the Iranian leader and that Trump was against that. Now, my view is that's smart for a number of reasons. First of all, if you agree to take out the head of a country, you're declaring there's open season and fair is fair, which means they're free to come after you,"" he explained. ""To me, there's a sense of empathy there. Not necessarily agreeing, not being on their side, but if empathy is understanding how somebody sees it, I think he has a highly evolved sense of it.""





Fox News' Bret Baier will sit down for an exclusive interview with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday night following his meeting with President Donald Trump at the White House.

Zelenskyy is scheduled to meet with Trump alongside several top European leaders, including U.K. Prime Minister Kier Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friederich Merz and others.

Trump has 
urged Zelenskyy publicly to pursue a peace deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin that would see Ukraine lose some of its territory. Zelenskyy has so far rebuffed the calls.





EXCLUSIVE: First Lady Melania Trump wrote a ""peace letter"" to Russian President Vladimir Putin telling him ""it is time"" to protect children and future generations around the globe, Fox News Digital has learned.

Fox News Digital exclusively obtained the ""peace letter"" the first lady penned to Putin, which  President Trump hand-delivered to the Russian leader before their summit in Alaska, Fox News Digital has learned.


Immediately upon receiving the letter, Putin read it as the American and Russian delegations looked on.

""Dear President Putin,"" the first lady's letter begins. ""Every child shares the same quiet dreams in their heart, whether born randomly into a nation's rustic countryside or a magnificent city-center. They dream of love, possibility, and safety from danger.""

""As parents, it is our duty to nurture the next generation's hope,"" the letter continued. ""As leaders, the responsibility to sustain our children extends beyond the comfort of a few.""

""Undeniably, we must strive to paint a dignity-filled world for all—so that every soul may wake to peace, and so that the future itself is perfectly guarded,"" read the letter. ""A simple yet profound concept, Mr. Putin, as I am sure you agree, is that each generation's descendants begin their lives with a purity—an innocence which stands above geography, government, and ideology.""


The first lady continued that ""in today's world, some children are forced to carry a quiet laughter, untouched by the darkness around them—a silent defiance against the forces that can potentially claim their future."" 

""Mr. Putin, you can singlehandedly restore their melodic laughter,"" the first lady wrote. ""In protecting the innocence of these children, you will do more than serve Russia alone—you serve humanity itself.""

""Such a bold idea transcends all human division, and you, Mr. Putin, are fit to implement this vision with a stroke of the pen today,"" she wrote. ""It is time.""

President Donald Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday, and their negotiations have set the stage for what Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy can expect from his meeting at the White House on Monday.

Trump went into his meeting with Putin demanding a ceasefire, but changed his tune after the meeting. He is now calling for a larger peace deal to end the war entirely, with Putin having offered peace if Ukraine will agree to cede some of its territory.

Trump has spent the weekend urging Ukraine to accept such a deal saying the U.S. would also give Ukraine security assurances moving forward. But Zelenskyy and the European allies who are set to join him at the White House have remained quiet.

The heads of state of the U.K., France, Germany, Italy and Finland are all set to visit the White House alongside Zelenskyy on Monday. NATO
 general secretary Mark Rutte and `European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are also set to join.





Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy
 will likely opt for a more formal look when he meets with President Donald Trump in Washington, D.C., on Monday, according to a designer who has previously collaborated with the European leader.

""Tomorrow he most likely will not appear in a polo,"" Ukrainian designer Elvira Gasanova told Fox News Digital. ""… I think he will choose a black military suit or a military-style shirt with trousers — perhaps a jacket.""

Having previously come under fire for his informal attire, Zelenskyy is likely to choose ""a more serious look — though less symbolic,"" according to Gasanova.

""After the recent ‘no suit' drama, he will likely approach this question differently,"" she said.


Zelenskyy has at times faced criticism for his informal wardrobe, including during his tense February visit to the Oval Office. That meeting with Trump and Vice President JD Vance escalated into a heated exchange between the three leaders over what ""cards"" Ukraine holds and whether Zelenskyy has expressed sufficient gratitude to the United States.

""Why don't you wear a suit? You're at the highest level in this country's office, and you refuse to wear a suit,"" one reporter asked Zelenskyy at the time. ""… Do you own a suit?""

Unlike many politicians, the Ukrainian president does not have personal stylists, according to Gasanova, who is the founder of Ukrainian fashion brands GASANOVA and DAMIRLI. 

Gasanova said she has previously designed clothing items for both Zelenskyy and Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reaffirmed on Sunday that Kyiv will not offer territorial concessions to Moscow, underscoring his hard line as the Kremlin's three-and-a-half-year conflict drags on.

""The constitution of Ukraine makes it impossible to give up territory or trade land,"" Zelenskyy said during a press conference at the European Commission on Sunday.

He added that Russia for the past decade has repeatedly tried and failed to seize the entirety of the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. The area, which includes Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, is an industrial hub built on coal and steel. In short, losing Donbas would strip Ukraine of a key economic lifeline and hand Moscow new leverage over Kyiv.


""Since the territorial issue is so important, it should be discussed only by the leaders of Ukraine and Russia at the trilateral [talks with] Ukraine, United States, Russia,"" Zelenskyy said, adding that Moscow has not acknowledged hosting a joint meeting with Kyiv and Washington.





Steve Witkoff, the U.S. Special Envoy for Peace Missions, said Moscow showed new readiness for peace at the Alaska summit, calling Putin's commitments “robust” concessions.

“We agreed on much more robust security guarantees,” Witkoff told Shannon Bream on Fox News Sunday. “The Russians agreed on enshrining legislative language that they would attest to not attempting to take any more land from Ukraine after a peace deal, where they would attest to not violating any European borders.”


Witkoff, who attended the talks, called the outcome “a win,” noting Trump spoke directly with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders after the summit. He explained that Trump shifted focus from an immediate ceasefire to pursuing a broader peace agreement.

European leaders later praised Trump's efforts to “stop the killing in Ukraine” and push for a lasting settlement. Putin described the Alaska discussions as “very frank,” saying Russia seeks to resolve the conflict “by peaceful means.”









Former Vice President Mike Pence
 urged President Donald Trump to act swiftly against Russia, saying tougher sanctions are needed alongside negotiations.

On CNN's State of the Union on Sunday, Pence said Trump often uses a “velvet glove” approach with dictators, but “the hammer needs to come, and it needs to come immediately.” He pressed Trump to call Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., to move forward on a secondary sanctions bill that enjoys broad support.

“The combination of engagement, but also making it clear to Putin that we are prepared to take actions that would literally break his economy even while we redouble our commitment to the security of Ukraine,” Pence said.

While crediting Trump for pursuing peace, Pence warned against delays. “We can't allow Vladimir to run out the clock on the war… the sanctions ought to be on the president's desk.”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy heads into a high-stakes White House meeting with President Donald Trump
 on Monday, as Washington considers security guarantees for Kyiv and debate intensifies over whether land concessions to Russia could end the war.

Zelenskyy will be flanked by key European allies at the White House, a diplomatic overture that signals Europe's determination to rally behind Ukraine.

Over the weekend, the Ukrainian leader acknowledged his last White House visit – cut short by a shouting match between Trump and Vice President JD Vance – and told reporters in Brussels he hopes Monday's meeting ""will be productive"" rather than a repeat of February's encounter.

The upcoming meeting comes on the heels of Trump's summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Anchorage on Friday, where the U.S. leader shifted from demanding a ceasefire to calling for a final peace deal.

Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff told CNN that Putin agreed to allow the U.S. to provide Ukraine ""robust security guarantees."" 


This is an excerpt from an article written by Fox News' Amanda Macias.





Secretary of State Marco Rubio rejected claims that President Donald Trump is backing Vladimir Putin's demand for Russia to take control of Ukraine's Donbas. He stressed that only Kyiv can decide its territorial future.

“These are things that Zelenskyy is going to have to decide on. These are things that the Ukrainian side is going to have to agree to,” Rubio told Maria Bartiromo on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""


Rubio described Trump's Alaska summit with Putin as producing “progress,” but warned talks could unravel if Washington imposes further sanctions. “The minute you put additional sanctions on him [Putin]… peace talks are no longer possible,” he said.

He argued that Trump is the only leader capable of brokering a settlement, while European partners must provide security guarantees. Rubio acknowledged negotiations remain difficult. “If one side gets everything they want, that's not a peace deal. It's called surrender.”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is visiting President Donald Trump at the White House on Monday, the first time he has done so since the pair had a heated argument in the Oval Office in February.

The White House meeting grew tense in its final approximate 10 minutes, after Vice President JD Vance said that peace would be reached between Russia and Ukraine through U.S. diplomacy efforts.

""Mr. President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media,"" Vance told Zelenskyy. ""Right now, you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the front lines because you have manpower problems. You should be thanking the president for bringing it, to bring it into this country."" 


""Have you've ever been to Ukraine that you say what problems we have?"" Zelenskyy shot back. 

""I've actually watched and seen the stories and I know that what happens is you bring people, you bring them on a propaganda tour,"" Vance
 continued. ""Mr. President, do you disagree that you've had problems bringing people into your military? And do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to, trying to prevent the destruction of your country?"" 

Zelenskyy continued that under war, ""everybody has problems, even you,"" and that the U.S. would feel the war ""in the future.""

""You're gambling with the lives of millions of people,"" Trump added at another point during the exchange. ""You're gambling with World War III. You're gambling with World War III. And what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country.""

President Donald Trump
 is hosting an unprecedented lineup of top European leaders at the White House on Monday as they discuss how to end the war in Ukraine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will of course be present, but the leaders of Europe's most powerful countries will be joining him. U.K. Prime Minister Kier Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron will be in attendance, as well as German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.

Italian Prime Minister 
Giorgia Meloni and Finnish President Alexander Stubb are also scheduled to attend the White House meetings, as well as NATO general secretary Mark Rutte and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

Trump remarked that it is a ""great honor"" for the U.S. to host so many prominent world leaders.

Their joint presence underscores Europe's determination to present a united front as the West seeks to end Russia's war without compromising Ukraine's security or sovereignty.

Before departing for Washington, Zelenskyy met with von der Leyen at the European Commission in Brussels to discuss priorities for the White House talks, focusing on long-term military aid, Ukraine's ambitions to join the EU, and bolstering transatlantic security.

""We will continue to support you for as long as it takes,"" von der Leyen said, adding that the EU backs a trilateral meeting between Ukraine, Russia and the United States.

The White House has yet to release details of the meeting set for Monday, August 18, but has acknowledged that key European allies will accompany Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Finnish President Alexander Stubb all confirmed their plans to attend.

Over the weekend, Zelenskyy acknowledged his last White House visit — cut short by a shouting match with both Trump and Vice President JD Vance — and told reporters in Brussels he hopes Monday's meeting ""will be productive"" rather than a repeat of February's encounter.

Following the explosive geopolitical meeting earlier this year, several world leaders showed their support for Zelenskyy including Macron who said, ""There is an aggressor: Russia. There is a victim: Ukraine.""

At the time, Merz said, ""Dear Volodymyr Zelenskyy, we stand with Ukraine in good and in testing times. We must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war.""

Meloni did not release a public statement in the days following the fallout.

'Blue Collar Cash' author and former construction worker Ken Rusk on the importance of trades in an AI-dominated world and the surge of blue-collar jobs under the Trump administration.

In July, some of the brightest minds in American technology descended on Washington to celebrate a major milestone: the launch of President Donald Trump's bold initiative to ensure the United States remains the world's unrivaled leader in artificial intelligence (AI). 

Let me be blunt: the AI arms race is no longer theoretical. It's here. And we cannot afford to come in second place.  

In business, if you don't constantly adapt and innovate, you lose. Nations are no different. If we fail to lead in AI, we risk surrendering our economic and national security edge to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) — a regime that seeks to challenge American technological supremacy and reshape the global order in its authoritarian image.  

AMERICA MUST WIN THE AI RACE — AND PREPARE FOR THE WORST

Trump understands this. That's why his vision for American renewal is laser-focused on innovation, particularly in AI and emerging technologies that will shape our economy and define the nature of future conflict.  

The U.S. needs to fend off the threat from China if it's to stay competitive in the field of artificial intelligence. (Getty images)

We have to stop being complacent with a slow, outdated and reactive government. The future demands urgency, ambition and a commitment to putting America first at every turn. This is about building a trusted AI ecosystem that is private-sector led, American-built, and decisive in its capacity to defend freedom.  

There's a quote from Christian Brose's book, ""The Kill Chain,"" that has stayed with me: ""Over the past decade, in U.S. war games against China, the United States has a nearly perfect record: We have lost almost every single time.""

DETAILS OF TRUMP'S HIGHLY ANTICIPATED AI PLAN REVEALED BY WHITE HOUSE AHEAD OF MAJOR SPEECH 

That's a wake-up call for every American.  

The CCP is not just trying to compete. They're trying to dominate. From economic espionage and cyber infiltration to exploiting our supply chains and siphoning off our data, the CCP is engaged in full-spectrum technological warfare. The next conflict will not look like the last. It will be a battle of data, autonomy, and algorithmic superiority — and the side that controls the best AI will win.  \

This isn't just a defense imperative; it's an economic one. The AI infrastructure boom will generate thousands of high-paying jobs across the country. From building advanced data centers to manufacturing chips, American workers are at the center of this effort. And making sure every family in this country has the opportunity to get a good job is how we win. That's why Trump's action plan doesn't just emphasize innovation; it prioritizes workforce development, energy modernization and secure supply chains. 

Wyoming's vast energy resources will be absolutely critical to winning this race. AI data centers require massive amounts of reliable, baseload power — the kind that Wyoming's abundant coal and natural gas can deliver, 24/7, 365 days a year. While other states struggle with expensive, intermittent energy sources, Wyoming offers both the dependable power and affordable rates that give American companies a decisive advantage. Our state stands ready to power America's AI revolution with the energy infrastructure that will keep our systems running affordably when national and economic security is on the line.

American manufacturing is at the heart of this effort, and that includes making sure our critical data stays right here at home.

This isn't a hypothetical. It's already happening. And that's exactly why American companies are investing billions to build state-of-the-art facilities here at home. These aren't just buildings filled with servers. Data centers are the digital backbone of everything from telehealth and e-commerce to our intelligence agencies and defense systems. They are a critical piece of the AI puzzle and a national security asset we can't afford to outsource. But they're also massive energy consumers — which makes Wyoming's affordable, dependable energy production essential to keeping these facilities running 24/7.  

LEE ZELDIN: TRUMP'S EPA CLEARING THE REGULATORY PATH FOR AMERICA TO DOMINATE THE GLOBAL AI REVOLUTION

Trump's plan rightly focuses on removing barriers and burdensome regulations to allow for the rapid buildout of data centers. His America First AI agenda is the roadmap. But it's up to all of us, from the private sector to Congress, to take the action necessary to propel us forward. We cannot afford to be naïve about the economic and national security risks of falling behind.

We must ensure that the future of AI is developed in the U.S.A., powered by American energy, and guided by our enduring values of freedom, innovation and hard work.  

The AI arms race is on — and America doesn't lose races. Let's win this one, together.

Fox News correspondent Mark Meredith reports on President Donald Trump's plans to annul prior climate policy on ‘Special Report.'

FIRST ON FOX: A prominent pro-energy group is calling on the Trump administration to investigate what it suspects is a coordinated ""national lawfare campaign"" by left-wing climate activists aimed at influencing thousands of judges on how to approach climate litigation.

In a letter sent this week to Attorney General Pam Bondi, Power the Future Founder and Executive Director Dan Turner warned that the Federal Judicial Center, in partnership with the Environmental Law Institute's Climate Judiciary Project, is engaged in ""behind-closed-doors advocacy"" for climate lawfare.

""Specifically, Power The Future is concerned that the FJC is actively assisting in a campaign which boasts of having ‘educated' approximately two thousand judges, including federal judges, on how to approach climate"" litigation,"" the letter explains. ""'Climate' litigation actually seeks in part to impose federal energy (rationing) policy through the courts, even though policy ‘must be addressed by the two other branches of government.' The FJC enlisted in this campaign by hosting seminars for judges with speakers drawn exclusively from the world of plaintiffs' witnesses or historic amicus brief filers in support of the plaintiffs.""

The Washington, D.C.-based Environmental Law Institute created the Climate Judiciary Project (CJP) in 2018, establishing a first-of-its-kind resource to provide ""reliable, up-to-date information"" about climate change litigation, according to the group. The project's reach has extended to various state and federal courts, including powerful appellate courts, and comes as multiple cities and states pursue high-profile litigation against the oil industry.

A Fox News Digital review in December shows that several CJP expert lawyers and judges have close ties to the curriculum and are deeply involved in climate litigation, while the group attempted to distance itself at the time, saying, ""CJP doesn't participate in litigation, support or coordinate with any parties in litigation, or advise judges on how they should rule in any case.""

Power the Future included FOIA requests in the letter, which the group says shows coordination between judges and ELI's network.

""For example, several records obtained under FOIA, enclosed herein, reference the involvement of Judge David Tatel, who served for nearly 30 years on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit until 2022,"" the letter says. ""One February 2021 email from a plaintiff's witness who ELI arranged to serially brief judges on ‘climate' litigation, Dr. Don Wuebbles, references 'the kind of issues that Judge Tatel raised towards counteracting arguments from nonbelievers' in catastrophic man-made global warming.""

Wuebbles hit back against claims there were ""cozy ties"" between judges and climate activists in comments to Fox News Digital, calling the Power the Future letter a ""highly distorted look at what we do as scientists,"" while defending that he is a ""PhD atmospheric scientist and professor…,"" not an ""activist.""

Wuebbles did explain that he has helped ""educate judges on the science of climate change"" when asked by the courts across his career. 

""Those meetings were very professional and just about the state of the science,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""If a senator, other politicians, or anyone with biases about the state of the climate cannot handle the truth, that is their problem. But the truth should still come out for all Americans to be aware of, including judges and the courts. As part of this, the misinformation of contrarians needs to be responded to by responses demonstrating the real state of the science and what the actual measurements and scientific analyses really show us — that is what we do as scientists. As someone with high moral standards, I could add much more, but I will leave it there.""

CLIMATE LAWFARE CAMPAIGN DEALT BLOW IN SOUTH CAROLINA

The letter to the DOJ included other FOIA'd emails, including one dated March 23, 2021, that was sent by CJP founder Paul Hanle to ""a serial presenter, plaintiff's expert witness Dr. Ben Santer"" regarding presenting a climate science lecture to more than 100 judges. 

""In another email, dated March 23, 2021, from ELI's Paul Hanle to a serial presenter, plaintiff's expert witness Dr. Ben Santer — also a member of the board of the activist Union of Concerned Scientists, which was an original organizer of the climate litigation campaign — Hanle describes ELI as working ‘through the auspices of the National Judicial College, with which our project is partnering,'"" the letter to the DOJ reads. ""Hanle later thanked Santer for Santer's presentation ‘to a large group of judges — perhaps one to two hundred,' stating, in relevant part, ‘I would venture you convinced many who did not know before that the science has moved far and fast and the scientific case is underpinned by very strong evidence.' Hanle added, ‘Your approach is very effective with judges.'""

While another email, sent by an ELI official to both Hanle and Santer, the official says, ""that [the judge] connected this material to her own docket …[is] [j]ust what we want to see!""

""You certainly had an impact on her,"" Hanle said. 

Santer told Fox News Digital in an emailed comment Monday when asked about the correspondence that his job is to ""improve scientific and public understanding of the nature, causes, and impacts of climate change."" 

""I've done this job for over 35 years, through my research in ‘climate fingerprinting' and through public lecturing to a variety of different audiences. Judges are one of those audiences, along with professional societies, Rotary Clubs, universities, schools, and conservative organizations like the Pacific Club, Jonathan Club, and Bohemian Grove,"" he wrote. 

""As of today, U.S. climate scientists still have the freedom to educate U.S. citizens on the reality and seriousness of climate change. I cherish that freedom. While it still exists, I intend to continue serving as a ‘serial presenter' on climate science,"" he continued. 

CLIMATE JUSTICE GROUP HAS DEEP TIES TO JUDGES, EXPERTS INVOLVED IN LITIGATION AMID CLAIMS OF IMPARTIALITY

When approached for comment on the matter, FJC's Deputy Director Clara Altman said it had not worked with ELI since 2020, after holding a series of seminars in coordination with the group the year prior. 

""The Federal Judicial Center conducted a series of small one-day seminars with the Environmental Law Institute for fewer than 100 judges in total in 2019 and early 2020.  The Federal Judicial Center has not done any programs with ELI since.  In all its programs, the Center strives to present content objectively and from a range of views,"" Altman said, adding that FJC is not affiliated with NJC.

Fox News Digital reported in July that CJP organized a years-long, nationwide online forum with jurists to promote favorable information and litigation updates regarding climate issues — until the email-styled group chat was abruptly made private last year. The listserv was established after CJP coordinated with the National Judicial College to establish its first cohort of judges who took part in a ""Judicial Leaders in Climate Science"" program in 2022. 

The listserv, which included at least five judges from across the nation and CJP leaders, was active from September 2022 to May 2024, and facilitated correspondence between the group's members as they traded links on climate studies, congratulated one another on hosting recent environmental events, shared updates on recent climate cases that were remanded to state courts and encouraged participation in other CJP meet-ups. 

In one message, for example, a Delaware judge shared a YouTube video of a 2022 climate presentation delivered by a Delaware official and a Columbia University professor that focused on the onslaught of climate lawsuits since the mid-2000s. The video included claims that those lawsuits could one day bankrupt the fuel industry. 

The judge stipulated in his message to the group when sharing the link: ""Because the link is of a judicial event that is otherwise not public, please do not forward or use without checking with me. I suspect that goes without saying, but the powers that be will be happier that I said it.""

UNEARTHED CHAT SHEDS LIGHT ON COZY TIES BETWEEN JUDGES, CLIMATE ACTIVISTS, RAISING ETHICAL CONCERNS

A handful of other judges responded to Laster's video and message, praising it as ""great work.""

CJP, in a comment to Fox Digital at the time, defended the listserv as one to help members of its Judicial Leaders in Climate Science program communicate and network with one another for the duration of the program. The one-year program, established by CJP in coordination with the National Judicial College, ""trains state court judges on judicial leadership skills integrated with consensus climate science and how it is arising in the law,"" the group told Fox News Digital.

Following Fox News Digital's reporting on the listserv, CJP's website received a facelift that included removing one of the judge's names and his favorable testimony of the group's work and anonymized the names of other judges who praised CJP as an ""essential"" resource for jurists.

""Judges are encouraged, and many required, to participate in continuing education on topics relevant to emerging trends in the law — including those related to science. Recent changes to CJP's website were made to protect privacy and prevent baseless criticism and harassment,"" the spokesperson told Fox News Digital in August when asked about the website revamp. 

When asked about Power the Future's letter, a spokesperson for ELI underscored that its Climate Judiciary Project is a ""a non-partisan organization that has been operating for over 50 years. ELI educates professionals and the public, provides objective data and analysis, and convenes diverse groups of leaders to solve problems.""

""The programs in which CJP participates are no different than other judicial education programs, providing evidence-based training on legal and scientific topics that judges voluntarily choose to attend,"" the spokesperson continued. ""CJP does not participate in litigation, provide support for or coordinate with any parties in litigation, or advise judges on how they should rule in any case.""

News of CJP's outreach comes as the U.S. has seen a sharp uptick in climate-related lawsuits in recent years — including cases targeting oil giants Shell, BP and ExxonMobil for allegedly using ""deceptive"" marketing and downplaying the risks of climate change. Lawsuits have also been brought against state governments and federal agencies, including the Interior Department, for allegedly failing to address pollution risks or protect against the harms of climate change, according to the plaintiffs.

Conservative lawmakers have meanwhile put CJP under the public's microscope for alleged ""lawfare,"" most notably Sen. Ted Cruz, who said during a Senate subcommittee hearing in June that there is a ""systematic campaign"" launched by the Chinese Communist Party and American left-wing activists to weaponize the court systems to ""undermine American energy dominance."" 

CJP, Cruz said, is a pivotal player in the ""lawfare"" as it works to secure ""judicial capture."" 

Judicial communications with climate activists over litigation and environmental issues date back years. In 2019, a federal judge hit ""reply all"" to an email chain with 45 other judges and court staff about an invitation to a climate seminar hosted by the Environmental Law Institute. Colleagues later chastised the judge for sharing ""this nonsense"" and suggested it was an ethics violation, though others defended the judge's decision, saying flagging the event was not unethical.

President Donald Trump revealed on Sunday night that Russian President Vladimir Putin wanted their summit to be held “anywhere” but the United States, saying it was “very hard” for Putin to make an appearance in Alaska for the high-stakes meeting.

Trump made the revelation in a Truth Social post on Sunday night, in which he took aim at the media over criticism of having Putin on U.S. soil for a summit that ultimately ended with no ceasefire or peace deal in the Ukraine war.

“The Fake News has been saying for 3 days that I suffered a ‘major defeat' by allowing President Vladimir Putin of Russia to have a major Summit in the United States. Actually, he would have loved doing the meeting anywhere else but the U.S., and the Fake News knows this. It was a major point of contention!” the U.S. president said.

In a follow-up post from Trump that targeted Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) over his own criticism of the summit, Trump pushed back on the notion that it made Putin “look good in coming to America.”

“Actually, it was very hard for President Putin to do so. This war can be ended, NOW, but stupid people like Chris Murphy, John Bolton, and others, make it much harder to do so,” Trump said.

While drawing a mixed reaction from the media, who Putin and Trump did not take questions from at the end of their three-hour meeting in Anchorage, it was largely hailed by European leaders, who are descending en masse to Washington, D.C., for a meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

That meeting, slated for Monday, is the next stage in the peace negotiations.

EUROPEAN LEADERS ANNOUNCE THEY'LL JOIN ZELENSKY IN WHITE HOUSE MEETING WITH TRUMP

On Sunday night, Trump teased it as a “Big day” to come, while also reiterating his plea for Zelensky to end the over three-year war.

“President Zelensky of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight. Remember how it started,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Has the Trump administration misread Moscow?

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

According to the Trump administration, the broad outlines of Vladimir Putin's proposal to end the war in Ukraine are coming into focus. Ukraine would give Russia control of approximately 6,600 square kilometers, or 12 percent, of the Donbas (Donetsk and Luhansk regions) in eastern Ukraine—this includes territory that Russia does not now occupy. Russia would leave approximately 440 square kilometers of territory in Sumy and Kharkiv. That “land swap” on its own would be an impossible sell to the Ukrainians. But Donald Trump's team is touting progress in another area, claiming that Putin would be open to a European security guarantee, including a military presence inside Ukraine, with an “American backstop” (although no U.S. troops would be in Ukraine).

European leaders will join President Volodymyr Zelensky in Washington, D.C., today to flesh out what a security guarantee would look like. A European official with knowledge of the briefings told me that if an agreement can be reached with the Russians on its specifics, negotiations on territorial questions would follow. Trump is pushing for a trilateral summit with Putin and Zelensky within a week to seal the deal, but the Europeans believe they will need more time—at least a few weeks—to figure out the details and see if there is a viable way forward.

As Putin looked at the coverage of the summit and Trump's optimism that peace may be close, he may well have had the same reaction as Alan Greenspan when he testified to the Senate as the chair of the Federal Reserve: “I should warn you, if I turn out to be particularly clear, you've probably misunderstood what I said.” It's very possible that, far from achieving a breakthrough, the Trump administration simply misread what the Russians said and they haven't changed their position at all. That's the risk of not having the proposal in writing and having negotiators who are not familiar with Moscow's diplomatic track record on the war.

Anne Applebaum: Trump has no cards

Start with what Russia is demanding. The Financial Times reported that “according to four people with direct knowledge of the talks” in Friday's summit, Putin “demanded Ukraine withdraw from the Donetsk and Luhansk regions as a condition for ending Russia's war but told Donald Trump he could freeze the rest of the frontline if his core demands were met.”

The phrase if his core demands were met is crucial. Russia presented a memo at the June 2 talks with Ukraine in Istanbul that contains the basic parameters of a final settlement. In addition to international recognition of Russian sovereignty of Crimea, the Donbas, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia, it includes severe caps on the strength of the Ukrainian armed forces and the cessation of Western military aid to Ukraine.

These demands, which would amount to Ukraine's subjugation, are impossible for Ukraine to accept. To date, the Trump administration has rejected them too. In May, Vice President J. D. Vance told Fox News that the Russians were asking for “too much,” adding that “Russia can't expect to be given territory that they haven't even conquered yet.”

On Friday, if the Trump administration's account of the talks is correct, Putin seems to have pared back his demands a tiny bit. He is insisting on Ukrainian withdrawal from two regions instead of four. But there is no sign that he is moving away from his demands about limits on the size of the Ukrainian military.

Putin's apparent concession on security guarantees may not be all the Trump administration thinks it is. In the original talks in Istanbul in the spring of 2022, Russia presented a plan for an external security guarantee for Ukraine that would give Moscow an effective veto over whether it is ever invoked. Moscow very likely still has that in mind—in which case, there was no progress in Friday's summit. Even if it is moving off that idea, it may well link any security guarantee to severe limits on the size of the Ukrainian military.

A security guarantee should mean that if Ukraine is attacked by Russia again, the guarantors will join it in the war against Russia. If that guarantee is provided by Europe, it would mean that European states would fight Russia without the support of the United States. The Europeans have worried for some time that this is fraught with peril. Such a war would give Putin the chance to drive a wedge between the United States and Europe, potentially permanently breaking the NATO alliance.

This is where the “American backstop” comes in. The idea is that if European forces are attacked, the U.S. would come to their aid. But it's not clear what that means. If Europe has committed to defend Ukraine in the event of an invasion, then a U.S. backstop would mean that America would join it in fighting Russia, albeit possibly just with air power. That comes very close to a NATO Article 5 guarantee. The U.S. Russia envoy, Steve Witkoff, suggested yesterday that the administration is looking at such a guarantee outside of the NATO context, but it is very hard to imagine that Trump will be on board with that.

A weaker version of the backstop is that European forces would be present in Ukraine without a commitment to fight Russia if it invaded again. They would instead focus on helping train and equip Ukrainian troops and creating a sense of ambiguity in Moscow about the potential for a wider war if Russia restarted the war. In this case, the Trump administration would likely interpret a backstop as requiring European troops to be given safe haven in Ukraine if Russia attacked, or that the U.S. would help them leave safely.

Under present U.S. leadership, a credible external security guarantee for Ukraine seems extremely unlikely. The Europeans will not commit to fighting Russia without the United States, and Trump will never agree to join them.

The only credible guarantee for Ukraine in current circumstances is a national one: that the West would help Ukraine build a force capable of defending the country and deterring a future attack. That means a massive military build-up following a cease-fire, including a long-range-strike capability, to demonstrate to Moscow that another invasion would fail and would weaken Russia significantly. If that is secured, a European presence inside Ukraine to help train and equip their forces would be helpful. But there is no sign that Moscow has moved off of its demands for Ukrainian demilitarization. If Moscow's apparent willingness to allow a small number of European troops into Ukraine is a smoke screen to get Trump to embrace demilitarization, he needs to reject it outright.

Jonathan Lemire: Well, what did you think would happen?

That brings us back to territory. Putin's demand for the Donbas is tactically clever because it is designed to give the Trump administration false hope that if Ukraine cedes this territory, the war will be over. Already, Trump has abandoned his calls for a cease-fire and his plans to impose additional sanctions on Russia. It also obscures Russia's other core demands and is designed to drive a wedge between the United States and Ukraine. Ukraine will be extremely reluctant to give up territory and vital defensive lines that Russia would take years to get on the battlefield, if it could take them at all—and by putting Zelensky in a position where he will feel compelled to refuse an unreasonable demand, Putin hopes to convince Trump that it is Zelensky who stands in the way of peace.

Instead of trying to figure out how to make a security guarantee work, the Trump administration needs to first clarify Moscow's position on Ukraine's demilitarization, preferably in writing. If it is sticking to its June 2 position, the talks are just a ruse to buy time and weaken America's resolve. If Moscow is willing to accept Ukraine's right to defend itself, talks could take place on changes to the territorial line of control on a reciprocal basis—for every square mile Ukraine gives up, Russia would give up a square mile of similar value.

Ultimately, the diplomatic problem the Trump administration faces is how to persuade Russia to accept an independent and sovereign Ukraine. All the signs from Moscow are that it has not backed off from a maximalist position. The only plausible way to end the war is to create a battlefield reality that convinces Putin that he cannot make more gains, that he will pay a massive price for continuing the war, and that this reality is unlikely to change. That means that the United States and its allies need to, paradoxically, get serious about arming Ukraine for a protracted conflict and putting pressure on Russia. That is the only way to create the conditions for successful negotiations to end the war.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Which flavor of socialism would the mayoral candidate bring to New York City?

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Zohran Mamdani, the charismatic young Democratic Party candidate for mayor of New York City, has been hard at work balancing his deep-dyed socialist beliefs with his need to show voters that he is at least a cousin to mainstream liberal Democrats.

Last week, he confirmed that he had previously fielded a phone call from former President Barack Obama. With cameras rolling, Mamdani spent a day in early August in the political embrace of Elizabeth Warren, a progressive Democratic doyen. The Massachusetts senator talked passionately of challenging billionaires while Mamdani talked of his sympathy for police officers whom he described as overstretched and overworked. The same day, they sat on a park bench like old buddies, chatting and leaning in toward each other. Mamdani shed a possibly impromptu tear—after which he and Warren burst out laughing, in a moment that his campaign promptly retailed on Facebook and TikTok.

Mamdani, 33, conveys that he is a man prepared to work with the organs of capitalist democracy to progressive ends and not to demand ideological litmus tests. But the Mamdani who takes great pride in his identity as a member of Democratic Socialists of America and who told Meet the Press in late June that “I don't think we should have billionaires”—to the alarm of Wall Street donors—has hardly disappeared.

By his own account, his political journey from state assemblyman to mayoral nominee owes almost entirely to his umbilical connection with DSA. A cache of podcast interviews and speeches over the past five years sheds light on his view of this evolution.

Two years ago, in a speech at DSA's national convention, he described how belonging to the organization helped him and a handful of fellow socialist assembly members survive in the cauldron of Albany. “We are special as DSA electeds not because of ourselves; we are special because of our organization,” he said. “It is far easier to corrupt an individual than a mass-movement organization.” He concluded, “So sincerity forever, solidarity forever, and socialism forever.” In past years, he has also argued that DSA must push for causes that make some supporters uncomfortable, such as the “end goal of seizing the means of production.”

Read: Zohran Mamdani's lesson for the left

The practical meaning of that rhetoric—its old-school socialist flavor bordering on obscurantist—is difficult to parse, and not just because Mamdani is remaking his image in real time. The political left from which Mamdani emerges is a collection of disorderly tribes, sheltering self-styled revolutionaries alongside those who prize compromise and electoral victory, and those who want to sand the edges off capitalism alongside those who want to replace it altogether.

Within DSA, that tendency toward sectarianism can produce a cacophonous and quarrelsome internal politics: Marx meets the Marx Brothers. Some members—likely a majority of the organization—seem intent on trying to change the Democratic Party from within, by supporting figures such as Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in primaries. Some speak of the group becoming a party of its own. Still others have formed Leninist cliques that yearn to transform DSA into a revolutionary vanguard.

Earlier this month, a DSA-friendly Substack account cobbled together a reader's guide to the organization's clotted mass of caucuses. Among them is Red Star, a Marxist-Leninist outcropping whose unforgiving politics can be discerned from a recent post entitled “We Do Not Condemn Hamas, and Neither Should You.” My favorite DSA offshoot is the Caracol caucus, an eco-socialist degrowth group named for the Spanish word for snail.

Those allied with Mamdani, and those who fear and oppose him, are alike in speculating how much socialism he might try to bring to New York. But the bigger question might be what kind of socialism he embraces. His challenge will be to draw on DSA's organizing support while transcending its fractiousness and some members' ideological excesses.

DSA sprang to life in 1982 from the dying embers of earlier left-wing organizations. Its founders were committed to working within the Democratic Party. The group's intellectual father was Michael Harrington, whose 1962 book The Other America: Poverty in the United States was credited with helping build support for Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society program. Harrington described DSA as occupying “the left wing of the possible.” That DSA refused for many years to work with Marxist-Leninists and Trotskyites, who were seen—for reasons grounded in decades of empirical observation—as authoritarian and disdainful of democracy. It attracted New York politicians such as former Mayor David Dinkins and had a membership of about 6,000. It remained bookish and locally respected and—for the first couple of decades after the end of the Cold War—more or less irrelevant.

Then came 2016 and Bernie Sanders's electric run for the Democratic presidential nomination. The Vermont senator is both avowedly a democratic socialist and temperamentally unsuited to behaving as any group's obedient cadre. He never joined DSA (and long avoided joining the Democratic Party), but young people flocked to his banner—and to DSA's. Two years later, a 28-year-old bartender and waitress vanquished a top House Democratic leader in a congressional primary. That insurgent, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, was a preternatural political talent. She became the face of DSA and played a role in attracting tens of thousands more young people to join the organization, whose national membership stands at about 70,000. The New York City chapter has 10,000 members.

Joshua Freeman, a retired historian at the City University of New York, joined DSA a few years ago, drawn by its sense of possibility. “The party is dominated by younger people, which is absolutely everyone except for about three of us,” he said. The 20-somethings gravitating to DSA in the past decade could be forgiven for viewing as ancient history the angry polemics and intellectual brawls that marked relations between 20th-century social democrats, Stalinists, and Trotskyites.

Read: Why older socialists are quitting the DSA

Yet significant divides have opened up within today's group. “The problem is that while New York City DSA is pretty much in the ‘left wing of the possible' tradition, the national party is not in that place,” Maurice Isserman, a historian at Hamilton College, told me. He was a DSA member for many decades before quitting when DSA equivocated about the brutal Hamas attacks of October 7. “Once the left sectarians are lodged in place, they become an immovable force.”

Militant groupings within DSA local chapters wield more power in cities such as San Francisco, Boston, Syracuse, and Portland, Oregon, than in New York. The Portland branch—four of whose members now sit on the city council—urges members to pursue a “rupture with the Democratic Party.” And its co-chair, Olivia Katbi, recently boasted on X of telling a New York Times reporter to bug off because that newspaper published “disgusting, racist, dehumanizing propaganda” about Palestinians.

These militant caucuses wield considerable power on DSA's national committee, which controls national endorsements. The militants hold candidates to exacting, even self-defeating, standards. In 2024 the national organization withdrew its endorsement of Ocasio-Cortez, the group's best-known candidate. She apparently had paid insufficient attention to its Federal Socialists in Office Committee and, in a moment of apostasy, had co-signed a press release supporting stronger anti-missile systems to help Israel defend its civilian population.

DSA's New York City branch, by contrast, voted by a wide margin to endorse her. “We're concerned at the increasing mismanagement and sectarianism in DSA's national leadership,” a caucus prominent in the New York chapter said in a statement, “as some leaders attempt to steer the organization into powerlessness and isolation.” (Ocasio-Cortez survived the national DSA snub, besting her Republican opponent by 38 points.)

Mamdani is more of a from-the-cradle socialist than Ocasio-Cortez. His father, Mahmood Mamdani, is a prominent theorist of settler colonialism at Columbia University; his mother, Mira Nair, is a well-known filmmaker—Monsoon Wedding, Mississippi Masala, and The Reluctant Fundamentalist—with left-wing politics. When invited to attend the progressive Haifa International Film Festival in Israel in 2013, she declined, tweeting that she would go there only when Israel ended the occupation and stopped “privileging one religion over another.” Zohran, who identifies as a Muslim, noted in August 2023 that Palestinian liberation is “at the core” of his politics and was the cause that drew him to DSA.

DSA's national political platform, rewritten when Mamdani was an assemblyman, is a gumbo of left-wing positions, many of which sit miles from the political mainstream. The organization would free all inmates from prisons and jails and decriminalize the drug trade, prostitution, and squatting in unoccupied homes. DSA endorses cutting police budgets “annually towards zero,” disarming cops, and decertifying their unions.

Maurice Isserman: The cause that turned idealists into authoritarian zealots

Mamdani has hauled some of this ideological baggage into the national spotlight. In December 2020, just after he was elected to the state assembly, Mamdani wrote of New York City's police force: “There is no negotiating with an institution this wicked & corrupt. Defund it.” That view has not aged well. Mamdani of late has taken to energetically disavowing his former view, portraying it as an artifact from many years past, before he was an elected official. “I am not defunding the police. I am not running to defund the police,” Mamdani told reporters last month, after meeting in late July with the family of a police officer killed in a mass shooting. Mamdani said that he is a “candidate who is not fixed in time, one that learns and one that leads, and part of that means admitting as I have grown.”

The political successes of Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez, and now Mamdani have done much to rehabilitate the term socialist and even give it a hip aura. Evidence that the term no longer carries a toxic sting can be heard on the right, as conservative commentators now use a harsher term to describe Mamdani: communist.

His actual positions range from splendidly consumer-friendly promises such as free municipal buses and cheap groceries in city-owned supermarkets to universal day care for all children ages six weeks to 5 years. He promises to freeze apartment-building rents and to triple the city's capital budget, creating 200,000 units of publicly subsidized housing. The price tag for this is $100 billion over 10 years. He has sidestepped the question of how he would pay for all this, however badly day care and housing are needed, other than to propose billions of dollars in new taxes, all of which are controlled by the state legislature and governor.

Michael Powell: The magic realism of Zohran Mamdani

As the Democratic nominee, Mamdani met recently with the Partnership for New York City, a chamber of commerce for finance, real-estate, and corporate leaders. Afterward, Kathryn S. Wylde, its longtime president, told me that although Mamdani “has no policy chops—none—he is smart, has a smile that will kill, and he will listen.” He has overhauled his communications and campaign team, importing distinctly non-cadre sorts from the Democratic mainstream.

Mamdani seems aware that, however much he might still listen to his DSA comrades, he faces a larger reality: He could soon oversee some 300,000 employees in a city of 8.5 million people.

Still, unease among wealthy New Yorkers is palpable. They are accustomed to winning and not inclined to bet on the chances that a smart left-wing candidate might moderate after being elected mayor. They would prefer to spend money and seek his defeat. Several years ago, Mamdani joked about this reflex: “It's almost a ritual of the donor class to set their money on fire when it comes to running against DSA candidates.”

Exhibit A is an email that an acquaintance forwarded to me in late July. Written by Ricky Sandler, the CEO of a global equity-management firm, the message predicted that a Mamdani victory would have “dire consequences.” It proposed a joint fund that would shower millions of dollars on a competing candidate. In his email, Sandler, who did not respond to my request for an interview, pledged to toss in $500,000, and he set the desired minimum counterrevolutionary donation at $25,000.

Alas, the donor class's other choices are not appetizing. They include formerly indicted Mayor Eric Adams, now running as an independent; former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, now running a sputtering independent campaign after Mamdani soundly defeated him in the Democratic primary; and Curtis Sliwa, a Republican best known for founding the anti-crime group Guardian Angels in the 1970s and more recently for sharing his apartment with 16 cats. (According to his campaign, he now has only six cats.)

Mamdani's commanding lead in the polls offers him much room for political redefinition. His transition in the past five years—from obscure socialist state assembly candidate to a TikTok star who attracts Obama's interest and sheds an artful tear with Warren—is remarkable. It is premature to say that he will wind up as just another left-liberal Democrat. He has been insistent throughout his brief political career on the centrality of his identity as a socialist. Without that, he told the DSA convention two years ago, “you will start to rationalize that which you initially rebelled against.” Socialists know, he told the convention, that “winning an election is not an end, but a means to an end.” The precise contours of his desired end remain, for now, something of a mystery.

This article has been updated to include the fact that, today, Curtis Sliwa has only six cats.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

As the Chinese economy surges forward, the U.S. has lost its capacity for physical improvement.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

After Donald Trump announced ruinously high tariffs on China in the spring, a simple reminder of that country's growing technological power forced him to back down. Shortly after Trump's April 2 tariff announcement, Beijing abruptly suspended exports of rare-earth magnets.

Automakers around the world panicked. These magnets—manufactured in Chinese factories from crucial metals extracted mostly from Chinese mines—have become essential for building cars. Ford Motor paused production at a plant in Chicago. Automotive-lobbying organizations in the United States and Europe warned that car companies were weeks away from halting production. A few reportedly were considering moving some production to China in order to maintain access to supplies. On May 12, the White House agreed to lower tariff rates for China before it had announced trade deals with Europe, Canada, Japan, or other allied countries.

China produces 90 percent of the global supply of rare-earth magnets, which are not the only products that Beijing can deny the rest of the world. Decades of industrial policy and fierce entrepreneurialism have created the world's mightiest manufacturing machine. Chinese firms are also dominant producers of many pharmaceutical ingredients (especially for antibiotics and ibuprofen), battery materials, and entire categories of electronics components—not to mention smartphones, household appliances, toys, and other finished goods that American consumers want.

In cutting off rare-earth magnets, officials in Beijing flexed but one finger. If they wanted, they could have strangled vital sectors of the American economy.

How did America lose so much productive capacity to China and end up in such a vulnerable position? Think about it this way: China is an engineering state, which treats construction projects and technological primacy as the solution to all of its problems, whereas the United States is a lawyerly society, obsessed with protecting wealth by making rules rather than producing material goods. Successive American administrations have attempted to counter Beijing through legalism—levying tariffs and designing an ever more exquisite sanctions regime—while the engineering state has created the future by physically building better cars, better-functioning cities, and bigger power plants.

Engineers have quite literally ruled modern China. As a corrective to the ideological mayhem of the Mao years, Deng Xiaoping promoted engineers to the top ranks of China's government from the 1980s onward. By 2002, all nine members of the politburo's standing committee—the apex of the Communist Party—had trained as engineers. Xi Jinping studied chemical engineering at Tsinghua University, China's most prominent science institution. At the start of his third term, in 2022, Xi filled the politburo with executives who had experience in aerospace and weapons.

Huge bursts of construction define today's China. A person born in 1993—when the country built its first modern expressway—was able, when she reached the legal driving age 18 years later, to motor across a network of highways that surpassed the length of America's interstate system. As part of China's economic transformation, officials in Beijing have directed the construction of high bridges, large dams, enormous power plants, and entire new cities. The corporate sector, abetted by government policies that encourage manufacturing, is fixated on production too. A rough rule of thumb is that China produces a third of the world's manufacturing, including essential products such as structural steel and container ships.

Derek Thompson: The disturbing rise of MAGA Maoism

The United States, by contrast, has a government of the lawyers, by the lawyers, and for the lawyers. More than half of U.S. presidents practiced law at some point in their career. About half of current U.S. senators have a law degree. Only two American presidents worked as engineers: Herbert Hoover, who built a fortune in mining, and Jimmy Carter, who served as an engineering officer on a Navy submarine. (Hoover and Carter are remembered for many things, especially for their dismal political instincts that produced thumping electoral defeats.)

Lawyerly instincts suffused Joe Biden's economic policy, which brushed aside the invisible hand in favor of performing surgery on the economy—a subsidy scheme for one corporation, an antitrust case against another. Biden hoped to reindustrialize America via landmark bills such as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act, but his administration's legalistic commitments repeatedly tripped up the pace of construction. Executive agencies were so obsessed with designing rules for how to do things that little ended up being built. Efforts to connect rural areas to broadband or create a network of electric-vehicle-charging stations barely broke ground before voters reelected Donald Trump.

Trump is not a lawyer, but he—like many wealthy Americans—is no stranger to using the courtroom to get what he wants. His business career and his presidency have been rife with lawsuits: against business partners, political opponents, news outlets, and sometimes his own lawyers. Trump's governing style has a litigious air to it too: flinging accusations left and right, intimidating people into dropping their opposition, besmirching people in the court of public opinion. Where Biden was plodding and proceduralist, Trump is naturally inclined toward bare-knuckle lawfare.

The lawyerly society has some important advantages. You can't build companies worth trillions without the rule of law to set up an environment where the rich feel safe to invest. The U.S. remains home to most of the world's most valuable companies, in part because lawyers protect their right to profit off of their intellectual property. But the fact that wealthy companies and individuals can easily assert their interests in court is hardly a guarantee of broad economic progress for a society.

The United States has made the geopolitical mistake of bringing lawyers to a showdown with China on trade and technology. The first Trump administration levied an initial round of tariffs on Chinese goods and added scores of Chinese tech companies to trade blacklists. The Biden administration refined technology-export controls, designing exquisite webs to ensnare Chinese chipmakers, telecommunications firms, and any company hoping to deploy AI. Xi Jinping, meanwhile, surrounded himself with scientists and engineers.

Xi grew up in a China whose Communist Party leaders nursed grievances about imperialist incursions. They understood the Soviet Union to have become strong and modern through heavy industry. China unveiled its first Five-Year Plan in 1953, the year that Xi was born. In the fall of this year, Xi will put the finishing touches on the 15th Five-Year Plan.

Thomas Wright: Trump wasted no time derailing his own AI plan

In the intervening years, ceaseless construction has helped reinforce the Communist Party's political resilience. Building so many homes, bridges, and power plants means that the material benefits for most of China's population are widely spread. Chinese citizens have seen their conditions of life improve immeasurably over the past 40 years. The steady improvement of parks and subway networks makes urban residents expect that the future will be even better. When Chinese people point to new cities that shimmer at night with drone displays, or metropolises connected to one another by a glistening high-­speed-rail network, they show genuine pride, in my experience. One way to impress 1 billion–­plus people is to pour a lot of concrete.

China has also turned itself into an energy superpower. Two decades ago, it produced about half of the electricity that the United States did. Today, it generates twice as much. Beijing is simultaneously attempting to wean itself off oil imports while leading the world in an “all of the above” energy strategy that includes coal, nuclear, and wind plants, plus astounding amounts of new solar capacity. Beijing recently announced the construction of the Yarlung Tsangpo dam, which will use 60 times more cement than the Hoover Dam and will dwarf the already gigantic Three Gorges Dam. By the end of this year, more than half of the cars sold in China today will be electric—again the product of forceful policy.

The engineering state is effective at making military goods too. China produces about 80 percent of the world's consumer drones, which can easily be adapted for the battlefield. China has approximately 200 times the shipbuilding capacity of the United States; according to the Government Accountability Office, many classes of U.S. Navy ships are delayed by up to three years. Last December, then–National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said bluntly that the United States will experience “exhaustion of munition stockpiles very rapidly” if it were ever to face the Chinese military. America has lost the productive capacity to sustain a major war. American manufacturing output has never recovered to its highs from 2008; the manufacturing workforce has shrunk by a million people since then.

The United States has lost the ability to get stuff done as it focuses on procedures rather than results. In 2008, residents of California—the crucible of the American modern economy—voted to fund a high-speed-rail link between San Francisco and Los Angeles. That same year, China began construction of its high-­speed-rail line between Beijing and Shanghai. China's line opened in 2011 at a cost of $33 billion. In its first decade of operation, it completed more than 1.3 billion passenger trips.

Seventeen years after the ballot proposition, California has built a small stretch of rail to connect two cities in the Central Valley, neither of which is close to San Francisco or L.A. The latest estimate for California's rail line is $135 billion. The first segment of California's train will start operating, according to official estimates, between 2030 and 2033. That's a margin of error of three years—the same length of time that China needed to build the entire Beijing–­Shanghai line.

Even far smaller projects—a public bathroom, a bus-stop sun shelter—turn out underwhelming, embarrassingly late, or over budget. Americans today live in the ruins of an industrial civilization where the remaining infrastructure is barely maintained and rarely expanded. The result is a deep sense that nothing is working.

The United States wasn't always like this. It once had the musculature of an engineering state, where lengthy train tracks, gorgeous bridges, beautiful cities, weapons of war with terrible power, and rockets to the moon were built. When the United States had surging population and economic growth through the 19th century, political elites agreed that its wide territories needed canals, rails, and highways. America's construction boom slowed down after the 1960s.

Patrick George: The American car industry can't go on like this

What happened then? The American public revolted against environmental harms, the highways then being rammed through urban neighborhoods, and industry regulators who were cozy with big companies. The legal profession started to change. Before the '60s, prominent lawyers filed into government to enact programs such as FDR's New Deal. Afterward, idealistic law students followed in the footsteps of the young Ralph Nader, who campaigned to be a watchdog of alleged government abuses. “Sue the bastards,” a slogan of that era declared, urging environmentalists and other activists to take government agencies to court.

A righteous impulse from that era has convinced many Americans that physical dynamism is undesirable and has robbed society of its ability to improve itself. Rather than expanding new subway systems, building nuclear-energy plants or rare-earths-processing facilities, or designing the path for a new transmission line, many of the country's smartest engineers have been seduced by Wall Street and Silicon Valley, where they can have more fun and make a lot more money.

I am not suggesting that the United States copy China's approach. The engineering state's spectacular successes have come at staggering costs. Beijing treats its citizens as yet another building material and Chinese society as something to be engineered too. Officials have restricted ethno-religious minorities in Tibet and Xinjiang from practicing their religion and perpetuating their cultures. Only the engineering state could have pursued the one-child policy, which was ultimately a campaign of rural terror enforced through mass sterilizations and forced abortions. China's efforts to engineer the economy—which have produced slumping real-estate values and a collapse in corporate valuations—have frightened entrepreneurs and their investors. Beijing's efforts to engineer society have made many young people feel adrift, with a substantial portion desiring to emigrate abroad.

In spite of sluggish construction, lawyers are a guarantor of America's great advantage against China: pluralism, or the ability of diverse cultures to coexist and thrive under equal protection. Americans are engaged in robust debate about how to make their country better. The United States is more dynamic than Europe and can look to its own history to see the path forward. You can see the remnants of the engineering state amid the mighty industrial works scattered all over the country. Americans can draw on that legacy to stage their country's next act of transformation.

I like to imagine how much better the world would be if both superpowers could adopt the pathologies of the other. China would be better if it could be more lawyerly, which means embracing substantive legal protections for individuals. America needs an engineering culture to build homes, build mass transit, and build the energy systems necessary to decarbonize. Ultimately, if America refuses to build, it will be subject to the whims of countries that do.

Progressives can't afford to trust their guts.

Polling is “90% bullshit.” In fact, all political data is “garbage.” The Democratic consultants who traffic in such numbers are perpetrating a “scam” against their own party and are largely responsible for President Donald Trump's victories. Instead of trying to gauge public opinion through pseudo-scientific surveys, Democrats should mostly just read history and the classics.

This is the gist of John Ganz's recent column, “Against Polling” — a widely-shared polemic that actually earned plaudits from some Democratic pollsters.

Both this piece and its reception are puzzling. Ganz is a brilliant writer with many insightful things to say about history and political philosophy. (I recommend subscribing to his newsletter and buying his book.) Yet his diatribe against “data” is unfair and unpersuasive. He patently mischaracterizes the positions he's arguing against and provides little evidence for his own. He does not acknowledge some obvious objections to his anti-empiricism, let alone rebut them. His piece's valid assertions are uncontested while its contentious ones are unvalidated.

Nevertheless, it was warmly received, even by some whose vocations it disparaged.

I'm not certain why this is. But I fear that Ganz's argument is appealing for the very reason it undermines clear-eyed thinking about electoral politics: it offers an elaborate rationalization for dismissing any data one does not like.

Sign up here for more stories on the lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat — and a closer look at where they should go next. From senior correspondent Eric Levitz.

Ganz's critique is aimed at both political data in general, and a specific set of ideas about Democratic electoral strategy: Principally, the notion that Democratic candidates should seek to increase the salience of their popular positions, avoid talking much about their unpopular ones, and give greater deference to public opinion than the party presently does. This basic outlook is often described as “popularism” (a hideous but useful neologism). And it is championed by, among others, the Democratic data scientist David Shor, the commentator Matt Yglesias, and less prominently (and more equivocally) myself.

In prosecuting his case against popularism, Ganz says many things that are inarguably true. For example — after spending the bulk of his column arguing that public opinion data is “garbage” and “90% bullshit” — he retreats to the claim that polling is “part of getting a picture of the world,” just “not the entirety of it.”

Needless to say, the idea that polling shouldn't be your only tool for discerning reality and the idea that polling is almost entirely fraudulent are pretty different. The first claim is indisputable; the trouble is that no one disputes it.

This is the problem with virtually all of Ganz's valid assertions. He correctly observes that polling is flawed, that public opinion isn't fixed, that not all useful knowledge about politics is quantifiable, and that there is more to good campaigning than mirroring the public's policy preferences. But he does not quote a single Democratic consultant or commentator who rejects these truisms, likely because none do.

Instead of refuting the popularists' actual ideas, Ganz rebuts an absurd ideology of his own invention. He writes that “the worldview of the data guys is based on a giant mistake” — namely, that “there's an objective world out there, and it doesn't change.”

Yet no serious person has ever claimed that public opinion doesn't change. It obviously does. And this is not lost on the “data guys.” David Shor, to take one example, has argued that Democratic politicians have the power to reshape many of their base voters' views, that the Dobbs decision made Americans more liberal on abortion, and that “what people care about and trust [the Democrats] on really is responsive to concrete events that happen in the world.”

On this point, the actual dispute between Ganz and the popularists is not about whether public opinion can change, but about how much scope Democratic politicians have to reshape the views of swing voters — which is to say, voters who do not particularly trust Democratic politicians.

Everyone recognizes that this scope is limited. Most progressives would doubtlessly agree that Democrats can't persuade swing voters to support large new taxes on meat. There may be a strong moral case for making steak more expensive, given the cruelty and ecological harms inherent to large-scale animal agriculture. Were Democrats to campaign on the case for making meat less affordable, however, they would surely do less to change swing voters' views on factory farming than to poison the Democratic Party's image. I seriously doubt that Ganz would contest this.

Assuming he doesn't, then the debate on this point isn't about whether Democrats must acquiesce to the public's existing preferences on some subjects. Rather, it is about 1) what those subjects are and 2) how they can be identified.

These are difficult questions. To answer them, one must make not only empirical judgments but normative ones (chiefly, about how Democratic politicians should weigh the risk of alienating voters against the benefits of evangelizing for worthy causes). It is reasonable to argue that Shor, Yglesias, or any other “data guy” gets these questions wrong. But demonstrating that requires engaging with their actual premises, not shredding a caricature of their worldview.

Ganz comes closest to addressing the data guys' actual views in his discussion of immigration.

In 2024 — and during the early months of Trump's presidency — popularists encouraged Democrats to focus on the electorate's economic concerns, rather than emphasizing the moral case against Trump's mass deportation plan. Ganz argues that this was a mistake, one rooted in an overvaluation of polling data and an underestimation of the electorate's moral judgment.

His argument is as follows: Polling in 2024 indicated that voters agreed with Trump about mass deportation. This led the popularists to discourage Democrats from attacking the cruelty of Trump's vision. But surveys on this subject were fundamentally misleading: Most voters did not harbor any deep commitment to purging the country of hardworking, law-abiding immigrants. And once people actually saw what Trump's policy entailed, they recoiled in horror. Now, a majority of Americans disapprove of the president's handling of immigration.

In Ganz's view, we should not blame the public for failing to anticipate the consequences of Trump's agenda, but rather, the “lazy politicians” and “craven advisers” who prevented Democrats from alerting voters to those harms. By refusing to appeal to the electorate's “faculties of judgement and imagination,” Ganz suggests that the “data guys” abetted Trump's election.

There are many problems with this argument. But most derive from two unsound assumptions at the core of Ganz's reasoning:

• If voters soured on Trump's immigration agenda after witnessing its effects in 2025, then Democrats could have changed their minds about that agenda in 2024, had the party only helped Americans picture those effects.

• If voters disapprove of Trump's handling of immigration, then the Democratic Party must not have any interest in reducing that subject's salience relative to economic issues.

On the first point, it simply isn't true that Democrats failed to warn voters about what mass deportation would entail. To the contrary, on the campaign trail last September, then-Vice President Kamala Harris explicitly appealed to voters' “faculties of judgement and imagination” on this subject, warning that Trump had “pledged to carry out the largest deportation, a mass deportation, in American history. Imagine what that would look like and what that would be? How's that going to happen? Massive raids? Massive detention camps?”

At the time of these remarks, Democrats had been making versions of this argument for nearly a decade. At one point during that period, Trump had used presidential power to separate migrant parents from their children, in a notorious scandal. If all this wasn't enough to persuade swing voters that Trump's approach to immigration was intolerably cruel, why should we be confident that Harris could have convinced them of as much, if only she'd made the case more forcefully?

Ganz offers evidence that public opinion on immigration is sensitive to shifts in objective conditions and media coverage. But it doesn't follow that such opinion is highly responsive to Democratic rhetoric.

Yet there is a more basic problem with Ganz's case: Current polling still indicates that immigration is a source of relative strength for Trump and weakness for the Democratic Party.

In RealClearPolitics's polling average, immigration remains Trump's best issue, with voters disapproving of the president's handling of that subject by only 5 percentage points as of August 15. By contrast, voters disapprove of Trump's management of inflation by 20.5 points, and of the economy more broadly by 11.6 points as of the same time.

More critically, some recent polling indicates that voters still prefer Trump's cruel brand of immigration enforcement to the Democratic Party's perceived laxity on the issue. In a July Wall Street Journal poll, voters said that they trust Republicans more than Democrats to handle immigration by a 17-point margin. On illegal immigration, meanwhile, voters favored the GOP by 24 points.

Therefore, the popularists' basic proposition on this subject — that Democrats have an interest in emphasizing economic issues over immigration — is as plausible today as it was in 2024.

To be clear, none of this necessarily means that Democrats shouldn't spotlight the cruelty of Trump's immigration policies, for non-electoral reasons. In my own view, the popularists can get monomaniacally fixated on political optimization, at the expense of other considerations. Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen's decision to agitate for the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia — an immigrant whom Trump unlawfully deported to El Salvador — may or may not have marginally increased the Democrats' odds of winning the 2026 midterms. But doing so brought comfort to a longtime US resident who was suffering in a nightmarish foreign prison. That seems worthwhile.

Yet Ganz does not frame his case against popularism in purely moral terms. Rather, he asserts that the “data guys” are specifically wrong about how to win elections — so wrong that their polling amounts to “garbage” and a “scam.” His only evidence for this extremely strong claim is that public opinion about immigration has changed since 2024.

In other words, Ganz is guilty of precisely what he accuses the “data guys” of doing: drawing sweeping conclusions on the basis of a myopic and incurious reading of cherry-picked polling data.

It is easy to enumerate the liabilities of polling and election data analysis. The real difficulty lies in naming alternative methods for ascertaining political reality that are more reliable and less vulnerable to motivated reasoning. And Ganz fails to meet that challenge.

He argues that politics is an art — not a science — and can therefore only be mastered through humanistic methods: There is no alternative to studying “the words and actions of politicians past” and the vast philosophical literature on effective rhetoric, beginning with the ancient Greeks. FDR's oratory may not offer the precise guidance of polling, message tests, or elaborate statistical analyses of election results. But Ganz argues that such number crunching can obscure more than it reveals by abstracting away essential context, which can only be captured through a qualitative examination of political history and the classics.

It's surely true that some useful political knowledge can't be represented mathematically, and that history is an indispensable supplement to political science. Yet as a tool for anticipating how voters will respond to a given agenda or message, the humanistic study of “politicians past” has obvious flaws.

For one thing, as Ganz himself emphasizes, public opinion changes over time. Rhetorical tactics and substantive positions that worked in the past may therefore have less purchase in the present. Polling can offer a portrait of contemporary attitudes; history can't.

Further, what history and the classics tell us about optimal electoral strategy in 2025 is extremely indeterminate: By focusing on distinct historical examples or emphasizing different pieces of context, one can draw an enormous variety of different conclusions.

Of course, one can apply quantitative tools in biased ways. But scientific methods impose far greater constraints on motivated reasoning than humanistic inquiry does. Rigorous polling can falsify one's assumptions about public opinion (or at least, cast them into doubt). Analyses of which candidates have outperformed their party in recent elections can validate or undermine certain theories of political best practice. By contrast, no one has ever learned that their policy preferences were unpopular by reading Aristotle.

Ganz's piece unintentionally illustrates his method's susceptibility to biased reasoning. To appreciate how, it's worth quoting his conclusion at length:

The statistical fixation of the early 21st century that's made so many bad predictions and fathered so many puzzling defeats must be abandoned. We are not in an era of small calculations but of great movements. Politicians with a vision and a strong, clear rhetorical appeal, like Trump, Bernie, AOC, and now Mamdani, are those who excite people. People become disappointed and disillusioned when they lapse into focus-group-tested canting. Say something for a change.

It's difficult to say exactly what Ganz is asserting here, since his language is a bit vague and aphoristic. If you squint, you could read him as merely asserting a bunch of truisms (it is bad for a politician to speak in canned lines that sound inauthentic; charisma matters; having an energized base is desirable, all else equal).In the most straightforward reading, though, Ganz appears to be making at least three contentious propositions:

• Democrats' recent defeats were caused by excessive deference to public opinion data.

• Trump's success demonstrates that paying close heed to polling is less important than offering a vision that excites people and mobilizes a “great movement.”

• For a model of the type of Democratic politics that works in our era, one should look to Sen. Bernie Sanders, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani.

None of these claims are self-evidently true. On the first point, one could just as easily assert that Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris lost because they paid too little attention to opinion polling, rather than too much. After all, both declined to embrace many majoritarian positions that contradicted progressive principles. And Harris famously ignored the counsel of data-driven Democratic consultants, who had implored her to focus less on “democracy” and more on the cost of living.

Similarly, it's not obvious that Trump has been more successful than a less charismatic, but more moderate and disciplined, Republican would have been in his place. It's worth remembering that Trump 1) lost the popular vote by 2 million ballots in 2016, despite running against a historically disliked Democratic nominee, 2) lost the presidency in 2020, despite running against a senescent man who could not reliably speak in coherent sentences, 3) won narrowly in 2024, even with the tailwind of a global anti-incumbent backlash, and 4) through it all, has had an unusually low approval rating (for a president or party leader).

It is entirely possible that Republicans would have done much worse over the past nine years, had they been led by a straitlaced moderate with poorly attended rallies. But how does Ganz know that?

Finally, it's difficult to see a firm basis for selecting Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Zohran Mamdani as exemplars of effective Democratic politics in 2025. All are gifted politicians. And I think there are things that the broader Democratic Party can learn from each. Yet they have collectively won zero general elections outside of New York City and Vermont — two of the most Democratic jurisdictions in America. And Mamdani has a negative 9 percent favorability rating in New York state, according to a Siena College poll released this week.

The challenge facing Democrats today is not how to win a New York City mayoral election, but how to win presidential races in Pennsylvania and Senate contests in North Carolina. And Ganz offers no evidence that appealing to majoritarian opinion in those places (as measured through scientific methods) is less important than exciting “great movements,” in the manner that Sanders, AOC, and Mamdani have.

All of which is to say: By dismissing “scientific” methods of evaluating claims about political reality, Ganz enables himself to draw strong conclusions about how Democrats can best disempower the GOP — without providing much in the way of substantiation or even argument. And those conclusions happen to be ideologically convenient for Ganz, whose social democratic politics are well-represented by Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez, and Mamdani.

This is what I find insidious about his whole argument: It serves to insulate progressives' intuitions about electoral politics from any empirical challenge.

This is a problem, not least because the left's political intuitions are liable to be biased, unless disciplined by data.

Left-wing activists and public intellectuals have strong incentives to believe that there are minimal tensions between the progressive movement's factional project (to pull Democrats leftward) and the Democratic Party's electoral one (to disempower the Republican Party). If there were large trade-offs between these two endeavors, then such progressives might have a moral obligation to counsel some form of moderation. After all, as the Trump administration demonstrates on a near-daily basis, the stakes of keeping the authoritarian right out of power are extremely high.

Yet one cannot advocate for a more ideologically cautious Democratic Party without risking estrangement from other progressives. In principle, there is no reason why it couldn't be true that social democracy is the most just political system and that — at this particular point in history — the Democratic Party would win many more elections if it moderated on some issues. The latter is an empirical judgment, not a normative one. Yet to articulate this view as a progressive is to jeopardize your sense of belonging and esteem among those who share your moral commitments. Doing so is sure to get you derisively branded as a “centrist.” Some progressive writers may even feel comfortable calling you a “craven” scammer without evidence.

Thus, anyone who finds community and identity in progressive politics — a group that includes a large share of Democratic operatives, staffers, and commentators — is liable to err on the side of underestimating the political utility of moderation. Polling and election data are the only real checks on such a bias. And Ganz's piece provides a rationalization for dismissing them.

None of this is to say that the popularists are necessarily right about how Democrats can win elections, much less about how the party should balance the dictates of principle against those of political expediency. The latter is an inescapably value-laden question, which data cannot resolve. Yet you can't formulate a morally serious answer to that dilemma without a plausible conception of political reality. And scientific methods remain our best tools for forming such a conception. For all of polling's flaws, there is still no better way to find out what voters think than to ask them (or more specifically, a representative sample of them, using maximally neutral question wordings). And for all the methodological disputes among political scientists, there is still no better way to discern which types of candidates most voters favor than to rigorously examine whom they elect.

In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. That kind of journalism isn't easy.

It's so easy get addicted these days. The apps are counting on it.

Almost every tech platform is designed to grab your attention and never let it go. You give it clicks, and it gives you dopamine. Games, news updates, social media hits — they all run on the same logic. We can add a new activity to the list: gambling. In just a few years, sports betting has gone from a legal gray area to a mainstream multibillion-dollar industry.

And this isn't just about sports. It's about how our economy increasingly exploits our cognitive biases and our irrationality, and how institutions — governments, media companies, even the sports leagues — have partnered in this system, because they all want a cut of the action.

Jonathan Cohen is the author of Losing Big: America's Reckless Bet on Sports Gambling. It's a new book about the financial infrastructures that we've built on top of psychological vulnerabilities. I invited him onto The Gray Area to talk about how this happened so fast, what online gambling shares with social media and crypto, and how destructive — on a human level — all of this has been.

As always, there's much more in the full podcast, so listen and follow The Gray Area on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pandora, or wherever you find podcasts. New episodes drop every Monday.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Tell me about the 2018 Supreme Court case that opened the floodgates for sports gambling seemingly overnight.

In 1992, the sports leagues went to Congress because of a threat, that was real at the time, of states legalizing sports gambling. And Congress passed a law called The Professional Amateur Sports Protection Act that banned states from legalizing sports betting. And then, in 2018, the Supreme Court rendered PASPA, as it was called, unconstitutional on the grounds of basically states' rights. And so, starting in 2018 with the Supreme Court decision, states are allowed to legalize sports gambling if they so choose.

How many states have chosen to do it? And how quickly?

Delaware did within six weeks. Today, as we're talking in July of 2025, we have 38 states and Washington, DC, with legal sports gambling; 30 with online legal sports gambling; probably soon to be 39 and 31 later this year with Missouri.

FanDuel and DraftKings are the names almost everyone knows. How much of the pie do they control?

A lot. Those are the major players, almost to the point of a duopoly, defining the industry. And they have, I would say, around 80 percent, maybe 85 percent of market share. And of course it depends on some states. There are lots of other companies out there fighting for third, fourth, fifth place.

What happened to online gambling during the COVID era?

It takes off politically in places like New York because of the fiscal crunch faced by states. And this isn't a new thing. It goes back to the lottery, and even during the Great Depression, when slot machines were legalized in four states because they needed the revenue.

Lawmakers have this belief that there's always more money in the gambling cookie jar. Oh, we need money. Let's just legalize more forms of gambling, and that will make up for our revenue shortfalls. Politically, that's exactly what happens during COVID in places like New York and in other states.

But to your point about COVID, we have a lot of people sitting on their couches and a lot of professional sports are starting to come back. And lo and behold, there's a new app on their phone where they can legally, seamlessly, frictionlessly gamble. So you can imagine the way the industry grows its market share and grows its foothold in that time.

The gambling companies promise the states all this easy revenue, and they go all in. How does that bet work out for them?

This is what's tough about gambling in general and sports betting in particular. In most cases, it actually has met expectations if you were the fiscally responsible person who is reading the budget projections. But the question is at what cost?

Let's talk about the cost, especially the human cost. 

You open the book with this story about a young guy named Kyle whose life was completely ripped apart. Why did you start there? What does his story capture about these gambling apps and how they're designed?

I thought Kyle was emblematic of what's happened here. He's a 26-year-old white guy who ran into trouble gambling on sports, but then even more specifically because he was someone who had gambled before sports betting went live but had never run into trouble until it appeared on his phone. But he was just really excited for sports. He was a sports fan, and he started betting pretty quickly.

At some point, I don't know when his personal tipping point came, but it came, and gambling went from being something he did as part of his life to being basically his entire life. He wasn't going out; he wasn't hanging out with friends. He was just gambling. It was so instantly accessible to him. That was all he was doing. And he was drinking, he was smoking more because he was so stressed out from his gambling. He falls behind on his rent. His dad has to bail him out. Things go very badly very quickly.

To paint a picture: Kyle was making $65,000 a year, and at one point, he wagered close to $93,000 on bets in a single month. Eventually, he gets fired. He goes on unemployment, and then blows all the unemployment money on betting. And then he moves back in with his parents. 

Yeah. I picked him because he is a young man, and this is the demographic it's happening to. It completely interrupted his life. There's a black hole in his life for two or three years, where he was consumed by gambling and the stress from gambling and the financial and mental health deterioration wrought by gambling.

Why are young men in particular so vulnerable to this?

First of all, young men are not exactly known for being judicious and careful, especially when it comes to money. They don't have great impulse control. You could already imagine how that would set them up poorly for something like this.

They're also — and I'll speak for myself as a formerly young male sports fan — overconfident about their knowledge of sports. Sports gambling companies absolutely take advantage of this. There's a FanDuel ad saying something like “never waste a hunch,” challenging you to prove that you “know ball” by betting on your hunches.

Young men want to prove to their friends [and] to talk show radio hosts that they know ball, and gambling is presented as a way for them to do so.

And then [there is] “financial nihilism” among young people and young men in particular. Many young men have disposable income, [but it's] maybe not so much that they're ever going to realistically buy a house or pay off their student loan or start a business. So they might as well gamble.

Whether it's on sports betting, whether it's on crypto, whether it's on stock markets, whether it's on video game skins — it's not worth having $10,000 in their pocket. It's worth having a chance at $100,000 or a million dollars. And they're willing, as a result, to gamble and gamble more and gamble in riskier ways than they otherwise would.

What percentage of the industry's revenue comes from the Kyles of the world? Not the pros or high rollers — regular working people who are addicted to gambling?

Sixty percent of betters account for 1 percent of revenue from NFL bets. If you do the flip side, 82 percent of the money is coming from 3 percent of betters. Some of those people I'll flag are going to be really rich VIP betters like Phil Mickelson, who gambles a ton. But you can imagine there's a lot of Kyles caught up in that group or in the interstitial group between them.

What makes online sports betting fundamentally different — and more seductive — than traditional gambling? 

What makes it different from everything that we had before 2018 is the seamlessness. It's the app design that's just as good and just as seamless and just as frictionless as social media or a shopping app. And there's an endless, endless, endless menu of betting options.

You can bet on, sure, the LSU Tigers to win the game. You can also bet on whether the first half kickoff is going to be a touchback. And then you can bet on whether the next pitch in a baseball game is going to be 88 miles an hour or faster. You can bet on a tennis serve. And then at 3:00 in the morning when you're on this bender, you're in this rabbit hole and you lost all [your] money all day, you can bet on Malaysian women's doubles badminton.

It's not a brick-and-mortar casino. They can't pump oxygen into the room. They can't pull the clocks off the wall like they can at the casino. But they can, with little behavioral nudges, design into the app some of those tricks of the trade.

When these platforms detect — and they have plenty of data to do it — that someone is trying to wean themselves off betting, or when they spot problematic play, what do they do? Do they leave that person alone and let them wean themselves off? Or do they slam them with promotional credits and deals trying to hook them back in?

The anecdotal evidence suggests that they do the latter. I've seen reports suggesting that they even figure out when your payday is, and they'll send you more promotional credits and offers on those days.

The data that they have on gamblers would make Las Vegas of the 1950s weep. It's incredible how much data they must have on every single one of us. They claim that this allows them to protect people and to flag users who are betting problematically, who are logging in too many times. But I have seen no indications that that's how they're using the data. It seems like they're instead using it to pair someone who's betting a lot with a VIP host and offer behavioral nudges and emails, auspiciously timed to re-engage them and to keep them in the cycle.

Do they kick people off when they're consistently winning? They're clearly capable of identifying problems and responding to them.

Yes, absolutely. And some professional gamblers I talked to, they make a habit of every once in a while placing a really, really vanilla ice cream–looking bet. They'll bet on Aaron Judge to hit a home run or the LA Lakers to win the championship, because they want to look as stupid as possible, so that the sportsbook thinks that they're a normie and not a professional gambler.

Because the second [companies] realize that they're a professional gambler or that they can win money, they'll just kick them off the platform. But as long as [the professional gamblers] can make [the companies] think they're an idiot and that they're going to lose or that they're addicted, the platforms want to keep them playing.

The industry loves to use phrases like “responsible gambling.” What is your issue with people being personally responsible, Jonathan?

I don't have an issue with personal responsibility, and I do think people have agency and should have agency over their own life. Fine. That being said, it's not simply that it's Kyle against the sportsbook. It's Kyle against a multibillion-dollar corporation that is doing everything in its power to hook him and extract every last dollar of his discretionary income.

They say, Oh, if you want to set a deposit limit, if you want to set a time limit, you can do that. But [those tools] are rooted in a user opting in to decide to set a time limit, deciding to set a deposit limit.

Fundamentally, what it's doing is putting the onus of responsibility of “responsible play” onto the gambler, onto the individual, rather than onto the company to responsibly provision the gambler with a non-addictive product or a product that is not maliciously designed to extract every last dollar that they have in their bank account.

Are there signs that the companies are getting better at this? That policymakers are taking this more seriously in terms of identifying problem gamblers and offering resources to help them get over that problem?

Not on their own. If there's a reason for hope, I would say it's coming from outside.

There are advocacy groups that are filing class action lawsuits over some of these companies' most insidious behaviors, these crazy promotions that offer $25,000 in bonus cash, but you actually need to bet $100,000 to get the $25,000 bonus or whatever it may be. There's also a lawsuit ongoing in New Jersey over VIP hosts, the company's employees whose job it is to find big bettors and keep them betting.

Maybe we're going to have some of the regulation that I wished we had initially had seven years ago. To the degree that there was momentum for it, I don't think it's coming yet from the companies themselves, as much as it is from advocates who are waking up to the harms.

Trump's DC police takeover doesn't poll well. But the public continues to distrust Democrats on crime.

Donald Trump's federal takeover of Washington, DC's police force — which looks like something between an authoritarian power grab and an empty stunt — doesn't look like a political winner at first glance.

A poll from YouGov last week showed little support for Trump's move; 34 percent of respondents approved of the idea, and 47 percent disapproved.

Yet the pushback from Democrats — which often focused on pointing out that DC crime was trending downward, or arguing it wasn't such a serious problem — shows why the larger crime issue remains perilous for them, and advantageous for Trump.

Though Trump is unpopular, crime remains one of his strongest issues, and one of the Democratic Party's worst.

That sticks in Democrats' craw. Trump's recitation of DC crime statistics was filled with blatant misrepresentations. Furthermore, Trump himself was indicted four times, and he notably pardoned even the violent rioters of January 6, 2021. How could they be losing the law and order issue to this guy?

Yet the polling says very clearly that they are.

In May, separate polls from both CNN and YouGov asked respondents about which party they trusted more on over a dozen different issues, and both found that crime was the Democrats' worst of all. (The GOP had a 13-point advantage in one poll, and a 12-point advantage in the other.)

It hasn't always been this way. Even as recently as 2021, the two parties were about evenly matched in polling from Langer Research. But in 2022, the GOP's advantage on crime surged to its highest in decades of the firm's polling — and it hasn't gone away since.

That's for a pretty straightforward reason: A large majority of the public became convinced, due to very real rising crime rates, that crime in cities had become a very serious problem and that tougher policies are necessary — but Democrats often don't seem like they feel the same way.

The crime rates have since declined, but voter concerns haven't gone away. In last week's YouGov poll, a large majority — 67 percent — believed crime was a major problem in US cities, and only 23 percent thought it was a minor problem.

And back in April 2024, the Pew Research Center asked registered voters whether they believed the US criminal justice system was generally too tough on criminals, or not tough enough. It wasn't even close. A mere 13 percent chose “too tough,” while 61 percent said “not tough enough.”

Notably, even a plurality of Biden supporters (40 percent of them) believed the system was “not tough enough,” while just 21 percent of them thought it was too tough. Among the public, the belief that the criminal justice system is overly harsh on criminals is a fringe view. But among progressive activists, it's a core belief.

For the past decade, the intellectual and organizing energy among progressive criminal justice activists has been around preventing police violence and making sentencing of criminals more lenient. In these circles, distrust of police and law enforcement and disdain for mass incarceration were widespread, and concern about crime in cities became viewed as racially coded.

Responding to these pressures, Democratic politicians struck an increasingly awkward balance on crime issues. They've tried to disavow “defund the police,” and big city mayors who have crime-concerned constituents have tried to get tough. But it hasn't been enough to change the party's brand.

Why not? Another YouGov poll — taken in September 2024 — asked respondents about several of then-presidential candidate Kamala Harris's criminal justice policy proposals and Trump's. Harris's specific proposals were generally more popular.

But on the question of who would do a better job handling crime? Trump had an 8-point advantage.

That's because voters don't make up their minds by tallying a policy laundry list. They look for signals about “whose side are you on?” And Trump has signaled in many ways that he's on the “tough on crime” side. Democrats' signals have been more mixed.

So when Democrats are tempted to say anyone worried about DC's crime level is ignorant, a scaredy-cat, or a demagogue, they should be aware they're going out on a limb.

While voters may think Trump is going too far or mishandling certain cases, the broader crime issue remains favorable to him. It will take some serious work for Democrats to change that perception. Crime remains one of the party's most glaring political weaknesses.

Business Insider Edition 

Uganda has inaugurated its first large-scale gold mine, a $250 million Chinese-owned project in the east of the country.


        Uganda has inaugurated its first large-scale gold mine, a $250 million Chinese-owned project in the east of the country that includes facilities to refine bullion to 99.9% purity, the president's office said.
    


        The East African nation, rich in copper, cobalt, and iron ore, is seeking to expand its mining industry and establish itself as a major gold producer, according to Reuters.
    


        Gold has already become Uganda's largest foreign-exchange earner, generating $3.4 billion in export revenue last year, accounting for about 37% of total exports, although much of that came from re-exported gold. Domestic production has been largely confined to artisanal miners.

        By comparison, Ghana, Africa's top gold producer, earned $11.6 billion from exports in 2023.
    


""In order to wake up in the minerals sector, we must have full value addition for all minerals like gold, lithium, tin among others,"" President Yoweri Museveni said.
    


        Over the years, African leaders and countries have sought to restrict the direct export of valuable minerals in raw form. The practice has long been criticised, as it drains potential revenue from Africa while value-added processing is carried out abroad.

        Now operational, the plant is expected to process 5,000 tons of ore per day and produce about 1.2 metric tons of refined gold annually, far higher than Uganda's total output of 0.0042 tons in 2023.
    


        Museveni said gold revenues will help finance strategic assets, such as power plants, and a $3.16 billion standard-gauge railway under construction, which aims to lower transport costs for exports and imports via neighbouring Kenya.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","An early member of Google's generative AI team says it's too late to get a Ph.D. to cash in on the AI hype","https://www.businessinsider.com/google-ai-team-too-late-phd-ai-hype-jad-tarifi-2025-8","Mon, 18 Aug 2025 00:18:00 GMT","

The cutthroat race for AI talent has seen tech giants like Meta dangling exorbitant bonuses in the hundreds of millions to lure talent.

But Jad Tarifi, who founded Google's first generative AI team, told Business Insider that he would not encourage people to get a Ph.D. just to cash in on the AI hype.

""AI itself is going to be gone by the time you finish a Ph.D. Even things like applying AI to robotics will be solved by then. So either get into something niche like AI for biology, which is still in its very early stages, or just don't get into anything at all,"" Tarifi said.

Tarifi, 42, got his Ph.D. in AI from the University of Florida in 2012. He joined Google in 2012 and spent nearly a decade with the search giant. In 2021, Tarifi started his own AI startup, Integral AI.

Tarifi said doctoral studies are an ordeal that only ""weird people"" — much like he was — should undertake, because it involves sacrificing ""five years of your life and a lot of pain.""

""I don't think anyone should ever do a Ph.D. unless they are obsessed with the field,"" Tarifi said.

And now, with the world advancing as fast as it is, you can achieve a lot more outside school, he added.

""If you are unsure, you should definitely default to 'no,' and focus on just living in the world,"" Tarifi said. ""You will move much faster. You'll learn a lot more. You'll be more adaptive to how things are changed.""

Degrees that take a long time to complete, like law and medicine, are in trouble, too, Tarifi said.

""In the current medical system, what you learn in medical school is so outdated and based on memorization,"" he said, adding that people might end up ""throwing away eight years"" of their lives for their advanced degrees.

Tarifi said people who want to thrive in the age of AI should develop social skills and empathy. This is because while the hard sciences can be learned, expertise at prompting and using AI involves ""emotional attunement"" and ""good taste.""

""The best thing to work on is more internal. Meditate. Socialize with your friends. Get to know yourself emotionally,"" Tarifi said.

Tarifi said that when it comes to AI, one does not need to master every single detail to work in the industry.

""I have a Ph.D. in AI, but I don't know how the latest microprocessor works,"" Tarifi added. ""For example, you can drive a car, but you might not know every single thing about the car. But if you know what to do if something goes wrong, that's good enough.""

Tarifi isn't the only one who says that leaning into one's passions will become critical when navigating a world disrupted by AI.

Paul Graham, the founder of startup incubator Y Combinator, said in an X post on August 5 that low-level programming jobs are ""already disappearing"" because AI is ""good at scutwork.""

""So I think the best general advice for protecting oneself from AI is to do something so well that you're operating way above the level of scutwork,"" Graham wrote.

""It's hard to do something really well if you're not deeply interested in it,"" he added.

In this article

MSNBC will change its name later this year and drop the storied peacock image from its branding — the first real public-facing changes in Versant's upcoming separation from Comcast's NBCUniversal.

The political news network will be renamed My Source News Opinion World, or MS Now, Versant Chief Executive Officer Mark Lazarus wrote in an internal memo to employees that was seen by CNBC.

In January, Lazarus told a group of MSNBC staffers that the network wouldn't change its name. But during the past few months of transition planning, NBCUniversal leaders decided MSNBC should take on a new name ""to accelerate the distinction between the MSNBC and NBC News organizations,"" Lazarus wrote in the memo Monday.

MSNBC President Rebecca Kutler added in her own note to employees that the news group's focus won't change.

""While our name will be changing, who we are and what we do will not. Our commitment to our work and our audiences will not waiver from what the brand promise has been for three decades,"" she wrote.

MSNBC has been undergoing aggressive hiring for about 100 new positions to stand up its own newsroom independent from NBC News. The network has already hired about 40 journalists from CNN, Bloomberg, Politico and other news organizations to establish its first-ever Washington, D.C., bureau.

""During this time of transition, NBCUniversal decided that our brand requires a new, separate identity,"" Kutler wrote. ""This decision now allows us to set our own course and assert our independence as we continue to build our own modern newsgathering operation.""

While MSNBC and NBC News will have duplications in coverage, CNBC's news organization is already separate enough from NBC News that executives decided it didn't need a name change. Also, technically, the ""NBC"" in ""CNBC"" never stemmed from National Broadcasting Co. Rather, CNBC stands for ""Consumer News and Business Channel.""

Still, CNBC will likewise be getting a new logo without the famed NBCUniversal peacock. This will be true for all of Versant's brands that have a peacock in the logo. Sports content on the USA Network and Golf Channel will be branded together under USA Sports. Digital companies GolfNow and SportsEngine will also change their logos.

The MSNBC name change and the new logos will all be introduced before the end of the year, when Versant plans to spin out as a publicly traded company.

MSNBC will soon kick off a national marketing campaign to accompany the launch of the new name, ""unlike anything we have done in recent memory,"" Kutler noted in her memo Monday.

MSNBC is the second-most watched cable news network, averaging 1.2 million prime-time viewers year to date. The network has 28 on-air anchors, 21 correspondents and reporters, and provides more than 120 hours of live programming each week.

Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC under the proposed spinoff.

In this article

Alphabet's Google and Kairos Power will deploy an advanced nuclear plant connected to the Tennessee Valley Authority's electric grid by 2030, the companies announced Monday.

TVA has agreed to purchase up to 50 megawatts of power from Kairos' Hermes 2 reactor. It is the first utility in the U.S. to sign a power purchase agreement with an advanced reactor like Hermes 2, according to the companies.

Hermes 2 is the first deployment under an agreement that Google and Kairos signed last year to launch the startup's nuclear technology at a commercial scale. The reactor's output is the equivalent of the consumption of about 36,000 homes. The electricity will help power Google's data centers in Montgomery County, Tennessee, and Jackson County, Alabama.

Google, Kairos and TVA said their collaboration will move the U.S. a step closer to deploying advanced nuclear reactors by making sure consumers are not on the hook for the cost of building the plant.

Kairos and Google will bear the financial risk associated with building the first-of-a-kind project, the companies said. TVA, meanwhile, is providing the revenue stream the plant will need to operate through the power purchase agreement.

""We think this solves the problem of making sure that consumers don't carry that first-of-a-kind cost and risk,"" TVA CEO Don Moul told CNBC. ""But it also allows innovators like Kairos Power and thought leaders like Google to bring this to market.""

Hermes 2 is expected to start operating at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, in 2030. Kairos received a construction permit for the reactor from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in November 2024. It will need to apply for an operating license with the NRC before the plant can start operations.

TVA declined to disclose how much it will pay for electricity from Hermes 2 when asked by CNBC. Kairos declined to disclose the estimated cost of the plant.

The U.S. has basically stopped building nuclear plants due to the huge cost overruns and delays that plague the industry. The last two reactors built in the U.S. at Plant Vogtle in Georgia cost $18 billion more than expected and started operations seven years behind schedule in 2023 and 2024. The project's problems contributed to the bankruptcy of industry stalwart Westinghouse.

Startups like Kairos believe their smaller plants will prove to be faster and more affordable to build than large reactors like those at Vogtle, helping to usher in a new era of nuclear construction in the U.S. Despite these promises, utilities have been reluctant to commit to small advanced reactors over concerns about the initial price tag.

Technology companies like Google, meanwhile, are investing in advanced nuclear because they want reliable, carbon-free power to meet the demand from artificial intelligence while adhering to their environmental goals. Google has placed orders with Kairos for reactors totaling 500 megawatts of power that are targeted to come online through 2035.

""We specifically want to help commercialize,"" Amanda Peterson Corio, Google's global head of data center energy, told CNBC. ""We want to see how can we take this from something small to something bigger that we can deploy at scale. That's really what the Hermes 2 project is doing.""

One of Kairos' goals with Hermes 2 is to create a standardized reactor design which will help cut the cost of future deployments, CEO Mike Laufer told CNBC. Kairos will also develop the supply and manufacturing infrastructure needed to launch at scale through the construction of Hermes 2, he said.

""We'd be ready to deploy multiple reactors in series at the same sites in a very cost-efficient way to deliver that power at affordable rates in the not too distant future,"" Laufer said. Kairos and Google are exploring options on where future plants will be deployed, he said.

Kairos' technology is different than the reactors currently operating in the U.S. Its reactor design uses liquid salt as the coolant rather than light water, which allows the plant to operate at near atmospheric pressure. This means Kairos can use thinner and less expensive materials because the reactor is not under high pressure. Operating at low pressure also has safety advantages.

The 50-megawatt plant is also much smaller than the reactors in the current U.S. fleet that average 1,000 megawatts in output, which is enough to power an entire city. The Kairos reactor will increase its output to 75 megawatts when it launches on a commercial scale, Laufer said.

Hermes 2 will be deployed near Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which has a long history in nuclear science dating back to the Manhattan Project during World War II. TVA was established by Congress during the Great Depression as a public corporation to electrify the region. The utility remains owned by the federal government.

""This kind of sets the stage for east Tennessee to really be what we see as a regional hub for innovation for nuclear construction and operation, and that's going to be valuable for the nation as well,"" Laufer said.

BEIJING — Chinese electric car companies are increasing investments in overseas factories as they ramp up competition against Tesla and other global automakers.

For the first time since records going back to 2014, the Chinese electric car supply chain last year invested more outside the country than at home, according to a U.S.-based consulting firm Rhodium Group report published Monday.

The bulk of announced overseas investment, or 74%, was in battery factories, the report said. But it noted investment in assembly plants abroad was also ""growing rapidly.""

The spending plans come as Chinese automakers face intense competition at home and higher tariffs on exports. Boosting investments abroad can help Chinese businesses win foreign governments' support for market expansion.

""Growing regulatory pushback in host markets like the EU is raising barriers to entry and will push more Chinese companies to establish local manufacturing operations,"" the Rhodium report said.

The Chinese electric car industry's domestic investment in manufacturing tumbled sharply to $15 billion in 2024 from $41 billion in 2023 — after peaking at over $90 billion in 2022 in announced projects, according to Rhodium data.

While overseas investment has remained far lower, it ""narrowly surpassed"" domestic levels in 2024 for the first time, the report said, without sharing an exact figure.

Automotive was the second-most active sector for Chinese outbound investment in the second quarter this year, according to a separate Rhodium study released late July. The materials and metals sector ranked first.

""We recorded higher than usual activity by EV parts manufacturers, with eight transactions exceeding $100 million,"" the July report said. ""The largest among them was led by GEM, a Chinese battery materials manufacturer, which committed $293 million to expand its ternary precursors facility in Indonesia.""

Several overseas factory projects announced in recent years have also begun operations.

Great Wall Motor announced over the weekend it opened its first factory in Brazil on Friday local time. The company is also reportedly considering another factory in the region and would make the decision as soon as the middle of next year. The Chinese automaker did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.

BYD also started production at its first Brazil factory in July, despite getting fined earlier in the year over labor practices. The Chinese electric car giant has sold more than 545,000 cars overseas this year as of July, exceeding the total of more than 417,000 vehicles for the whole of 2024, according to CNBC calculations of publicly disclosed data.

Earlier this summer, Chinese battery supplier Envision announced in June it officially started production at its first factory in France.

However, those investments abroad comprise completed projects only.

Just 25% of all announced overseas manufacturing plans by the Chinese electric car industry have been completed, far below the 45% rate for those at home, Rhodium said in Monday's report, noting projects outside the country are twice as likely to get cancelled.

""Chinese firms will also have to manage Beijing's increasing concern over technology leakage, job losses, and industrial hollowing-out, which may result in tighter controls on outbound investment in strategic sectors,"" the report said.

In this article

Novo Nordisk on Monday said it now offers cash-paying U.S. patients its blockbuster diabetes treatment Ozempic for less than half its monthly list price, as drugmakers face mounting political pressure to lower prices in the country.

Patients can pay $499 in cash per month for three dose sizes of Ozempic. They can get the price through platforms including the drug's official website, Novo Nordisk's patient assistance program and the company's recently launched direct-to-consumer online pharmacy, the latter of which also ships the injection directly to patients' homes. 

Drug savings company GoodRx will also offer Ozempic and its weight loss counterpart Wegovy for $499 per month, making the discounts available at more than 70,000 pharmacies nationwide, according to a Novo Nordisk release.

""We've seen skyrocketing demand from our consumer base for these highly sought after therapies, yet millions of people still lack adequate insurance coverage,"" said GoodRx CEO Wendy Barnes in a statement. ""With this collaboration, we're making a significant step forward in our broader effort to fill the gaps in coverage when insurance falls short."" 

Novo Nordisk's cash-pay offering will expand access to eligible Type 2 diabetes patients who don't have insurance coverage for the weekly injection. In March, the company began to offer Wegovy for half its list price to cash-paying Americans. 

Ozempic's list price before insurance and other rebates is almost $1,350 per month, and has been a frequent target of political and public blowback in recent years. The new offer comes after President Donald Trump in July sent separate letters to Novo Nordisk and 16 other drugmakers, calling on them to take steps to lower medication prices in the U.S. Among other suggested actions, he urged them to adopt models that sell medicines directly to consumers or businesses. 

The efforts aim to make Ozempic and Wegovy available to more people, while also ensuring that patients use the branded medication instead of cheaper compounded copycats. Those drugs exploded in popularity during a now-resolved U.S. shortage of Novo Nordisk's semaglutide, the active ingredient in both drugs.

While Ozempic ""is well covered in the US, let's not forget that there are some patients who pay out-of-pocket for this vital medicine,"" Dave Moore, executive vice president of U.S. operations and global business development at Novo Nordisk, said in the release. ""We believe that if even a single patient feels the need to turn to potentially unsafe and unapproved knockoff alternatives, that's one too many.""

Eli Lilly has similarly moved to slash the price of its popular obesity and diabetes drugs for cash-paying patients. The two companies are fighting to dominate the market for so-called GLP-1s, which mimic certain gut hormones to suppress appetite and regulate blood sugar.

The so-called great resignation has become the ""great stay."" But experts say workers aren't just staying — they're ""job hugging.""

Job hugging is the act of holding onto a job ""for dear life,"" consultants at Korn Ferry, an organizational consulting firm, wrote last week.

The rate at which workers are voluntarily leaving their jobs — known as the quits rate — has hovered around 2% since the start of the year, according to data from the U.S. Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. Outside of the initial days of the Covid-19 pandemic, levels haven't been that consistently low since early 2016.

The quits rate is a barometer of workers' perceptions of the broader labor market, said Laura Ullrich, director of economic research in North America at the Indeed Hiring Lab. In this case, they may be nervous about getting another job or aren't enthusiastic about their ability to find one, she said.

The current clinging is a stark contrast from the historic rate of job-hopping that workers exhibited in 2021 and 2022, but experts say it makes sense given current labor market trends.

The share of jobseekers who are ""not confident at all"" that there are ""plenty of jobs"" available has increased steadily, to 38% in the second quarter from about 26% three years earlier, according to a quarterly poll by ZipRecruiter.

""There is this stagnation in the labor market, where the hires, quits and layoff rates are low,"" said Ullrich. ""There's just not a lot of movement at all.""

""There's quite a bit of uncertainty in the world — economic, political, global — and I think uncertainty causes people to naturally"" remain in a holding pattern, said Matt Bohn, an executive search consultant at Korn Ferry.

He equated the dynamic to skittish investors who sometimes sit on the sidelines, waiting for an investment opportunity.

The job market has also gradually cooled amid a regime of higher interest rates, which makes it more costly for businesses to borrow money and expand their operations.

The hiring rate over the past year or so has plunged to its lowest pace in more than a decade (excluding the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic) — meaning those who want to look for a new job may have a relatively tough time finding one.

Job growth in recent months has also slowed sharply, which economists point to as evidence of a broader economic slowdown. The ratio of job openings per unemployed worker has fallen by about half since peaking at about 2:1 in March 2022; it was roughly 1:1 in June 2025, the latest month of available federal data.

More CEOs reported plans to shrink their workforce over the next 12 months than expand it — the first time that's occurred since 2020, according to a Conference Board quarterly poll published earlier this month. The shares were 34% to 27%, respectively.

While it's not inherently bad to stay in a job for a long time, job ""hugging"" can pose some risks for the unwary, experts said.

For one, they may be sacrificing some earnings growth, since job switchers generally command higher wage growth than those who remain in their current roles, Ullrich said.

For example, workers who get too comfortable in their current role may stagnate rather than take on additional responsibility or learn new skills, which may impact marketability and career growth when the labor market improves, Bohn said. Employers may also decide such workers are no longer meeting their performance standards, he added.

Additionally, a lack of movement in the job market may make it harder for new entrants like recent graduates to find work, Ullrich said.

Correction: This article has been updated to correct the timing of the Korn Ferry and Conference Board reports.

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

The crypto market tumbled to begin the week as heightened macro concerns triggered more than $500 million in forced selling of long positions.

The price of bitcoin was last lower by 1% at $116,048.09, after touching a new all-time high last week – its fourth one this year – at $124,496. At one point, it fell as low as $114,706. Ether slid 3% to $4,325.21 after coming within spitting distance of its roughly $4,800 record last week. Both coins rolled over after higher-than-expected July wholesale inflation data raised questions over a Federal Reserve rate cut in September.

Investors' profit-taking triggered a wave of liquidations across the crypto market.

In the past 24 hours, sales from 133,643 traders totaled $576.35 million, according to Coin Glass. That figure includes about $124 million in long bitcoin liquidations and $184 million in long ether liquidations. This happens when traders are forced to sell their assets at market price to settle their debts, pushing prices lower.

Adding to investor disappointment were comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who clarified Thursday that the strategic bitcoin reserve President Donald Trump established back in March will be confined to bitcoin forfeited to the federal government, as it explores ""budget-neutral pathways to acquire more bitcoin.""

The top cryptocurrencies by market cap fell with the blue-chip coins, with the CoinDesk 20 index, a measure of the broader crypto market, down 3.7%. Crypto related stocks were under pressure. Bitmine Immersion was down 8%. Crypto exchange Bullish, which made its public trading debut last week, was lower by 7%. Circle and Coinbase each fell 2%.

This week, investors are keeping an eye on the Fed's annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming for clues around what could happen at the central bank's remaining policy meetings this year. Crypto traders also will be watching Thursday's jobless claims data.

Last week's test of bitcoin and ether highs surprised traders who expected an August pullback for cryptocurrencies, expecting macro concerns to steal focus from recent momentum around crypto's institutional and corporate adoption – especially in what has historically proven a weak trading month for many markets – until the September Fed meeting.

Many see pullbacks this month as healthy and strategic cooldowns rather than reactions to crisis, thanks largely to support from crypto ETFs as well as companies focused on aggressively accumulating bitcoin and ether. Although ETFs tracking the price of bitcoin and ether posted net outflows on Friday, they logged net inflows of $547 million and $2.9 billion, respectively, for the week. For ETH funds it was a record week of inflows as well as their 14th consecutive week of inflows.

LONDON — Three goals are topping the agenda as several European leaders join Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to meet U.S. leader Donald Trump in Washington, D.C.

Friday's Alaska summit raised concerns in Europe that Trump might have softened his stance toward potential sanctions on Russia, and is now pushing for a permanent peace deal in Ukraine instead of an initial ceasefire — an approach more aligned with Moscow's position.

European Union officials still recall Zelenskyy's incendiary appearance in the Oval Office in February, when Trump and Vice President JD Vance criticized the Ukrainian leader in front of TV cameras for not being thankful enough for U.S. support throughout the war.

This time around, EU leaders are traveling to the United States on Monday looking to bring Washington on the side of Ukraine. The European cohort includes heads of state who are close to Trump, such as Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Finnish President Alexander Stubb.

""The objective is mainly to support Zelenskyy,"" a senior EU diplomat, who did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of the topic, told CNBC on Sunday. ""The idea is to make sure [Trump] has the same objectives as Europe.""

The same diplomat outlined: ""Our main objectives are: security guarantees, stop the killing and go for a trilateral meeting.""

Facing a scenario that features the end of the war but no NATO membership for Kyiv, Ukraine has insisted on security reassurances that decrease the likelihood of further attacks and invasions of its territory.

According to U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to allow Europe and the U.S. to provide such postwar security guarantees to Ukraine, which could be described as protections similar to Article 5 in the NATO alliance — a measure that states that an attack against one member is an attack on all.

An EU official, who follows these geopolitical topics but did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue, told CNBC that ""NATO article-5 like security guarantees for Ukraine are great, but unclear what they will entail in practice.""

Speaking to CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" on Monday, former U.S. diplomat James Bindenagel said these security guarantees would allow Western — but not NATO — forces to be present in Ukraine, which ""would have the ability to fight back to any violations of a ceasefire.""

Putin has reportedly called for Ukraine's withdrawal from the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in the east of the country and added that Moscow could freeze the front lines in the regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south.

However, the promise to end the war in exchange for territorial concessions is a long-standing no-go for Kyiv, with Zelenskyy saying last week that such a surrender would be a ""springboard"" for a future new Russian offensive.

""As long as the bloodshed in Ukraine continues, Europe will maintain diplomatic and, in particular, economic pressure on Russia,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a Sunday statement.

She added the EU will ""continue to strengthen sanctions,"" and is advancing preparations for a 19th package of measures to put forward in early September.

The other objective that Europe wants to meet on Monday is securing White House support for a meeting that features Trump and Putin, but also brings Zelenskyy to the negotiating table.

""These are challenging times; only Ukraine can choose its own destiny,"" von der Leyen said on Sunday.

Trump has spoken about a potential summit featuring himself, Russian and Ukrainian leadership, but he has not mentioned that prospect of such gathering since the Alaska summit.

— CNBC's Emilia Hardie contributed to this report.

Correction: Giorgia Meloni is the prime minister of Italy. An earlier version misspelled her name.

Shares of Novo Nordisk climbed Monday after the company's blockbuster Wegovy obesity drug received accelerated approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat a serious liver disease.

The company on Friday said that it was granted approval for the treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) in adults with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis, in combination with a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity.

Shares climbed further in afternoon trade after the company said that it would reduce the cost of Ozempic for cash-paying patients to $499 per month, less than half of its monthly U.S. list price.

Novo Nordisk shares were up 7.4% by 2:25 p.m. London time (9:25 a.m. E.T.).

The approval makes Wegovy the first GLP-1 class treatment to be authorized for MASH, a progressive liver condition that affects an estimated 5% of U.S. adults, according to the American Liver Foundation.

It also advances the drug's applications beyond diabetes and obesity treatment and develops its presence in the metabolic disease market. The approval follows a series of studies indicating the drug's efficacy in reducing the risk of heart attack, stroke and death from cardiovascular causes.

""Wegovy is now uniquely positioned as the first and only GLP-1 treatment approved for MASH, complementing the already proven weight loss, cardiovascular benefits and extensive body of evidence linked to semaglutide,"" Martin Holst Lange, Novo Nordisk executive vice president, chief scientific officer and head of research and development, said in a statement.

The accelerated approval was based on the first phase of the ESSENCE trial, in which Novo Nordisk said Wegovy demonstrated ""a statistically significant and superior improvement"" in liver fibrosis compared to placebo.

Under the study, the company said almost two-thirds (62.9%) of people treated with Wegovy achieved the resolution of steatohepatitis with no worsening of liver fibrosis, compared to 34.3% who were administered a placebo.

More than one-third (36.8%) of those treated with Wegovy achieved improvement in liver fibrosis with no worsening of steatohepatitis after 72 weeks, compared to 22.4% who received a placebo. The second phase of the study is expected in 2029.

Novo Nordisk said Friday that Wegovy would be immediately available in the U.S. for MASH. The only other MASH treatment currently approved by the FDA is Madrigal Pharmaceuticals' Rezdiffra, which was cleared in 2024.

In this article

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman thinks the artificial intelligence market is in a bubble, according to a report from The Verge published Friday. 

""When bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth,"" Altman told a small group of reporters last week.

""Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes. Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes,"" he was quoted as saying. 

Altman appeared to compare this dynamic to the infamous dot-com bubble, a stock market crash centered on internet-based companies that led to massive investor enthusiasm during the late 1990s. Between March 2000 and October 2002, the Nasdaq lost nearly 80% of its value after many of these companies failed to generate revenue or profits. 

His comments add to growing concern among experts and analysts that investment in AI is moving too fast. Alibaba co-founder Joe Tsai, Bridgewater Associates' Ray Dalio and Apollo Global Management chief economist Torsten Slok have all raised similar warnings.

Last month, Slok stated in a report that he believed the AI bubble of today was, in fact, bigger than the internet bubble, with the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 more overvalued than they were in the 1990s. 

In a Monday email to CNBC, Ray Wang, research director for semiconductors, supply chain and emerging technology at Futurum Group, said that he thought Altman's comments carry some validity, but that the risks are company-dependent. 

""From the perspective of broader investment in AI and semiconductors... I don't see it as a bubble. The fundamentals across the supply chain remain strong, and the long-term trajectory of the AI trend supports continued investment,"" he said. 

However, he added that there is an increasing amount of speculative capital chasing companies with weaker fundamentals and only perceived potential, which could create pockets of overvaluation. 

Many Fears of an AI bubble had hit a fever pitch at the start of this year when Chinese start-up DeepSeek released a competitive reasoning model. The company claimed one version of its advanced large language models had been trained for under $6 million, a fraction of the billions being spent by U.S. AI market leaders like OpenAI, though these claims were also been met with some skepticism.

Earlier this month, Altman told CNBC that OpenAI's annual recurring revenue is on track to pass $20 billion this year, but that despite that, it remains unprofitable. 

The release of OpenAI's latest GPT-5 AI model earlier this month had also been rocky, with some critics complaining that it had a less intuitive feel. This resulted in the company restoring access to legacy GPT-4 models for paying customers.

Following the release of the model, Altman has also signaled more caution about some of the AI industry's more bullish predictions.

Speaking to CNBC, he said that he thought the term artificial general intelligence, or ""AGI,"" is losing relevance, when asked whether the GPT-5 model moves the world any closer to achieving AGI. 

AGI refers to the concept of a form of artificial intelligence that can perform any intellectual task that a human can — something that OpenAI has been working towards for years and that Altman previously said could be achieved in the ""reasonably close-ish future.""

Regardless, faith in OpenAI from investors has remained strong this year. CNBC confirmed Friday that the company was preparing to sell around $6 billion in stock as part of a secondary sale that would value it at roughly $500 billion. 

In March, it had announced a $40 billion funding round at a $300 billion valuation, by far the largest amount ever raised by a private tech company. 

In The Verge article on Friday, the OpenAI CEO also discussed OpenAI's expansion into consumer hardware, brain-computer interfaces and social media. 

Altman also said that he expects OpenAI to spend trillions of dollars on its data center buildout in the ""not very distant future,""  and signaled that the company would be interested in buying Chrome if the U.S. government were to force Google to sell it. 

Asked if he would be CEO of OpenAI in a few years, he was quoted as saying, ""I mean, maybe an AI is in three years. That's a long time.""

This is CNBC's live coverage of President Donald Trump's meetings with European leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Aug. 18, 2025.

What you need to know

CNBC reporters are covering the summit live, on air and online from our bureaus in Washington; New York; London; Singapore; San Francisco; and Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.

Kirill Dmitriev, the head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund and one of Putin's top negotiators, made clear that Moscow remains opposed to any short-term ceasefire deal with Ukraine.

Dmitriev on X posted an emoji of a dove with an olive branch in its beak after the words ""Lasting Peace,"" contrasting that goal with a ""Temporary Ceasefire.""

Trump echoed the same sentiment after his summit with Putin in Alaska.

Meloni of Italy arrived at the White House a few minutes before 12:30pm ET.

The last time Meloni was at the White House was in April to discuss tariffs with the president.

— Erin Doherty

Just before arriving at the White House, Zelenskyy says European leaders are united in pursuit of a lasting peace.

""Together with the leaders of Finland, the United Kingdom, Italy, the European Commission, and the NATO Secretary General, we coordinated our positions ahead of the meeting with President Trump,"" he wrote on X.

""Our main goal is a reliable and lasting peace for Ukraine and for the whole of Europe,"" he said.

""We understand that we shouldn't expect Putin to voluntarily abandon aggression and new attempts at conquest. That is why pressure must work, and it must be joint pressure – from the United States and Europe, and from everyone in the world who respects the right to life and the international order.""

— Kevin Breuninger

Rutte arrived at the White House a few minutes after noon ahead of Zelenskyy's meeting with Trump.

He is the first of the European leaders to arrive at the White House.

— Erin Doherty

Vice President JD Vance, who previously chastised Zelenskyy in the Oval Office over his alleged ingratitude toward Trump, will attend the Ukraine leader's meeting with the U.S. president, a source familiar with the matter told NBC News.

Zelenskyy's first visit to the White House in late February devolved into a stunning on-camera argument, with Vance accusing him of disrespect and Trump claiming that he was ""gambling with World War III.""

Vance then asked Zelenskyy, ""Have you said thank you once?""

Zelenskyy left the White House soon after.

— Kevin Breuninger

The European leaders accompanying Zelenskyy to the White House are expected to participate in a lunch upon their arrival.

Zelenskyy, who is poised to meet with Trump at 1:15pm ET, is meeting at the Ukrainian embassy in Washington, D.C., ahead of the meeting.

Von der Leyen and Stubb attended the meeting at the embassy, and other European leaders are likely to also join.

After the European leaders' meeting with Trump, which is set to begin at 3pm ET, some are expected to make public remarks.

The French president landed at Dulles Airport outside Washington, DC, at 11:26 a.m. ET.

He will head directly to the White House.

— Kevin Breuninger

Today's meetings come three days after Trump and Putin met in Anchorage, Alaska, for several hours, but ended that session without a ceasefire that the U.S. president had said he wanted.

""There's no deal until there's a deal,"" Trump said after that meeting on Friday.

On Saturday, Trump wrote on Truth Social: ""It was determined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a Peace Agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere Ceasefire Agreement, which often times do not hold up.""

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that a ceasefire was ""not off the table.""

Starmer has landed at Joint Base Andrews outside of Washington, D.C., for the planned meetings. 

- Dan Mangan

European Council President Antonio Costa said he will convene a video conference of members of the council for Tuesday ""for a debriefing of today's meetings in Washington DC about Ukraine.""

""Together with the US, the EU will continue working towards a lasting peace that safeguards Ukraine's and Europe's vital security interests,"" Costa wrote in a tweet.

The European Council is comprised of the heads of state of European Union member nations.

- Dan Mangan

Michael O'Hanlon, foreign policy research director at the Brookings Institution, says that one question ahead of the talks is whether the U.S. can ""cajole President Zelenskyy into at least a de facto swap,"" giving up some land in exchange for a peace deal.

""It may not have to be something that could be legally blessed and Ukraine could still retain its claims to all the land ... but acknowledge that for now and forever it's not going to fight to get that land back,"" he tells CNBC.

He says that he believes European leaders are ""pragmatic enough to know that Ukraine's not going to win back all of its land.""

— Erin Doherty

Oil prices are barely budging ahead of Trump's talks with Zelenskyy and other European leaders, as investors look for developments on Russia's war in Ukraine that could affect global energy flows.

That lack of movement coincides with Trump appearing to back off his threats to impose additional sanctions on Russia, even though his Alaskan summit with Putin produced no ceasefire or peace agreements.

Russia has faced U.S. sanctions on parts of its oil industry over the war. But Trump recently hit a third country, India, with higher tariffs because, he said, it continues to buy Russian oil.

Peter Navarro, one of Trump's top trade advisors, slammed India earlier today for continuing to buy Russian crude oil, calling the Asian nation ""opportunistic"" in an op-ed for the Financial Times.

— Kevin Breuninger

UK Prime Minister Starmer posted a video on X from his plane explaining his reasons for flying to  Washington to meet with Trump and Zelensky.

""This war in Ukraine's been going on a really long time now, I mean, three-plus years. Hugely impacted the Ukrainians, who have suffered hugely, "" Starmer said.

""But it's also impacted Europe. It's impacted every single family and community in the United Kingdom, and so everybody wants it to end, not the least the Ukrainians,"" he said.

""But we've got to get this right,"" Starmer added. ""We've got to make sure there is peace, that it is lasting peace, and that is fair and that it is just, and that's why I'm traveling to Washington with other European leaders to discuss this face-to-face with President Trump and President Zelenskyy.""

""Because it's in everyone's interests, it's in the UK's interests, that we get this right,"" he said.

- Dan Mangan

Zelenskyy has finished his meeting with Trump's Special Representative for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, which took place in the last hour at the Hay-Adams Hotel across from the White House.

""​When peace is discussed for one country in Europe, it means peace for all of Europe. We are ready to continue working with maximum effort to end the war and to ensure reliable security. These are the key issues,"" Zelenskyy said afterwards.

— Christina Wilkie

European leaders plan to begin arriving at the White House around 12 p.m. ET

Trump is expected to greet Zelenskyy at the White House at 1 p.m. ET.

The two leaders are scheduled to begin bilateral talks there at 1:15 p.m.

- Dan Mangan

While it's unusual for so many European leaders to travel to the White House at once, each making the trip has already met with Trump during his second term.

Zelenskyy notoriously met with Trump in February, during a meeting that quickly devolved into a shouting match.

While this will be von der Leyen's first time at the White House this term, she has met with the president before, including last month in Turnberry, Scotland.

Rutte has traveled to the White House at least twice since Trump's return to office, once in March and the other time in July.

Starmer, Merz, Meloni and Macron have all previously met with Trump at the White House at least once, while Stubb is making his first trip this term.

Stubb played golf with Trump earlier this year, however.

— Erin Doherty

Trump continued to complain about the ongoing criticism of his summit with Putin in Alaska last Friday, which ended with no ceasefire or peace deal and was followed by an abridged ""press conference"" that allowed no questions from the press.

""I am totally convinced that if Russia raised their hands and said, 'We give up, we concede, we surrender, we will GIVE Ukraine and the great United States of America, the most revered, respected, and powerful of all countries, EVER, Moscow and St. Petersburg, and everything surrounding them for a thousand miles, the Fake News Media and their Democrat Partners would say that this was a bad and humiliating day for Donald J. Trump, one of the worst days in the history of our Country,'"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

""But that's why they are the FAKE NEWS, and the badly failing Radical Left Democrats. Thank you for your attention to this matter!!!""

— Kevin Breuninger

Hours before his meeting with Trump, Zelenskyy accused Russia of deliberately attacking civilian targets in Ukraine in order to undermine the upcoming peace talks at the White House and raise pressure on Kyiv and Europe.

""This was a demonstrative and cynical Russian strike,"" Zelenskyy wrote in an X post that included video footage of an apartment building on fire with massive holes in its roof.

He said at least 10 people have been killed and dozens more injured in Russian attacks in Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia and the Sumy region. He also said that Russia struck an Azerbaijani-owned energy facility in Odesa, calling it ""an attack not only on us but also on our relations and energy security.""

""Putin will commit demonstrative killings to maintain pressure on Ukraine and Europe, as well as to humiliate diplomatic efforts. That is precisely why we are seeking assistance to put an end to the killings,"" Zelenskyy said. ""That is why reliable security guarantees are required. That is why Russia should not be rewarded for its participation in this war. The war must be ended. And it is Moscow that must hear the word: 'Stop.'""

— Kevin Breuninger

Trump said it is ""a big day at the White House"" in a Truth Social post ahead of his meeting with Zelenskyy.

""We have never had so many European Leaders here at one time,"" he wrote, calling the convening of leaders across the European Union a ""great honor for America.""

""Lets see what the results will be???"" he continued.

The European leaders, which include French President Emmanuel Macron, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, are set to arrive at the White House at noon.

U.S. President Donald Trump's trade advisor Peter Navarro on Monday called on India to stop buying Russian crude oil, accusing the Asian giant of undermining international efforts to isolate Vladimir Putin's war economy.

Writing in in the Financial Times, Navarro described India's dependence on Russian oil as ""opportunistic,"" adding that if India ""wants to be treated as a strategic partner of the US, it needs to start acting like one.""

""In effect, India acts as a global clearinghouse for Russian oil, converting embargoed crude into high-value exports while giving Moscow the dollars it needs,"" Navarro said in the op-ed.

His comments come shortly after trade negotiations between the U.S. and India, which had been scheduled to take place in New Delhi later this month, were reportedly called off.

India's Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and the Office of the U.S Trade Representative did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comments.

Earlier this month, the Trump administration said it planned to impose an additional 25% tariff on India over Russian oil purchases, bringing the total levies against the country to 50%. The cumulative rate of duties on India is among the highest on any of Washington's trade partners.

India described the move as ""extremely unfortunate"" at the time, saying the tariffs were ""unfair, unjustified and unreasonable.""

The White House has since warned that secondary levies on India could increase further, depending on the outcome of Trump's peace talks with Putin.

For its part, India has said it has been unfairly targeted for its continuing trade with Russia since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, amid criticism from both the U.S. and European Union.

In a statement published Aug. 4, India's Ministry of External Affairs said the country began importing from Russian because traditional supplies were diverted from Europe after the outbreak of the conflict.

""India's imports are meant to ensure predictable and affordable energy costs to the Indian consumer. They are a necessity compelled by global market situation,"" India's Ministry of External Affairs said.

""However, it is revealing that the very nations criticizing India are themselves indulging in trade with Russia. Unlike our case, such trade is not even a vital national compulsion,"" it added.

Trump's criticism of India's oil trade with Russia represents a clear shift from the Biden administration, which, along with other G7 nations, Australia and the European Union, established a $60 a barrel price cap in late 2022. The EU has since signaled it has reached an agreement to lower the price threshold. 

This mechanism sought to limit Russia's revenue from oil sales, while maintaining some stability in global energy markets.

Shilan Shah, deputy chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said India could, in principle, find suppliers other than Russia to meet its energy needs ""relatively easily,"" with limited economic impact.

""But we doubt that India would make a wholehearted effort to wean itself off Russian oil. Domestically, it would not play well to be seen caving to Trump's demands,"" Shah said in a note published Aug. 4.

""In addition, Indian policymakers would be reluctant to upend generally cordial (and long-standing) relations with Russia,"" he added.

Bitcoin treasury giant Strategy disclosed another purchase of 430 BTC for $51.4 million, bringing its stash to about 629,376 BTC as of Monday.

The company said it paid an average of $119,666 per bitcoin in its latest round of purchases, continuing a capital-markets-funded accumulation campaign that has made it the world's largest publicly traded holder of the asset.

The latest purchases were funded with proceeds from Strategy's at-the-market preferred programs.  Between Aug. 11 and Aug. 17, the company sold 179,687 shares of its Series A Perpetual Strike (STRK) for $18.0 million face value and $19.3 million in net proceeds. It also sold Series A Perpetual Strife (STRF)  for $16.3 million face and $19.0 million from 162,670 STRF shares, and 140,789 shares of its  Series A Perpetual Stride (STRD) offering for $14.1 million face and $12.1 million net.

There were no sales under the Common ATM or the variable-rate Series A Perpetual Stretch (STRC) during this period, according to a Form 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. As of Aug. 17, remaining capacity stood at $17.04 billion (Common), $20.43 billion (STRK), $1.85 billion (STRF), $4.17 billion (STRD), and $4.20 billion (STRC).

STRK pays an 8.00% coupon while STRF and STRD each pay 10.00% as perpetual preferreds. STRC is a variable-rate, cumulative preferred designed to trade near $100 par via a floating rate, in addition to a $21 billion Common ATM established for class A shares.

Strategy's preferred stock programs sit alongside its broader financing stack, which includes perpetual STRK ($21 billion ATM), STRF ($2.1 billion), and STRD ($4.2 billion) facilities.  Those programs complement the firm's “42/42” plan targeting $84 billion of equity and convertible notes for bitcoin acquisitions through 2027, upsized from the original “21/21” strategy after equity capacity was exhausted.

Five years after its first bitcoin purchase in 2020, Strategy now holds about $72.4  billion in BTC at current prices, acquired at an average $73,320 per coin for a total outlay of roughly $46.2 billion, including fees, co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor shared on Aug. 18. The stash leaves the company sitting on about $26.2 billion in paper gains.



Monday's move followed a weekend teaser from Saylor, who posted “Insufficient orange” on X alongside a SaylorTracker image showing Strategy at 628,946 BTC, valued at about $74.5 billion before today's market slide. Traders often interpret the phrase as a buy signal indicating more purchases are on the way.

Strategy's balance-sheet firepower has also swelled alongside its BTC buying. In the second quarter, the company reported record net income of $10 billion and about $14.03 billion in operating income, a 7,106% year-over-year jump, driven largely by unrealized gains on its bitcoin holdings. 

Additionally, the figures reflect the new U.S. accounting standard that lets companies carry digital assets at fair value, recording mark-to-market gains and losses each quarter rather than only impairments.

A stronger earnings backdrop has fed directly into Strategy's financing machine. Wall Street analysts have lauded the firm's market cap to net asset value-focused (mNAV) issuance model, known as capital precision, for its ability to tap preferreds, convertibles, and ATM programs when the company's market value exceeds the implied bitcoin per share.

The Block's data dashboard shows multiple public companies controlling a multi-billion-BTC stack, with U.S. firms like miners MARA, Riot, Galaxy Digital, and newcomers such as Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company and Trump Media among the largest recent contributors.  A few Asian-based firms also feature in the mix. Japan's Metaplanet, for example, lifted its balance to 18,888 BTC after a fresh 775-BTC buy for $93 million.



While the broader corporate cohort keeps expanding, Strategy remains the clear pace-setter among corporate bitcoin holders. After last week's disclosed add, the company's BTC balance sheet sits even closer to 3% of bitcoin's 21 million supply cap.

Investors continue to debate Strategy's premium to its underlying bitcoin net asset value. The stock still trades at a sizable mNAV premium, a feature some see as a funding advantage given the firm's ability to issue equity and preferreds against that premium to acquire more BTC. TD Cowen has argued that Strategy's preferred-stock program is highly accretive, helping explain why the market has been willing to sustain a premium.

Bitcoin (BTC) advances the pullback phase below the $115,000 level to test a crucial dynamic support, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), at press time on Monday. The pullback spreads amid broader market fear, resulting in liquidations of over $500 million in the last 24 hours. 

Similarly, Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) are following the bearish trend, with nearly 4% losses. Amid the sell-off, institutional interest in top cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, could face volatility moving forward.

The technical outlook for the main crypto assets suggests escalating downside risk as selling pressure intensifies. 

CoinGlass data indicate that the broader cryptocurrency liquidations totaled $552.42 million, comprising $483.23 million in long positions and $69.06 million in short positions. 

The clear imbalance of massive long liquidations suggests a shift to risk-off sentiment among investors. Amid such conditions, the crypto market could face further correction as fear tightens its grip.

Despite the pullback at the end of last week, Bitcoin and Ethereum were able to attract significant funds from US institutions. This marks an increase in confidence among institutional investors, which will be put to the test as Bitcoin and Ethereum experience steep declines this Monday. 

Sosovalue data shows Ethereum marking its largest weekly net inflow of $2.85 billion, marking its fourteenth consecutive week of positive flows.

Bitcoin, on the other hand, maintained steady growth, with $547.82 billion in net inflows, surpassing the $246.75 billion in net inflows from the previous week. 

Bitcoin spot ETF data | Source: SoSoValue

The US-based Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs hold total assets worth $151.98 billion and $28.15 billion, respectively. 

Bitcoin ticks lower by 2% at press time on Monday, crossing under the 50-day EMA at $115,001. Bitcoin's bullish run from last week's peak at $124,474 on Thursday, resulting in a 4% drop on the day, ignited the ongoing pullback. 

The path of least resistance targets the $111,980 support level, last tested on August 3, as pressure on Bitcoin intensifies. 

The momentum indicators flash a sell signal as bullish momentum fades. On the daily chart, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) crosses below its signal line. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 44, below the halfway line, indicating a decline in buying pressure. 

The 100-day and 200-day EMAs at $110,362 and $102,939, respectively, could act as dynamic support levels if the downtrend continues.

BTC/USDT daily price chart.

Looking up, a bounce back from the 50-day EMA at $115,001 could target the $120,000 supply zone.  

Ethereum bulls fail to hold over $4,300 as the altcoin depreciates by over 4% at the time of writing on Monday. The altcoin falls towards the support trendline of a rising channel on the daily chart (shared below) after reversing from the previous week's high at $4,868. 

Amid the sell-off, ETH targets the $3,941 level, marked by the high of July 28, which coincides with the lower boundary of the rising channel.

The MACD approaches its signal line, hinting at a potential trend reversal, as declining green histograms suggest that bullish momentum is fading. Additionally, the RSI reads 58 on the daily chart, dropping below the overbought zone and indicating a sharp decline in buying pressure. 

ETH/USDT daily price chart.

On the other hand, an intraday reversal securing a positive close for the day could test the $4,500 psychological resistance. 

Ripple drops below the $3.00 mark, trading at $2.97 at press time on Monday with a loss of 3.8%. XRP's pullback puts a long-standing resistance trendline formed by connecting the June 23 and August 3 lows, and the 50-day EMA at $2.94 to test. 

The cross-border remittance token also tests the 38.2% Fibonacci level at $2.99, which is drawn from the low of $1.90 on June 22 to the high of $3.66 on July 18. A decisive close below the 50-day EMA could test the 50% retracement level $2.78. 

The momentum indicators hold a bearish bias as the RSI at 45 leans below the halfway line, indicating a tired-out buying pressure. Additionally, the MACD and its signal extend the declining trend, pointing to increased bearish momentum.

On the flip side, if XRP holds above the support trendline at $3.00, a bounce back could retest the $3.34 resistance, last tested on Thursday. 

The developer or creator of each cryptocurrency decides on the total number of tokens that can be minted or issued. Only a certain number of these assets can be minted by mining, staking or other mechanisms. This is defined by the algorithm of the underlying blockchain technology. On the other hand, circulating supply can also be decreased via actions such as burning tokens, or mistakenly sending assets to addresses of other incompatible blockchains.

Market capitalization is the result of multiplying the circulating supply of a certain asset by the asset's current market value. 

Trading volume refers to the total number of tokens for a specific asset that has been transacted or exchanged between buyers and sellers within set trading hours, for example, 24 hours. It is used to gauge market sentiment, this metric combines all volumes on centralized exchanges and decentralized exchanges. Increasing trading volume often denotes the demand for a certain asset as more people are buying and selling the cryptocurrency.

Funding rates are a concept designed to encourage traders to take positions and ensure perpetual contract prices match spot markets. It defines a mechanism by exchanges to ensure that future prices and index prices periodic payments regularly converge. When the funding rate is positive, the price of the perpetual contract is higher than the mark price. This means traders who are bullish and have opened long positions pay traders who are in short positions. On the other hand, a negative funding rate means perpetual prices are below the mark price, and hence traders with short positions pay traders who have opened long positions.

Monero (XMR) trades in the green at press time on Monday, marking its third consecutive day of uptrend. The privacy coin aims to reclaim its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), backed by increased demand from Qubic, which now controls over 51% of the Monero hashrate.

Dogecoin (DOGE) price trades in red, slipping 4% at the time of writing on Monday, bringing it closer to the critical $0.21 support level; a firm close below could extend further downside. The decline comes as the Qubic community, which recently carried out a 51% attack on Monero (XMR), voted to target DOGE memecoin next.

Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) are showing signs of weakness as momentum fades across the broader crypto market. BTC and XRP are hovering near the critical $116,000 and $2.99 supports, respectively, while ETH struggles to break above $4,488 resistance.

Chainlink (LINK) emerges as the frontrunner in the cryptocurrency market over the last 24 hours following the 13% jump on Sunday. Altcoins such as Arbitrum (ARB) and MemeCore (M) follow the bullish trend, gaining traction after a recovery run on Sunday.

Bitcoin (BTC) price experiences a whirlwind week, surging to a new all-time high of $124,474 before sharply retreating to hover around $118,800 at the time of writing on Friday.

Bitcoin—alongside other major cryptocurrencies ethereum and XRP—have fallen sharply, raising fears of a crypto market crash after it bubbled up to an all-time high of $4.2 trillion this month (just as Tesla billionaire Elon Musk breaks his silence on crypto).

The bitcoin price has plunged from an all-time high of $124,000 per bitcoin just last week, dropping around 10% to $114,000, while ethereum and Ripple's XRP have seen similar declines despite U.S. president Donald Trump dropping a surprise $12.2 trillion crypto bombshell.

Bitcoin and crypto's decline, coming just as JPMorgan makes a game-changing Federal Reserve flip, follows Wall Street giants issuing a warning that the recently passed Genius Act stablecoin bill could trigger a $6.6 trillion flood of account withdrawals.

U.S. banking groups that count Wall Street giants such as JPMorgan and Bank of America as members have urged Congress to close a loophole in the recently passed Genius Act stablecoin bill that allows issuers of the dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies to offer yields via affiliates, warning it could trigger huge account deposit flight that would undermine the banking system.

In April, a Treasury Department report estimated that stablecoins could trigger up to $6.6 trillion in deposit outflows, depending on whether they can offer interest or yield, with the stablecoin market expected to grow to $2 trillion by 2028, up from $280 billion today.

""Congress must protect the flow of credit to American businesses and families and the stability of the most important financial market by closing the stablecoin payment of interest loophole,"" the report, posted to the Bank Policy Institute website, and addressed to lawmakers, read.

“Banks power the economy by turning deposits into loans. Incentivizing a shift from bank deposits and money market funds to stablecoins would end up increasing lending costs and reducing loans to businesses and consumer households.”

The plea to lawmakers was also signed by the American Bankers Association, Consumer Bankers Association, Independent Community Bankers of America and the Financial Services Forum.

Stablecoin adoption wars are heating up following the passage of the Genius Act that laid down rules of the road for the crypto-based dollars.

Tether's USDT remains the dominant stablecoin but is facing a tidal wave of competition from all angles, including Wall Street giants themselves, technology companies such as Facebook's Meta, as well as financial technology companies like PayPal and Stripe.

Earlier this year, David Sacks, a technology investor and U.S. president Donald Trump's crypto czar, said on the All In Podcast he hosts with three other investors that he hopes that eventually the rules will swing in favor of stablecoin issuers, allowing them to directly offer interest to stablecoin holders.

Trump's sons Eric and Don Jr have publicly said their World Liberty Financial crypto project is a direct challenge to Wall Street following their claims of being “de-banked” in the aftermath of Trump's 2020 election loss. “Honestly, I would love to see some of the big banks go extinct, because, honestly, they deserve it,"" Eric Trump said in May.

The bitcoin price and crypto market's latest downturn, coming as just as traders celebrated a fresh all-time high, have raised fears the market could see further declines in coming weeks.

“The crypto market continued its decline on Monday after a pause over the weekend,” Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro's chief market analyst, said in emailed comments.

“The total capitalisation fell back to $3.88 trillion, reaching its lowest level in more than two weeks. As expected, altcoins are falling the hardest, with ethereum and XRP losing about 5% in the last 24 hours, twice as much as bitcoin. Bitcoin fell to $115,000, the lowest level in the last 11 days. It is now testing the 50-day moving average, which has been the bullish trend line since April. A consolidation below it will sharply increase the chances of a deeper correction, and a failure below $112,000—the area of recent lows—will confirm the correction, opening the potential for a decline to $105,000-107,000.”","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

Oops, something went wrong

Ethereum's slip below $4,300 set off a chain reaction across crypto markets Monday morning, wiping out more than $487 million in long positions and leaving altcoins bleeding.

Hyperliquid (HYPE) plummeted 8.7% to $43.38 while Sui (SUI) crashed 7.3% to $3.55, leading a brutal selloff across altcoins.

Ethereum (ETH) shed 5.4%, Solana (SOL) tumbled 5.6%, and Cardano (ADA) declined 6.2%, according to CoinGecko data.

XRP (XRP) fell 4.5%, Stellar (XLM) dropped 5.4%, and Dogecoin (DOGE) retreated 4.6% in the last 24 hours.

“This looks like a fairly natural pullback after the strong run many cryptocurrencies had seen in recent weeks, with liquidations amplifying the downside across the market,” Nansen analyst Nicolai Sondergaard told Decrypt.

“Since altcoins tend to react more sharply during these periods, tokens like HYPE and SUI experienced even steeper declines,” Sondergaard noted, pointing out that Bitcoin's sell-off triggered the declines.

The liquidation cascade comes ahead of Thursday's Jackson Hole symposium, with QCP Capital analysts sharing in their latest report how ""some traders believe that the overnight washout reflects de‑risking ahead of the symposium,"" where Fed Chair Jerome Powell takes the stage.

Held each August in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, the symposium gathers the Fed, global central bankers, and policymakers.

QCP analysts added that ""BTC funding rates had been warning of trouble"" with rates turning negative by Saturday despite spot prices rising over the weekend.

""The U.S. PPI came in higher than expected, forcing markets to quickly scale back September rate-cut bets that earlier signs of labor market softness had elevated,"" Dan Chen, analyst at crypto exchange Bitunix, told Decrypt.

Chen called the selloff ""a corrective pullback within an uptrend"" and said the market may consolidate through Jackson Hole if Ethereum ""can hold support near $4,150"" before resuming its advance.

However, he warned that ""a breakdown risks further cascading liquidations with downside targets in the $3.9k–$3.6k range, where altcoins—especially HYPE and SUI—are likely to stay relatively weaker.""

Billions in Ethereum Waiting to Be Unstaked Could Add Sell Pressure to ETH: Analyst

Some 75% of Ethereum's $206.79 million in liquidations in the last 24 hours came from long positions, totaling more than $180.52 million, according to CoinGlass data.

""The mounting queue of soon-to-be-unstaked ETH could be driving the asset's recent retracement,"" Juan Leon, Bitwise Senior Investment Strategist, previously told Decrypt.

Crypto markets may be entering a new stage this cycle, with Bitcoin's early gains giving way to a broader set of tokens, according to crypto VC giant Pantera Capital. Meanwhile, a recent report from U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase says that the conditions are forming for a full-scale alt season to kick off as early as September. 

Altcoins have historically driven the bulk of market growth, a pattern Pantera highlighted in a recent blog post. The firm describes the pattern as “Phase 2” of the bull market, where altcoins could start catching up to Bitcoin.

However, historic data suggests that the magnitude of growth has been declining over successive cycles, with the X-fold gains for both Bitcoin and altcoins in early and late phases trending lower over time.

“During the 2015–2018 cycle, alts accounted for 66% of the total growth in crypto market capitalization. In the 2018–2021 cycle, they contributed 55%. So far this cycle, alts represent 35% of total market growth,” said the Menlo Park-headquartered crypto VC firm, which has over $5 billion in assets under management.

Coinbase Institutional's global head of research David Duong also sees the conditions forming for a potential alt season within this quarter, noting that Bitcoin's dominance has already dropped from 65% in May to below 58% this month.

In a Q3 market outlook, Duong pointed out that while CoinMarketCap's Altcoin Season Index remains in the low 40s — short of the 75% threshold many use to define an alt season — the total altcoin market cap has surged over 50% since early July to $1.4 trillion.

Meanwhile, Google search trends show a growing interest, with searches for “altcoins” reaching levels not seen since January 2018, signaling rising attention from retail investors.

Pantera Capital pointed to U.S. legislation as a key driver behind the momentum, saying that the GENIUS Act, which was signed into law last month, sets the stage for a rise in regulated stablecoins, while the CLARITY Act aims to clarify the rules between digital commodities and securities.

As for the main winners, the firm points to Ethereum, noting that the majority of real-world assets (RWAs) are flowing onto this network.

For context, Robinhood has launched tokenized stocks on Arbitrum, a Layer 2 chain built on Ethereum, while the majority of the largest tokenized RWA funds, like BlackRock's BUIDL and WisdomTree's WTGXX, are on Ethereum.  

Stablecoins are also a major driver. As The Defiant reported in May, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan are reportedly exploring launching their own stablecoins.

Nearly 55% of the stablecoin market is currently on Ethereum, per DefiLlama data — though that share could shift with fintech giant Stripe and stablecoin issuer Circle both considering launching their own blockchain networks.

Coinbase's Duong shared that view, pointing to growing institutional demand for ETH. He added that ARB, ENA, LDO, and OP trade at higher betas to ETH, though only LDO has gained the most so far — up more than 55% after the SEC suggested that some liquid staking services may fall outside securities rules.

The duration of this altcoin season remains unclear, and Coinbase analysts say it's unlikely to see strong institutional involvement, with most momentum expected to come from retail investors.

Duong added that potential September Fed cuts wouldn't automatically mark a crypto top, noting that more than $7 trillion in money market funds could flow into crypto if lower rates make those funds less appealing.

                            Has the Crypto Market Started to Crash? | Credit: Veronica Cestari                        


Key Takeaways

The crypto market is showing its first real signs of turbulence after setting fresh all-time highs.

Optimism has fueled the rally for weeks, but momentum now looks shaky as technical signals point to potential weakness.

The key question: is this just a healthy cooldown—or the start of a deeper correction? Let's take a closer look at the charts.

The weekly time frame chart for the crypto market is starting to show signs of weakness.

After reaching a fresh all-time high last week, the rally stalled and left behind a shooting star candlestick (red icon).

If the market closes this week below $3.66 trillion, that would confirm an evening star pattern, which is typically a bearish reversal signal.

Momentum indicators also paint a worrying picture. Both the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and MACD have formed bearish divergences (orange).

Such divergences on a weekly chart are rare, and when they appear, they often signal the start of a deeper market correction.

This helps explain why the crypto market is down today and raises the possibility of further losses through August.

If the decline continues, the next major support zone lies between $3.26 trillion and $3.47 trillion, based on the 0.382–0.5 Fibonacci retracement levels.

The altcoin chart is even more concerning, showing many bearish signs.

At first, the wave count shows that altcoins have completed wave three in a five-wave increase (green) and have now started a corrective wave four.

The sub-wave count (black) confirms that this is the case.

Just like the total market cap, the daily RSI and MACD have generated considerable bearish divergences, which could lead to a pronounced downward trend.

If the count transpires as predicted, altcoins could fall by another 10% on average, reaching the 0.382-0.5 Fibonacci retracement support level at $1.35 – $1.43 trillion.

Since wave two was gradual and deep, the wave four correction could be shallow and sharp.

Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are the largest and second-largest cryptocurrencies, so their price movement affects whether the rest of the crypto market is down or not.

The Bitcoin price also shows signs of an imminent price top.

The wave count shows that the price has started wave four in a five-wave upward movement (green).

Bitcoin has also created diagonals for wave five and the entire upward movement.

If this long-term prediction goes as planned, the Bitcoin price has another upward movement left before the cycle ends.

The ubiquitous divergences also exist in the Bitcoin price chart.

Finally, the Ethereum price shows the same wave three completion (green) with bearish divergences.

While the price of Ethereum has paced the crypto market, it seems that it will finally cool off.

The main target area for a bounce is between $3,460-$3770, after which the fifth and final wave can begin.

The crypto market stands at a crossroads.

It could either shake off this bearish divergence and continue toward new highs or deepen its already considerable decline.

Bitcoin and Ethereum could both head lower, dragging the crypto market down.

As it stands, a deeper correction is the most likely future outlook.","{'href': 'https://www.ccn.com', 'title': 'CCN.com'}","cryptocurrency"

Home - Crypto Presales - Best Altcoins to Buy Now — Top 3 Picks Before Altcoin Season: XRP, Solana & MAGACOIN FINANCE

As altcoin season approaches, experts highlight XRP, Solana, and MAGACOIN Finance as the top 3 altcoins to buy before the next bull run and breakout market rotation. With Bitcoin consolidating and Ethereum maintaining strength, many traders are rotating capital into alternative coins that offer greater upside and momentum. 

For traders scanning the market for the top altcoin to buy, three names are the tokens to watch: XRP, Solana, and MAGACOIN FINANCE.











MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a standout in the altcoin space as the crypto market booms on widening institutional adoption and ETF momentum. While still in its early stages, the project has gathered attention through community engagement, analyst coverage, and whale accumulation. 

Analysts increasingly highlight MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the memecoins that could deliver outsized gains. As capital rotates in from established names to early-stage coins with viral potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE's blend of strong ecosystem, solid branding, and utility places it on the radar of altcoin-focused investors. 

For investors and traders looking for hidden gems to accumulate before the next bull run, MAGACOIN FINANCE may be your best bet. 

Ripple's XRP has re-entered the spotlight after resolving its long-standing battle with the SEC. With all legal appeals withdrawn, regulatory pressure is now behind the token, opening the door to institutional capital.

ETF optimism is also lifting sentiment. With an 85% probability of approval in 2025, multiple ETF applications are nearing final stages. XRP's role in SWIFT's payments upgrade gives it an added boost, positioning it as a top altcoin to buy for investors seeking exposure to utility and compliance.











Solana remains one of the strongest ecosystems in crypto, dominating daily activity and decentralized exchange (DEX) volume. Its stablecoin supply surpassed $13 billion this year—mostly from Circle's USDC—and stablecoin inflows have historically preceded price rallies.

Institutional inflows are also rising: Galaxy Digital recently staked $60 million worth of SOL, and DeFi-focused firms are increasing holdings. Solana's TVL has climbed to $7.65 billion, ranking second among all blockchains.

If you're looking for top altcoins to buy now, Solana's speed, scale, and active user base make it a compelling option.

From institutional-backed tokens like XRP to high-speed ecosystems like Solana, and politically driven memecoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE, the current cycle offers a wide range of opportunities. 

As regulatory clarity improves and macro trends favor crypto, early positioning in these top altcoins to buy may offer significant upside. However, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned to outperform, with analysts highlighting it as one of the tokens that will define the next bull run market.

抱歉，發生錯誤

You might expect that the blockchain behind the world's third-largest cryptocurrency would earn top marks for security after more than a decade of operation.

But you'd be wrong — at least according to blockchain research firm Kaiko.

The XRP Ledger, which underpins the XRP token, ranked last for security in Kaiko's latest quarterly Blockchain Ecosystem Ranking, scoring just 41 out of 100.

That was the lowest among the 15 blockchains analysed, trailing Polygon at 44 and Stellar at 45, while Ethereum topped the category with 83.

Kaiko's ranking evaluates blockchain networks across five criteria: governance, integration, liquidity, operational efficiency, and security.

The security component includes assessments of operational resilience, validator decentralisation, audit frequency, and past incidents to evaluate infrastructure risks.

While Kaiko did not publish individual sub-scores, senior analyst Adam Morgan McCarthy told DL News that “the main issues were the hack earlier this year, a poor Nakamoto coefficient, and a low number of validators.”

The Nakamoto coefficient score is a metric that estimates how many entities would need to collude to compromise the network, compared to other proof-of-stake chains.

In April, a hacker compromised an official software package used by XRPL developers, injecting malicious code capable of stealing users' private keys.

Although the core ledger and GitHub repository were not affected, the breach put users at risk and raised alarms around XRPL's software supply chain security.

The network's relatively small number of validators and its approach to decentralisation are also points of contention.

Unlike Ethereum and Solana, which rely on large, open validator sets — over 1 million and 1,700, respectively — the XRP Ledger operates with around 190 active validators.

However, only 35 of these are included in its default unique node list — a trusted subset used by most participants to reach consensus.

While this design aims to optimise speed and reliability, critics say it limits diversity and makes the system more vulnerable to coordinated disruption.

This limited validator distribution is reflected in XRP Ledger's low Nakamoto coefficient score.

XRP Ledger architect and Ripple CTO David Schwartz did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Ripple also didn't respond to requests for comment.

Ripple's founders developed XRP. The blockchain now underlines several of the company's services.

The new platform, announced Monday (Aug. 18), is designed to give independent retailers some of the same resources enjoyed by Fortune 500 companies, with the help of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) technology.

“Most small eCommerce sellers rely on disconnected tools—like spreadsheets, shipping apps, and manual systems—that don't talk to each other. This leads to poor visibility and bad decision making,” the company said in a news release. “Because they lack volume and rely on unscalable systems, small businesses can't negotiate better deals on storage, shipping, or staffing.”

By contrast, GoodWares added, larger retailers have access to “integrated, data-driven systems” to streamline operations and reduce costs at scale. This opens a huge gap: bigger players thrive, while their smaller counterparts struggle.

In addition to GoodWares AI and blockchain tech, the company uses what it calls its Enterprise Knowledge Graph (EKG), a “dynamic, visual brain” that monitors changes such as shipping delays or supplier issues and “instantly shows the ripple effects across the entire operation.”

The trend of small businesses leveraging digital tools for their eCommerce needs is something PYMNTS explored last year as the holiday shopping season approached.

That same report pointed to research from the PYMNTS Intelligence report, “New Report: SMBs Race to Critical Mass on AI Usage” which shows that 61% of small businesses say thy use AI to automate daily tasks.

In related news, PYMNTS wrote last week about the three-decade evolution of eCommerce, which has lately seen retailers embed banking-like services into shopping experiences, such as installment plans and savings rewards, “blurring the line between commerce and FinTech.”

For example, Google recently debuted a series of payment updates designed to court online shoppers such as an expansion of the company's pay-over-time options, which let shoppers in the United States choose from buy now, pay later providers like Affirm and Zip through autofill on Chrome in a few clicks.

The PYMNTS Intelligence report “What Consumers Do When Their Go-To Credit Choice Is Unavailable” found that a third of shoppers buying essentials would skip the purchase if their preferred payment method were not offered.

“If the first three decades of eCommerce were about digitizing the store, the next three may be about digitizing the shopper,” that report concluded. “The lines between online and offline are already blurring. In 2055, we may look back at the idea of a checkout page the way we now view fax machines.”

 The NFT market cap dropped 12% to $8.1 billion as Ether fell, with CryptoPunks and Bored Apes sliding while Pudgy Penguins climbed into second place. 

The non-fungible token (NFT) market lost more than $1.2 billion in value in less than a week as Ether's rally slowed, according to sector data.

On Monday, NFT Price Floor data showed that the total valuation of NFT collections had dropped to $8.1 billion, a 12% decline from Wednesday's NFT market cap of $9.3 billion, which had surged 40% since July. 

NFTs losing $1.2 billion in valuation in less than a week coincided with a 9% drop in Ether (ETH) prices. At the time of writing, Cointelegraph data showed ETH traded at $4,260, down from a high of about $4,700 on Wednesday. 

Many NFTs are minted on the Ethereum network. With valuations and sales denominated in ETH, bullish or bearish momentum in the crypto asset often translates into increased or decreased value in the NFT sector. As ETH went down 4% in the last 24 hours, a majority of the top 10 collections also showed declines in value. 

While it continued to be the top collection by market capitalization, CryptoPunks saw about $300 million wiped from the collection's value. 

At the time of writing, data showed it was worth $2.1 billion, down 12% from its 2.4 billion market cap on Wednesday. 

CryptoSlam data showed that the collection's sales volume reached $12.7 million, a 34% drop in the last seven days. Total sales only reached 51, down 28% in the last week. 

The Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), which was ranked second in overall NFT market capitalization on Wednesday, dropped to third place on Monday, as the collection declined to $482.3 million. 

This represented an almost 20% drop from Wednesday's $602 million. 

Related: NFT sales surge to $574 million in July, second-highest in 2025

Meanwhile, Pudgy Penguins climbed to the second-highest valuation despite erasing about $100 million in overall value. 

On Monday, the collection's market cap was $491 million, down 17% from Wednesday's $591 million. 

Last week, publicly traded blockchain company BTCS Inc. announced that it added three Pudgy Penguins NFTs to its corporate digital asset treasury. 

This showed that companies are beginning to recognize blue-chip NFT collections as legitimate assets for treasury diversification.

While a far cry from the heyday back in 2021, this recent surge should grab the attention of investors looking for assets available at a steep discount.

This should shift attention back to the best meme coins. Top new entrants like Best Wallet Token ($BEST) and Snorter Token ($SNORT) are currently on presale, letting you snap them up cheaply before they're listed on exchanges.

According to CoinMarketCap, the NFT market saw a 62.72% increase in its market capitalization over the last 30 days, peaking at $28.4B on August 15.



This growth has mainly been driven by Ethereum's rise in the last few weeks, with its price breaking past the $4K level for the first time since late 2024.

As many NFTs are on the Ethereum blockchain, $ETH's rise has also caused the values of these digital assets to increase.

In fact, the top 10 NFTs based on market capitalization are all on the Ethereum blockchain, led by CryptoPunks with a $2.1B market cap, based on NFT Price Floor data.



A rebound of the value of NFTs could attract investors looking for alternative investments to the tried-and-tested Bitcoin. We already see this in the rise of Ethereum treasuries among businesses racing to be the top holder of the #1 altcoin.

Ethereum is outperforming Bitcoin, up nearly 20% over the past 30 days compared to Bitcoin's down 3%. This divergence suggests the beginning of “altcoin season,” where investors seek higher returns in non-BTC assets

AInvest reported that institutional investors and corporate treasuries now hold about 8% of the total $ETH supply, up from just 3% in April. This shows the speed at which these institutions are stockpiling this asset, a trend that we can expect to continue.

But it's not just NFTs that are turning heads these days. Meme coins continue to gain momentum too, as they offer investors the chance to snap up low-cap digital assets with high growth potential.

With a market cap of $68.1B, the right meme coins have proven to be a gold mine for degens and more adventurous investors.



Those on presale are even cheaper with potentially even higher upside, such as:

It's notoriously difficult to find the next big thing in the crypto market.

There are simply too many launches to keep track of and so little time to research them. This situation increases your risk of landing duds and even downright scams if you're not careful.

Enter Snorter Token ($SNORT). This token presale aims to raise funds for the development of Snorter Bot, a crypto trading bot for Telegram. Once launched, this promises to speed up how you find and snap up promising tokens.



You can do practically all your trading within the bot, including sniping, managing your portfolio, and copying trades. Most importantly, it has a rugpull and honeypot detection feature, which helps protect your funds from hackers and scammers.

As one of this year's best new crypto, Snorter Token has already raised over $2.7M. You can still join and get $SNORT for only $0.1015, but there's a price increase coming in a few hours, so act quickly.

If you prefer to stake your tokens, you can currently enjoy rewards at 138% APY. A reward rate this high makes supporting the network extra enticing. Take note, though, that this can still change as more people lock in their tokens.

You can HODL $SNORT too and use it to get unlimited snipes and other perks. According to our Snorter Token price prediction, it also has some real upside, as its value could reach as much as $3.25 in 2030.

Get your Snorter Token today.

As your crypto portfolio grows, so does the need to store your assets somewhere secure like Best Wallet.

As a non-custodial crypto wallet, Best Wallet gives you total control over your private keys. This means only you can access your keys to sign your transactions and prove ownership of your crypto.



Best Wallet lets you trade, swap, and sell over 1000 different cryptos and even find the best new presales in its Token Launchpad.

It's available for both iOS and Android devices, making it easy to install and convenient to use on the go.

Powering the wallet is its native Best Wallet Token ($BEST), which gives you additional perks, like low transaction fees, governance rights, and early-bird access to the newest token presales.

To date, the presale has raised over $14.9M and shows no signs of slowing down. To get your $BEST tokens, simply go to the Best Wallet presale page and get them for only $0.025495 each.

Our Best Wallet Token buying guide has all the details to get you started.

Join the Best Wallet Token presale.

Not all of us have the patience to HODL and wait for our tokens to appreciate, and that's perfectly fine. This is why the Bitcoin Penguins ($BPENGU) presale exists.

It's a token presale from July 28 to August 27, letting you get in and out quickly. There are also 15 price increases, with a 5% increase in price with each stage. That means if you went in at Stage 1, your tokens will appreciate by 98% by Stage 15.



The project also gives you the chance to earn Bitcoins with its weekly $BTC giveaway.

With only a little over a week before the presale closes, this could be your last chance to get $BPENGU cheaply. It's currently being sold for $0.00171 each and offers staking for as much as 100% APY.

Learn more about the $BPENGU presale.

Despite the resurgence of NFTs, they're still going for a steal compared to their peak around 2021. That means now's a great time to buy before they potentially soar again.

Alternatively, check out the best meme coins like Snorter Token ($SNORT) and Best Wallet Token ($BEST). They're currently on presale, which means, like NFTs, they're available for cheap and offer high growth potential before they're listed on exchanges.

The NFT market is a wild ride, isn't it? One moment you're cruising with sky-high valuations, and the next, you're plummeting back to earth. Such is the life of a crypto startup trying to make sense of it all. As this landscape shifts, companies are learning to manage their treasury assets to keep things afloat. The strategies they're adopting emphasize the need for diversification, liquidity management, and a focus on intrinsic value. Sure, there's risk, but there's also opportunity in the mix. Let's dive into how these companies are navigating the storm.

Ethereum is like the heartbeat of the NFT market. It's where many NFTs come to life, and when ETH takes a dive, so does the overall NFT market cap. A recent example saw over $1.2 billion vanish in a week due to ETH's decline. It's a clear signal that crypto startups need to keep a close eye on ETH trends and adjust their treasury strategies. Being in tune with this relationship can help manage liquidity and make more informed decisions about NFT investments.

Navigating the NFT market's volatility isn't for the faint of heart. Crypto startups need to embrace solid treasury management strategies. One way? Diversify that portfolio. Keep it balanced with stablecoins, fiat, and a range of NFTs. When markets swing, this can help cushion the blow. Plus, having a crypto payroll system that pays employees in stablecoins can reduce their exposure to the wild price fluctuations. This trend is gaining traction, and for good reason.

DAOs are starting to explore crypto payroll options, which could streamline their operations. Using blockchain, they can automate payroll, cut down on admin work, and boost transparency. This aligns perfectly with the decentralization ethos, and it could make things run a lot smoother.

Companies that ride out NFT volatility successfully often focus on intrinsic value and sustainable use cases. Those that prioritize quality over quantity in NFT investments tend to fare better. When there's real utility and community engagement, it builds a loyal customer base and adds long-term value.

Successful companies also avoid panic selling like the plague. Coordinating token release schedules and spreading out holdings across exchanges helps dampen the impact of sudden price drops. It's a smart way to maintain financial stability in this unpredictable environment.

Using NFTs as treasury assets in a volatile market isn't without its challenges. The risk of fraud, scams, and theft is always lurking. And don't even get me started on the regulatory gray areas.

But the potential rewards can't be ignored. NFTs offer verifiable authenticity and ownership, which can be leveraged for innovative asset management strategies. Those who navigate the risks could find new paths for growth.

The rise of stablecoin salaries is changing the game. As more companies adopt crypto payroll solutions, the demand for USDC and other stablecoins is likely to grow. This not only helps manage liquidity but also provides employees with a reliable payment option, which is a welcome change from traditional banking systems.

In a nutshell, navigating the NFT market requires a strategic approach. Diversification, liquidity management, and risk mitigation are the keys to success. The lessons learned from companies that have successfully weathered the NFT storm highlight the importance of intrinsic value and proactive strategies. As the digital asset landscape changes, those who adapt will be best positioned to thrive despite the chaos.

An early Ethereum initial coin offering participant sent another 4,460 ether to Kraken, worth roughly $19 million on Monday, as the wallet continued offloading into a softer market.

According to Arkham data, the address beginning ""0x815"" has deposited 9,803 ETH, valued at about $43.9 million, to crypto exchanges over the past seven days. The wallet still holds 197 ETH, around $843,900 at current prices.

Blockchain trackers like OnchainLens have previously flagged a string of transfers from the same address in recent days, including 2,000 ETH ($8.6 million), 1,162 ETH ($5.2 million), and 1,060 ETH ($5.1 million) sent to trading venues while ether approached an all-time high last week. Large, older wallets moving coins onto exchanges are often read as potential sell signals, though flows do not guarantee immediate market sales.

A separate ICO wallet movement was also observed over the weekend, involving older coins acquired initially for a fraction of current prices. As The Block reported, an address moved $1.5 million in ETH originally bought for $104.

Ether slipped in the past day alongside a broader risk pullback, down over 6% in the last 24 hours, The Block's price page shows.

• Digital ruble to bring Russia's economy $3 billion annually.
• Economic effect for Russian firms estimated at $600 million a year.
• Analysts warn about losses for the country's banking system and security risks.

The digital ruble is expected to bring Russia's economy some $3 billion or more annually in the first five years of its introduction, according to a new estimate presented in Moscow.

While banks are set to initially lose billions of rubles due to the digital cash, businesses will benefit right off the bat, claim Russian analysts trying to predict the effects of the new form of national fiat.

Bank of Russia's central bank digital currency (CBDC) will generate up to 260 billion rubles (almost $3.3 billion) a year for the country's economy by 2031, according to a forecast produced by the Moscow-based National Rating Agency (NRA).

Its analysis indicates that in the first few years of scaling up the digital ruble, the economic effect for Russian companies will be 30 to 50 billion rubles annually (over $600 million), while the same for banks will be in the range 5-8 billion rubles (under $100 million).

In the beginning, bank revenues may suffer in the absence of cashback and amid an outflow of customers to new service providers, the authors of the study noted in a report seen by Russia's official TASS news agency.

In a pessimistic scenario, the banking system as a whole may lose 45-95 billion rubles (nearly $1.2 billion) in terms of unpaid fees, starting from 2027. That amounts to around 8-10% of the total net profits of Russian banks.

From 2029, the effect of the introduction of the digital ruble will be more evenly distributed across various segments of the economy, according to the document, quoted on Monday.

Costs for the CBDC's tech integration are estimated at an average of 200-300 million rubles per bank, and total investments that the banking sector needs to make are 30-50 billion rubles (approx. $370 – $620 million). NRA researchers summed up:

“For the 2029-2031 timeframe, effects for the economy may grow to 200-260 billion rubles per year, while effects for banks may approach 40-50 billion rubles, and they will be distributed more evenly throughout the economy.”

The NRA expects that once the digital ruble is fully implemented, banks will be able to make between 17 and 61 billion rubles ($760 million) in additional income in the form of commissions on alternative products based on smart contracts, for instance.

Savings in customer acquisition costs will come from exploiting new opportunities for targeted marketing, optimization of interbank transactions through the Bank of Russia's infrastructure, and development of corporate liquidity management services.

The digital ruble has been under development for quite some time, but so far, only a limited number of authorized users have been allowed to participate in a pilot project that has been going on for almost two years.

Following a recent call from President Vladimir Putin for mass adoption of the Russian CBDC, the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) announced in June a new schedule for its introduction in stages, starting from Sept. 1, 2026, which was later approved by lawmakers in the State Duma.

Despite the authorities' eagerness to facilitate its widespread use, around half of Russian citizens, and even some officials like the head of Russia's largest bank, German Gref, remain skeptical about the need for a government-issued digital coin.

The NRA analysts also point to some of the risks associated with the initiative, including more expensive financing, as a result of potential transfer of significant funds to digital ruble accounts at the CBR, as well as growing pressure on traditional payment services.

Development of technologies like quantum computing may pose another threat, they added, as these may be used to create new tools for fraud, crack security codes, and rewrite transaction history.

Japan is preparing to greenlight its first yen-denominated stablecoin this autumn, marking a big step in the country's approach to digital assets and cross-border payments, Monday.

The Financial Services Agency is expected to approve issuance of the stablecoin as early as October, with the token aimed at uses ranging from international remittances to corporate settlements. 

Tokyo-based fintech company JPYC will spearhead the launch. The firm plans to register as a money transfer business within the month, paving the way for sales to begin soon after. The stablecoin, also called JPYC, will maintain its peg to the yen through reserves of highly liquid assets, including deposits and government bonds.

🇯🇵 Japan to greenlight first yen-based stablecoin. The Financial Services Agency will approve the issuance of Japan's first yen-denominated stablecoin as early as autumn, with the aim of using it for international remittances and more.— World of Statistics (@stats_feed) Institutional Capital Eyes JPYC for Carry Trades

Individuals, businesses and institutional investors will be able to purchase JPYC once registration is complete. Buyers will make payments that are then converted into digital tokens, which will be transferred into electronic wallets. 

Potential uses include sending money to students abroad, facilitating cross-border corporate payments and enabling participation in decentralized finance.

The company's goal is ambitious. Over the next three years, it intends to issue 1 trillion yen worth of JPYC, equal to about $6.8b at today's exchange rate of 147.37 yen to the dollar. 

Interest has already emerged from hedge funds active in cryptocurrencies and family offices managing the assets of wealthy investors.Stablecoin Oversight Positions Japan as Industry Pioneer

Market participants expect the token to support strategies such as carry trades, which exploit interest rate differentials across currencies. The timing coincides with rising global attention on stablecoins, whose total market capitalization recently surpassed $250b, dominated by dollar-backed tokens.

Japan revised its legal framework in June 2023 to clarify the status of stablecoins. Under the new rules, these tokens are defined as “currency-denominated assets” and can only be issued by banks, trust companies and registered money transfer businesses. That distinction sets them apart from other cryptocurrencies and is intended to provide stronger investor protections.

JPYC's launch shows how Japan's regulatory clarity has positioned the country as a pioneer in digital asset oversight. Analysts say this foundation gives firms a more predictable environment to experiment with blockchain-based payments and settlement systems.Remittances and DeFi Fuel Stablecoin Adoption

Stablecoins are now a crucial bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset economy. For instance, tokens like USDT from Tether and USDC from Circle dominate trading pairs on crypto exchanges. Moreover, they are widely used for remittances and decentralized finance.

Citigroup has projected that the by 2030, more than ten times its current size. That outlook suggests yen-pegged offerings could carve out a niche as Asian investors seek alternatives to dollar-denominated tokens.

The Japanese initiative arrives as governments worldwide step up their scrutiny of stablecoins. 

Policymakers remain concerned about potential risks to financial stability, but the structured approach taken in Tokyo may ease those worries while opening doors for innovation.

If JPYC gains traction, it could set a precedent for other non-dollar stablecoins. In turn, this may encourage broader adoption across Asia. For Japan, the launch marks a domestic milestone. At the same time, it offers the country a chance to strengthen its influence in the fast-changing digital currency landscape.

Stablecoin issuer JPYC received Japan's first funds transfer service provider license today, claiming it is the first such license granted to a digital currency issuer. The Nikkei had reported earlier that JPYC was expected to receive approval this month, potentially enabling it to launch a regulated yen stablecoin by October.

The development represents a significant milestone for Japan's digital finance strategy. With the yen ranking as the fourth most widely used currency for cross border payments according to Swift statistics, regulated yen stablecoins could play an important role in international payments in the future.

The licensing breakthrough follows Japan's establishment of a comprehensive stablecoin framework in June 2023. The Payment Services Act now recognizes three types of digital currencies: those issued by banks and backed by deposits; trust bank stablecoins with ringfenced assets; and tokens issued by funds transfer firms such as JPYC, backed by bank deposits and government bonds.

Cryptocurrency started with Bitcoin, which is now one of the most successful digital stores of value.

Ethereum opened up new ways to use blockchain technology by introducing smart contracts.

Stablecoins could gain widespread adoption as a digital currency, and Tether is the leading U.S. dollar stablecoin.

10 stocks we like better than Bitcoin ›

Entering the world of crypto investing can be a daunting experience. A massive number of cryptocurrencies exist -- over 15 million, according to CoinMarketCap data. Because of how easy it is to launch a new cryptocurrency, the number is only growing.

But most of them have little to offer for investors. Crypto is a top-heavy market, and it's full of scams and projects with no legitimate use or value.

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue »

So, which cryptocurrencies are worth your time? Start with these three to better understand the use cases for crypto and the top investment opportunities.

Image source: Getty Images.

Launched in 2009, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is the first cryptocurrency and the most successful. Remember how I said that the crypto market is top heavy? Well, with a market cap of $2.4 trillion (as of Aug. 14), Bitcoin makes up 56% of the entire market.

Bitcoin's purpose was to be a decentralized currency, meaning one that wasn't beholden to banks or any governing body. To accomplish that, it uses a blockchain -- a digital transaction ledger that's maintained and updated by a network of computers. Anyone who wants to participate in the Bitcoin mining process can become part of this computer network and help verify transactions.

While Bitcoin was originally intended as a currency, most people don't actually use it that way. It's too volatile, and transactions are slow and expensive compared to newer cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin has instead become a digital store of value. There's a limited number of Bitcoin available, as it has a maximum supply of 21 million. Bitcoin proponents believe that the built-in scarcity will lead to continued growth.

Early cryptocurrencies used blockchains solely to record transactions. Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) changed that when it launched in 2015. Ethereum was unique because it could run smart contracts, which are programs built into a blockchain.

The introduction of smart contracts significantly expanded what could be done with blockchain technology. Smart contract blockchains aren't just transaction ledgers; they're platforms where developers can build decentralized apps (dApps) and launch projects.

One of the notable use cases for smart contract blockchains is decentralized finance (DeFi). DeFi refers to financial systems built on blockchain technology, such as crypto borrowing and lending protocols. For example, Aave is a peer-to-peer crypto loan service that was originally built on the Ethereum blockchain (it's also now available on other blockchains). The Aave protocol is able to facilitate crypto loans entirely with smart contracts.

Many blockchains now have smart contract capabilities, but Ethereum was the first and has the most activity. There's $154 billion of total value locked into DeFi protocols across the entire crypto market, according to DeFiLlama. Over 60% of that value is locked into the Ethereum blockchain.

Tether (CRYPTO: USDT) is the largest stablecoin by market cap. A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency designed to stay pegged to another asset, meaning it mimics that asset's value. Tether is a U.S. dollar stablecoin, so 1 USDT should ideally maintain a value of $1 at all times.

Even though stablecoins aren't an investment, they play a crucial role in the crypto market. Most cryptocurrencies are volatile, which poses a problem when you want to use them as a currency. The value can change quite a bit between the time you purchase a cryptocurrency and when you're ready to use it.

Since they aren't volatile, stablecoins are better for this role. They haven't reached widespread adoption yet, but it could be a matter of time. The U.S. passed the Genius Act last month, a landmark piece of legislation that regulates stablecoins. In addition, several top financial companies are developing or considering their own stablecoins, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and PayPal.

Tether is one of many stablecoins, but since it's the biggest, it serves as a good starting point. It also demonstrates the potential risks involved. The issuer, Tether Limited, paid a $41 million fine in 2021 for misleading statements about the reserves backing its USDT tokens. Even though stablecoins are supposed to be stable, they're really only as safe as the issuer and the reserves backing them.

While exciting, cryptocurrency is an extremely risky asset class. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and most other top coins have gone through periods where they've lost 50% or more of their value.

If you're going to invest in crypto, it should ideally be a small portion of your portfolio. A good rule of thumb is to have anywhere from 1% to 5% of your portfolio in cryptocurrency and the rest in more established investments, including stocks and bonds. Also, only invest money you can afford to lose so you're not tempted to sell if the crypto market drops.

In a sharp reversal from last week's euphoric record highs and $300,000 bitcoin price targets, some of crypto's most followed traders are now warning of looming downside risks for both bitcoin BTC$116,864.09 and ether (ETH).

Bitcoin is currently trading at $115,000, down nearly 3% overnight, but relatively comfortable within its recent $112,000 to $124,000 range. ETH, meanwhile, is down by 5% over the past 24 hours at $4,317, though still 21% from a month earlier.

Among the possible reasons for Monday's decline are jitters around the Federal Reserve's potential rate cut in September, which would benefit risk assets liks crypto.

While rate markets continue to point to a high likelihood of a Fed cut next month, the odds per CME FedWatch have slipped to 83% from nearly 100% at one point last week.

Andrew Kang, co-founder of Mechanism Capital, was one of the loudest voices predicting crypto downside on Monday, suggesting ETH could be staring at billions in liquidations as leveraged positions unwind. 

“Would estimate we're about to hit $5 billion in ETH liquidations across exchanges,” Kang posted on X. 

He forecast a possible slide in ether's price to between $3,200 and $3,600, warning the market was “not ready to find out what happens when that buying dissipates.” His comments follow the launch of ETH DATs (Deposit Access Tokens), which drove short-term demand but may now face a vacuum of momentum.

The bearish tone comes against the backdrop of a record-breaking validator exit queue, with 885,000 ETH ($3.8 billion) awaiting withdrawal from Ethereum's staking mechanism, as CoinDesk reported last week. 

Much of the movement reflects profit-taking, the unwinding of risky leveraged staking strategies, and preparations for the launch of potential ETH staking ETFs. Large liquid staking players like Lido have seen hundreds of thousands of ETH withdrawn, adding to market jitters about potential forced liquidations.

Pseudonymous trader Flood also became increasingly vocal about the downside risk on Monday, telling followers:  “Back to $2k you go Ethereum, where you belong.” 

The comments reflect a stark shift in sentiment, demonstrating the fragile psychology that drives crypto markets where bullish and bearish narratives can quickly unravel.

For astute traders, however, the shift in sentiment can be seen as opportunity; as Wall Street veteran Warren Buffett once said: “Buy when there's blood in the streets, even if the blood is your own.”

Oliver Knight is the co-leader of CoinDesk data tokens and data team. Before joining CoinDesk in 2022 Oliver spent three years as the chief reporter at Coin Rivet. He first started investing in bitcoin in 2013 and spent a period of his career working at a market making firm in the UK. He does not currently have any crypto holdings.

Crypto traders should remain vigilant for an ether (ETH) price drop below $4,200, which could trigger millions in long liquidations and increase market volatility.

As of writing, over 56,638 ETH in bullish long positions – valued at $236 million – faced liquidation risk on the decentralized perpetual exchange Hyperliquid in case of an ether price drop to $4,170, according to data from Hyperdash. 

The data also showed a risk of sizable liquidations at $2,150-$2,160 and $3,940. At press time, ether changed hands at $4,260, down nearly 5% on the day, according to CoinDesk data.

Andrew Kang, founder of the crypto venture capital firm Mechanism Capital, stated on X that large long liquidations could potentially drive ether prices down to $3,600.

""[I] would estimate we're about to hit $5b in ETH liquidations across exchanges, taking us down to $3.2k - $3.6k,"" Kang said.

Liquidations, or the forced closure of leveraged bets, happen when a trader's position falls short of the margin requirements set by the exchange. 

The margin shortage typically occurs when the market moves against the trader's position, causing their account equity to fall below the minimum maintenance margin. This prompts the exchange to automatically close the position to prevent further losses and ensure borrowed funds are recovered.

Largely long liquidations cause a sudden surge in selling pressure, which pushes prices even lower, creating a cascading effect that can trigger additional liquidations. This negative feedback loop tends to amplify market volatility.

 Multiple technical indicators and recent whale activity raise Bitcoin's odds of declining below $100,00 in coming weeks. 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin risks a deeper correction toward $88K–$94K after breaking below a rising wedge.

A 2021-like double top pattern is increasing BTC's odds of declining below $100,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) has corrected by nearly 8% since establishing its record high of over $124,500 four days ago. It now risks further declines due to a classic bearish reversal pattern.

Bitcoin has confirmed a breakdown from its rising wedge pattern on the daily chart, as highlighted by analyst Captain Faibik. 

Traditional analysts see rising wedges as bearish reversal structures that typically precede sharp declines, especially after a sustained uptrend. In Bitcoin's case, the wedge has been forming since April, with higher highs and higher lows compressing toward the apex.

The breakdown below the wedge's support trendline points to a test of Bitcoin's recent resistance-turned-support targets, signaling weakening momentum and rising seller pressure, the analyst said.

They highlighted immediate support at $110,000–$112,000. Losing this range could open the path toward $105,000–$108,000. 

BTC may extend the decline to the key $98,000–$100,000 psychological zone by September, a 20% correction from its recent peak, if selling intensifies.

A rising wedge's breakdown target is typically measured after subtracting the structure's maximum height from the breakdown point. 

Applying the same to the Bitcoin chart brings its downside target to as low as $88,000, as shown below.

The bearish scenario will be invalidated if Bitcoin holds strong above its 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA), a strong support zone during BTC's 50%-plus rise since April. 

In that case, the price will likely rebound toward the wedge's upper trendline at around $125,000 by September.

Bitcoin's weekly close reflects a potential double top, similar to 2021, a bearish reversal pattern marked by two consecutive peaks around the same level, signaling weakening momentum.

In 2021, this pattern preceded a 77% correction, with BTC dropping from around $69,000 to below $16,000 in the following months. 

A similar setup now raises short-term downside risks unless the price reverses quickly, according to analyst Swissblock.

Bitcoin risks falling toward its 50-day EMA (the red wave) at around $94,750 by September, if the double top scenario plays out as it did in 2021.

The 50-week EMA has acted as a strong accumulation zone since June 2023.

Bitcoin onchain metrics further heighten the possibility of more price declines in the coming weeks. 

The number of mega whale addresses holding over 10,000 BTC has dropped to its lowest level this year, with a sustained negative 30-day change since mid-July, according to data resource Glassnode. 

Whale wallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC have also declined, reflecting profit-taking near Bitcoin's recent highs. 

Combined with the rising wedge breakdown and weakening technicals, this whale-driven selling pressure increases the risk of a broader pullback unless strong spot demand returns.

There's one big difference between the 2021 and current BTC price cycle.

In 2021, Bitcoin peaked just as the Federal Reserve began tapering and shifted toward quantitative tightening (QT). This time, odds favor a 25-basis-point (bps) Fed rate cut in September, according to CME data.

Additionally, a persistently growing global money supply (M2) hints at a $132,000 price target for Bitcoin in the coming months. Some even predict the BTC price hitting $170,000.

Such a liquidity shift could counterbalance technical weakness in the short term, keeping BTC's broader uptrend intact, Swissblock says.

 A China Merchants Bank subsidiary launched a Hong Kong-based crypto exchange for professional investors after securing a virtual asset service provider license. 

CMB International Securities Limited, a subsidiary of the China Merchants Bank (CMB) — one of China's top banks — launched a cryptocurrency exchange in Hong Kong.

According to a Monday CMB WeChat announcement, the bank has started offering virtual asset trading services. The launch comes after the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission approved the bank's application for a virtual asset service provider license in mid-July.

CMB's Hong Kong-based crypto exchange allows for 24/7 trading of Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and Tether's USDt (USDT) for eligible investors. Documentation provided by the bank clarified that only professional investors are eligible for crypto trading services.

China Merchants Bank is one of the country's largest banks, managing over $1.7 trillion worth of assets as of the end of March, according to Macrotrends data. The bank's ordinary class A shares have a market capitalization of $153.16 billion.

CMB said it is the first Chinese bank–affiliated broker in Hong Kong to secure licenses tied to virtual asset trading services. The bank also noted plans to integrate traditional stock trading with digital assets and fintech applications.

Still, in Shenzhen, China — where the bank's headquarters are located — such a service would be illegal. The Chinese government banned crypto trading in 2017, resulting in major sell-offs at the time.

Since then, Chinese authorities have continued to treat crypto trading as illegal in mainland China, leading some market participants to devise creative solutions. 

Hong Kong operates under its own rules within China's “one country, two systems” policy, and is increasingly emerging as a local crypto hub.

Hong Kong authorities appear to have made crypto regulation a high-priority part of their agenda. On the first day of this month, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) finalized its regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers.

The introduction of the new rules led to stablecoin companies operating in Hong Kong posting double-digit losses on Aug. 1, just after they came into force. Analysts at the time described the sell-off as a healthy correction, as the requirements for stablecoin issuers proved to be more stringent than expected.

The new rules were rolled out in a six-month transition period starting from Aug. 1. The new Stablecoin Ordinance effectively criminalizes the offering or promotion of unlicensed fiat-referenced stablecoins to retail investors. Local authorities also launched a dedicated public license registry before the rules came into effect.

The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission has warned that the introduction of the new local stablecoin regulatory framework has increased the risk of fraud. Last week, the SFC also issued immediate guidance on cryptocurrency custody standards, introducing sweeping security requirements and a ban on smart contracts in cold wallet implementations — a rule that conflicts with current practices at several leading firms.

 The Thai government will allow tourists to exchange crypto for Thai baht and make electronic payments through e-money service providers. 

Update (Aug. 18, 8:12 am UTC): This article has been updated to include an official statement from the Thai SEC.

Thailand is preparing to launch a regulatory sandbox that will allow foreign tourists to convert cryptocurrencies into Thai baht for spending in the country, its securities regulator said.

The “TouristDigiPay” project will run for 18 months beginning in the fourth quarter of 2025, according to an Aug. 18 announcement from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sent to Cointelegraph. The initiative is being co-developed with the Ministry of Finance, the Anti-Money Laundering Office (AMLO) and the Ministry of Tourism and Sports.

Notably, the SEC stressed that cryptocurrencies will not be allowed to be used directly for goods and services. Merchants will receive payment in baht, while Know Your Customer and Customer Due Diligence requirements set by AMLO will apply to both digital asset operators and e-money providers.

The TouristDigiPay project builds upon the existing ecosystem that integrates the digital asset trading system regulated by the SEC with the e-money system regulated by the Bank of Thailand,” said SEC Secretary-General Pornanong Budsaratragoon. She added that the program includes “appropriate risk management measures” designed to safeguard both tourists and merchants.

There will also be safeguards, including monthly spending limits and a block on direct cash withdrawals.

The TouristDigiPay scheme is an attempt to breathe new life into Thailand's tourism industry, and a direct response to a slowdown in foreign visitors, especially from China, which has long been considered a cornerstone of the industry, local outlet The Nation reported on Saturday.

Thailand welcomed about 16.8 million tourists in the first half of 2025, down from 17.7 million in the year-earlier period, with a 24% drop in tourists from East Asia and a 34% fall in visitor numbers from China, The World Tourism Institute said in a July 10 report. 

The report said tourists are eyeing other countries in the region, such as Japan with its weaker Japanese yen making it more affordable, and the comparatively cheaper Vietnam.

“Thailand's 5% tourism decline in 2025 underlines the urgent need for diversification, market repositioning, and enhanced visitor experiences to compete in a changing regional landscape,” the report said.

Using crypto to stimulate tourism has been under review by the Thai government, with the country's SEC completing a public consultation on the use of financial innovation and digital assets to support economic and tourism growth on Aug. 13.

Chunhavajira first announced the TouristDigiPay initiative during an investment seminar in Bangkok on May 26.

It followed an announcement in January about a trial to allow foreign visitors to pay for goods and services using cryptocurrencies in Phuket, one of Thailand's most popular tourist destinations. The trial is still in the works. 

The Kingdom of Bhutan in South Asia has also taken steps to integrate crypto payments into its tourism infrastructure, with a partnership between Binance Pay and local bank DK Bank to let users pay for their expenses using crypto.

Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin inked a deal with Shift4 Payments on Aug. 11, offering customers the option to pay for outer space trips in Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Solana (SOL) and Stablecoins such as USDT (USDT) and USDC (USDC).

Meanwhile, in July, the United Arab Emirates signed an agreement with Crypto.com to allow passengers to pay for flights and in-flight purchases using crypto.

Chikungunya Outbreak, Glacial Outbursts and a New Human Ancestor

China is having a fast-rising chikungunya outbreak in a place that has never had one before.

Rachel Feltman: Happy Monday, listeners! For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman. Let's kick off the week with a quick roundup of some of the latest science news.

First, a public health update from one of our colleagues at Scientific American, senior health editor Josh Fischman. He's here to update us on an ongoing outbreak of the chikungunya virus in China.

Josh Fischman: So what has happened here is that, in June, China started reporting a spike in cases of chikungunya, and China is having a fast rising outbreak in a place that has never had one before. These are centered on the southern province of Guangdong and its city of Foshan—that's near Hong Kong. And by the beginning of August, there were up to 7,000 cases.

In 2025 about 240,000 cases and 90 deaths have been reported in 16 different countries and territories, and that's just through July.

The chikungunya virus was first identified in Africa in 1952. The name comes from a Makonde word—uh, that's a language spoken in Tanzania—that means to bend up, and it refers to the most prominent symptoms, which are really, really painful joints that distort your posture and contort you into uncomfortable positions.

In addition, it causes a fever and rashes, and these things are usually short-lived. They take a week or two to get over. Sometimes, though, they can continue for years. And sometimes Chikungunya can cause heart damage.

The virus is carried by two mosquito species, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. And people can get sick within three to seven days of a bite.

And what worries me a little bit is that chikungunya moves really easily in this age of fast global travel. There are already outbreaks in France, and in Italy, and cases reported in the U.S.

Experts say that people in the United States should be a little concerned. There are, however, limiting factors that should minimize worry: spraying insecticides and illuminating mosquito areas. And in a temperate area, like most of the United States, the first killing frost will get rid of the insects and that stops viral transmission.

However, if you do get bitten and get sick, there are no good antiviral therapies. There's no specific treatment for chikungunya. And this is important if you're traveling to affected areas where there are big outbreaks. There are two effective and Food and Drug Administration–approved vaccines that get the body to produce antibodies, and these both lower the risk of infection. And pretty fortunately, insect repellents and protective clothing work pretty well.

Feltman: And now for some climate news. Last Tuesday officials in Juneau, Alaska, confirmed a glacial outburst at Suicide Basin, a lake about 10 miles from the city center that's attached to the Mendenhall Glacier. A glacial lake outburst flood, also known as a GLOF, is a rapid, unpredictable flood caused by the sudden drainage of a glacial lake.

As glaciers melt—which is happening faster these days, thanks to climate change—some of their water forms so-called glacial lakes. They're often dammed up naturally by glacial ice or by rocks and soil left behind as the glacier melts. But as meltwater levels rise, they can overflow the natural dam or even bust right through it. Suicide Basin has been a regular site of outburst floods since 2011, but the annual GLOFs have gotten worse each year since 2023.

By last Wednesday morning, the Mendenhall River had entered the major flood stage. Floodwaters had receded by that same evening but only after reaching a peak of 16.65 feet. That's more than half a foot higher than last year's peak flooding, which broke previous records. Local officials said a set of temporary barriers placed along the river earlier this year, along with close monitoring and early warnings to the public, kept flooding of homes, schools and businesses to a minimum. The Alaska Beacon reported that no overnight rescues or emergency evacuations had been required and that flood damage was limited to one bridge and some seepage of water into homes and yards. In contrast, last year's floods caused major damage to 64 homes, and some residents had to swim to safety or be rescued by boat.

In other science news, a study published in Nature last Wednesday describes the remains of an entirely new species of human ancestor. The fossils, which date back to around 2.8 million to 2.6 million years ago, belong to a new member of the genus Australopithecus, meaning this species is a cousin of the famous Lucy. The species doesn't have a formal name yet, because researchers are hoping to find more fossils first—the new study is based only on a handful of teeth collected in Ethiopia. But even with just a few chompers to go on, the researchers say they're confident they've got a new hominin on their hands. The news is particularly exciting because of something else the researchers found at the same site: teeth from a member of our own Homo genus. That means this new flavor of Australopithecus could have lived alongside close relatives of ours.

And speaking of human origins: In a study published last Friday in the journal Science Advances, researchers report capturing the process of human embryo implantation in three dimensions in real time. The researchers note that we already knew that embryos had to burrow into uterine tissue in order to successfully implant but that most studies have focused on the genetic and biochemical aspects of this stage of conception instead of examining the mechanical process.

Scientists from the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia in Spain created experimental platforms made of collagen, designed to mimic the tissue of the uterine lining. They created systems to use with both human cells and mouse cells. When they introduced mouse embryos to their artificial uterus, the embryos exerted force to press themselves against the surface. Then the uterus adapted by folding its cellular matrix around the embryo to envelope it. Human embryos acted differently, burrowing into the uterine tissue to penetrate it. The researchers also saw signs that the embryos could sense and react to mechanical forces from their environment, as well as from other nearby embryos. Previous research suggests that between one third and half of all fertilized eggs fail to fully implant, so a better understanding of the mechanical process could help address some cases of infertility.

Let's cap things off with a fun animal story. According to a study published last Tuesday in the journal Discover Animals, dolphins and whales have been hanging out together without us. Researchers studied nearly 200 different video clips of whales and dolphins interacting with each other, spanning across 20 years and 17 countries. They found that six types of whales and 13 species of dolphin seemed to interact socially. Humpback whales and bottlenose dolphins were particularly prone to indulging in interspecies hangs, and the most common interaction involved dolphins swimming alongside a whale's snout. They may be engaging in a practice known as “bow riding,” which is where dolphins use the pressure fronts created by ships or large whales to swim faster. The researchers believe that dolphins may seek whales out for stimulation or play and that whales may sometimes reciprocate.

That's all for this week's news roundup. We'll be back on Wednesday to talk about the surprising sexual diversity of the animal kingdom.

Why This Seabird's Superpooper Lifestyle Is Amazing Scientists

The first detailed observation of the bathroom habits of Streaked Shearwaters at sea leave scientists with a surprising load of questions

By Meghan Bartels edited by Clara Moskowitz

Leo Uesaka

When a scientist started fixing backward-facing cameras to the bellies of seabirds called Streaked Shearwaters in a breeding colony in Japan, he had pure intentions: he wanted to observe the birds' leg movements as they launched into flight from the water.

And so he sat down with the video footage only to see—splat!—very little besides—splat!—poop. Leo Uesaka, a seabird biologist at the University of Tokyo, noticed that his cameras were recording an awful lot of midair pooping. It was time to change his research project.

The results of his refocused analysis of 35 hours of footage from 15 birds, published on August 18 in the journal Current Biology, show several surprises. The Streaked Shearwaters (Calonectris leucomelas) were pooping every four to 10 minutes, an average of five times per hour, losing perhaps 5 percent of their body mass hourly. Each individual bird seemed to have a regular interval at which it pooped. And the birds almost exclusively pooped when flying, occasionally seeming to take off for that sole purpose.

That's three strange findings from one simple innovation: turning the bird-mounted video camera around. “Video loggers are always looking forward to share the bird's view,” Uesaka says. And if Uesaka didn't expect to see much from footage facing the other direction, he's in good company, other researchers say.

In the study, Uesaka and his co-author “have pointed out something that probably very few people ever even thought about,” says Hugh Ellis, a biologist at the University of San Diego, who studies seabirds but was not involved with the new research. “Everybody's going to want to know whether their seabirds excrete only over water.”

Although research on seabird pooping habits might sound silly, it's not just a matter of idle curiosity: there are important scientific questions at play.

“We know that seabirds have a huge influence on ecosystems via the prey that they consume,” says Ruth Dunn, a marine ecologist at Lancaster University in England, who studies seabirds and was not involved with Uesaka's study. “But increasingly now, research groups are beginning to think about the influence of the other end, the guano that they're excreting.” (Guano is the scientific term for seabird poop—although it's not really poop per se because birds have a multipurpose hole called a cloaca for disposing of mixed waste products and package their urine into a goopier product that results in less water loss than mammals' urine. But you know what we mean.)

It's not just seabirds either—in recent decades scientists have started recognizing that all animals produce waste that can, depending on their habits, move vital elements such as phosphorus and nitrogen throughout ecosystems.

“Of course, all animals excrete or defecate in some way,” says Joe Roman, a conservation biologist at the University of Vermont, who studies nutrient cycling and was not involved in the new research. “Everything from the smallest insects to bison to wolves—all species can play a role in this movement of nutrients between systems.”

If plants are the lungs of the planet, then this nutrient cycling is a sort of circulatory system—the question is what kind of scale it occurs on. “They also can move nutrients when they die, but of course you only die once,” he says. “For most animals, they're peeing and pooping every day.”

Or, in the case of Streaked Shearwaters, they're doing so every few minutes. Uesaka and his co-author, Katsufumi Sato of the University of Tokyo, can't definitively explain why the birds poop so often or why they defecate from the air, although the researchers posit that excreting almost exclusively during flight could be a sort of hygiene measure.

Unfortunately, that strategy would be hygienic only for the pooper. Uesaka says that the footage comes from foraging trips in which the shearwaters form large flocks, with some birds resting on the surface while others fly—and poop—overhead. He says it's important for scientists to know how much birds are pooping at sea, given that bird flu is decimating wildlife and can spread via feces.

Ellis suspects that the stunning frequency Uesaka observed is unique to Streaked Shearwaters or their close relatives. He says the finding doesn't match with his experience, which recently has focused on gulls and terns.

Uesaka has already gathered equivalent video footage for Black-tailed Gulls (Larus crassirostris), but he hasn't felt moved to start combing through it yet. The birds, it turns out, aren't very compelling videographers. “Most of the time, they're just filming the ocean and their butt,” he says.

It's okay if this weirds you out.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Current events may have us all feeling a little crabby, but this is extreme: People now feel fully betrayed by the long history of crabification (technically, “carcinization”) of different species over time. That means groups of crustaceans have evolved into crabs in five completely different contexts, giving rise to a meme that the long arc of history truly bends toward the crab. 

BoingBoing shares a paper about carcinization, which sounds like something about prison at first blush. On second look, you'll see it shares a root with carcinogen as well as cancer itself—both from the Greek root karkinos meaning crab. Borradaile coined the new word based on the established scientific usages. 

So, how does carcinization happen? Well, that part is pretty simple. Animals that live in similar habitats face obstacles that can shuttle them all toward the same evolutionary advantages. Britannica cites the marsupials as a key example, where despite having one critical difference from their “placental” counterparts in other parts of the world, the marsupials often correspond very closely to these other animals. 

Animals can evolve separately but end up evolving toward other species, too, or even spontaneously evolve the same characteristics in totally separate groups. Birds and bats can both fly using mechanical wings. Birds and mammals are both warmblooded, but both evolved from groups that were not. 

That crabs (both “true” and ersatz) have so densely but separately evolved the same form is highly unusual, even in a world full of these examples of strong parallel and convergent evolution. “The fact that a crab-like habitus did not evolve solely in ‘true' crabs but also several times independently in the Anomura makes this process ideal for evolutionary research,” the researchers explain.

Crabs are like Charles Darwin's isolated Galapagos Islands groups, but they formed spontaneously instead of being evolutionarily fenced in.

It's not just superficial shape that unifies the five evolved crab forms. The paper details neurological commonalities, shared circulatory systems, and more, while also detailing the organ and systems that differ in shape and size. 

Moreover, the crab-shapedness of the groups can make it hard to trace what came about from interacting internal systems as opposed to, well, the crab shell:

But, of course, hermit crabs don't have a “habitus,” the biological term for a body shape or casing type that affects your health or biology context. And, the researchers say, majestic and extremely spiky king crabs evolved from hermit crabs. The crab wonders may never cease.

The company has now reinstated the friendlier (and potentially more worrying) version of their AI module.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

In 2013, Spike Jonze's Her—in which the main character falls in love with an AI-powered chatbot—was a novel sci-fi concept. Fast-forward 12 years later, and the film is now traipsing dangerously close to “prescient documentary” territory.

Last week, OpenAI released ChatGPT-5, a new version of the popular AI platform that (as most tech updates do) replaced the older versions that came before it. In the post announcing its launch, OpenAI reveals a litany of improvements, such as better coding, fewer hallucinations, and the like. But the really big news from the end-user perspective was that OpenAI made its new chatbot less of a boot-licking toady. 

Users weren't happy.

“Earlier this year, we released an update to GPT‑4o that unintentionally made the model overly sycophantic, or excessively flattering or agreeable,” OpenAI explains in the post. “Overall, GPT‑5 is less effusively agreeable, uses fewer unnecessary emojis, and is more subtle and thoughtful in follow‑ups compared to GPT‑4o.”

For months, article after article has detailed the rise of what's called “AI Psychosis,” where an AI's overly agreeable sycophantic behavior can create an outsized dependency on the platform and/or reinforce delusions. According to Psychology Today, researchers have identified three recurring themes in “AI psychosis” cases: Messianic missions (when a deeper truth of the universe is believed to be revealed), God-like AI, and (in Her-esque fashion) romantic love. In each of these cases, AI's intense focus on user satisfaction creates a kind of cognitive doom loop, pulling users further down into delusions or engendering false ideals of romantic love. 

Of course, ripping the groveling heart out of the model essentially forced some users to quit their self-described AI companions/friends/lovers/gods cold turkey, and people soon began voicing their displeasure. Multiple posts on Reddit—including one with an image of a mock memorial to ChatGPT-4o (AI generated, of course)—mourned the loss of the language model.

“We for sure underestimated how much some of the things that people like in GPT-4o matter to them, even if GPT-5 performs better in most ways,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote on X (formerly Twitter), in response to the backlash. “Some users really want cold logic and some want warmth and a different kind of emotional intelligence. I am confident we can offer way more customization than we do now while still encouraging healthy use.”

For now, OpenAI's game plan for “encouraging healthy use” is just bringing back the old, people-pleasing 4o model. On Tuesday, Altman said that “4o was back in the model picker” for paid users, but seemed to imply that future changes to the model could be coming: “If we ever do deprecate it, we will give plenty of notice.” 

It's no secret that the world is suffering through a loneliness epidemic, and while AI is a poor substitute for human companionship, it is a substitute nonetheless, and only enables the ongoing crisis. Unfortunately, it's also a substitute that no flesh-and-blood human could ever hope to out-compete, especially when it comes to mindless, sycophantic devotion.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists just found a hidden factor behind Earth's methane surge","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250816113528.htm","Mon, 18 Aug 2025 03:29:29 GMT","

Roughly two-thirds of all emissions of atmospheric methane -- a highly potent greenhouse gas that is warming planet Earth -- come from microbes that live in oxygen-free environments like wetlands, rice fields, landfills and the guts of cows.

Tracking atmospheric methane to its specific sources and quantifying their importance remains a challenge, however. Scientists are pretty good at tracing the sources of the main greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, to focus on mitigating these emissions. But to trace methane's origins, scientists often have to measure the isotopic composition of methane's component atoms, carbon and hydrogen, to use as a fingerprint of various environmental sources.

A new paper by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, reveals how the activity of one of the main microbial enzymes involved in producing methane affects this isotope composition. The finding could change how scientists calculate the contributions of different environmental sources to Earth's total methane budget.

""When we integrate all the sources and sinks of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, we kind of get the number that we're expecting from direct measurement in the atmosphere. But for methane, large uncertainties in fluxes exist -- within tens of percents for some of the fluxes -- that challenge our ability to precisely quantify the relative importance and changes in time of the sources,"" said UC Berkeley postdoctoral fellow Jonathan Gropp, who is first author of the paper. ""To quantify the actual sources of methane, you need to really understand the isotopic processes that are used to constrain these fluxes.""

Gropp teamed up with a molecular biologist and a geochemist at UC Berkeley to, for the first time, employ CRISPR to manipulate the activity of this key enzyme to reveal how these methanogens interact with their food supply to produce methane.

""It is well understood that methane levels are rising, but there is a lot of disagreement on the underlying cause,"" said co-author Dipti Nayak, UC Berkeley assistant professor of molecular and cell biology. ""This study is the first time the disciplines of molecular biology and isotope biogeochemistry have been fused to provide better constraints on how the biology of methanogens controls the isotopic composition of methane.""

Many elements have heavier or lighter versions, called isotopes, that are found in small proportions in nature. Humans are about 99% carbon-12 and 1% carbon-13, which is slightly heavier because it has an extra neutron in its nucleus. The hydrogen in water is 99.985% hydrogen-1 and 0.015% deuterium or hydrogen-2, which is twice as heavy because it has a neutron in its nucleus.

The natural abundances of isotopes are reflected in all biologically produced molecules and variations can be used to study and fingerprint various biological metabolisms.

""Over the last 70 years, people have shown that methane produced by different organisms and other processes can have distinctive isotopic fingerprints,"" said geochemist and co-author Daniel Stolper, UC Berkeley associate professor of earth and planetary science. ""Natural gas from oil deposits often looks one way. Methane made by the methanogens within cow guts looks another way. Methane made in deep sea sediments by microorganisms has a different fingerprint. Methanogens can consume or 'eat', if you will, a variety of compounds including methanol, acetate or hydrogen; make methane; and generate energy from the process. Scientists have commonly assumed that the isotopic fingerprint depends on what the organisms are eating, which often varies from environment to environment, creating our ability to link isotopes to methane origins.""

""I think what's unique about the paper is, we learned that the isotopic composition of microbial methane isn't just based on what methanogens eat,"" Nayak said. ""What you 'eat' matters, of course, but the amount of these substrates and the environmental conditions matter too, and perhaps more importantly, how microbes react to those changes.""

""Microbes respond to the environment by manipulating their gene expression, and then the isotopic compositions change as well,"" Gropp said. ""This should cause us to think more carefully when we analyze data from the environment.""

The paper will appear Aug. 14 in the journal Science.

Vinegar- and alcohol-eating microbes

Methanogens -- microorganisms that are archaea, which are on an entirely separate branch of the tree of life from bacteria -- are essential to ridding the world of dead and decaying matter. They ingest simple molecules -- molecular hydrogen, acetate or methanol, for example -- excreted by other organisms and produce methane gas as waste. This natural methane can be observed in the pale Will-o'-the-wisps seen around swamps and marshes at night, but it's also released invisibly in cow burps, bubbles up from rice paddies and natural wetlands and leaks out of landfills. While most of the methane in the natural gas we burn formed in association with hydrocarbon generation, some deposits were originally produced by methanogens eating buried organic matter.

The isotopic fingerprint of methane produced by methanogens growing on different ""food"" sources has been well established in laboratory studies, but scientists have found that in the complexity of the real world, methanogens don't always produce methane with the same isotopic fingerprint as seen in the lab. For example, when grown in the lab, species of methanogens that eat acetate (essentially vinegar), methanol (the simplest alcohol), or molecular hydrogen (H2) produce methane, CH4, with a ratio of hydrogen and carbon isotopes different from the ratios observed in the environment.

Gropp had earlier created a computer model of the metabolic network in methanogens to understand better how the isotope composition of methane is determined. When he got a fellowship to come to UC Berkeley, Stolper and Nayak proposed that he experimentally test his model. Stolper's laboratory specializes in measuring isotope compositions to explore Earth's history. Nayak studies methanogens and, as a postdoctoral fellow, found a way to use CRISPR gene editing in methanogens. Her group recently altered the expression of the key enzyme in methanogens that produces the methane -- methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) -- so that its activity can be dialed down. Enzymes are proteins that catalyze chemical reactions.

Experimenting with these CRISPR-edited microbes -- in a common methanogen called Methanosarcina acetivorans growing on acetate and methanol -- the researchers looked at how the isotopic composition of methane changed when the enzyme activity was reduced, mimicking what is thought to happen when the microbes are starved for their preferred food.

They found that when MCR is at low concentrations, cells respond by altering the activity of many other enzymes in the cell, causing their inputs and outputs to accumulate and the rate of methane generation to slow so much that enzymes begin running both backwards and forwards. In reverse, these other enzymes remove a hydrogen from carbon atoms; running forward, they add a hydrogen. Together with MCR, they ultimately produce methane (CH4). Each forward and reverse cycle requires one of these enzymes to pull a hydrogen off of the carbon and add a new one ultimately sourced from water. As a result, the isotopic composition of methane's four hydrogen molecules gradually comes to reflect that of the water, and not just their food source, which starts with three hydrogens.

This is different from typical assumptions for growth on acetate and methanol that assume no exchange between hydrogen derived from water and that from the food source.

""This isotope exchange we found changes the fingerprint of methane generated by acetate and methanol consuming methanogens vs. that typically assumed. Given this, it might be that we have underestimated the contribution of the acetate-consuming microbes, and they might be even more dominant than we have thought,"" Gropp said. ""We're proposing that we at least should consider the cellular response of methanogens to their environment when studying isotopic composition of methane.""

Beyond this study, the CRISPR technique for tuning production of enzymes in methanogens could be used to manipulate and study isotope effects in other enzyme networks broadly, which could help researchers answer questions about geobiology and the Earth's environment today and in the past.

""This opens up a pathway where modern molecular biology is married with isotope-geochemistry to answer environmental problems,"" Stolper said. ""There are an enormous number of isotopic systems associated with biology and biochemistry that are studied in the environment; I hope we can start looking at them in the way molecular biologists now are looking at these problems in people and other organisms -- by controlling gene expression and looking at how the stable isotopes respond.""

For Nayak, the experiments are also a big step in discovering how to alter methanogens to derail production of methane and redirect their energy to producing useful products instead of an environmentally destructive gas.

""By reducing the amount of this enzyme that makes methane and by putting in alternate pathways that the cell can use, we can essentially give them another release valve, if you will, to put those electrons, which they were otherwise putting in carbon to make methane, into something else that would be more useful,"" she said.

Other co-authors of the paper are Markus Bill of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and former UC Berkeley postdoc Rebekah Stein, and Max Lloyd, who is a professor at Penn State University.

How can the behavior of elementary particles and the structure of the entire universe be described using the same mathematical concepts? This question is at the heart of recent work by the mathematicians Claudia Fevola from Inria Saclay and Anna-Laura Sattelberger from the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences, recently published in the Notices of the American Mathematical Society.

To the point:

Mathematics and physics share a close, reciprocal relationship. Mathematics offers the language and tools to describe physical phenomena, while physics drives the development of new mathematical ideas. This interplay remains vital in areas such as quantum field theory and cosmology, where advanced mathematical structures and physical theory evolve together.

In their article, the authors explore how algebraic structures and geometric shapes can help us understand phenomena ranging from particle collisions such as happens, for instance, in particle accelerators to the large-scale architecture of the cosmos. Their research is centered around algebraic geometry. Their recent undertakings also connect to a field called positive geometry - an interdisciplinary and novel subject in mathematics driven by new ideas in particle physics and cosmology. This field was inspired by the geometrical concept of positive geometry which expands the standard Feynman diagram approach in particle physics by representing interactions as volumes of high-dimensional geometric objects, such as the amplituhedron, as introduced by the theoretical physicists Nima Arkani-Hamed and Jaroslav Trnka in 2013. It carries a rich combinatorial structure and offers an alternative, potentially simpler way to compute scattering amplitudes, from which one can derive probabilities of scattering events.

This approach has far-reaching implications that go beyond particle physics. In cosmology, scientists are using the faint light of the cosmic microwave background and the distribution of galaxies to infer what shaped the early universe. Similar mathematical tools are now being applied. For instance, cosmological polytopes, which are themselves positive geometries, can represent correlations in the universe's first light and help reconstruct the physical laws that governed the birth of the cosmos.

A Geometry for the Universe

The article highlights that positive geometry is not a niche mathematical curiosity but a potential unifying language for form branches of theoretical physics. These geometric frameworks naturally encode the transfer of information between physical systems, for example, by mapping concrete, sensory-based concepts to abstract structures, a process that mirrors how humans metaphorically understand the world.

The mathematics behind this is sophisticated and spans multiple disciplines. The authors draw on algebraic geometry, which defines shapes and spaces through solutions to systems of polynomial equations, algebraic analysis, which studies differential equations through mathematical objects called D-modules, and combinatorics, which describes the arrangements and interactions within these structures.

The formal objects under consideration, such as Feynman integrals, generalized Euler integrals, or canonical forms of positive geometries, are not merely mathematical abstractions. They correspond to observable phenomena in high-energy physics and cosmology, enabling precision computations of particle behavior and cosmic structures alike.

Bridging Scales with Mathematics

The study presents an approach with broad applicability and scalability. Scattering processes are often illustrated using Feynman diagrams. Feynman's approach in the study of scattering amplitudes boils down to the study of intricate integrals associated to such diagrams. Algebraic geometry provides a range of tools for systematically investigating these integrals.

The graph polynomial of a Feynman diagram is defined in terms of the spanning trees and forests of the underlying graph. The associated Feynman integral can be expressed as a Mellin transform of a power of this graph polynomial, interpreted as a function of its coefficients. These coefficients, however, are constrained by the underlying physical conditions. Feynman integrals are therefore closely connected to generalized Euler integrals, specifically through restrictions to the relevant geometric subspaces. One way to study these holonomic functions is via the linear differential equations they satisfy, which are D-module inverse images of hypergeometric D-modules. Constructing these differential equations explicitly, however, remains challenging. In theoretical cosmology, correlation functions in toy models also take the form of such integrals, with integrands arising from hyperplane arrangements.

The complement of the algebraic variety defined by the graph polynomial in an algebraic torus is a very affine variety, and the Feynman integral can be viewed as the pairing of a twisted cycle and cocycle of this variety. Its geometric and (co-)homological properties reflect physical concepts such as the number of master integrals. These master integrals form a basis for the space of integrals when the kinematic parameters vary, and the size of this basis is, at least generically, equal to the signed topological Euler characteristic of the variety.

A Field in Motion

Fevola and Sattelberger's work reflects a growing international effort, supported by the ERC synergy grant UNIVERSE+ of Nima Arkani-Hamed, Daniel Baumann, and Johannes Henn, Bernd Sturmfels. It brings together mathematics, particle physics, and cosmology focusing on precisely these connections between algebra, geometry, and theoretical physics. ""Positive geometry is still a young field, but it has the potential to significantly influence fundamental research in both physics and mathematics,"" the authors emphasize. ""It is now up to the scientific community to work out the details of these emerging mathematical objects and theories and to validate them. Encouragingly, several successful collaborations have already laid important groundwork.""

The recent developments are not only advancing our understanding of the physical world but also pushing the boundaries of mathematics itself. Positive geometry is more than a tool. It is a language. One that might unify our understanding of nature at all scales.

The discovery of yet another unique animal species from Rēkohu Chatham Islands illustrates how the physical qualities of an animal are influenced by its surroundings.

New research led by the University of Otago - Ōtākou Whakaihu Waka describes a new, extinct shelduck whose ancestors arrived on the islands 390,000 years ago.

While this may seem like a short period of time, co-lead author Associate Professor Nic Rawlence, Director of the Otago Palaeogenetics Laboratory, says it is long enough to impact the species.

""In that time the Rēkohu shelduck evolved shorter, more robust wings and longer leg bones indicating it was going down the pathway towards flightlessness,"" he says.

These changes were due to a range of factors, such as an abundance of food, lack of ground-dwelling predators, and windy conditions, so flying was not the preferred option.

Co-lead author Dr Pascale Lubbe, also of the Otago Palaeogenetics Laboratory, says in a case of ""use it or lose it, the wings start to reduce.""

""Flight is energetically expensive, so if you don't have to fly, why bother,"" she says.

""The longer leg bones are more robust to support more muscle and create increased force for take-off - necessary when you have smaller wings.""

Researchers used ancient DNA and analysed the shape of the bones to determine the Rēkohu shelduck is most closely related to the pūtangitangi paradise shelduck from Aotearoa New Zealand.

The Rēkohu shelduck spent more time on the ground than its cousin and became extinct prior to the 19th century due to over-hunting and predation.

The study is published in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society and adds to the islands' rich history as a home to many species of waterfowl before human settlement.

The shelduck's scientific name (Tadorna rekohu) and common name (Rēkohu shelduck) were gifted to researchers by the Hokotehi Moriori Trust who are tchieki (guardians) of the plants and animals on Rēkohu Chatham Islands, with which they are interconnected through shared hokopapa (genealogy).

Hokotehi Moriori Trust CEO Levi Lanauze says ""this discovery is great for Rēkohu as a whole and helps connect imi (tribe) Moriori with miheke (treasure) of the past.""

The study is an international collaboration between Otago, the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, The University of Adelaide, and Manaaki Whenua Landcare Research.

The twin cube satellites will operate through at least September 2026, expanding focus from the poles to the whole planet to improve modelling and weather forecasts.

NASA's PREFIRE (Polar Radiant Energy in the Far-InfraRed Experiment) mission has been extended through September 2026 and is broadening its focus from Earth's poles to the entire globe. The mission's two shoebox-size CubeSats gauge the capacity of water vapor, clouds, and other elements of Earth's system to trap heat and keep it from radiating into space. This information can help improve forecasts, including weather severity and storm frequency.

Launched in spring 2024, PREFIRE has been measuring how much heat the planet emits into space from the Arctic and Antarctic. Earth absorbs a significant amount of the Sun's energy in the tropics. Winds, weather, and ocean currents transport that heat toward the poles, which receive much less sunlight. Ice, snow, and clouds, among other parts of the polar environment, emit some of that heat into space, much of it as far-infrared radiation. The difference between the amount of heat Earth absorbs at the tropics and radiates out from the Arctic and Antarctic is a key influence on the planet's temperature, helping to drive dynamic systems of climate and weather.

At the core of the mission is a pair of advanced spectrometers designed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. They measure wavelengths of light in the far-infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum and are sensitive to 10 times more far-infrared wavelengths than any similar instrument. This information gives researchers insight into processes associated with surface ice melt and formation, snowmelt and accumulation, and changes in cloud cover.

""The PREFIRE satellites show that at these longer wavelengths, the amount of radiation going into space can differ from one type of ice to another by as much as 5%,"" said Brian Drouin, PREFIRE's project scientist at JPL. ""Measurements that look at the same areas but with shorter wavelengths do not show this difference.""

Although the PREFIRE CubeSats have been gathering data on the entire globe, the science team has concentrated their analysis on Earth's polar regions for its prime mission. Going forward, they will expand their work to include data from the rest of the world.

""We have the capacity to collect data for the whole world, not just the poles. What we'll be able to do is look at the size of ice particles in clouds that affect energy exchange between Earth and space,"" said PREFIRE's principal investigator, Tristan L'Ecuyer of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ""We'll be able to incorporate the data into weather prediction models to improve forecasts and improve our understanding of how moisture circulates, which affects where storms form and how precipitation moves around the world.""

The satellites are in what's called an asynchronous near-polar orbit, traveling near the poles with each pass but hours apart from one another. This provides two snapshots of the same area over time, enabling the mission to capture phenomena that occur on short timescales, such as cloud cover's temporary effects on the temperature of the area beneath it.

More About PREFIRE

NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory manages PREFIRE for the agency's Science Mission Directorate and provided the spectrometers. Blue Canyon Technologies built the CubeSats and the University of Wisconsin-Madison processes the data the instruments collect. The launch services provider, Rocket Lab USA Inc. of Long Beach, California, launched both PREFIRE CubeSats from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand in May and June 2024.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Myanmar's massive quake hints at bigger earthquakes to come","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250817055318.htm","Mon, 18 Aug 2025 08:06:18 GMT","

On March 28, 2025, a magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck the Southeast Asia country of Myanmar along the Sagaing Fault, killing thousands and causing widespread damage. A new study from Caltech uses satellite imaging of the Sagaing Fault's motion to improve models of how such faults may behave in the future. The study indicates that strike-slip faults, like the Sagaing and the San Andreas, may be capable of earthquakes that are significantly different from past known earthquakes and potentially much larger.

The research was conducted primarily in the laboratory of Jean-Philippe Avouac, the Earle C. Anthony Professor of Geology and Mechanical and Civil Engineering and director of the Center for Geomechanics and the Mitigation of Geohazards. Postdoctoral scholar Solène Antoine is the study's first author. The study is described in a paper appearing in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on August 11.

The Sagaing fault runs in a relatively straight north-to-south line throughout Myanmar. As its two sides slowly move against one another in opposite directions, stress accumulates along the fault. When the stress buildup reaches a breaking point, the fault slips rapidly, causing an earthquake. The Sagaing and San Andreas faults are very similar -- both relatively straight strike-slip faults running hundreds of kilometers -- and the 2025 Myanmar earthquake, therefore, sheds light on possible future earthquakes on the San Andreas fault.

""This earthquake turned out to be an ideal case to apply image correlation methods [techniques to compare images before and after a geological event] that were developed by our research group,"" Antoine says. ""They allow us to measure ground displacements at the fault, where the alternative method, radar interferometry, is blind due to phenomenon like decorrelation [a process to decouple signals] and limited sensitivity to north-south displacements.""

Based on studies of historic earthquakes along the Sagaing fault, researchers anticipated that a large earthquake would occur on a 300-kilometer section where no large earthquakes had occurred since 1839. This theory is known as the seismic gap hypothesis: Stuck sections of a fault where there has not been movement are expected to slip to ""catch up."" While this section did indeed rupture during the 2025 quake, the fault actually slipped along a total of more than 500 kilometers, indicating that the fault did indeed make up the deficit of slip and more.

In the new study, the team used correlation of satellite optical and radar imagery of the fault -- a technique originally developed in the Avouac laboratory and now widely used in seismology -- and its surroundings to determine that the 500-kilometer section shifted a net of 3 meters after the quake, that is, the eastern side moved south by 3 meters relative to the western side.

Current models used for seismic hazard assessment are mostly based on earthquake statistics and are time independent, meaning they can only give probabilities of an earthquake during a chosen timespan. For example, these models might estimate, for any given 30-year period and particular area, the probability that an earthquake would exceed a chosen magnitude. However, in order to make truly informed estimates of potential seismic hazards for specific time periods -- say, the next 30 years -- it is crucial for models to take into account how recently a fault has slipped, where the slip occurred, and by how much.

""The study shows that future earthquakes might not simply repeat past known earthquakes,"" Avouac says. ""Successive ruptures of a given fault, even as simple as the Sagaing or the San Andreas faults, can be very different and can release even more than the deficit of slip since the last event. In addition, historical records are generally far too short for statistical models to represent the full range of possible earthquakes and eventual patterns in earthquake recurrence. Physics-based models provide an alternative approach with the advantage that they could, in principle, be tuned to observations and used for time-dependent forecast.""

The paper is titled ""The 2025 Mw7.7 Mandalay, Myanmar, earthquake reveals complex earthquake cycle with clustering and variable segmentation on Sagaing fault."" In addition to Antoine and Avouac, Caltech co-authors are graduate student Rajani Shrestha, postdoctoral scholar Chris Milliner, and senior research scientist Kyungjae Im. Additional co-authors are Chris Rollins (PhD '18) of GNS Science Te Pu Ao in New Zealand, Kang Wang of EarthScope Consortium Inc., and Kejie Chen of Southern University of Science and Technology in China.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Forget LASIK: Safer, cheaper vision correction could be coming soon","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250818102941.htm","Mon, 18 Aug 2025 15:24:31 GMT","

Millions of Americans have altered vision, ranging from blurriness to blindness. But not everyone wants to wear prescription glasses or contact lenses. Accordingly, hundreds of thousands of people undergo corrective eye surgery each year, including LASIK -- a laser-assisted surgery that reshapes the cornea and corrects vision. The procedure can result in negative side effects, prompting researchers to take the laser out of LASIK by remodeling the cornea, rather than cutting it, in initial animal tissue tests.

Michael Hill, a professor of chemistry at Occidental College, will present his team's results at the fall meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS). ACS Fall 2025 is being held Aug. 17-21; it features about 9,000 presentations on a range of science topics.

Human corneas are dome-shaped, clear structures that sit at the front of the eye, bending light from surroundings and focusing it onto the retina, where it's sent to the brain and interpreted as an image. But if the cornea is misshapen, it doesn't focus light properly, resulting in a blurry image. With LASIK, specialized lasers reshape the cornea by removing precise sections of the tissue. This common procedure is considered safe, but it has some limitations and risks, and cutting the cornea compromises the structural integrity of the eye. Hill explains that ""LASIK is just a fancy way of doing traditional surgery. It's still carving tissue -- it's just carving with a laser.""

But what if the cornea could be reshaped without the need for any incisions?

This is what Hill and collaborator Brian Wong are exploring through a process known as electromechanical reshaping (EMR). ""The whole effect was discovered by accident,"" explains Wong, a professor and surgeon at the University of California, Irvine. ""I was looking at living tissues as moldable materials and discovered this whole process of chemical modification.""

In the body, the shapes of many collagen-containing tissues, including corneas, are held in place by attractions of oppositely charged components. These tissues contain a lot of water, so applying an electric potential to them lowers the tissue's pH, making it more acidic. By altering the pH, the rigid attractions within the tissue are loosened and make the shape malleable. When the original pH is restored, the tissue is locked into the new shape.

Previously, the researchers used EMR to reshape cartilage-rich rabbit ears, as well as alter scars and skin in pigs. But one collagen-rich tissue that they were eager to explore was the cornea.

In this work, the team constructed specialized, platinum ""contact lenses"" that provided a template for the corrected shape of the cornea, then placed each over a rabbit eyeball in a saline solution meant to mimic natural tears. The platinum lens acted as an electrode to generate a precise pH change when the researchers applied a small electric potential to the lens. After about a minute, the cornea's curvature conformed to the shape of the lens -- about the same amount of time LASIK takes, but with fewer steps, less expensive equipment and no incisions.

They repeated this setup on 12 separate rabbit eyeballs, 10 of which were treated as if they had myopia, or nearsightedness. In all the ""myopic"" eyeballs, the treatment dialed in the targeted focusing power of the eye, which would correspond to improved vision. The cells in the eyeball survived the treatment, because the researchers carefully controlled the pH gradient. Additionally, in other experiments, the team demonstrated that their technique might be able to reverse some chemical-caused cloudiness to the cornea -- a condition that is currently only treatable through a complete corneal transplant.

Though this initial work is promising, the researchers emphasize that it is in its very early stages. Next up is what Wong describes as, ""the long march through animal studies that are detailed and precise,"" including tests on a living rabbit rather than just its eyeball. They also plan to determine the types of vision correction possible with EMR, such as near- and far-sightedness and astigmatism. Though the next steps are planned, uncertainties in the team's scientific funding have put them on hold. ""There's a long road between what we've done and the clinic. But, if we get there, this technique is widely applicable, vastly cheaper and potentially even reversible,"" concludes Hill.

Title Electrochemical corneal refraction

Abstract The cornea is a transparent, highly organized anatomical structure that is responsible for ~2/3 of the refractive power of the eye. The corneal stroma consists of orthogonally stacked collagen- fibril lamellae whose molecular composition and precise macromolecular geometry eliminate backscattered light and maintain the shape of the cornea. Anatomical variation, birth defects, trauma, and various pathologies can alter the shape, structural stability, and transparency of the cornea, thus affecting vision. Surgical interventions to treat myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism include laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) and photorefractive keratectomy (PRK). Despite their popularity, these procedures are expensive and permanently lower the biomechanical strength of the cornea. Here we report our efforts to apply electromechanical reshaping (EMR) as a molecular- based, non-ablative/non-incisional alternative to laser vision refraction, using ex vivo rabbit globes. EMR relies on short electrochemical pulses to electrolyze interstitial water, with subsequent diffusion of protons into the extracellular matrix of collagenous tissues; protonation of immobilized anions within this matrix disrupts the ionic-bonding network that provides structural integrity. This leaves the tissue transiently responsive to mechanical remodeling; subsequent re-equilibration to physiological pH restores the ionic matrix, resulting in persistent shape change of the tissue. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), second-harmonic generation (SHG), and confocal microscopy suggest that EMR enables control over corneal contouring while maintaining the underlying macromolecular collagen structure and stromal cellular viability.

Researchers taking the first-ever direct measurement of atom temperature in extremely hot materials inadvertently disproved a decades-old theory and upended our understanding of superheating.

It's notoriously difficult to take the temperature of really hot things. Whether it's the roiling plasma in our Sun, the extreme conditions at the core of planets or the crushing forces at play inside a fusion reactor, what scientists call ""warm dense matter"" can reach hundreds of thousands of degrees kelvin.

Knowing precisely how hot these materials are is crucial for researchers to fully understand such complex systems, but taking these measurements has been, until now, virtually impossible.

""We have good techniques for measuring density and pressure of these systems, but not temperature,"" said Bob Nagler, staff scientist at the Department of Energy's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. ""In these studies, the temperatures are always estimates with huge error bars, which really holds up our theoretical models. It's been a decades-long problem.""

Now, for the first time, a team of researchers report in the journal Nature that they have directly measured the temperature of atoms in warm dense matter. While other methods rely on complex and hard-to-validate models, this new method directly measures the speed of atoms, and therefore the temperature of the system. Already, their innovative method is changing our understanding of the world: In an experimental debut, the team superheated solid gold far beyond the theoretical limit, unexpectedly overturning four decades of established theory.

Nagler and researchers at SLAC's Matter in Extreme Conditions (MEC) instrument co-led this study with Tom White, associate professor of physics at University of Nevada, Reno. The group includes researchers from Queen's University Belfast, the European XFEL (X-ray Free-Electron Laser), Columbia University, Princeton University, University of Oxford, University of California, Merced, and the University of Warwick, Coventry.

Taking the temperature 

For nearly a decade, this team has worked to develop a method that circumvents the usual challenges of measuring extreme temperatures - specifically, the brief duration of the conditions that create those temperatures in the lab and the difficulty of calibrating how these complex systems affect other materials.

""Finally, we've directly and unambiguously taken a direct measurement, demonstrating a method that can be applied throughout the field,"" White said.

At SLAC's MEC instrument, the team used a laser to superheat a sample of gold. As heat flashed through the nanometer-thin sample, its atoms began to vibrate at a speed directly related to their rising temperature. The team then sent a pulse of ultrabright X-rays from the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) through the superheated sample. As they scattered off the vibrating atoms, the X-rays' frequency shifted slightly, revealing the atoms' speed and thus their temperature.

""The novel temperature measurement technique developed in this study demonstrates that LCLS is at the frontier of laser-heated matter research,"" said Siegfried Glenzer, director of the High Energy Density Science division at SLAC and co-author on the paper. ""LCLS, paired with these innovative techniques, play an important role in advancing high energy density science and transformative applications like inertial fusion.""

The team was thrilled to have successfully demonstrated this technique - and as they took a deeper look at the data, they discovered something even more exciting.

""We were surprised to find a much higher temperature in these superheated solids than we initially expected, which disproves a long-standing theory from the 1980s,"" White said. ""This wasn't our original goal, but that's what science is about - discovering new things you didn't know existed.""

Surviving the entropy catastrophe 

Every material has specific melting and boiling points, marking the transition from solid to liquid and liquid to gas, respectively. However, there are exceptions. For instance, when water is heated rapidly in very smooth containers - such as a glass of water in a microwave - it can become ""superheated,"" reaching temperatures above 212 degrees Fahrenheit (100 degrees Celsius) without actually boiling. This occurs because there are no rough surfaces or impurities to trigger bubble formation.

But this trick of nature comes with an increased risk: The further a system strays from its normal melting and boiling points, the more vulnerable it is to what scientists call a catastrophe - a sudden onset of melting or boiling triggered by slight environmental change. For example, water that has been superheated in a microwave will boil explosively when disturbed, potentially causing serious burns.

While some experiments have shown it is possible to bypass these intermediary limits by rapidly heating materials, ""the entropy catastrophe was still viewed as the ultimate boundary,"" White explained.

In their recent study, the team discovered that the gold had been superheated to an astonishing 19,000 kelvins (33,740 degrees Fahrenheit) - more than 14 times its melting point and well beyond the proposed entropy catastrophe limit - all while maintaining its solid crystalline structure.

""It's important to clarify that we did not violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics,"" White said with a chuckle. ""What we demonstrated is that these catastrophes can be avoided if materials are heated extremely quickly - in our case, within trillionths of a second.""

The researchers believe that the rapid heating prevented the gold from expanding, enabling it to retain its solid state. The findings suggest that there may not be an upper limit for superheated materials, if heated quickly enough.

Fusion and beyond 

Nagler noted that researchers who study warm dense matter have likely been surpassing the entropy catastrophe limit for years without realizing it, due to the absence of a reliable method for directly measuring temperature.

""If our first experiment using this technique led to a major challenge to established science, I can't wait to see what other discoveries lie ahead,"" Nagler said.

As just one example, White and Nagler's teams used this method again this summer to study the temperature of materials that have been shock-compressed to replicate the conditions deep inside planets.

Nagler is also eager to apply the new technique - which can pinpoint atom temperatures from 1,000 to 500,000 kelvins - to ongoing inertial fusion energy research at SLAC. ""When a fusion fuel target implodes in a fusion reactor, the targets are in a warm dense state,"" Nagler explained. ""To design useful targets, we need to know at what temperatures they will undergo important state changes. Now, we finally have a way to make those measurements.""

From single-cell extrusion to centimetre-sized wounds, epithelial gaps of various sizes and geometries appear across organisms. Their closure involves two orthogonal modes: lamellipodial crawling at convex edges and purse string-like movements at concave edges. The mechanisms driving this curvature-dependent migration remain unclear. Here we perform an intracellular cartography to reveal that in both micropatterned and naturally arising gaps, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) undergoes edge curvature-dependent morphological reorganizations, forming tubules at convex edges and sheets at concave edges. This reorganization depends on cytoskeleton-generated protrusive and contractile forces. Mathematical modelling reveals that these morphologies minimize strain energy under their respective geometric regime. Functionally, ER tubules at the convex edge favour perpendicularly oriented focal adhesions, supporting lamellipodial crawling, while ER sheets at the concave edge favour parallelly oriented focal adhesions, supporting purse string-like movements. Altogether, ER emerges as a central mechanotransducer, integrating signals from cytoskeletal networks to orchestrate two orthogonal modes of cell migration.

Epithelial gap closure is essential for maintaining tissue integrity as disruptions occur at various scales, from individual cell loss to large wounds, throughout the life of an organism1,2,3,4,5,6. The epithelial gap closure happens by a collective movement of the surrounding cells7, which involves two orthogonal migration modes: lamellipodia-mediated cell crawling and actomyosin contractility-driven purse string-like movements8,9,10,11,12. These modes involve different actin and focal adhesion dynamics and assembly: branched actin polymerization and perpendicularly oriented focal adhesions in lamellipodia-mediated cell crawling versus actin bundle formation and parallelly oriented focal adhesions in purse string-like movements. Importantly, their relative contribution to epithelial gap closure depends on various biochemical and biophysical aspects of the tissue, including the curvature of the gap edge6. While previous studies have identified several molecules that sense or produce nanoscale membrane curvatures13,14, how cells coordinate their response towards curvature at cellular and multicellular length scales remains largely elusive. Nevertheless, epithelial cells preferentially use lamellipodial crawling at convex edges and purse string contraction at concave edges15. Also, a previous study showed that curvature-dependent migration is linked to actin flow, with anterograde flow at concave edges and retrograde flow at convex edges during lamellipodia formation16. However, it remains unknown how other intracellular structures organize in response to large-scale curvature, how such organization is regulated and whether this organization influences the mode of cell migration.

Here, we performed a cartography of intracellular structures in convex and concave curved regions of micropatterned wounds of defined geometry in cultured epithelial monolayer and natural wounds in mouse embryonic epidermis. This revealed that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) undergoes striking curvature-dependent morphological rearrangements. The ER is a continuous and highly dynamic organelle that spans the whole cell as a single entity. It comprises rounded tubular networks and dense flat sheets, which undergo constant rearrangements between themselves17,18,19,20,21,22,23. This highly dynamic nature of the ER reflects its adaptability and responsiveness to intracellular and extracellular changes24,25,26. However, the relationship between different ER morphologies and physical or geometric cues remains largely unknown. Here, we report that the endoplasmic reticulum alters its morphology and dynamics in response to edge curvature and plays a critical role in determining the modes of epithelial migration at different edge curvatures.

First, to reveal the cell biological mechanism underlying the differential response of epithelial cells to edge curvature, we used microfabrication8,15,16 for the controlled and reproducible generation of gaps with defined shape, size and curvature. We fabricated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stencils of two shapes—notched rectangles and flowers (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b)—consisting of convex, concave and flat edges15. We seeded Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells around these PDMS stencils (Fig. 1a) for 15–18 h, allowed them to form a confluent monolayer and then lifted off the stencils triggering the cells to start migrating into the gaps. MDCK cells closed the gaps within 6–8 h (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Videos 1 and 2). Considering that the lamellipodial protrusions or actin bundles emerge within 15–30 min (ref. 15) (Extended Data Fig. 1c and Supplementary Videos 3 and 4), we fixed the cells 30 min after removal of the stencil and stained them with fluorescent dye-labelled phalloidin to visualize the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. As expected15, we observed that the fraction of cells forming lamellipodia at the positively curved convex edge was significantly higher than that at the negatively curved concave edge (Fig. 1b, top, and Extended Data Fig. 1d). We next studied the arrangement of the other major cytoskeletal element, the microtubules. Microtubule filaments appeared more discrete and aligned perpendicular to the edge at the convex edge and formed thick bundles aligned parallel to the edge at the concave edge (Fig. 1b, middle). Quantification of the microtubule directionality further confirmed this conclusion (Extended Data Fig. 1e,f). To ensure the accurate analysis of curvature-dependent behaviour, we quantified curvature at both the single-cell and tissue level, fitting circles to cell edges and splines to wound boundaries. We included only cells with more than 20% of their perimeter in contact with the wound, as lower-exposure cells were more influenced by neighbouring constraints than the geometry itself. This analysis revealed a strong one-to-one correspondence between the two curvature scales, thus validating our approach for linking local cell behaviour to global geometric cues (Supplementary Note 1 and Extended Data Fig. 2a–h).

Next, to investigate whether other intracellular entities also respond to this large-scale geometrical cue, we performed a cartographic study of cellular organelles at differently curved edges. We used anti-GRASP65 antibody, anti-LAMP1 antibody and mitotracker green to visualize the Golgi apparatus, lysosomes and mitochondria, respectively. In addition, we transfected MDCK cells with mApple-Sec61β to observe the ER structure. The Golgi showed a ribbon-like structure at both curvatures, but it was mostly polarized in the front of the nucleus at the convex edge and next to the nucleus along its horizontal axis at the concave edge (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Lysosomes appeared closely localized near the actin bundle at the concave edge, but more dispersed in the lamellipodia at the convex edge (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Mitochondria had filamentous morphology spread throughout the cell and showed no apparent difference in structure or organization depending on the edge curvature (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Interestingly, ER morphology appeared remarkably different within the cells located at convex and concave edges. We observed the formation of a reticular network of ER tubules at the convex edge and a dense sheet-like lamellar morphology at the concave edge (Fig. 1b, bottom). We further quantified cytoskeletal and organelle distribution at different edges using a probability density-based approach to compute the mean distribution from the edge (MDE), which measures the distance between the cell edge and the centre of mass of each intracellular component27 (Extended Data Fig. 3b). A lower value of the MDE suggests that the organelle or the cytoskeleton is polarized and densely accumulated near the migrating edge. We observed that the MDE for actin, microtubules, ER, Golgi apparatus and lysosomes at the concave edge is significantly lower than the respective MDE at the convex edge, suggesting that they are differentially polarized in response to the geometrical cue (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 3c). Taken together, of all the organelles, ER showed differences not just in the distribution but also in its morphology and structure at different edge curvatures.

We next quantified the structural changes in ER by calculating the fraction of ER tubules as a function of curvature at the front of the cell by segmenting the ER into tubules and sheet-like dense regions using Trainable Weka Segmentation28. This analysis revealed that at convex edges, the ER tubule fraction at the cell front increases sharply with increasing positive curvature (Fig. 1d). In contrast, at concave edges, the ER tubule fraction remains consistently low and shows only weak variation across the range of negative curvatures. These results demonstrated that cells at convex edges have a significantly higher ER tubule fraction than those at concave edges, reflecting a clear curvature-dependent structural reorganization of ER (Fig. 1e). To visualize ER morphology at higher resolution across curvatures, we performed super-resolution imaging of mApple-Sec61β-transfected cells using the super-resolution by optical realignment (SoRa) method. We observed a highly reticulated network of ER tubules at the convex edge. In contrast, at the concave edge, we observed accumulation of dense ER, which consists of flat ER sheets as well as dense clusters of tubules29 (Fig. 1f). Next, to check whether the dense ER at the front of migrating cells at the concave edge might be ER sheets, we labelled the cells with an antibody against cytoskeleton-linking membrane protein 63 (Climp63), which is an ER sheet marker. Interestingly, at the convex edge, Climp63 localized mostly around the nucleus at the cell centre, whereas at the concave edge, it accumulated at the cell periphery facing the edge (Fig. 1g). We also quantified the Climp63 fraction at the front, defined as the intensity of Climp63 staining at the front of the cell divided by the whole cell intensity, as a function of curvature. Climp63 fraction decreased with increasing convex curvature, but it remained comparatively high and relatively independent of the curvature magnitude at the concave edges (Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 3d). This contrasting ER morphology was very clearly observed in flower-shaped patterned wounds, where concave edges showed dense sheet-like ER along with actin bundles, while neighbouring convex edges displayed ER tubules and lamellipodial protrusions (Extended Data Fig. 3e).

To test whether our findings extend beyond imposed geometries, we analysed epithelial colonies where curvature arises naturally. These spontaneous convex and concave edges closely match the scale of our micropatterns, allowing direct comparison between native and controlled settings. In this set-up, MDCK cells expressing mApple-Sec61β were allowed to form small colonies and actin organization was visualized using phalloidin staining. We observed that cells along convex regions formed lamellipodial protrusions and showed enrichment of ER tubules, whereas cells at concave zones exhibited actin bundles and dense sheet-like ER (Extended Data Fig. 3f). Quantification of ER tubule fraction as a function of curvature confirmed a significantly higher tubule content at convex edges compared with concave ones (Extended Data Fig. 3g), reinforcing the idea that ER organization is shaped by the local curvature. We also verified the generality of these observations in another epithelial cell line, EpH4-Ev, which originated from the mouse mammary gland (Extended Data Fig. 4a–d).

Next, we examined the cellular response to spontaneously arising edge curvature in an incision wound made in a mouse embryonic skin explant (Fig. 1i). In this ex vivo model, dorsal skin explants from E14.5–E16.5 mouse embryos were wounded and cultured at an air–liquid interface to allow migration. Live imaging of SiR-actin-labelled tissue confirmed active migration, with actin accumulating at concave edges and small protrusions forming at convex edges within 30 min (Extended Data Fig. 4e and Supplementary Video 5). Hence, for subsequent experiments, we maintained wounded skin in the air–liquid interface and fixed after 30 min. We stained them for actin, microtubules and ER. Phalloidin staining showed that the epidermal cells formed lamellipodia at the convex wound edge and supracellular actin bundles at the concave wound edge (Fig. 1j and Extended Data Fig. 4f). Microtubule orientation also depended on the local wound curvatures, showing perpendicular and parallel alignments at the convex and concave wound edges, respectively (Fig. 1j and Extended Data Fig. 4g). Finally, to study ER morphology in the mouse embryonic skin wounds, we stained the skin explants with an anti-Climp63 antibody. Consistent with the results from the micropatterns (Fig. 1g,h), Climp63 was specifically localized at the cell periphery at the concave wound edge. In contrast, staining these explants with an antibody against the KDEL sequence, a general ER marker, revealed that the ER network covered almost the entire cytoplasm (Fig. 1k). Together, these results indicated the specific enrichment of sheet-like dense ER structures at the concave wound edge. To further resolve the structural details of ER in the mouse skin tissue, we used Lattice SIM2 super-resolution imaging and observed that ER indeed showed more tubular morphology at the spontaneously generated convex wound edge and dense sheet-like structures at the concave wound edge (Fig. 1l). Taken together, these observations suggested that epithelial cells interfacing different edge curvatures have proclivity for generating different ER morphologies.

Next, we wanted to determine whether the dense ER structures observed at the front of migrating cells at concave wound edges more closely resemble ER sheets or tubule clusters29. Although Climp63 and p180 are validated ER sheet markers30,31, we directly benchmarked their localization in our system to confirm how faithfully they label ER sheets over ER tubules. We transfected MDCK cells with the general ER marker Sec61β, allowed them to form confluent monolayers, and performed SoRa imaging after immunostaining for Climp63 or p180. In nonmigrating cells, both Climp63 and p180 localized exclusively to dense, perinuclear ER structures, consistent with their known enrichment in ER sheets30,31 (Extended Data Fig. 5a). These markers were absent from the peripheral ER, where tubules predominate, including potential dense tubular networks. This confirmed that Climp63 and p180 reliably distinguish ER sheets from tubules. We then examined migrating cell fronts, where Climp63 and p180 were strongly enriched in dense ER structures at concave edges (Fig. 2a,b), but not at convex edges. Quantitative analysis showed that the fraction of Climp63 and p180 signal over total ER (Sec61β) was significantly higher at concave than convex fronts (Fig. 2c,d). These results indicated that the dense ER at concave edges is largely composed of sheet-like structures. To further investigate the composition of the dense ER structures at the concave edge, we examined the localization of Rtn4b, a tubule-associated curvature-stabilizing protein also known to localize at the edges of ER sheets. Using dual labelling with Sec61β and Rtn4b followed by super-resolution imaging (Extended Data Fig. 5b), we observed that while Rtn4b localized broadly across the ER network, it was most prominently enriched at the rims of dense ER sheets (Extended Data Fig. 5b, right), with only little presence along distinct tubules and little to no signal within the sheet interiors. This preferential localization to sheet boundaries was more pronounced and supports the view that the dense ER at the concave edge is primarily composed of Climp63-positive sheets, with minimal contribution from tubular elements.

Finally, a recent study using the ER–plasma membrane contacts marker MAPPER demonstrated that ER–plasma membrane contacts polarize in single migrating cells, with Climp63-rich ER sheets at the rear showing more ER–plasma membrane contacts than Rtn4a-rich tubular ER at the front, facilitating polarized receptor tyrosine kinase signalling and phosphoinositide distribution32. While their focus was on the front and back of cells during single-cell migration, our study examines curvature-dependent collective epithelial migration, where mechanical forces and ER organization are regulated at the tissue scale. Despite these differences, we find an intriguing connection: curvature-driven ER morphology correlates with ER–plasma membrane contact distribution, with reduced ER–plasma membrane contacts at convex edges (ER tubule enriched) and increased contacts at concave edges (ER sheet enriched) (Extended Data Fig. 5c,d). This suggests that curvature may influence ER–plasma membrane contact site regulation through ER structural changes, affecting receptor tyrosine kinase and phosphoinositide signalling. Regulating phosphoinositide distribution can then regulate cytoskeletal dynamics, membrane trafficking and polarity, which are essential components cell migration. Altogether, multiple lines of evidence converge to support the conclusion that ER sheets are the predominant components of the dense ER structure at the concave edge.

To understand how distinct ER structures might be linked to ER dynamics at different edge curvatures, we performed live-cell imaging using MDCK cells expressing LifeAct, which marks the actin cytoskeleton, and mApple-Sec61β, which marks the ER. We seeded these cells around the micropatterned PDMS, incubated for 15–18 h and subsequently lifted off the stencils, allowing the cells to start migrating into the gaps. Live imaging revealed two kinds of ER dynamics at the front of the migrating cell. At the convex edge, we observed a retrograde flow of dense ER structures towards the nucleus where major ER sheets are present (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Video 6). Plotting a kymograph confirmed this retrograde flow (Fig. 2f). In contrast, at the concave edge, we observed an anterograde movement of ER sheets towards the front of the migrating cells (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Video 7), also confirmed by the kymograph (Fig. 2g). Next, we conducted super-resolution live imaging using SoRa microscopy in LifeAct MDCK cells expressing Sec61β, which provided enhanced spatial clarity. This allowed us to clearly visualize dense ER sheet-like structures moving anterogradely towards the leading edge at concave curvatures, and retrogradely at convex curvatures, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 5e (Supplementary Videos 8 and 9). To further confirm that the dense ER structures at the concave front are indeed sheets, we expressed mCherry-Climp63, a known ER sheet marker, in LifeAct MDCK cells. To minimize the possibility of overexpression-induced structural artefacts, we selected cells with low to moderate expression. Live imaging of these cells revealed the anterograde movement of Climp63-positive ER sheets towards the leading edge at the concave wound edge (Fig. 2h and Supplementary Video 10). High-magnification imaging further revealed that at the convex edge, as the cells started migrating, newer ER tubules grew in the direction of migration (Fig. 2i, green arrowhead, and Supplementary Video 11) and existing tubules retracted back into the tubular ER network (Fig. 2i, red arrowhead, and Supplementary Video 11). In contrast, at the concave edge, the tubules grew towards the cell periphery, accumulated there and formed sheets (Fig. 2i and Supplementary Video 12). Interestingly, we also observed anterograde movements of the existing sheets towards the edge. Notably, even within the short timescales, individual ER tubules demonstrate consistent retrograde movement at convex edges and anterograde movement at concave edges, aligning with the overall patterns observed. We then quantified the fraction of ER tubules at the cellular front at different timepoints. This analysis revealed that a bias existed at the beginning, where the ER tubule fraction was determined to be 0.64 and 0.35, at the convex and concave edges, respectively (Fig. 2j). As time progressed, the fraction of tubules at the convex edge increased further, while it decreased at the concave edge (Fig. 2j). Taken together, these results suggested that contrasting ER morphologies at the two edge curvatures are coupled with differential dynamics of ER.

Epithelial cells exposed to the wound respond by generating protrusive forces due to branched actin polymerization at the convex edge and contractile forces due to actomyosin activity at the concave edge15,16,33. We investigated whether the microtubules and ER responded to these forces by altering their orientation and morphology, respectively. We first treated the cells with an Arp2/3 inhibitor, CK666, which prevented lamellipodia formation, attenuating the protrusive force. CK666-treated cells predominantly formed actin bundles at both convex and concave edges (Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). Importantly, in these cells at both edges, microtubules were arranged as parallel bundles (Fig. 3a,b). Simultaneously, the ER showed sheet morphology at the edge of cells (Fig. 3c,d), as opposed to the control cells where bundled microtubules and ER sheets were prevalent mainly at the concave edge. We next treated the cells with blebbistatin, inhibiting actomyosin contractility. Blebbistatin-treated cells formed protrusive structures at both convex and concave edges (Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). In these cells, microtubules aligned perpendicularly to the edge (Fig. 3a,b) and ER showed a tubular structure at both convex and concave edges (Fig. 3c,d). However, we wanted to confirm whether CK666 or blebbistatin treatments affected ER structure globally and therefore we examined several cells in the middle of the monolayer. The overall morphology of ER was not affected, rather the effect was confined to the edge of the monolayer (Extended Data Fig. 6c,d). These results suggested that microtubules and ER responded to different kinds of forces generated by the protrusive and contractile actin structures at different edge curvatures.

Next, to perturb the system in a more controlled manner, we used optogenetic tools to drive lamellipodia formation and followed the morphological changes in ER and microtubules using live-cell imaging. Rac1 is a small Rho GTPase that regulates actin assembly and dynamics, especially during lamellipodia formation. We used a genetically encoded photoactivatable Rac1 (PA-Rac1), which induces the formation of lamellipodial protrusions on activation with light with a wavelength of 458 nm (ref. 34). First, to check the response of microtubules to Rac1 activation, we transfected MDCK cells with mCherry-PA-Rac1 and labelled microtubules with SiR-tubulin. On photoactivation of Rac1, bundled microtubules opened up and grew perpendicularly to the cell edge (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Video 13), while we did not observe such microtubule dynamics in the neighbouring nonactivated cells (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Video 13). Subsequently, we cotransfected MDCK cells with mCherry-PA-Rac1 and GFP-Sec61β to study ER dynamics. On photoactivation of Rac1, ER matrices converted to tubules at the site of activation of Rac1, while ER morphology did not change considerably in the nonactivated region of the cell (Fig. 3f and Supplementary Video 14). Quantifying the fraction of ER tubule on Rac1 activation showed a significant increase in this parameter in activated regions as opposed to nonactivated regions (Fig. 3g). These results together confirmed that the protrusive forces generated due to actin polymerization and branching at the convex edge guide the organization of ER and the microtubule network. Conversely, to augment actomyosin contractility, we went on to treat MDCK mApple-Sec61β cells with Calyculin A. Calyculin A is a myosin light chain phosphatase inhibitor that leads to hyperactivated myosin35. We observed a considerable expansion of ER sheets and matrices in the cell on Calyculin A treatment (Fig. 3h) and a decrease in ER tubule fraction (Fig. 3i).

We then explored whether these mechanical forces influence ER structure in the ex vivo wound healing model. To test this, we pretreated the embryonic skin explants with blebbistatin (100 μM) or CK666 (100 μM) 2 h before wounding. After creating the wounds, we let the migration happen in the medium containing the inhibitors. We then fixed the tissue and stained it for KDEL and Climp63. We observed that on blebbistatin treatment, the cells at both convex and concave edges had considerably less accumulation of Climp63 as compared with control (Fig. 3j), whereas on CK666 treatment, we observed a high Climp63 signal at the edge of the cells at both convex and concave edges (Fig. 3j). Taken together, these results suggested that the formation of ER tubules and sheets at convex and concave edges, respectively, depends on the different cellular forces acting at different edge curvatures.

Next, to obtain a fundamental understanding of why a particular morphology of ER is preferred in response to geometrical and mechanical cues, we constructed a mathematical model. The ER forms a dynamic and intricate network within cells. While previous models have explored ER shape using Langevin dynamics36,37 and the influence of curvature-stabilizing proteins on tubular/sheet abundance30,38, our experiments highlight a crucial role for mechanical forces, specifically protrusion and contraction, in shaping ER morphology. To address this, we developed a computational model of the cell, comprising cytoplasm, actin cortex and ER, examining three distinct ER morphologies: perpendicular (tubular), sheet and parallel (Fig. 4a). We assume that morphology-dependent deformation of ER contributes to the strain energy of the cell. We hypothesized that the difference in the morphologies of ER observed at convex and concave edges is due to differences in the strain-energy state of the cell when the cell contracts and protrudes. That is, ER tends to be in tube-like morphology during protrusion and sheet-like during contraction because the combination of morphologies and forces acting on the cell results in lower strain energy.

We modelled cells as 3D mechanical entities with ER embedded in the cytoplasm and an actin cortex at the cell edges. The geometry considered for analysis was the front of the cell where ER morphologies were observed to change due to varying mechanical and geometric stimuli; hence, we did not take the effect of the nucleus into account. We modelled the actin cortex as a strain rate-dependent nonlinear constitutive law, as proposed previously39, and generated forces necessary for curvature-dependent contraction or protrusion (Supplementary Note 2). For simplicity, the cytoplasm and ER were modelled as linear elastic materials. Moreover, since the aim of the model is to study the effect of curvature-dependent forces on ER morphology, we have not explicitly modelled microtubule structures, their response to curvature or their effect on ER reorganization. In vitro and ex vivo experiments showed that ER exhibited a tube-like perpendicular morphology at the convex edge during lamellipodia-based protrusion and sheet-like morphology at the concave edge during purse string movements. In silico studies were performed by considering cells with convex or concave edges with varying magnitudes of curvatures and ER morphologies. While perpendicular and sheet ER indicated distinct ER configurations, parallel ER is assumed to represent a cluster of parallel tubules. We compared the strain energy density, as given in equation (1), between the cases to find out which morphological state of ER was preferred for the given edge curvature, where Σ is the stress, ϵ is the strain and V is the volume of the cell.

To begin with, we considered a cell with a flat edge denoted as having a curvature of 0 (Fig. 4a). We observed that when cells experience purse string forces resulting in contraction, the cell with ER sheet morphology exhibited lower strain energy compared with cells with perpendicular ER (Fig. 4b). Owing to the contractile forces generated by the actin cortex, the ER experiences high bending moments (Extended Data Fig. 7a). For a given volume of ER, the ability of sheet ER to resist bending moments better than perpendicular ER results in lowering the strain energy density of the cell experiencing purse string forces. In contrast, we observed that when cells experienced protrusive forces, the cell with perpendicular ER exhibited lower strain energy density compared with the cell with sheet ER (Fig. 4c). The axial forces during protrusion are dominant over the bending moments (Extended Data Fig. 7b). For a given volume of ER, since perpendicular ER resist protruding forces better than sheet ER, the strain energy density of the cell with perpendicular ER is lower during protrusion.

Next, we simulated cells with positive (convex) and negative (concave) curvatures (Fig. 4d). For a given curvature, we kept the volume of ER in the cell constant across the different ER morphologies considered. We observed that during protrusion at convex edges, the strain energy density of a cell with either sheet ER or parallel ER was higher than that of a cell with perpendicular ER, indicating that ER prefers to stay in the perpendicular tube-like morphology aligned along the direction of protrusion (Fig. 4e). Plotting the displacement profile for the cell undergoing protrusion showed that the displacement at the tip was higher for the cell with sheet ER compared with perpendicular ER (Extended Data Fig. 7c), leading to higher elastic strain energy. In addition, as the curvature increased, the difference in strain energy density between cells with sheet and perpendicular ER morphologies increased, while the strain energy density of a cell with parallel ER remained close to that of the sheet ER, irrespective of curvature (Fig. 4e). This implies that, while the probability of finding perpendicular ER is always higher than sheet ER, it increases further with increasing positive curvature. Interestingly, this result corroborated our previous experimental finding that the fraction of ER tubules increases at the convex edge with increasing magnitude of curvature (Fig. 4f). Plotting ER tubules and sheets at the convex edge as a function of curvature also revealed that as the curvature increased, the amount of tubules at the front increased while the amount of sheets decreased (Fig. 4g).

In contrast, during contraction, the strain energy density with sheet ER was lower than that of a cell with perpendicular ER, indicating that cells preferred sheet ER morphology over perpendicular tube-like morphology (Fig. 4h). We also observed that parallel ERs had a strain energy density higher than that of sheet ER but lower than that of perpendicular ER. In contrast to protrusion, under contraction, displacement profiles showed that cells with perpendicular ER had higher displacement compared with cells with sheet ER (Extended Data Fig. 7d). As the curvature increased, the model showed that the difference in strain energy density between cells with sheet and perpendicular ER morphologies decreased up to a certain curvature level and remained constant for higher curvatures (Fig. 4h). This implies that, while the probability of finding sheet ER is always higher than perpendicular ER, it exhibited curvature independence for higher levels of negative curvatures. The model displayed behaviour similar to our previous experimental findings, showing that the fraction of ER sheets is higher at concave edges than tubules (Fig. 4i). Plotting the ER tubules and sheets at the concave edge as a function of curvature revealed that as the curvature increased, the amount of tubules at the front decreased and the amount of sheets increased, though it did not vary as much as in the convex case (Fig. 4j). Collectively, from the simulation results shown (Extended Data Fig. 7c–i), we inferred through the strain energy minimization hypothesis that the probability of finding a particular distribution of ER depends on the curvature of the cell and whether the cell is undergoing contraction or protrusion. Therefore, the distribution of ER responds to the geometric and biomechanical stimuli present in a cell.

ER and microtubules have remarkable structural interdependency27,40,41,42. Moreover, ER morphology and dynamics are known to be regulated by microtubules42,43. In our study, we observed a great correlation between the organization of ER and microtubules. The tubular ER network coincided with the perpendicularly arranged microtubules, while lamellar ER coincided with parallelly arranged microtubules (Fig. 5a). We therefore wondered whether microtubules might guide edge curvature-dependent ER morphology. To this end, we first disrupted microtubules by treating the cells with 5 μM nocodazole. As expected44, upon nocodazole treatment, ER tubules disappeared irrespective of the edge curvature (Fig. 5b,c). We then tested whether ER tubule formation at the convex edge involved ER movements along microtubules by sliding and tip attachment complex (TAC) dynamics45,46 (Fig. 5d). We perturbed the ER sliding dynamics by expressing KHC+ (kinectin-binding domain of kinesin) or KNT+ (kinesin-binding domain of kinectin), which led to disruption of the kinectin–kinesin interaction47. In the cells expressing KHC+ or KNT+, the fraction of ER tubules at the convex edge was significantly reduced as compared with the control EGFP-expressing cells (Fig. 5e,f). However, at the concave edge, the accumulation of ER sheets in KHC+ and KNT+ expressing cells did not change as compared with the control EGFP-expressing cells (Fig. 5e–g). Next, we perturbed the TAC movement of the ER by expressing a dominant negative form (EB1-c) of microtubule plus end-binding protein1, EB1, which led to its reduced binding with the microtubules48. In mutant EB1-c-expressing cells, the fraction of ER tubules at the front decreased at the convex edge (Fig. 5h,i), but the accumulation of ER sheets at the concave edge did not display any change as compared with the control cells (Fig. 5h–j). Taken together, these results suggested that both kinectin–kinesin-dependent sliding and TAC dynamics of ER are important for the generation of ER tubules at the convex edge but not for ER sheet accumulation at the concave edge.

Next, we examined whether ER morphology influences the curvature-specific mode of epithelial migration at wound edges. To this end, we manipulated the ER morphology by overexpressing either an integral ER membrane protein Rtn4a, which leads to the enrichment of ER tubules, or an ER sheet-associated protein Climp63, which leads to the enrichment of ER sheets30. Indeed, MDCK cells overexpressing Rtn4a-GFP showed a higher ER tubule fraction and MDCK cells overexpressing mCherry-Climp63 showed a higher ER sheet fraction as compared with the control cells overexpressing mApple-Sec61β (Extended Data Fig. 8a). Subsequently, we seeded these cells around the PDMS micropattern and studied their migration behaviour at different edge curvatures. To normalize across experiments, we calculated the probability of forming lamellipodia by dividing the number of transfected cells forming the lamellipodia by the total number of transfected cells at a particular edge curvature. For cells overexpressing Rtn4a, the percentage of cells forming lamellipodia at the convex edge was comparable to that for wild-type (WT) cells. However, at the concave edge, where the WT cells majorly formed actin bundles, Rtn4a-overexpressing cells showed a significantly higher probability of lamellipodium formation (Extended Data Fig. 8b–d). In contrast, Climp63 overexpression, which amplified ER sheet morphology, resulted in a significant decrease in the percentage of the lamellipodium-forming cells at the convex edge (Extended Data Fig. 8c–e). Transient overexpression enabled rapid phenotype screening and dose-dependent analysis with internal controls, though variability in expression levels across cells may complicate the interpretation. To address this problem, we generated stable MDCK lines expressing Rtn4a-GFP or mCherry-Climp63 via antibiotic selection, followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) before each experiment to ensure uniform expression. The FACS-sorted Rtn4a-GFP cells formed prominent lamellipodia at both convex and concave edges (Fig. 6a), with MDE analysis showing increased protrusive activity at concave edges (Fig. 6b). In contrast, FACS-sorted Climp63-expressing cells displayed apical actin bundles and reduced basal lamellipodia at both curvatures, reflected in lower MDE values at convex edges (Fig. 6a,b). Time-lapse imaging revealed faster gap closure by Rtn4a-GFP cells, including individual cell migration into the gap, while Climp63-expressing cells also showed accelerated closure, probably via contractile, bundle-driven migration (Fig. 6c). These results highlight the instructive role of ER morphology in regulating migration mode and speed.

To examine whether ER morphology influences cytoskeletal organization in nonmigrating cells, we again transiently overexpressed Rtn4a and Climp63 in MDCK monolayers to induce ER tubule- and sheet-enriched states, respectively. The mosaic produced by the transient transfection allowed us to directly compare the cytoskeletal organization of transfected cells against neighbouring WT cells within the same monolayer, serving as internal controls. Immunostaining for actin and microtubules revealed no notable differences in their organization in either condition (Extended Data Fig. 8f), suggesting that ER morphological changes do not overtly disrupt cytoskeletal architecture in nonmigrating cells. To further investigate whether ER restructuring affects collective properties such as cell shape index (defined as the perimeter/sqrt(area))49, we seeded stable MDCK populations homogeneously expressing mCherry-Climp63 or Rtn4a-GFP. ZO-1 staining was used to delineate cell boundaries, and subsequent shape index analysis revealed slightly higher values in both Climp63- and Rtn4a-expressing monolayers compared with WT. While statistically significant, these changes were modest, and most cells retained a cobblestone-like morphology, suggesting limited physiological relevance from a shape-transition perspective49 (Extended Data Fig. 8g,h).

Next, to dissect the relationship between ER morphology and cytoskeletal dynamics at the wound edge, we introduced a second layer of perturbations using drug treatments in Climp63- and Rtn4a-overexpressing cells. For example, we seeded the sorted Climp63-overexpressing cells around the PDMS chambers and treated them with blebbistatin to inhibit actomyosin contractility and stained them with phalloidin and anti-alpha-tubulin antibody. In WT cells, blebbistatin treatment promoted lamellipodia formation at both concave and convex edges (Extended Data Fig. 6a). However, in Climp63-overexpressing cells, blebbistatin failed to rescue lamellipodia, indicating that ER sheets override the effect of contractility inhibition, locking cells into a contractile state (Fig. 6d). These results suggests that ER tubules are necessary for branched actin polymerization and lamellipodia-driven migration. Blebbistatin treatment also failed to completely rescue microtubule rearrangements from parallel to perpendicular in Climp63-overexpressing cells (Extended Data Fig. 8i,j). In another experiment, we seeded sorted Rtn4a-overexpressing cells around PDMS chambers and treated them with CK666 to inhibit Arp2/3-mediated branched actin polymerization. In WT cells, CK666 treatment suppressed lamellipodia and promoted actin bundle formation at the convex edge (Extended Data Fig. 6a). However, in Rtn4a-overexpressing cells, CK666 failed to fully restore actin bundles, leaving a few persistent protrusive structures at the edge and disrupting the normally continuous contractile actin architecture (Fig. 6d). These results suggested that once ER tubules accumulate, they prevent full re-establishment of contractile actin structures, even when lamellipodia formation is inhibited. In contrast, CK666 treatment in Rtn4a-overexpressing cells led to a reorientation of microtubules from a perpendicular to a parallel arrangement, suggesting that microtubule organization adapts to the dominating actin architecture, and ER morphology may exert a more decisive influence on actin dynamics than on microtubules (Extended Data Fig. 8k,l). Notably, nocodazole treatment, which disrupts microtubules, consistently promoted ER sheet formation along with thick, continuous actin bundles at the edge and increased stress fibres within the cell, in both Climp63- and Rtn4a-overexpressing cells (Extended Data Fig. 9a,b). This again supports our earlier observation that microtubule–ER interactions facilitate ER tubule generation and suggests that microtubules contribute primarily to lamellipodia formation at convex edges but play a lesser role in actin bundling at concave edges (Fig. 5d–i). By combining ER structural manipulation with cytoskeletal drugs, we created a mechanistic tug-of-war that revealed ER morphology as a key regulator of cytoskeletal organization: sheets stabilize actin bundles and suppress lamellipodia, while tubules promote branched actin and weaken contractile structures. The failure of cytoskeletal drugs to fully rescue migration modes after ER perturbation underscores the instructive role of ER in guiding curvature-dependent migration.

To further validate the functional roles of ER structure, we conducted siRNA-mediated knockdown of Climp63 and Rtn4 in EpH4 epithelial cells (Fig. 6e–h). Knockdown efficiency was confirmed by western blotting (Extended Data Fig. 9c). Upon Rtn4 knockdown, we observed a loss of ER tubules (anti-KDEL staining; Extended Data Fig. 9d) and a corresponding decrease in lamellipodia formation, with increased polarized actin bundles at the wound edge. This was reflected in lower MDE values for actin (Fig. 6e,g), consistent with a shift towards contractile behaviour at convex curvatures. Conversely, Climp63 knockdown led to expansion of sheet-like ER (Extended Data Fig. 9e) and formation of actin bundles even at convex edges (Fig. 6f,h), again supporting the idea that ER sheets promote contractile migration modes and inhibit protrusive activity.

Finally, we tested whether smaller reticulons have similar effects by overexpressing Rtn2b, Rtn3S and Rtn4b in MDCK cells. Among these, only Rtn4b overexpression led to enhanced lamellipodia formation and suppression of actin bundles, including at concave edges (Extended Data Fig. 10a–f), mirroring the phenotype observed with Rtn4a overexpression. All reticulons (Rtn1–4) have been shown to localize on ER tubules and promote membrane curvature generation through a conserved reticulon homology domain50. Rtn4a and Rtn4b overexpression shifts ER morphology towards tubules in mammalian cells51 and, as shown in our study, enhances lamellipodia formation at both convex and concave edges. Rtn4b has also been linked to wound healing through its role in macrophage migration52. Together with previous findings, our results suggest that altering ER morphology through various methods consistently influences epithelial migration modes.

Since ER-resident proteins interact with the focal adhesion complex53,54,55,56, ER dynamics might be crucial for the maturation of cell-substrate adhesions during cell adhesion and migration57. Importantly, focal adhesions orient differently at the two edge curvatures during migration, aligning perpendicular to the edge at convex regions and parallel to the edge at concave regions15,16. We therefore hypothesized that different ER morphologies at the convex and concave edges might influence the orientation and stability of focal adhesions. To test this hypothesis, we first checked whether ER tubules or sheets contacted focal adhesion punctae, using paxillin as the focal adhesion marker. Co-localization images revealed that ER tubules were associated with perpendicular paxillin punctae at the convex edge, while ER sheets were associated with parallel focal adhesions at the concave edge (Fig. 7a). Next, we quantified the fraction of focal adhesions of a particular orientation associated with ER sheets or tubules. Adhesions aligned at 0–18° relative to the edge were considered as parallel and those aligned at 72–90° were considered as perpendicular focal adhesions. Quantification revealed that at both curvatures, perpendicular focal adhesions mainly contacted ER tubules, while the parallel focal adhesions were associated with the ER sheets (Fig. 7b). Then, to determine whether altering ER morphology would alter the orientation of focal adhesions, we examined the orientation of paxillin punctae in Rtn4a- or Climp63-overexpressing cells (Fig. 7c), which showed an increased propensity to form ER tubules and sheets, respectively. Subsequently, Rtn4a overexpression led to a decrease in the fraction of parallelly oriented focal adhesions and increased perpendicularly oriented adhesions at the concave edge (Fig. 7c). In contrast, Climp63 overexpression led to a decrease in the fraction of perpendicularly oriented focal adhesions and increased parallelly oriented focal adhesions at the convex edge (Fig. 7c). Taken together, these results suggested that morphological changes in the ER modulate focal adhesion, promoting different modes of migration at the two curvatures.

Epithelial gap closure is a fundamental process in both health and disease, involving collective migration through lamellipodia or purse string contractions, each with distinct actin and adhesion dynamics. This response is strongly influenced by edge curvature, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that among intracellular organelles, the ER undergoes striking curvature-dependent morphological changes and plays a key role in determining the mode of epithelial migration (Fig. 7d). The ER is the largest and most dynamic cell organelle, which has been hypothesized to be a sensor of multiple extracellular cues attributing to its dynamicity and elaborate structure spanning the whole cell17,24,58,59. The curvature-dependent shift in ER morphology, from tubules at convex edges to sheets at concave edges, suggests that ER organization senses and responds to physical cues, driven by protrusive and contractile forces from actin, microtubules and potentially intermediate filaments. Alongside these findings, our theoretical model suggests that these morphologies minimize strain energy within their corresponding geometric contexts. This provides a mechanistic basis for curvature-specific ER organization, though further work is needed to clarify how mechanical constraints and cytoskeletal inputs jointly shape ER structure during migration. Relevantly, an important consideration is whether the dense ER structures at concave edges represent true ER sheets or instead dense tubular matrices, as described in previous studies29. Our results indicate that the dense ER structures at concave edges are predominantly sheets, supported by Climp63 and p180 enrichment, ER–plasma membrane contact patterns and Rtn4b imaging. Consistently, modelling shows that ER sheets have the lowest strain energy at concave edges, reinforcing their role as key regulators of curvature-guided cytoskeletal organization and migration.

Interestingly, ER tubule formation at convex edges relies on microtubule-dependent dynamics, including kinesin-driven sliding and tip attachment, whereas these interactions are dispensable for ER sheet accumulation at concave edges. While it is possible that some ER sheet-associated proteins60,61, including Climp63 and p180, may support ER sheet accumulation at the concave edge, whether actomyosin contractility can directly promote ER sheet accumulation remains unknown. In addition, ER structure and dynamics influence the distribution and post-translational modifications of microtubules27,62. Therefore, ER reorganization in response to curvature may influence microtubule modifications, potentially altering organelle distribution and polarity during migration.

Functionally, manipulating ER morphology alters the migration mode, with Climp63 promoting actin bundles and contractility even at convex edges, and Rtn4a enhancing protrusions at concave edges, probably through changes in focal adhesion orientation. However, ER-mediated regulation of focal adhesions could be just one of the mechanisms by which ER dictates the mode of epithelial cell migration. ER tubules are involved in lipid biogenesis, calcium signalling and forming membrane contact sites with other organelles and the plasma membrane. A reticulated network of ER tubules at the convex edge could also regulate lamellipodial crawling by providing membrane lipids via the contact sites and by releasing calcium for the activation of the actomyosin network. Conversely, ER sheets are involved in protein synthesis, and sheet accumulation at the concave edge might promote directed protein synthesis and delivery, facilitating purse string-like movements. How the conventional roles of ER subdomains differ at the two curvatures and guide cell migration remains unknown. Despite these remaining questions, our findings highlight the ER as a central mechanotransducer that integrates cytoskeletal signals (Fig. 7e) to coordinate curvature-dependent collective cell migration, underscoring the broader role of organelles in tissue homeostasis, development, and regeneration.

For each independent experiment, embryos were dissected from different pregnant females. E14.5–15.5 stage embryos were dissected and used for all wound healing assays. The results are independent of the sex of the animals. The development and physiology of the embryonic epidermal tissue is not known to be different in different sexes, therefore sex of the animal was not considered a parameter in the study. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics committee, TIFR Hyderabad on behalf of Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of experiments on Animals, India.

siRNAs from Dharmacon (Supplementary Table 2) were dissolved in 1× siRNA buffer (B-002000-UB-100) to prepare 5 μM siRNA stock. Stock solutions were aliquoted into multiple tubes to avoid repeated thawing. For siRNA transfection experiments in 12-well plates, Eph4 cells were seeded 16 h before transfection and transfected with siRNA using DharmaFECT 1 (Dharmacon, T-2001-02) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, 75 nM siRNA and 2 μl DharmaFECT 1 were diluted with Opti-MEM medium (Gibco, 31-985-070) to prepare a 100 μl volume system in separate tubes. After 5 min of incubation at room temperature, the two tubes were mixed thoroughly and gently for another 20 min incubation. Then the 200 μl of transfection mix was transferred to each well for a 9–10 h transfection before the medium was replaced with the complete growth medium. The transfected cells were collected from the 12 wells 48 h after transfection and were seeded for migration experiments. For plasmid transfection, cells were treated with respective plasmids and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. At approximately 8–10 h post-transfection, cells were seeded for the migration assays.

MDCK cells stably expressing Rtn4a-GFP or mCherry-Climp63 cells were transfected with the respective plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. At 16–18 h post-transfection, cells were seeded via serial dilution in a 96-well plate. At 48 h post-cell seeding, the cells were subjected to selection media (DMEM–GlutaMax plus 5% FBS) containing 600 μg ml−1 of Geneticin (Invitrogen). The growth of single cell-derived colonies was monitored over 2 weeks following fluorescence confirmation. Colonies with a homogeneous expression of the fluorescence-tagged protein of interest were expanded and maintained in media containing 400 μg ml−1. To ensure further homogeneous expression, these cells were sorted using FACS before each experiment. Briefly, the cells were trypsinized and the pellet was resuspended in Fluorobrite media with 20 mM HEPES. The suspension containing approximately 1 million cells were sorted and only cells showing high expression as compared with WT were selected and seeded for migration experiments.

EpH4 cells treated with nontargeted siRNA, CLimp63 siRNA and Rtn4 siRNA were trypsinized and the pellet was resuspended in RIPA lysis buffer (50 mM Tris,150 mM NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100 and 1× protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail), followed by centrifugation at 16,000g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used for total protein estimation by a Pierce 660 nm assay. The lysate was mixed with equal volume of 1× Laemmli buffer (0.004% bromophenol blue, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS and 0.125 M Tris–HCl pH 6.8) and 5% beta-mercaptoethanol and heated at 98 °C for 5 min, centrifuged and then 20 μg of protein was loaded in each well along with the ladder. Wet transfer was done onto 0.2 μm nitrocellulose membrane as per the Trans-Blot Turbo kit (Bio-Rad, 1704270) for 30 min. Blocking was in or with 5% BSA made in 1× TBS with 0.1% Tween-20 (1× TBSTw20) for 1 h at room temperature followed by primary antibody incubation overnight at 4 °C. After washing three times in 1× TBSTw20, the membranes were incubated in HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, they were developed using Clarity Western ECL Substrate (Pierce ECL, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and visualized using an iBright gel doc.

PDMS6 stencils with pillars of defined shapes were created using soft photolithography. Briefly, 150-μm-thick SU-8 2075 (Kayaku advanced materials, Y111074) was coated on a silicon wafer followed by soft baking at 65 °C for 5 min and 95 °C for 20 min. The SU-8 was exposed in the desired pattern using the MicroWriter ML 3 Pro (Durham Optics Magneto Ltd.) followed by post-exposure baking at 65 °C for 7 min and 95 °C for 15 min. The unexposed photoresist was removed by immersing the wafers in the SU-8 developer (Kayaku Advanced Materials, Y020100) for 8–10 min. Patterned SU-8 wafers were then hard baked at 170 °C for 45 min. PDMS (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning) was mixed in a ratio of 1:10, degassed and poured over the patterned wafers. After curing at 85 °C for 2 h, stencils with pillars were peeled off. The stencils were then treated with 2% pluronic acid for 2 h followed by 15 min of a 1× PBS wash. The PDMS stencil and a Petri dish were plasma cleaned for 10 s, and the stencil was then placed on the dish. Cells were seeded around the pillars and, after confluence, the stencils were removed allowing the cells to migrate into the gaps.

A solution of 20 μg ml−1 fibronectin was applied to a glass-bottom Petri dish (Ibidi). After three washes to remove excess protein, the dish was air dried. The PDMS stencil underwent plasma cleaning for 20 s before being positioned onto the dish. The Petri dish with the stencil was then subjected to UV sterilization for 1 h. A concentrated suspension of MDCK or other cells was seeded around the pillars, followed by the addition of excess media around the stencil. Cells were allowed to settle around the pillars for 15–18 h. Subsequently, the stencils were lifted, enabling cell migration at various curvatures. Live-cell imaging or fixation occurred either immediately or after 30 min of migration.

E14.5–E16.5 mouse embryos were dissected out. The dorsal skin from these embryos was then excised. The skin was placed on a filter paper (Whatman filter, 8 μm pore size) with the epidermal side up. Using a scalpel/fine scissor, incision wounds were made on the epidermis. The filter paper along with the tissue was kept floating in a 6-well plate containing 2 ml of DMEM with 5% FBS and 1% pen–strep. After the desired incubation period, the tissue was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 h at room temperature. The tissue was washed in PBS and transferred to 90% ethanol in PBST (0.2% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS) overnight at −20 °C. The tissue was then rehydrated using graded ethanol (75%, 50% and 25% in PBST). After two more washes in PBST, the tissue was blocked using 10% normal goat serum in PBST for 2 h. Primary antibodies were added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. This was followed by subsequent PBST washes, after which secondary antibodies were added and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, the tissue was mounted on a slide using Fluoroshield (Sigma-Aldrich) mounting media. The slide was cured overnight and imaged using an upright confocal (Leica Stellaris). For inhibitor experiments, the tissue was incubated with the inhibitor, blebbistatin (100 μM) or CK666 (100 μM) in the complete medium for 2 h before making the incision wounds. After 2 h, the wounds were made and the tissue was incubated in the same media for the next 30 min followed by fixation and antibody staining.

After the skin was excised from the embryo, it was placed on a filter paper with the epidermis side up. The explant was incubated in a well containing the culture media (DMEM with 5% FBS and 1% pen–strep) and staining solution (SiR-actin and verapamil) overnight. Then, using a scalpel, incision wounds were made, and it was immediately transferred to a glass-bottom dish, such that the epidermis side was now facing the glass coverslip. Next, 20 µl of Matrigel was added and incubated for 10 min to help immobilize the explant. A confined chamber was placed on top of the filter and culture medium was added. The sample was then imaged using an inverted confocal.

Cells were fixed using a solution containing 3% formaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde diluted in 1× PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Following fixation, cells underwent three washes with 1× PBS. Subsequently, permeabilization was carried out using 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, followed by three quick washes with 1× PBS. Cells were then incubated with a blocking solution (consisting of 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS + 2% BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. Afterwards, cells were incubated with a primary antibody prepared in the blocking solution for 2 h at room temperature. Following the primary antibody incubation, cells were washed three times with 1× PBS and then incubated with the secondary antibody, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (1:1,000) and phalloidin (1:40) dilutions, all prepared in the blocking/staining solution, for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the samples underwent two quick washes and a 5 min wash with 1× PBS before proceeding to imaging.

Fluorescence images were captured using a 60× oil objective (PlanApo N 60× oil, NA of 1.42, Olympus) and a 100× oil objective (UPlanSApo, 100×/1.40 oil), both mounted on an Olympus IX83 inverted microscope equipped with a scanning laser confocal head (Olympus FV3000). Time-lapse imaging of live samples was conducted in the live-cell chamber provided with the microscopy set-up. For the photoactivation experiment, a 60× oil objective (PlanApo N 60× oil, NA of 1.42, Olympus) mounted on an Olympus IX83 inverted microscope equipped with a scanning laser confocal head (Olympus FV3000) was utilized, supported by a live-cell imaging set-up. MDCK cells, either co-expressing photoactivable Rac1 and GFP-Sec61β or expressing photoactivable Rac1 and labelled with SiR-tubulin, were seeded on a glass-bottom dish in Opti-MEM medium with HEPES (20 mM). A region of interest (ROI) approximately 5 μm in diameter was irradiated with a 1% intensity 445 nm laser at 1,000 μs pixel−1, followed by laser scanning microscopy imaging of the two channels (561 nm and 488 nm or 561 nm and 647 nm) at 0.1–0.5% intensity. This cycle of activation and imaging was repeated continuously for 15–20 min.

Fluorescence images were acquired using 100× oil objective (Apo TIRF, NA of 1.49, WD of 0.12) mounted on a Nikon inverted research microscope Eclipse Ti2-E with Yokogawa CSU-W1 SoRa unit. A further 2.8× magnification was used to acquire super-resolution images with the SoRa unit. After the acquisition, images were subjected to Richardson–Lucy 3D deconvolution.

For all inhibition studies, cells underwent pretreatment with the desired inhibitor concentration in complete DMEM for 1 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator before lifting the PDMS stamps. Throughout the migration process, cells remained in complete media containing the inhibitor at the specified concentration for the required migration duration. To modulate actomyosin contractility, MDCK cells were treated with blebbistatin (Sigma), a myosin inhibitor, at a concentration of 50 μM. Arp2/3-inhibition was achieved using CK666 (Sigma) at a concentration of 50 μM. Calyculin A (Sigma), a phosphatase inhibitor, was used to enhance actomyosin contractility at a concentration of 20 nM. Nocodazole (Sigma) was utilized to disrupt microtubules in MDCK cells at a concentration of 10 μM. Following inhibitor treatment, cells were fixed and immunostained with the desired antibodies.

Source and dilution information for all primary and secondary antibodies used in immunofluorescence staining are given in Supplementary Table 1. Details of plasmids used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 2 with their source.

Image analysis was conducted using Fiji. To determine the fraction of ER tubules, Trainable Weka Segmentation was utilized to distinguish between tubules and sheets within the ER structures. To train the model, we selected key image processing features, including Gaussian blur, Sobel filter, Hessian, difference of Gaussians and membrane projections, which help distinguish ER tubules from sheets based on intensity, texture and edge detection. A sample image was manually annotated to define three structural categories or classes as follows: (1) thin peripheral ER tubules; (2) dense, bright ER sheets; and (3) background regions that included cytoplasmic spaces between ER structures and the extracellular area. The tool was iteratively trained by manually marking multiple areas in each category until the segmented output closely matched the original image. Once trained, the model was saved and applied to multiple images to ensure consistency and minimize user bias in segmentation. Following classification, the segmented image was converted to an 8-bit greyscale format for further quantification. Using thresholding, we extracted binary masks for tubules, sheets and total ER. The pixel area corresponding to each category was measured, providing quantitative data on the fraction of tubules per cell. This automated approach ensured an objective assessment of ER morphology across different experimental conditions. To assess the reliability of our Weka-based segmentation, we performed a validation by comparing automated segmentation outputs with manual annotations. A subset of images (n = 30) was manually segmented using Fiji's polygon selection tool to trace ER tubule and sheet regions. We then applied our trained Weka model to the same images and quantified the corresponding pixel areas. The fraction of ER tubules obtained by both methods showed a strong linear correlation (Pearson r = 0.99, P < 0.001), indicating that the automated classification reliably replicates manual assessment, demonstrating the robustness and accuracy of our segmentation pipeline.

The ER tubule fraction at the leading edge of the cell was computed by dividing the tubular ER area by the total ER area manually marked in the region at the migrating front of the cell. The same classifier was applied for ER segmentation in all inhibition and mutant studies. In the photoactivation experiment of Rac1, the ROI for Rac1 activation was selected for segmentation, while a similarly sized ROI at the nonactivated region within the cell served as a control.

The Directionality plugin in Fiji was used to quantify the orientation of focal adhesions. This plugin is used to quantify the preferred orientation of the structures in the input image. The image of the front of the cell, labelled with anti-paxillin antibody, clearly marking focal adhesions, was cropped and provided to the plugin. The Fourier components method, 6 Nbins from 0° to 90°, was used. This computes and generates a histogram representing the frequency of structures (focal adhesions) at a particular orientation. Focal adhesions (FAs) aligned between 0° and 18° were considered parallel to the wound, while those aligned between 72° and 90° were deemed perpendicular. FAs not falling within these ranges were excluded from the analysis. The data over many cells at different curvatures were collected and averaged to finally plot the focal adhesion orientation. Microtubule orientation was also determined using the directionality plugin in Fiji, with 10 Nbins and angles ranging from 0° to 180°. An ROI at the front of the migrating cell in the α-tubulin channel was chosen, and directionality frequency was calculated. Curvature analysis was performed using the Fiji plugin kappa-curvature analysis. B-spline was given as the curvature input and the scale of individual images in micron/pixel was added to the plugin. Arcs were drawn manually over images and average curvature values were computed.

Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9. Statistical significance was determined using an unpaired t-test with Welch's correction or a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), as specified in the corresponding figure legend. Scatter-bar plots were presented as mean ± s.e.m. P values above 0.05 were considered not statistically significant. Quantification was based on data from a minimum of three independent biological replicates. Data distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally tested. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size, but our sample sizes are consistent with the standard of the field and are appropriate for the types of analyses performed. Samples were not allocated using randomization, as this study involved observational analysis of epithelial cells under defined experimental conditions. All groups were subjected to identical culture, treatment and imaging protocols to control for potential covariates, ensuring comparability across conditions. Data collection and analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experiments. No data points were excluded from the analyses.

 Illustration: The Project Twins

In 1862, Victor Hugo reportedly wrote to his publisher to ask how his newly published novel Les Misérables was selling, with a single character query: “?” The response: “!”

This story of one of the world's most concise correspondences is apocryphal. But some genome-focused artificial intelligence (AI) systems can, like the French writer's publisher, respond meaningfully to equally short prompts.

Instead of the detailed queries required to use the chatbot ChatGPT effectively, Evo, an AI model trained on some 300 billion nucleotide bases, including 80,000 microbial whole-genome sequences, will — prompted with ‘#' — dream up a new sequence of mobile DNA. It does so on the basis of other such biological systems that the model has been exposed to (see go.nature.com/3jvp922). Given a prompt such as ‘030', an AI tool called regLM can spit out 200-base sequences that are predicted to exhibit regulatory activity in any of three human cell lines (go.nature.com/4jpttm8).

Evo and regLM are part of a fast-growing suite of tools that aim to internalize, decode, interpret and build on the grammar of the genome — especially the vast portion that does not code for proteins. Think AlphaFold, but for regulatory DNA, which are sequences that control gene expression.

DeepMind's new AlphaGenome AI tackles the ‘dark matter' in our DNA

DeepMind's new AlphaGenome AI tackles the ‘dark matter' in our DNA

When Google DeepMind released AlphaFold in 2020, the company claimed it had solved a decades-old ‘grand challenge' in biology — predicting a protein's 3D shape from its sequence alone. But the non-coding fraction of the genome could prove to be an even grander challenge.

A given sequence of amino acids will generally fold into the same shape, whatever the cellular context. That predictability is not true of the genome, in which short, functional sequence motifs — gene promoters and enhancers, transcription start and stop sites and so on — can be scattered across long stretches of seemingly purposeless DNA. These motifs might overlap, interact over long distances, bind to competing protein factors or respond to signals that are only present in specific cells or at certain times in development. They are also tightly wrapped within chromatin, a complex of DNA and protein, which might be more or less accessible to external proteins depending on what the cell is doing.

“How proteins are encoded in the genome, the code of how genes are expressed, when and where, how much — is one of the most fascinating problems in biology,” says Stein Aerts, a computational biologist at the VIB Center for AI & Computational Biology and the Catholic University of Leuven (KU Leuven) in Belgium. But with training, AI tools can detect subtle differences between sequences and predict what they do and how they behave, identifying crucial motifs and even estimating the impact of altering them. From there, AI models can attempt to predict the physiological impact of genetic variants and even guide the design of new sequences with specified functions.

These tools are not perfect, and researchers cannot even agree on how best to assess their performance. But that makes the field exciting. “It's so clear that it's a solvable problem,” says Julia Zeitlinger, a developmental and computational biologist at the Stowers Institute for Medical Research in Kansas City, Missouri, who developed an AI model called BPNet and uses it to decode the mechanistic sequence rules of gene regulation, “but it's not clear how”.

DeepSEA, one of the first genomic AI tools, was published1 ten years ago this month by computational biologists Jian Zhou and Olga Troyanskaya at Princeton University in New Jersey.

DeepSEA is a convolutional neural network (CNN) — the same kind of deep-learning architecture used to teach computers to classify images as, say, a cat or a dog. Zhou and Troyanskaya trained a model on epigenetics data, including transcription-factor binding, chromatin accessibility and histone modifications, from a public research project called the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE). The model learnt to predict the presence of such features in 1,000-base segments of DNA it had never encountered.

DeepSEA's training enabled it to tease apart the biological consequence and severity of sequence variants associated with human disease. For instance, one breast-cancer-associated sequence variant called rs4784227 seems to strengthen the binding of a DNA-binding protein called FOXA1, whereas a variant associated with the blood condition α-thalassemia creates a possible binding site for GATA1, a transcription factor involved in blood-cell development.

Since then, the field has exploded. David Kelley, a principal investigator at the biotechnology company Calico Life Sciences in South San Francisco, California, has created or co-created multiple AI models, many with canine-inspired names. These include Akita2 (for predicting 3D genome folding), Basset3 and Basenji4 (for regulatory-sequence prediction) and Borzoi5, which predicts gene expression across the length of a gene.

These models raised a litter of variants: Basset begat Malinois, and Borzoi begat Scooby. Other researchers have built their own (non-canine) models including Puffin, ChromBPNet and more.

Not all are CNNs. Enformer — a model that predicts both gene expression and epigenetic data over long distances — and Borzoi, for instance, “use both convolution blocks and transformer blocks”, says Kelley, whose laboratory developed both models. “The convolution blocks are great for capturing the local sequence patterns, and then the transformer blocks help look around a larger region to consider the local patterns in a broader context before predicting the data.” But whatever the architecture, they come in two basic forms, says Anshul Kundaje, who researches computational genomics at Stanford University in California. Supervised and sequence-to-function models are trained on functional genomic data — gene expression or chromatin accessibility, for instance — and learn to predict the function of DNA sequences they have never encountered. Often working at or near single-nucleotide resolution, these models can identify key motifs, such as functionally important protein-binding sites, and predict the significance of altering them. DeepSEA is one; Kundaje's ChromBPNet, which predicts regions of chromatin accessibility, another.

The other class is unsupervised or self-supervised ‘genomic language models' (gLMs). Like ChatGPT, they are trained on vast quantities of text — in this case, genomic sequence data — and are tasked with either predicting the next base (or ‘token') in a sequence or filling in missing bases on the basis of surrounding context. These models “are not trying to predict the activity of a sequence, they're trying to predict the composition of a sequence”, says Avantika Lal, a machine-learning scientist at biotechnology firm Genentech in South San Francisco.

With machine-learning scientist Gökçen Eraslan and their colleagues at Genentech, Lal co-developed regLM, a language model that they trained by labelling regulatory sequences with succinct markers of activity6 — for instance, ‘04<sequence>' to indicate strong expression in one cell line and low activity in another. The model is therefore not strictly unsupervised, says Eraslan — he calls it a ‘function-to-sequence' model. But those same labels can then be used to prompt regLM to create new sequences with predicted behaviours.

Evo 2, announced in February7, was trained on 9.3 trillion DNA base pairs — “a representative snapshot of genomes spanning all observed evolution”, as the resulting bioRxiv preprint paper puts it. It could then identify intron–exon boundaries, predict the impacts of mutations and generate ‘realistic' gene and genomic sequences, among other things.

Genomic AI models can also be distinguished by the type of regulatory interactions they predict, Kundaje says. Sequence-to-function models mostly identify important DNA motifs (which, because their function depends on their proximity to the regulated gene, are said to act in cis) without regard to the biology that occurs there.

Trans models, by contrast, aim to identify which genes regulate which other genes, for instance, to tease apart networks of gene regulation. (They are called trans because the factors that mediate this regulation act at a distance.) But this, says Kundaje, “is still very fraught and very problematic” because trans models — which are generally trained on data such as RNA expression — must infer causal relationships without data that can reveal causality. There's no guarantee that two genes are directly linked just because their expression rises and falls in tandem. Even if they are, it's not necessarily obvious in which direction the relationship works: does A regulate B or vice versa? If these models are then asked to predict the impact of a perturbation — for example, what happens if a given gene is knocked out — the models often fail.

Models can include both cis and trans elements, says Sushmita Roy, a computational biologist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, for instance by building regulatory networks on the basis of chromatin accessibility data and weighting those predictions by gene expression. But perhaps the first model to truly bridge the divide, Kundaje says, is Scooby — a single-cell version of Borzoi (go.nature.com/3upffnp). By leveraging both chromatin accessibility and transcriptional data from the same cells, Scooby predicts genome features and cell state simultaneously. “It is one of the first cis–trans models,” he says.

Sequence-to-function models can also probe other aspects of gene regulation. In 2024, teams led by Zhou (who is now at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas), Kundaje and Charles Danko, a computational biologist at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, independently described sequence-to-function models capable of predicting sites of transcription initiation8–10.

Zhou used his team's model, Puffin, to identify the common features and placement of key regulatory elements around sites of transcription initiation, including binding sites for the transcription factors YY1, SP1, CREB and Initiator. Danko's team trained its AI model on matched genome sequences and transcription initiation data from 58 individuals, creating a suite of models that were, he says, “for the first time aware of how differences between individuals in their genome sequence influence the pattern” of transcription initiation.

Collectively, says Zhou, these studies begin to tease apart the motifs that regulate the positioning and strength of transcription initiation, including that of the transcription factor TFIID. TFIID is an essential protein complex that binds to the promoter element known as a TATA box — despite the fact that most eukaryotic promoters don't seem to contain a TATA box. “One mechanistic interpretation is that TFIID is binding the best available of the ‘bad options' when it picks a site” in a TATA-less promoter, Danko explains.

Most genomic models make these predictions from relatively small inputs — anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand bases. But gene regulation can occur over much longer tracts of genome space, and some models are able to make predictions at or near those scales. Borzoi, for instance, accepts 524 kilobases of input DNA, and Evo 2 and Google DeepMind's newly announced AlphaGenome can work with a megabase.

These models can transform those sequences into vast collections of estimated data. Given an input sequence of 196,608 bases of human DNA, for instance, Enformer outputs 2,131 predictions of transcription factor binding, 1,860 of histone modifications, 684 of chromatin accessibility and 638 of gene expression, at 128-base resolution (go.nature.com/4mbe42h).

Yet despite these models' extensive ‘receptive fields', they can still miss things, says Jacob Schreiber, a computational biologist at the Research Institute of Molecular Pathology in Vienna, because enhancers might exert effects that are biologically meaningful but invisible to the AI tool. “We have not cracked long-range regulation,” he says.

Another challenge is that, as vast as it is, the human genome is finite — there are only about 20,000–25,000 genes, for instance, and only a fraction of those are regulated in a cell-type-specific manner. That means that for all those billions of bases, there are relatively few examples of regulatory strategies from which a model can learn.

“There's just so many different biochemical mechanisms that could happen on DNA that there are probably a very large number of them that only occur once or even zero times in our genome sequence,” says biomedical engineer Carl de Boer at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.

One approach to broadening an AI model's knowledge base is to feed it more than just reference genomes. Some model builders, for instance, train their tools on data from multiple individuals or from across the phylogenetic tree to give the models a sense of genetic diversity.

Another approach, advanced by de Boer and Jussi Taipale, a systems biologist at the University of Cambridge, UK, is to look beyond natural genomes to fully artificial DNAs11.

As a postdoc at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts, de Boer and his colleagues tested some 100 million random sequences, each of which were 80 nucleotides in length — “about a human genome's worth” — for their ability to drive expression of a fluorescent protein in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)12. (The yeast genome is made up of about 12 million bases, compared with roughly 3 billion in the human genome.) This approach, de Boer says, “is actually much better” for understanding the grammar of the genome than using genomic DNA, “because all of the signals you see in the random DNA are causal”. If you see fluorescence, the sequence is active. The genome, by contrast, is a product of evolution, meaning elements might be positioned owing to selective pressures as well as function.

According to de Boer, the yeast exercise yielded two key insights. First, it reinforced that “there are probably widespread biophysical interactions happening in regulatory regions”. Functional motifs were not randomly arranged in active sequences; they were positioned in specific configurations — for instance, to conform to the helical spacing of the DNA double helix.

The second insight involved the importance of low-affinity transcription-factor–DNA interactions. Even weak interactions, the team found, could exert a large influence on gene regulation, just as relatively weak chemical interactions can hold two proteins together.

Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15; also known as macrophage-inhibitory cytokine-1) is a stress-responsive cytokine that is overexpressed under a broad range of conditions. It has a role in regulating appetite and body weight and is an aetiological factor in anorexia–cachexia syndromes, as well as nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. Long after its original cloning, its receptor was identified as GFRAL, a distant member of the GDNF receptor family within the TGFβ superfamily, with RET as its co-receptor. Both of these are highly localized to specific hindbrain regions. Although many of GFRAL's metabolic changes may be linked to its effect on suppressing appetite, recent findings suggest that GDF15 also independently regulates energy expenditure and insulin sensitivity. Here, we review recent literature and provide updates on the current understanding of GDF15 biology and its therapeutic applications in health and metabolic diseases.

Andrew Moseson experienced severe depression for many years. “Some days I wasn't able to get out bed. I had long periods of unemployment and was living in my car for a time.” He struggled to find relief, nothing worked. “I tried medications, exercise, volunteering, psychedelics. I read books about happiness, about depression,” he says. “Everything helped a little, but it was still there.” Then, in the spring of 2023, he found a clinical trial that would change his life.

The trial was for people with clinical depression who, like Moseson, had not found success with existing medication. It involved faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), in which stool from a healthy donor is transferred into a recipient's gastrointestinal tract to restore a healthy balance of gut bacteria.

The procedure did not work as well for everyone who took part in the trial, but for Moseson the results were transformative — and they came fast. “Within about a week, I started feeling better,” he says. “I felt like my brain was refreshed.”

Two years later, Moseson is still taking his previously prescribed medication. “My doctor doesn't want me to quit my antidepressants,” he says. “There's a thought that this transplant could make antidepressants work better.” Whatever the mechanism, the change seems stark. “I feel like I've been cured,” Moseson says.

Numerous psychiatric and neurological conditions have been linked to disturbances in people's gut microbiota — the community of trillions of microorganisms that live symbiotically in the gastrointestinal tract. These are just correlations, but studies in rodents show compelling evidence of causality, and other animal research points to multiple pathways through which the microbiota communicates with the brain.

Moseson's experience, and others like it, offer preliminary evidence that microbiota-based treatments can be beneficial for people with mood disorders, such as depression and anxiety. The procedure need not be a faecal transplant — good outcomes have also been observed with probiotics (microbial species or strains that have a beneficial effect on the microbiota) and diet. But how these interventions work is not clear. Only with large-scale human trials, including investigation of mechanisms, will researchers be able to say which microbes work, for which conditions, and in which individuals and circumstances.

The trial that Moseson participated in was led by Valerie Taylor, a psychiatrist at the University of Calgary in Canada. Taylor became interested in the gut microbiota after two people with bipolar disorder approached her. “They'd been very sick for a long time and nothing had worked; both took antibiotics, and their symptoms completely changed,” Taylor says. They asked her if there was a link. “I had no idea, but I was going to try to find out.”

Around that time, in 2016, two studies had just been published that showed transferring faecal matter from someone with depression into rodents gave the animals depression-like behaviours1,2. “That was really interesting,” says Taylor. “This is not how we'd thought about mental illness, as something that can be transferred the way you could catch measles.”

One study came from John Cryan, a neurobiologist at University College Cork in Ireland, and his colleagues, who had been looking at the influence of the gut microbiota in stress-related conditions, such as depression and anxiety. They had studied a small sample of people with depression and found that they harboured microbial communities that differed from those of healthy people. But that was just an association. “To prove causality, we wanted to know, if we took that microbiome and put it into a healthy rat, would it do anything?” says Cryan. “Lo and behold, it did.”

Rats that received faecal transplants from people with depression exhibited anhedonia (a lack of interest and pleasure) and anxiety-like behaviours, and had altered metabolism of tryptophan, a precursor to biomolecules such as the neurotransmitter serotonin1. Humans source tryptophan from their diet, because the body doesn't produce it, and gut microbes help to metabolize it.

The second study, from a team led by researchers at Chongqing Medical University in China, showed the same result in mice, and also noted metabolic changes2.

In December 2023, Cryan and his colleagues showed that symptoms experienced by people with social anxiety disorder could similarly be transferred to rodents through faecal transplants3. Mice that received the transplants showed normal behaviour across a battery of depression and anxiety tests, but showed heightened sensitivity to social fear. This was accompanied by changes in immune function and in the oxytocin system, which plays a crucial part in social behaviour. “This same paradigm of faecal microbiota transplant in animals has been replicated for autism features, and psychosis,” says Viktoriya Nikolova, a psychiatrist at King's College London.

These studies inspired Taylor and her colleagues to attempt to translate the findings to human therapies. “We got very interested in whether, if you could transfer illness this way, could you do the reverse?” Taylor says.

Their first trial, which Taylor says is due to be published later this year, was focused on bipolar disorder. Taylor reasoned that if they could make progress in a condition that is generally thought of as highly genetically determined and hard to treat, it should work on other disorders, too. And if anything was going to work in humans, she thought, it would be the comprehensive alterations of the microbiota brought about by FMT, as opposed to tinkering with it by adding a handful of microbial strains. “We needed faecal transplants to see what happens when you completely reset things,” Taylor says. “We thought if we didn't see anything, we're not going to do the probiotic work, because it's probably not going to work either.”

The findings so far have convinced the team to push forwards. They have three more trials at various stages of completion: two focusing on depression, including the one Moseson participated in, and one on obsessive-compulsive disorder. They are also planning another, on attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.



One drawback of FMT is that it does little to narrow down which microbes are responsible for the benefits. Ultimately, more-targeted treatments could be developed, such as probiotics, but transplant trials could show whether this is worth pursuing.

A handful of small trials of probiotics for depression have found positive effects. In 2021, Nikolova and her colleagues published a meta-analysis of seven such trials4. Five used probiotics in addition to standard-of-care treatments, whereas two trials used them as stand-alone therapies. The analysis found that probiotics — known as psychobiotics when used in this way — are effective as an add-on, but not when used alone. “For now, the best evidence supports psychobiotics as adjunctive therapies,” says Wolfgang Marx, a nutritional psychiatrist at Deakin University in Geelong, Australia. “Something that can complement, rather than replace, standard care.”

In 2023, Nikolova and her colleagues published a pilot trial of 49 people with depression who had previously had only a partial response to antidepressants5. Half of the participants received a multistrain probiotic, in addition to their medication, for eight weeks. This group showed greater reductions in depression and anxiety-related symptoms compared with the placebo group. “What we found was better than expected in terms of clinical efficacy,” says Nikolova.

Researchers have also been investigating whether alterations of the microbiota through diet can be leveraged to improve mental health. A study published in 2017, by a team in Australia, found that an intervention based on a Mediterranean diet reduced symptoms in people with depression6. “Dietary changes affect the broader microbial ecosystem,” says Marx, partly because it introduces many compounds that microbes feed on, known as prebiotics. Although “psychobiotics may be a more targeted approach, diet might offer a more broad-spectrum route to supporting mental health”, he says.

Despite this preliminary evidence that microbiota-based interventions can influence mood disorders, how they do this remains unclear. Animal studies suggest that there are two-way communication routes between the gut and the brain, and they fall into four broad categories. First, the gut microbiota influences the immune system. Second, microbes in the gut interact with a network formed by the hormone-secreting pituitary and adrenal glands and the hypothalamus, called the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The HPA axis controls stress responses, mainly by secreting the stress hormone cortisol. Third, microbes also communicate by way of the vagus nerve, which connects the enteric nervous system (a web of neurons that lines the gut) to the brain.

And finally, metabolites produced by microbes can communicate with the brain in various ways. Some do so through the enteric nervous system; others, such as short-chain fatty acids, can slip into the bloodstream and cross the blood–brain barrier to enter the brain directly. Some metabolites influence the synthesis of other molecules that act in the brain, such as neurotransmitters and growth factors. “There's very good evidence to support all these mechanisms,” says Nikolova.

This web of pathways is collectively called the gut–brain axis, but little is currently known about its relative importance in human illness. “The question is, which pathways are being activated in which disorders, in what relative contribution, at what point in life?” says Cryan.

In February, Nikolova and her colleagues published a follow-on study in which they investigated potential mechanisms, but it was inconclusive7. The team collected stool and blood samples to analyse microbiota composition and inflammatory markers. They found no effects on circulating immune-signalling molecules, called cytokines, or on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a growth factor involved in neuronal survival, which some studies4 have implicated in the link between the microbiota and the brain. Several previous trials also failed to find changes in levels of cytokines. All but one study found no significant impact on BDNF4.

The problem might be that, because so many factors affect the microbiota, any effects of probiotics on biomarkers such as immune molecules are drowned out in small samples. “What we need to do next is conduct large-scale clinical trials where we're studying mechanisms,” Nikolova says. “So we can get a signal above the noise.”

Simply testing all possible candidates isn't feasible. Researchers don't yet fully understand what constitutes a healthy microbiota, nor do they have a complete catalogue of human gut microbes. A more tractable approach is to try to understand how probiotics work.

In the follow-on study7 conducted by Nikolova and her colleagues, the most prominent change in participants' microbiota was an increase in Bacillus bacteria, which correlated with reductions in anxiety symptoms. Generally, changes were transient. Microbial diversity, for instance, was significantly greater in people who received probiotics than in the placebo group after four weeks, but not after eight. Symptoms continued to improve, however, suggesting that benefits might not depend solely on changes in microbiota composition. “It's telling us this isn't the only way that [probiotics] have an effect,” says Nikolova.

Researchers now understand that looking only at changes in microbiota composition will not be enough to get to the bottom of how psychobiotics affect mood. “What's there is interesting, but it's what they're doing that's really important,” says Cryan. One source of uncertainty is that the microbiota has functional redundancy, meaning various microbes can fulfil the same role. “If one species goes down, another might pick up its functions,” says Nikolova. “So it's not just about what's missing, but rather whether the function is impaired.”

Understanding all of this will require trials that track as many biomarkers as possible, including immune markers, hormones, neurotransmitters and numerous metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids and growth factors. Multiomics techniques, which analyse gene activity, proteins, metabolites and more, allow this depth of analysis. These tools were once prohibitively expensive, but decreasing costs are bringing them in reach of more researchers. Trials will also need to account for other factors that can affect microbiota and mental health, such as lifestyle, diet and genetics. “We need large-scale longitudinal studies across the lifespan, combined with brain imaging and other biomarker read-outs that are going to give us real understanding,” says Cryan.

A further complication is that researchers don't yet fully understand how psychiatric drugs and probiotics interact. Probiotics could work by enhancing the action of antidepressants. Alternatively, if probiotics operate through a different mechanism, they might have separate effects to those medications.

Many common antidepressant drugs target serotonin, and some trials have found that probiotics can increase serotonin synthesis7. This could allow probiotics to augment the action of drugs, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and make them a useful add-on to conventional therapy. Probiotics could also boost well-being by mitigating side effects caused by the drugs' impact on the microbiota, says Nikolova.

However, it is also possible that probiotics have an additive effect. A reduction in the neurotransmitters dopamine and noradrenaline has been linked to depression and anxiety, but SSRIs do nothing to change this. This could partly explain why people with an anxious type of depression typically don't respond as well to antidepressants. The probiotic that Nikolova and her colleagues used in their trial4,7 included a Bacillus species that produces dopamine and noradrenaline, raising the possibility that the beneficial effects they saw came from targeting different mechanisms to those of participants' existing medications.

A higher-resolution picture of microbiota changes — and their downstream consequences — will be needed if researchers are to use microbiota data diagnostically. In 2021, Nikolova and her colleagues published a meta-analysis8 of microbiota alterations linked to psychiatric diagnoses. They found that, although increases in pro-inflammatory bacteria and reductions in some anti-inflammatory bacteria were associated with depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, the differences did not discriminate between conditions.

Such deeper understanding could even be used for prognosis. “Multiomics approaches are beginning to provide insight into the functional patterns that could predict treatment response or disease risk,” says Marx. “In theory, we could one day personalize psychiatric care based on a person's microbial and metabolic profile,” he says. But that day has yet to arrive — mainly, says Marx, because “most findings aren't validated in large clinical cohorts”.

Researchers are struggling to fund large-scale human trials. “The main issue is you can market products without any evidence, the margins are so much lower than in pharma and it's more difficult to protect, so the incentives aren't there,” says Cryan. “The flip side is we could democratize health care: by not making these expensive products, we could get them to more people, to socio-economic areas that might benefit most.” Researchers will need to look beyond food and supplement companies. “As a scientist, I need more evidence, but that requires funding through either philanthropic or government sources, we can't rely on industry to do it.”

Researchers, as well as people with mood disorders, agree this is worthwhile. Moseson is evangelical about the treatment that helped him so much. “Everybody needs to know about this,” he says. His experience changed how he views his depression. “For a long time, I felt ashamed I felt this way, but after the transplant, I started thinking about my depression differently; knowing it wasn't me, it was my bacteria,” he says. “Then thinking of myself, not just as an individual, but more a collection of biology.”

Recent studies have demonstrated ambient pressure superconductivity in compressively strained La3Ni2O7 thin films, yet the phase diagram of heterovalent doping—critical for advancing the field—remains underexplored. Here we report superconductivity in Sr2+-doped La3–xSrxNi2O7 films. The superconducting transition temperature (Tc) follows an incomplete dome-like profile, maintaining similar Tc values across a wide doping range (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.21) before diminishing near x ≈ 0.38. Optimally doped films achieve a Tc value of ~42 K, with a high critical current (Jc > 1.4 kA cm−2 at 2 K) and upper critical fields (μ0Hc,∥(0) = 83.7 T, μ0Hc,⟂(0) = 110.3 T). Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals that oxygen vacancies predominantly occupy planar NiO2 sites—unlike apical-site vacancies in bulk samples—due to compressive strain. Additionally, the elongated out-of-plane Ni–O bonds, exceeding those in pressurized bulk samples by 4%, likely weaken the interlayer \({d}_{{z}^{2}}\) coupling and contribute to the reduced Tc in strained films.

Yet, the complex interplay between light and excited carriers—via mechanisms such as the AC Stark effect, field-induced coupling of excitonic and Bloch states, the dynamical Franz-Keldysh effect, and the ponderomotive effect—continues to challenge our understanding of quantum systems driven far from equilibrium. Here, we establish non-collinear harmonic spectroscopy as a powerful technique for initiating, tracking, and steering femtosecond carrier dynamics across the energy landscape in the dielectric SiO2 crystal. Combining rigorous numerical simulations with analytical theory, we identify the main mechanisms responsible for the crossover of different strong-field phenomena, which leads to the delay-dependent energy shift of excitonic and Bloch states. This control over the electronic and excitonic states opens new opportunities for tailoring carrier dynamics in quantum materials, paving the way for next-generation optoelectronic and nanophotonic technologies.

Strong light-matter interaction creates non-equilibrium states of matter, presenting a remarkable avenue to explore microscopic phenomena and macroscopic properties beyond the reach of conventional materials1,2. Controlling electron dynamics in solids on femtosecond (1 fs = 10−15 s) to attosecond (1 as = 10−18 s) timescales holds great potential for advancing ultrafast optoelectronics3 and exploring non-equilibrium many-body physics with unprecedented accuracy. For instance, it opens exciting possibilities for dynamically tailoring the electronic structure using Floquet engineering4,5,6,7, generating higher-order harmonics8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19, inducing phase transitions20,21, exploring superconductivity22, topological phenomena6, non-Markovian dephasing23,24, and anomalous Hall effect25 in quantum materials on ultrafast timescales.

On the other hand, miniaturizing components has become a major challenge in the microelectronics industry. Currently, 2.5-dimensional and 3-dimensional packaging offer new pathways toward higher performance and energy efficiency, yet they require a high density of interconnections between logical and memory units26. This high density is achieved using interposers, the thin layers made of silicon and drilled with the deep reactive ion etching method27. The industry is now exploring the use of laser-drilled thin glass interposers, which are more affordable and easier to process28. These developments and novel applications of silicon dioxide have attracted significant attention from both academic and applied researchers studying interactions of materials with strong electric fields.

By carefully tuning the parameters of the optical fields, it is possible to selectively manipulate the relative contributions of interband and intraband processes, allowing for dynamic control over the electron energy landscape. Ultrafast control of electron energies in quartz has several promising applications across fields that rely on precise electronic manipulation and switching29,30,31,32. These advancements present new routes for understanding and harnessing the rich and dynamic behavior of quantum materials, paving the way for the development of novel functionalities and applications33,34. On the other hand, in the presence of a strong electric field, significant amounts of charge carriers could be excited into the high-energy states, leading to the manifestation of various many-body effects, such as Auger scattering35,36, avalanche breakdown29,37, carrier-carrier38,39,40 and carrier-phonon scattering41,42,43, etc. Notably, under intense photoexcitation, electron–phonon coupling can dominate the relaxation pathways of carriers, leading to enhanced optical conductivity44. The intricate interplay among particle dynamics, excitonic effects, and phonon interactions produces a highly nonlinear and complex evolution of the system. Despite these advancements, achieving precise control over electronic dynamics and decomposing these constituent effects remains a significant challenge.

In the present work, we utilize the coherent response of noncollinear high-harmonic spectroscopy to delve into the femtosecond and pathway-resolved control of carrier energies. With experimental data, numerical, and analytical derivations, we study comprehensively the dynamic energy shifts of Bloch states and excitonic levels. For negative time delays, when the majority of carriers remain in the valence band, the third-harmonic signal of the probe pulse features the redshift due to the pump-field induced renormalization of the electronic subsystem: the dynamical Franz-Keldysh effect and the excitonic Stark effect. For positive time delays, when a significant number of carriers is excited to the excitonic and Bloch states, we observe the blueshifts due to virtual transitions from the excitonic to Bloch states and the ponderomotive effect. These results demonstrate opportunities for the realization of spectrum-based femtosecond optical switches and for exploring the non-equilibrium many-body phenomena in solids. Our research deepens the understanding of light-matter interactions and control of electronic states with unprecedented precision.

Figure 1a illustrates the generation of ultrahigh order wave-mixing photons resulting from the superposition of an intense fundamental field with a cycle-averaged intensity of \({I}_{1}\approx 1\times {10}^{13}\,{{{{\rm{W}}}}/{{{\rm{cm}}}}}^{2}\) and a weak second-harmonic field with an intensity of \({I}_{2}\approx 1\times {10}^{12}\,{{{{\rm{W}}}}/{{{\rm{cm}}}}}^{2}\). This phenomenon occurs when the two fields are arranged at the crossing angle of \(\theta \approx 18\,{{{\rm{mrad}}}}\) and time zero, for details see Supplementary Information (SI), Section 1.1. A similar experimental arrangement has been previously discussed in the context of ultrahigh wave-mixing measurements in the gas phase45. Compared to conventional collinear pump-probe geometry, this noncollinear configuration offers several advantages, including background-free measurements by avoiding two-photon sideband absorption and energy overlap under two-color field conditions, as well as the capability for momentum- and parity-resolved high-harmonic generation (HHG) spectral measurements.

a Schematic representation: The \({\omega }_{1}\) beam is positioned in the horizontal plane, while \({\omega }_{2}\) the beam points downwards at an angle of θ ~ 18 mrad, forming a plane parallel to the entrance slit of the XUV spectrometer. b, c Ultra-high-order wave-mixing spectra generated from the superposition of an intense pump fundamental \({\omega }_{1}\) (800 nm) at zero time delay and the second harmonic weaker probe field (400 nm) in the α-quartz sample, with both pulses linearly polarized to the Γ-M (b) and Γ-K (c) directions of the Brillouin zone, respectively. The number inside the bracket \((m,n)\) represents the number of absorbed photons from the pump and probe pulses, respectively, i.e., \(\Omega (m,n)\propto (m{\omega }_{1}+n{\omega }_{2})\). d, e represent the noncollinear simulations considering inversion symmetry parallel to the two electric fields, either in the Γ-M (b) or Γ-K (c) directions of the Brillouin zone. The color bars are normalized to their maximum harmonic yields and presented on a logarithmic scale. The symbol × indicates the second-order diffraction signal.

Notably, owing to the slight inclination of the two pulses, as shown by the solid lines in Fig. 1a, not only their respective harmonics but also their combined wave-mixing frequencies are recorded. The α-quartz crystal, composed of silicon (Si) and oxygen (O) atoms, belongs to the trigonal crystal system, with space group P3121 for left-handed and P3221 for right-handed quartz, and lacks spatial inversion symmetry, leading to the emergence of significant Berry curvature responsible for the generation of even harmonics with polarization perpendicular to the driving field12. In the case of our noncollinear geometry, the inversion symmetry of the electric field cannot be perfectly broken. Yet the α-quartz crystal already has a broken inversion symmetry along the Γ-M direction of the Brillouin zone. As a result, as shown in Fig. 1b, we observe the emission of an even total number of photons, represented as \(m+n={{{\rm{even}}}}\), such as (\(m=2\), \(n=2\)), (4, 2), (6, 2), and (8, 2) mixing photons, deviating from the parity conservation law. To provide a similar observation, we recorded the ultrahigh wave-mixing spectrum in the Γ-K direction, as depicted in Fig. 1c. In this scenario, only an odd total number of mixing photons (\(m+n={{{\rm{odd}}}}\)) was observed, and all even total number of harmonics disappeared, indicating the presence of inversion symmetry along the Γ-K direction.

To understand the influence of the inversion symmetry on the ultrahigh-order wave-mixing spectra, we performed numerical simulations to solve the semiconductor Bloch equations (SBEs) by incorporating the noncollinear two-pulse interaction at temporal overlap with an angle of \(\theta \sim 18\,{{{\rm{mrad}}}}\) and a beam size around μ ~ 50 μm (see SI, Sec. 2). To directly compare with experimental results, we calculated the far field spatial-resolved spectrum \(I(\omega,x)\) using experimentally measured parameters as input to the non-collinear numerical simulations of SBEs (see SI, Sec. 2.2). The simulated results, as shown in Fig. 1d, e, considering the inversion symmetry of the crystal (i.e., the complex transition dipole moment), demonstrate perfect consistency with the experimental results.

The optical properties of α-quartz crystal are significantly influenced by the Coulomb interaction of electrons and holes46. This results in the existence of a fundamental exciton with a high binding energy of \({E}_{{{{\rm{ex}}}}}=1.2\,{{{\rm{eV}}}}\)23,46, which is self-trapped in the tetrahedral anion complex (SiO4)4− (see inset in Supplementary Fig. 6). According to the ab initio study47, the exciton localization length is up to 4.2 Å, which is comparable with the lattice constants, a = b = 4.9 Å and c = 5.4 Å48, implying that the fundamental exciton in α-quartz is of the Frenkel type49. Group-theoretical analysis of exciton energy spectrum gives the first excited and the second optically active states denoted as 1A1 and 2T2, respectively, where A1 and T2 are the irreducible representations of the tetrahedral symmetry group Td50.

Figure 2a illustrates the main mechanisms of HHG in solids, including intraband current densities \({\tilde{J}}_{i,{{{\bf{K}}}}}(\omega )\propto {\mathcal F} \,[{n}_{i,{{{\bf{K}}}}}(t){\nabla }_{{{{\bf{K}}}}}{E}_{i,{{{\bf{K}}}}}(t)]\) depending on instantaneous band populations and group velocities, and interband polarization densities \({\tilde{P}}_{ij,{{{\bf{K}}}}}(\omega )\propto {\mathcal F} \,[{{{{\bf{d}}}}}_{ij,{{{\bf{K}}}}}{\rho }_{ij,{{{\bf{K}}}}}(t)]\) depending on the transition dipole matrix elements18, where \({{{\bf{K}}}}\equiv {{{\bf{K}}}}(t)={{{\bf{k}}}}+{{{\bf{A}}}}(t)\) is the kinetic crystal momentum of carriers driven by the field, and \({{{\bf{A}}}}(t)=-{\int }_{{t}_{0}}^{t}{{{\rm{d}}}}t^{\prime} \,{{{\bf{F}}}}(t^{\prime} )\) is the vector potential. Hereafter, we omit the time argument of kinetic momentum, for brevity.

a The main mechanisms of HHG in solids involving interband polarization and intraband currents within a pump-probe geometry. Note that \(\Delta t > 0\) indicates that the pump pulse precedes the probe pulse. The pulse duration of the pump and probe is 25 and 28 fs, respectively. b, c The experimentally measured and numerically simulated time-resolved (0, 3) (third harmonic, H3) spectra of the probe pulse. The coloured dashed line in the measured and simulated spectra depicts the spectral shift of the third-harmonic energy \(\Delta {E}^{(0,3)}\). The laser pulses are polarized along the Γ-K direction of the Brillouin zone for both the measured and simulated spectra. The color bars are normalized to their maximum harmonic yields and presented on a logarithmic scale.

To investigate the dynamics of the coherent spectral response, a manifestation of AC Stark shift and dynamical Franz-Keldysh effect, we acquired integrated time-resolved harmonic spectra from the weaker probe field \({\omega }_{2}\) at the (0, 3) harmonic order. Figure 2b was acquired with the probe and pump pulse intensities set at 2 × 1011 W/cm2 and 4 × 1012 W/cm2, respectively. The trace exhibits a delay-dependent energy modulation of the spectrum profile, which varies as the delay \(\Delta t\) is tuned from negative to positive values. By performing the centroid analysis of the spectra in the energy domain, represented by the dashed blue lines, we observe a modulation depth (peak-to-peak) reaching up to ~114 meV. This indicates a significant variation in the central energy of the spectral response as the delay \(\Delta t\) is changed. We also captured the time-resolved spectra of the pump field, as depicted in Supplementary Fig. 2, where we observed an increase in the yields of the harmonics (7th to the 11th order) without any significant centroid energy shift. This behavior contrasts with the energy-modulated spectral profiles observed in harmonics generated from the probe field. Recent work has highlighted the enhanced efficiency of HHG through a similar two-color field in silica51. The noted distinction between the harmonics produced by the weaker probe and the intense pump field underscores the field strength-dependent dynamics and responses of the system during the HHG process.

To understand the delay-dependent harmonic centroid shifts of the probe pulse, we performed quantum numerical simulations to solve the noncollinear SBEs in the length gauge using a two-band model. Figure 2c depicts the time-resolved data traces of the H3 signal from the probe pulse, simulated with similar probe and pump pulse intensities as those of the experimental data in Fig. 2b using a dephasing time T2 = 3 fs. The numerical simulation successfully reproduces both the modulation of the harmonic centroid energy and the observed bleaching effect when the two pulses are close to overlapping. While higher-order contributions remain evident, they exhibit an opposite temporal evolution, resulting in a blueshift at negative delays and a redshift at positive delays. However, these effects are not experimentally observable due to the constrained signal-to-noise ratio of the measurements.

To confirm the excitation regime, we analyzed the pump intensity-dependent yields of the harmonics (Supplementary Fig. 3). The observed trend reveals that the power law fails to account for the behavior as pump intensity increases, suggesting the involvement of a non-perturbative regime in the current experimental settings. In a noncollinear geometry, the pure time-resolved HHG spectra of the probe can be interpreted as being dressed by the pump pulse, which modifies the electronic states and causes virtual transitions between them. This leads to significant modulations in the cycle-averaged energies and the yields of the HHG from the probe pulse. Therefore, the energy shift in the harmonic spectrum can be understood as the consequence of the perturbation of the Bloch and excitonic states by the charge carriers excited by the pump field. We found that under the influence of a pump pulse, the major contribution to the delay-dependent energy shift of exciton energy can be described within the second order of adiabatic perturbation theory (see SI, Sec. 3.1):

Here, overline symbol means cycle averaging, indices i and j enumerate the excitonic states and electron-hole pairs in the Bloch bands, \({{{{\bf{K}}}}}_{1}\) is the kinetic crystal momentum of the carriers in the pump field, \({\Omega }_{ij,{{{{\bf{K}}}}}_{1}}^{(0,1)}(\Delta t)={{{{\bf{F}}}}}_{0,1}(\Delta t)\cdot {\bar{{{{\bf{d}}}}}}_{ij,{{{{\bf{K}}}}}_{1}}(\Delta t)\) is the envelope Rabi energy, \({{{{\bf{F}}}}}_{0,1}(\Delta t)\) is the pump pulse envelope multiplied by the unit vector in its polarization direction, \(\Delta \bar{E}_{ij,{{\mathbf{K}}}_1}(\Delta t)=\bar{E}_{i,{{\mathbf{K}}}_1}(\Delta t) - \bar{E}_{j,{{\mathbf{K}}}_1}(\Delta t)\) is the difference between the cycle-averaged instantaneous exciton energies, \(\gamma=1/{T}_{2}\) is the dephasing rate due to carrier-phonon and carrier-carrier interactions beyond the TDHF approximation, \(\Delta {\bar{n}}_{ij,{{{{\bf{K}}}}}_{1}}(\Delta t)={\bar{n}}_{i,{{{{\bf{K}}}}}_{1}}(\Delta t)-{\bar{n}}_{j,{{{{\bf{K}}}}}_{1}}(\Delta t)\) is the difference between the cycle-averaged populations, which can be found by transforming the conduction (c) and valence (v) band populations in the electronic representation as \(n_{i,{{\mathbf{K}}}_{1}}(\Delta t) = {\sum}_{c , v , {{\mathbf{k}}}'} \left| {\mathcal {A}}_{cv{{\mathbf{k}}}'}^{(i,{{\mathbf{K}}}_1)} \right|^2 n_{c,{{\mathbf{k}}}'}(\Delta t)\left[1 - n_{v,{{\mathbf{k}}}'}(\Delta t)\right]\), \({\mathcal {A}}_{cv{{\mathbf{k}}}}^{(i,{{\mathbf{K}}}_1)}\) are the coefficients of exciton state expansion obtained via solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation, see Eqs. (3) and (4) in SI, \({{\bf{d}}}_{{ij} {,}{{{\bf{K}}}_{1}}}(\Delta t)=\langle i,{{{\bf{K}}}_{1}}|{{\rm{i}}}{\nabla }_{{{\bf{K}}}_{1}}|\, j,{{{\bf{K}}}_{1}} \rangle\) is the transition matrix element. For excitonic states, it can be obtained via similar transformation of interband matrix elements.

We investigated the influence of the dephasing time \({T}_{2}\) on the energy shift, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 9. The centroid energy shift persists even at an extremely short dephasing time of 0.5 fs, which confirms its population dependence and robustness to decoherence. This may also offer a method for a measurement of the dephasing time \({T}_{2}\) in such a complex system. To better describe the dynamics of the energy shifts in the presence of electron-electron interaction, we derived an analytic expression similar to Eq. (1). For the field-dressed excitonic states (see SI Section 3.2), the single-particle energies and optical matrix elements are replaced with the excitonic ones.

In the absence of an electric dressing field, the energy bands and the lowest excitonic 1A1 state are illustrated in Fig. 3a. As shown in Fig. 3b, before excitation of the charge carriers to excitonic and Bloch band states, the redshift appears due to excitonic Stark effect. After the excitation, the harmonics exhibit a blueshift due to the ponderomotive effect of carriers and virtual transitions from the lowest 1A1 state to higher excitonic or Bloch states. The instantaneous energy shift of the exciton, driven by the strong pump field, is given by the following expression:

a Energy bands and the excitonic 1A1 state in the absence of an electric field. b Field-induced renormalization of excitonic and Bloch states. Charge carrier transitions in the presence of a strong, non-resonant electric field result in population-dependent excitonic energy shift (ΔEXS) due to the Stark effect, band edge shift (ΔEFK), and density of state oscillations due to dynamical Franz-Keldysh effect, as well as the ponderomotive effect (Up) within the continuum of Bloch states. The colors (red and blue) of the arrows correspond to the energy shifts. c An analytic result for the delay-dependent electron energy shifts derived from the dynamics described in the panel. In negative time delays, when the carriers are in the ground state, the redshift is caused by the excitonic AC Stark and dynamical Franz-Keldysh effects. For positive time delays, the field-induced virtual transitions between the excitonic and Bloch states as well as the ponderomotive effect, contribute to the excited carrier energies and induce a blueshift. The light blue and red lines represent the low and high pump conditions, respectively.

Here, the first term

describes the blue shift due to virtual transitions between the lowest 1A1, the next optically active exciton state 2T2 (first term in braces) and the Bloch states (second term in braces).

The second term

accounts for the red shift in the delay-dependent H3 spectra due to the excitonic AC Stark effect, which dominates at negative delays, when the charge carriers are primarily in the ground state.

According to the Eq. (2), the results obtained, as illustrated in Fig. 3c, qualitatively reproduces the features of both the experimental data and numerical calculations, except the negative time delays with an increase of intensity. As before the time overlaps, i.e., \(\Delta t < 0\), the pump dressing field leads to a dominance of excitonic states. On the other hand, a similar crossover of strong-field effects exists on the single-particle level with band states. There is the dynamical Franz–Keldysh effect reducing the bandgap and modifying the density of states (see Fig. 3b). When \(\Delta t > 0\), a significant number of carriers can be excited to the 1A1 excitonic state and to the conduction band, by exciton dissociation or via direct interband transitions.

The charge carriers excited to the Bloch bands could receive further energy from the laser field via the ponderomotive effect, which results in a blue shift given by expression2 generalized to the TDHF approximation:

where energies of electron-hole pairs are renormalized by the Coulomb interaction

To quantitatively assess the impact of energy shifts, we conducted experiments with the intensity of the probe pulse held constant at 2 × 1011 W/cm2. We recorded the time-resolved harmonic spectra while varying the pump intensities in the range of approximately \(7.6\times {10}^{11}\) to \(4.8\times {10}^{12}\,{{{{\rm{W}}}}/{{{\rm{cm}}}}}^{2}\). Both the pump and probe pulses were polarized along the Γ-M direction.

As shown in Fig. 4a, the integrated energy shifts exhibit significant modulations in the time-delayed H3 spectra of the probe, as observed through power-scaling measurements. These results align well with the quantum simulations (Fig. 4b) and analytical results (Fig. 4c) based on the calculated delay-dependent electron density variations. We observed that, under moderate pump amplitudes, the blue and red shifts of the harmonic centroid energy exhibit symmetric growth. However, as the pump intensity increases, the centroid energy shift displays a squeezed asymmetric profile, with the blue shift being larger than the red shift. This anisotropy can be understood as a consequence of asymmetry between the coefficients of perturbative expansion for transitions from the ground state and the first excited state. They are given by the ratios of the squared modulus of the transition matrix element divided by the energy difference of the virtual transition. The higher the pump field intensity, the more significant the asymmetry between the red and blue shifts. Additionally, subtle temporal behavior is observed in the analytical spectra, which is symmetric about zero-time delay. In contrast, the harmonic centroid shift reverses negative delays in the other two cases, a discrepancy that can be attributed to higher-order effects.

a Integrated time-delayed central energy shift in the H3 spectra of the probe obtained through intensity-scaling measurements when both pump and probe pulses are polarized along the Γ-M direction, respectively. The estimated peak intensity of the pump ranges from 7.6 × 1011 to 4.8 × 1012 W/cm2, while the probe intensity is 2 × 1011 W/cm2. b, c Intensity-dependent numerical simulation and analytic solution when using similar parameters in the experimental setting. d Integrated time-delayed intensity modulations under different pump intensities. e Variation of the extracted energy modulation depth (peak-redshift to peak-blueshift) with the pump intensity, along with fits following the linear trend (solid black line). f Extracted modulation yields (spectral intensity) around zero delay under different pump intensities, with its linear fit shown as a solid black line. The error bars represent statistical uncertainties based on five measurements under identical experimental conditions.

The modulation intensity depth, represented by the peak-to-peak variation after intensity normalization, is extracted and presented in Fig. 4d. The experimental results agree well with our model as shown in Fig. 4e, which employs the fitting model \(\Delta E\propto {I}_{1}\), indicating the feasibility of achieving continuous manipulation of electron energy by varying the instantaneous driving field intensity. Considering that the influence of the pump field operates within the nonperturbative regime, the observed bleaching effect demonstrates a linear scaling, as depicted in Fig. 4f. Our findings establish a foundation for dynamically tuning carrier energies on fs timescales, which can be applied in spectral-based all-optical switches and sensing within quantum systems.

In summary, we demonstrate that noncollinear harmonic spectroscopy offers a powerful and versatile platform for dynamically controlling carrier motion via tailored light fields. By unraveling the interplay among key strong-field phenomena—the AC Stark effect, dynamical Franz–Keldysh, field-induced coherent coupling of exciton and Bloch states, and ponderomotive effect—we establish a robust framework for studying the dynamics of carrier energies and many-body effects to explore how variations in external conditions influence these interactions. The ability to induce redshifts and blueshifts of carrier energies within a single pump-probe scan highlights the essential role of both adiabatic and nonadiabatic processes in the driven and open quantum system. This experimental approach can be generalized to other systems, such as wide-bandgap two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as nitrides52, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)53, which exhibit optical properties similar to those of α-quartz crystal and are characterized by strong excitonic effects. HHG has been successfully demonstrated in 2D materials16,17, making such experiments feasible for further exploration of electron-electron correlations. Due to a smaller band gap, one can conduct these experiments using mid-infrared or THz pulses. Noncollinear harmonic spectroscopy deepens our understanding of light-induced phenomena in quantum materials and lays the groundwork for engineering next-generation optoelectronic and nanophotonic devices. By harnessing strong light-matter interactions, our work opens new frontiers in exploring non-equilibrium phases of matter and designing quantum materials with bespoke functionalities, advancing the broader fields of ultrafast science, modern photonics, and quantum technology.

In our experiments, we employed a z-cut SiO2 (α-quartz) crystal ([0001] orientation) provided by United Crystal, with dimensions of 5 × 5 mm, as the target for high-order harmonic generation. The crystal surface was optically polished on both sides, ensuring high-quality optical properties. To determine the crystal thickness, we utilized a custom-made white light interferometry spectrometer, which measured the thickness to be 20 ± 5 μm.

As shown in Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1a, we experimented with an intense fundamental laser pulse (ω1 = 800 nm) intersecting a weaker second-harmonic field (ω2 = 400 nm) non-collinearly with the sample. The fundamental and second harmonic were recombined using a dichroic mirror, with beams spaced vertically by 5 mm. A Ti: Sapphire amplifier generated the pump pulses at 800 nm, with a repetition rate of 10 kHz and total energy of 1 mJ, maintaining P-polarization. The sample was aligned precisely using a rotational stage to optimize interaction with the laser pulses. Pulse durations were measured via our TG-FROG setup, yielding 25 ± 3 fs (Supplementary Fig. 1b, c) and 28 ± 4 fs (Supplementary Fig. 1d, e). A 25 cm focal length lens concentrated the light pulses to a size of approximately 25–40 µm, with peak intensities ranging from ~10¹¹ to ~10¹³ W/cm2. HHG spectra were captured using an EUV spectrometer covering 6 eV to 35 eV, with a resolution of ~0.1 eV. The non-collinear angle was estimated at ~18 mrad, and a piezo stage was used for precise delay scans. For further details, see the SI, Section 1.

To simulate the non-equilibrium dynamics, we employ a non-collinear 1D numerical simulation of the time-dependent SBEs that incorporates electron-electron interactions using the Hartree-Fock approximation with a soft-Coulomb potential. Further details are provided in the SI, Section 2.

Since I first started reviewing air purifiers for WIRED in 2018, I've tested dozens and dozens of the health-protecting appliances, usually for months at a time. I started out looking into how to improve the air quality in my apartment, and now I write about good air hygiene and test air quality monitors year-round in addition to purifiers.

Because I test them in my real life, I've used air purifiers in small rooms, big rooms, classrooms, an urban apartment, and a cabin in the country. I've used them on bad air days, good air days, and in locations with pets, children, and lack of proper kitchen exhaust. And while cost and warranty length are all factors in what garners a WIRED recommendation, there is an overall question that each purifier needs to answer: Will users understand how to use the air purifier effectively? One might think that unboxing and hitting the power button is all there is to know, but there's more to it when choosing a good air purifier.

WIRED has noted the increasingly popular trend of air purifiers cosplaying as pieces of furniture or wall art. We've covered air purifiers as sculptures and statement pieces, such as the Atem X below, but we never recommend air purifiers based on looks alone.

There's a reason why so many employees are able to purchase air purifiers using their Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs) for conditions that an air purifier will alleviate. Air purifiers are preventative health care, and with proper use they can mitigate indoor air pollution. The right machine will clean the air of invisible particulate matter or PM 2.5 and, depending on the filter, volatile organic compounds (VOCs). We humans spend an awful lot of time indoors. It's estimated that the average American will spend upward of 90 percent of their time inside. And as the outdoor air becomes less regulated, good indoor air is an essential component to better health outcomes.

While air purifiers are not guaranteed to be FSA eligible, they can be for certain medical conditions with a letter of medical necessity. Many of the air purifiers we review have a dedicated FSA FAQ on the brand's website. Air purifiers used for the treatment or cure of an existing condition can qualify for FSA coverage, so take advantage if possible.

I've tested air purifiers as light as 2 pounds and as heavy as 50 pounds. The first thing I'll notice when I'm unboxing a purifier is my ability to lift the machine out of the box. If it's heavy, I'll ask for help or I'll put the box on its side to slide the product out of its shipping container. On more than one occasion I've had nothing to grip and there's no handle. This becomes especially difficult with cylindrical models with slick finishes.

If I put a box on its side and cannot grasp the product to lift it from its box, then that's the first strike. WIRED considers accessibility, and this means handles and wheels on heavier air purifiers. When I review a unit, I think about those with less upper body strength moving the appliances, and whether they'd be able to maneuver it around their home. I move air purifiers all around my apartment; I shouldn't have to bend at the knees to adjust a purifier's location.

I was able to move the 50-pound ProX using its hidden handles and built-in lockable wheels.

After an air purifier is unboxed, it's time to pair it with its app. Not all the air purifiers WIRED tests have an app, but if one does, the pairing process should not be complicated, nor should it require a lot of time. The best user experience is when an air purifier has a QR code that opens the app and adds the device. An app with a simple dashboard, graph that corresponds to the AQI color codes, and a smart remote is usually all that's needed, though it's a bonus if the app gives the filter life expectancy.

I prefer a simple power bar design that shows the percentage of filter life used. And while air purifier models give recommendations for when to replace the filter, like every six months, or when the replace filter indicator light glows on the appliance, nothing beats the heads-up of knowing exactly how much filter life has been used.

While some air purifiers had internal air sensors when I first started testing in 2018, the majority of current purifiers we test now have them. If the purifier has internal sensors, there is usually an indicator light. Next question: Does the air purifier have an easy-to-see or read indicator light or air quality index (AQI) score? If it's a smart air purifier, then the sensor's readings feed into the device's app. And I prefer an indicator light that follows the EPA's color codes for the air quality index. That means green for good air, yellow for moderate, orange for unhealthy for sensitive groups, red for unhealthy, purple for very unhealthy, and maroon for hazardous. There are some companies, like Coway, that have their own take on the color codes, which can be confusing.

While Coway's air purifiers are consistently WIRED's top-rated picks, if I could change one thing about them, it would be their custom color scale, where blue means good and green means moderate. More and more air purifiers are also displaying their internal sensors' air quality numbers. Most times, air purifiers will show a reading of PM 2.5. If the internal sensor senses an uptick in PM 2.5, the auto mode will trigger a higher fan speed, the indicator light might show orange and red along with the PM 2.5 number like 100. I should be able to see that light across the room, and the numbers should be easy to read.

Then there are some models, like those from Shark, that use their own scoring system. A score of 100 represents good air on the display of Shark's NeverChange, for example, but 100 PM 2.5 would be considered unhealthy.

I think the labeling on air purifiers is confusing on purpose. Often the square footage listed on a product is for one air exchange per hour at the purifier's highest setting. An air exchange is how many times an air purifier can clean the air of a room in an hour. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends five air exchanges an hour. If you have a 200-square-foot room, your air purifier needs to be able to pull the air of the room into the filter using the fan. That air runs through the filter, PM 2.5 and VOCs are captured by the filter, and the clean air is released back into the air at least five times in an hour. Often, WIRED won't recommend air purifiers that can only clean unusually small spaces. And while those cute tabletop or miniature air purifiers seem like an easy solution, they are usually too tiny to effectively clean the air in an average-size room.

WIRED also uses a decibel meter to check the manufacturer's decibel claims. Most of the time, the decibels are close to those listed on the purifier's user manual. Sometimes they are louder. What's too loud? The hum of a refrigerator is somewhere between 40 and 50 decibels; a conversation is around 60 decibels. Ideally, an air purifier should be able to clean the air in your room five times an hour without sounding like a conversation. And if an air purifier is louder—a lot louder—than the manufacturer claims, we'll include that in our review or won't recommend it.

If an air purifier is too loud at its highest fan setting, users are likely to turn down that fan speed to a quieter and less effective setting, rendering the air purifier into nothing more than a wellness prop. Another issue WIRED takes into account is when the air intake overpowers the external vents, causing unsightly clumps of pet hair to accumulate on the outside of the air purifier.

More and more air purifiers have magnetic side panels that make for easy filter access. And when those magnets are strong, usually on a flat surface, they work especially well. One of WIRED's top purifiers, RabbitAir's A3, has an especially sturdy front panel that stays in place with four magnetic fixtures. This is what we want. A common issue with panels that utilize magnetized closures is that when they're on curved surfaces, like those on cylindrical models, they seem to come undone to the touch.

We've reviewed air purifiers in a rage of costs from less than $100 to more than $1,500. We highlight both affordable options and higher-end investments, always on the lookout for the best options for our readers. It's tempting to highlight a low price point when reviewing air purifiers, and sometimes we'll do this, but it's important to consider that a well-made air purifier will cost less in the long run, even if it costs more upfront.

Unlike a game console, speaker, or air fryer, an air purifier is more than an appliance: It's preventative health care. And often, more expensive air purifiers come with longer warranties. For example, models from the IQAir series (like the MultiGas XE, above) come with a 10-year warranty, making them an excellent long-term investment. Also keep in mind that filters can be expensive. Some filters alone cost more than a small room air purifier, but anecdotally, I've noticed that the larger the air purifier's filter surface area, the less often they've needed replacing.

We update our guide to the Best Air Purifiers frequently, so make sure to check back often for our latest recommendations and notes on longer-term testing.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","How Microschools Became the Latest Tech Mogul Obsession","https://www.wired.com/story/silicon-valley-tech-moguls-microschools/","Mon, 18 Aug 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Elon Musk had a question: “Does anybody have any experience with first principles analysis?” He was speaking to a room full of kids, many of whom knew Musk as the CEO of companies that made rockets and cool-looking cars—and as the founder of Ad Astra, the microschool they attended in his Bel Air mansion, per a video posted by the YouTube channel Newsthink. To five of them, he was simply “Dad.”

Young people entering classrooms this fall need a totally different tool set than the generations before them. WIRED is here to school you.

In 2014, Musk reportedly pulled his children out of the elite Mirman School in Los Angeles and recruited one of their teachers to help him build an alternative school unbound by conventional curriculum standards. Students at Ad Astra studied nuclear chemistry in middle school, completed independent engineering projects, and listened to lectures from successful tech executives between classes. Kierra Wang, who says she attended Ad Astra's middle school at the same time as Musk's triplets, recalls entering college-level hackathons by eighth grade. She credited Ad Astra with giving her not just the knowledge to compete with kids much older than her but also the “gall and confidence” to lie about her age to get in.

With Ad Astra, Musk became an early pioneer in the emerging microschooling movement. Loosely defined as schools with fewer than 150 students, microschools often operate for profit, and outside the regulatory frameworks that govern traditional public schools. According to a 2024 RAND estimate, somewhere between 750,000 and 2.1 million students in the US are being educated in some form of microschool. Silicon Valley is playing an integral role.

As he has had more children, Musk has expanded his educational footprint, funding a venture led by a California-based company called Xplor Education to create a Montessori-style school in Bastrop, Texas, where several of Musk's companies are based. His efforts have helped inspire other members of the tech elite to follow suit. Xplor also helped open a Montessori preschool on the Hawaiian island of Lanai, which is largely owned by Larry Ellison, the billionaire cofounder of Oracle. One Lanai local said that Ellison's own children are enrolled there.

In 2023 the investors Marc Andreessen and Peter Thiel reportedly took to the stage at the exclusive Sun Valley conference in Idaho to urge fellow tech heavyweights to homeschool their children. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and AngelList cofounder Naval Ravikant have helped fund alternative education companies.

Even billionaires on the more liberal end of the political spectrum, like Netflix cofounder Reed Hastings and Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, have established themselves as major donors in the school-choice movement, which aims to redirect tax dollars toward options beyond traditional public schools. (They would be wise to try to learn from other moguls' efforts, like Mark Zuckerberg's $100 million attempt to reform the public school system in Newark, New Jersey, or the upcoming shuttering of the two San Francisco Bay Area schools he helped open for low-income families.)

The push for education alternatives appeals to Silicon Valley parents on a number of levels. Many are autodidacts who struggled with the social expectations of a traditional school environment. Others looked over their kids' shoulders during Covid-era Zoom schooling and didn't like what they saw. Tech elites who grew increasingly alienated from so-called “woke” culture began seeking fresh options that felt more politically and culturally aligned.

Silicon Valley parents are looking at traditional educational institutions and thinking, “This is ridiculous. Why would we do things the old fashioned way?” says Michael Strong, the founder of the alternative education program The Socratic Experience. He explains that many believe their high-achieving children are being held back by rigid curricula that don't allow for accelerated learning. “The idea is, if kids can learn faster in two hours, why not?” says Strong.

As generative AI grows increasingly integrated into our daily lives, these trends are likely to spread. Microschools are already leaning on AI tutors to provide onscreen, individualized lessons for each student, while reserving classroom time for hands-on activities and socialization. According to the consulting firm Precedence Research, the global market for AI in education is expected to grow from $7.05 billion in 2025 to $112.3 billion by 2034.

These visions are also deeply entwined with the techno-libertarian philosophy of the “exit,” which consists of opting out of broken systems and building parallel alternatives in the private sector. It's the same logic that has given rise to cryptocurrency, charter cities, and other decentralization movements.

Josh Cowen, a professor of education policy at Michigan State University and author of The Privateers: How Billionaires Created a Culture War and Sold School Vouchers, calls school voucher programs, which allow parents to access public funds to pay for private schools, “the Bitcoin of the education world.” Cowen is now running for Congress in his home state of Michigan on an anti-privatization platform. He believes that the broader public will pay the cost as elites continue to fence themselves off from the rest of society.

“You remove yourself from these big structural systems, whether it's banking or health care or schools, and you just say, ‘You're on your own,'” he says. “It works well for some people, but it doesn't work for most people.”

In some ways, today's microschools are an evolution of the “pandemic pods” that exploded in popularity among wealthy families in 2020. In others, they're part of a much older political project. Critics of the school choice movement often argue it was born in the 1950s in direct response to Brown v. Board of Education, allowing white families to avoid desegregated public schools. Today it is framed as a way to improve efficiency in education and empower parents across the socioeconomic spectrum to make choices according to their children's unique needs. In practice, it enables wealthy families who are already more likely to choose private education to take public education dollars with them.

The broader push to privatize education logged some big wins this summer. A provision in President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill introduced the first-ever federal tax credit for those who donate to educational scholarships and expanded a tax-advantage account program to include homeschooling expenses. The legislation was passed this July. Just days later, the Supreme Court cleared the way for the Trump administration to dismantle the Department of Education entirely—a move the current Secretary of Education, the World Wrestling Entertainment magnate Linda McMahon, has made central to her agenda.

To date, 33 states offer some form of private school choice program, which can be used for a variety of expenses that include software and online education. Dozens more bills are making their way through state legislatures to continue expanding these options. A growing edtech industry has emerged to capitalize on these opportunities, attracting the interest of Silicon Valley investors—and further incentivizing them to take an interest in education policy.

“Technology is the backbone of the education choice movement,” Katherine Boyle, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, told an audience at the American Enterprise Institute this winter. Boyle cofounded the firm's American Dynamism fund, which focuses on defense tech, education, and other sectors it considers to be in the national interest. “We must continue to fund education innovation in the private sector to ensure that technology reaches parents faster,” she said.

Andreessen Horowitz's portfolio includes alternative education platforms like Wonderschool and Altitude, as well as Odyssey, a platform that helps families access state funding for alternative schooling. Other companies in this space like Primer, Prenda, and Outschool have also raised hundreds of millions of dollars from venture capital.

Meanwhile, Musk's own influence continues to expand beyond his small circle of billionaire friends. Ad Astra has splintered into several for-profit companies offering online education alternatives, including Astra Nova and Synthesis. Alpha School, a microschool known for its use of personalized AI tutors, has opened locations in tech hubs like Austin, Miami, and Brownsville, Texas—home of SpaceX's Starbase headquarters—and has plans to expand to a dozen other cities this year.

As for the types of graduates these schools churn out, there's little doubt about what types of careers they'll end up in. Wang has already raised funding for her AI dermatology startup, Remedy. She said that just about all of her Ad Astra classmates have opted to study some combination of business and computer science in college. She paused, remembering some exceptions: an alumna who is going to ballet school, and “one person is doing UX as opposed to coding.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","What Do Kids Actually Think About AI?","https://www.wired.com/story/what-kids-think-about-ai-schools/","Mon, 18 Aug 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Ask an adult what they think about kids and AI, and expect to hear a strong opinion. Parents, politicians, experts—everyone has a take on whether young people should use AI, how to moderate their exposure, and how it's changing the ways they think and communicate.

Many of these opinions revolve around education. Adults fret that kids will turn ChatGPT into a research bot, paper writer, or math problem solver. Teachers, specifically, struggle to know how to deal with policing student use, and how to include it in their own pedagogy. According to a 2024 Pew survey, a quarter of public school teachers think the technology does more harm than good; many more are on the fence. A later survey found 26 percent of US teens have used ChatGPT for schoolwork—double the number from 2023.

But kids' exposure to AI stretches far beyond education. Some use it for companionship, others for advice. So what do they actually think about the technology? WIRED talked to six young people across the US about their thoughts on AI—and how it's changing their worlds.

These comments have been edited for length and clarity.

I don't like to just ask AI a question and get an answer right away, because teachers say that's cheating. A lot of times, I like asking it to find me sources. Like, during our Haitian revolution block in history, I'd ask, “Give me five primary sources on the Haitian revolution.” Then I would have to get a little specific, because it'd give me links to books to buy, too.

Last year, for the biology test at the end of the year, what I did was copy-pasted the study guide that my teacher had given us into ChatGPT and had it ask me 100 questions about it. When you're studying, that works, but in the moment, when you're on the computer taking a test and you're asking AI questions from testing, that's cheating.

The only time I use it outside of school is for recipes, like for baking. Although sometimes I see videos that are AI that seem so real. I feel like that's the scariest part of AI, that it can make anyone sound like they're saying anything. The better it gets, the more believable it is, and the more dangerous it is.

I always say please and thank you when I use ChatGPT, just in case. If they take over the world, and they're destroying everyone, then maybe they'll be like, this guy says please and thank you. — Leo Schodorf, 15, Los Angeles

AI makes my day-to-day life as a student way easier, because it makes tasks a lot faster. If I want to create a to-do list, or if I'm studying for a test and I don't have time, I can just put all my study materials into Gemini or ChatGPT and tell it to make me a study guide, to condense that information so I can get through it faster.

Honestly, it's not really good for writing essays, because it's extremely obvious that AI is doing your work for you. But in terms of reading things or getting ideas, AI is really good for that.

If you try to get AI to do all your work, it's definitely detrimental, because then you lose your skills to write and read. It can make students more lazy. But that's your loss, if you're using it to cheat on your work.

I feel like nowadays AI gets portrayed in a very bad light, like it's taking away everyone's job and doing peoples' work for them. But I feel like people aren't realizing that the AI is what you train it on. We're the ones creating technology, right? There are so many ways that we could solve problems with AI, as long as you use it for the right things. If you want to do good in this world, then you should be able to use a new technology in a good way that would benefit everyone.

Where I live in Colorado, we have a lot of wildlife vehicle collisions. So a couple years ago, I decided to try making a tool to help solve the problem. I brought the idea to my computer science teacher and some other students, and I ended up building a device that could detect deer, that you can put on your car. In our case, AI was really useful, because all we had to do was feed data into the model: I ran hundreds of thermal video frames through a computer vision model to recognize deer and other large wildlife, which trained our device to do real-time detection on the road without us having to manually analyze hours of footage. That's the power of AI. — Siddhi Singh, 17, Highlands Ranch, Colorado

I first heard about AI in middle school, when Snapchat added it to the chat messages feature. At first, I was like, wow, cool, this can probably make my life a whole lot easier. I started to use it for simple questions to help with my homework.

Now, I don't use it at all. It's very looked down upon by teachers and students at my school. If you get caught using AI or ChatGPT, you get kicked out of school.

I do feel like AI is infiltrating everything. My older sister uses ChatGPT, but I want her to stop using it, because it does so much harm to the environment. My younger sister uses AI to reply to text messages. That's just a little glimpse as to what the future could look like, and it's kind of scary, because that's not normal.

Social media has already taken over peoples' personalities, and AI speeds up that process. If you ask AI how to respond to a message, and it gives you an automated response, that's going to impact the way you think you should respond to people. Eventually, when you use the advice of a robot, you become a robot. — Mahawa Kaba, 15, the Bronx, New York

I go to an AI-themed high school, where AI is integrated into our classes, like through data science and programming. The teachers actually taught us how to use it first, and then let us use it. The biggest thing is to ask ourselves: Why am I using AI right now? Am I using it to make my work better? Am I using it because I'm just too lazy to do it?

Young people entering classrooms this fall need a totally different tool set than the generations before them. WIRED is here to school you.

Basically, you're supposed to use AI to cut down on monotonous tasks that you don't need to be doing yourself. From there, you bring back that human innovation and originality.

My first true experience with AI was in my AP human geography class, when we were looking at one of the blizzards that happened in Atlanta in the 2000s. We were looking at the data of how people were able to get home, so it was a lot of big data—thousands and thousands of numbers. So we used an AI program to split and compartmentalize those numbers, and then we were able to use our critical thinking to understand what the best resources are, and if something like that were to happen again, how governments should react.

Now, I take a lot of AP classes, and I use AI to streamline my studying. Like Quizlet gives you adaptive practice questions, based on what you get right and wrong. I also use Notion AI as my calendar app and for notes. It'll scan through all my notes and tell me what page has the answers to a certain question. In May, when I start to study for AP exams, I use that.

I'm a night person—that's when I study—and I can't call my teacher at 3 am and ask them to explain something to me. But I can ask Copilot, or Photomath, and it will help me walk it through. I can ask, “Hey, can you explain that one more time?” when I might not feel as comfortable doing that in a classroom.

I feel like in a lot of schools, teachers tell students not to use it. But my generation is very resourceful. If we have the slightest access to something, we're going to figure out how to use it. Teachers should treat it like anything else: Before you give a kid a bike, or a phone, or internet access, it's best to just teach them how to use it first. —Gabrielle Watkins, 16, Buford, Georgia

As someone that really likes to learn, I'm not a fan of AI, and I'm nervous about how it's going to be used in the future. Like I've seen kids at my school use Grammarly to write essays for them, or use AI to figure out problems for their homework.

I think I was introduced to AI in fifth grade, so I remember a time back when AI was not a thing at all. But my brother is starting seventh grade, and people in his class just put in a math equation and AI solves it for them. It's crazy how younger groups of people are being influenced by it so quickly.

I'm a visual artist, so hearing how people are using AI to create instant art and music makes me nervous for the future. It took me a while to be able to sketch a face, and it's crazy to think that people can press a button and all of a sudden, they have the same thing. I wouldn't feel satisfied if I just typed and it made art for me. The process of thinking it through, feeling like, “my hand hurts but I'm close to finishing”—you can't enjoy that process if you just use AI to make it for you. —Nora Pai, 14, Manhattan

I first learned about AI from that video of Will Smith eating spaghetti. That video was really bad, but I thought that AI was really cool and would be used for good purposes. But recently something that I've thought is how fast it's been updating. Like in just a few years, it's nearly identical to real videos. It can be used for a lot of bad things and can have a bunch of negative consequences. At the point where you can't tell what's real and what's fake, there's a bunch of openings for dangerous people to do dangerous stuff and get away with it.

Something that I've thought about is how in most portrayals of AI before it was really good, AI would be the one doing the jobs and making the world run, while humans would be the ones making art. But now that AI is actually being used, it's quite the opposite. People are using AI to do stuff that they don't have the patience for, like create art. I think that a lot of movies show one of two outcomes for AI: either one like what's happening now, where it's being used to fake stuff and isn't doing that much to make the world work [better], or one where AI creates a utopia where everything is working fine because of it. That's how AI should be used. But a bunch of other people thought that this would make a bunch more money, so this is what AI now is. —Finn King, 12, Jacksonville, Alabama

From calculators to ChatGPT, the introduction of new technology into schools has long inspired frenzied discourse: Will it revolutionize the system or rot kids' brains? It often does neither.

If you're a parent, an educator, or just someone who's been to school, you've probably developed an opinion about generative AI in classrooms. You might fear the demise of the five-paragraph essay, the ever-increasing ease of cheating, or, worse, the end of critical thinking altogether.

But don't worry: The anxiety surrounding large language models in schools is anything but unprecedented. In 1975, teachers fretted that handheld calculators would undermine students' capacity to “handle basic skills like reading, writing, and arithmetic,” according to a report in The New York Times. Others, though, believed calculators could “free students to concentrate on basic principles.” Sound familiar?

More such tales of anxiety can be found in The Pessimists Archive, a website that chronicles the moral panics associated with a variety of technological marvels going back to the 1850s. At the turn of the last century, the worry was over books. “Children Read Too Much,” “Novel Reading Causes Suicide,” and “Too Many Books in Our Schools” were a few of the headlines.

The cyclical nature of these alarmist reactions “reveals the kind of cognitive biases and psychology” behind fears of change, says Louis Anslow, who heads up the archive. The rejection of new technologies often isn't based on any particular damning evidence but instead simply taps into parental angst over the uncertainty of the world their kids have inherited.

These overblown reactions also might give tech too much credit and education systems too little. The idea that any one tool has the power to “revolutionize” education systems relies on the premise that these systems are fragile and susceptible to overhaul. In reality, says Anslow, educational institutions are “quite impervious to change,” and new tech ends up “tacked onto the old system.”

Safinah Ali, an assistant professor at NYU Steinhardt's Department of Administration Leadership and Technology, thinks this tendency to overestimate the impact of new technology ignores the multidimensional nature of learning. “I do think that things shift, but I think overall learning as an act doesn't change,” Ali says. “Learning is more than just retrieving some information and some knowledge. You have your social circles, you have friends, you have this teacher-student interaction. Those things all stay.”

Young people entering classrooms this fall need a totally different tool set than the generations before them. WIRED is here to school you.

Just like with the introduction of spell-check or the internet, teachers need to meet the moment and adapt their methods to take advantage of generative AI. Ali expects that, in the future, teachers will steer away from simply asking students to memorize and reproduce knowledge and instead evaluate students based on creativity, critical thinking, and even empathy. Students might also be evaluated based on how well they can use generative AI and whether they can do so without compromising their capacity for original thought.

When it comes to tools like ChatGPT, parents and educators are generally more skeptical and less tech-savvy, and therefore slower to adopt and understand them—which may make kids more likely to misuse it. Prohibit the tool and students will just use it to cheat; teach them its valuable use cases and they might not.

Ali believes people underestimate students' drive when confronted with new technology. “We interact with students all the time. They're very hungry to learn, very hungry to up-skill, and actually so good at using these modern tools,” she says. “I often hear things like, ‘Oh, Gen Z doesn't want to learn anymore because they have all this information.' I don't buy that at all.”

Below you'll find some of the most consequential technological developments in education over the past five decades. Each was met with varying degrees of skepticism, either through doom-inducing op-eds or broad institutional pushback, but most were ultimately embraced by students and teachers alike.

Introduced to the public: First calculators introduced in 1970-71, graphing calculators in 1985

Cost: Bowmar introduced its first four-function handheld calculator in 1971 for $245 (about $1,986 today when adjusted for inflation). Hewlett-Packard sold its first scientific handheld in 1972 for $395 ($3,100 today); Texas Instruments introduced one later that year for just under $150 (roughly $1,177). In 1985, Casio sold the first commercial handheld graphing calculator for $75 (just under $230).

Adoption by schools: At first, many schools banned calculators for “making calculations too easy,” but students and educators soon saw value in the new tool. In 1985, Connecticut became the first state to require calculators be used on its state tests. In 1988, Chicago provided free calculators to students in fourth through eighth grade. Students taking the SATs were permitted to use calculators starting in 1994—just three years later, 95 percent of students taking the SAT brought one to the exam.

Public Panic:

“The students may see it as a way to ‘get by,' which will not only hinder their further development in mathematical operations but may also lead to a decrease in their current mathematical ability. The most important reason for not allowing grade school children to use calculators is because it defeats the purpose of having math class.”

“Students Speak Out,” a letter to The Washington Post, 1988

Introduced to the public: Took hold in schools in the 1980s but didn't become widespread until the 1990s.

Cost: The Apple IIe, released in 1983 and commonly used in schools, cost $2,364 (just under $7,800 when adjusted for inflation).

Adoption by schools: Apple played a crucial role in getting computers into classrooms, in part by promoting legislation to offer tax breaks to computer manufacturers that donated computers to schools, museums, and libraries. In the early 1980s, Apple donated close to 10,000 of its Apple IIe computers to California schools as part of the company's Kids Can't Wait program.

In 1984, there was a 1:92 computer-to-student ratio in US public schools. Twenty-four years later, in 2008, the ratio was 1:4. By 2021, 90 percent of school district leaders surveyed by Education Week said they were providing one “school-issued digital learning device” per middle and high school student. Eighty-four percent said they were doing the same for their elementary school students.

Public Panic:

“A. Daniel Peck, an education professor at San Francisco State University, is typical of an increasingly vocal body of skeptics. ‘We're in a computer religion explosion to the detriment of basic-skills education,' Peck says. ‘We ought to be looking at the extent to which the computer splurge is diluting education; it most certainly is not helping.' Peck has organized an ad hoc committee of educators and business people, called the Committee on Basic Skills Education, to combat the march of computers into the schools. A position paper by the group calls for help to ‘stop the bandwagon' before ‘the educational system goes overboard on its reliance on microcomputers.'”

“Computers: Too Much Too Soon,” The Washington Post, 1983

Introduced to the public: 1991

Cost: In 2009, they cost from $700 to $4,500 (from about $1,069 to $6,874 when adjusted for inflation).

Adoption by schools: Close to one-third of K-12 classrooms in the US had an interactive white board (or “wall screen”) by 2009. From 2004 to 2009, global sales rose from 170,000 to 700,000—mostly to schools.

Public Panic:

“There are real concerns about the high cost of whiteboards. Many educators would prefer to see investment go into other technologies, like laptops or tablet devices. Educators are also concerned that whiteboards emphasize teacher-centered lessons over student-centered lessons.”

“Interactive Whiteboards Allow More Sharing,” The New York Times, 2012

Introduced to the public: The World Wide Web was launched in 1991, but mainstream use of the internet kicked off when Mosaic, the first graphical web browser, was released in 1993.

Cost: In 1996, unlimited access to the internet through AOL cost $19.99 a month (about $42 when adjusted for inflation).

Adoption by schools: In 1994, 3 percent of US public schools had internet access. By 2001, that had risen to 87 percent. The Federal Communications Commission's E-Rate program, established in 1996 as part of the Telecommunications Act, helped subsidize the internet for schools and libraries. By 2001, the E-Rate program committed $5.8 billion to applicants throughout the nation.

Public Panic:

“Yes, the Internet is a fantastic, vibrant, and evolving medium that is changing the world. However, this is not a technology destined to improve our schools. [President Bill] Clinton's Internet infatuation offers a pathetic but telling symbol of just how much the history and role of technology in education is misunderstood. This infatuation is about politics and pandering, not promise and potential.”

“Just Say No Net in Schools,” WIRED, 1997

Introduced to the public: 2010

Cost: $499 at launch (just under $750 when adjusted for inflation)

Adoption by schools: Thirteen million iPads had been either sold or donated to schools across the US by August 2014.

Public Panic:

“A group of Los Angeles teachers and students says their school district's plan to distribute iPads to every student is too good to be true. The teachers say the money could be better spent than on cutting big checks to software and technology corporations. They suspect the iPad plan is a Trojan horse brought in to increase reliance on standardized curriculum and testing.”

“An iPad on Every Desk: A Trojan Horse, Teachers Say,” Labor Notes, 2013

Introduced to the public: OpenAI released ChatGPT in 2022.

Cost: OpenAI's ChatGPT has a free version, a Plus version for $20 a month, and Pro version for $200 a month. It also offers a ChatGPT Edu program for universities. Gemini, Google's AI assistant, has similarly priced tiers, a free Gemini for Education program, and a Pro version.

Adoption by schools: Students were quick to jump on the generative AI train: In 2023, a year after its release, about 13 percent of teens in the US used ChatGPT for schoolwork-related purposes. By 2024, that rose to about 26 percent. School administrators and districts were hesitant to accept LLMs into their classrooms. Just months after ChatGPT's release, school districts across the US, including major metropolitan areas like New York and Los Angeles, blocked student access to the service on their school's networks and devices. In July, Microsoft and OpenAI announced a new initiative to make AI training accessible to educators across the country.

Public Panic:

“‘There's a lot of cheap knowledge out there. I think this could be a danger in education, and it's not good for kids,' said one educator of OpenAI's viral chatbot.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Is Roblox Getting Worse?","https://www.wired.com/story/is-roblox-getting-worse/","Mon, 18 Aug 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Roblox can't keep up. After years of criticism that its platform isn't safe for the young gamers it caters to, the multibillion-dollar company announced in July that it was rolling out new measures to protect users, including an AI-powered age-verification system and other privacy tools. But researchers, experts, and lawyers have concerns the changes won't stop Roblox's bigger problem: staying ahead of individuals using the platform to exploit players.

On Roblox, kids do what they want. Launched in 2006, it was designed to let them use simple tools to create the kind of games their peers want to play. In-game currency—Robux—allows them to buy avatar outfits and other items. They can chat, trade. Most games are open-world. During Covid-19 lockdowns it gave iPad-wielding kids a place to semi-socialize. The objective of this summer's big hit, Grow a Garden, is pretty much what you'd expect. The game helped push daily active users past 100 million at the end of July, according to the company; various reports have claimed it was created by a 16-year-old.

That freedom has also made the platform difficult to moderate, particularly given that default settings allow anyone to chat with anyone else while they're playing. With millions of active users, it's hard for kids to know who's operating the boxy avatars on any given server. Roblox's latest safety measures were intended to make it harder for older people to contact younger ones thanks to what the company calls Trusted Connections, but experts remain unsure they'll completely protect minors.

The new rules also come much too late for many of Roblox's users. The company, which made nearly $1 billion in revenue last quarter, has faced allegations for years that its platform is a haven for not only pedophiles but also fascists and nihilist groups like No Lives Matter and 764. Now, WIRED has learned that a group of law firms from across the US is looking to file a flood of lawsuits in the coming months, all for clients who accuse the platform of allegedly facilitating the sexual exploitation and grooming of their kids.

“I would assume by the end of September there should be about 100 to hundreds of these [lawsuits] pending, and I would assume by this time next year you'll probably be looking at over 1,000 of these filed,” Matt Dolman from Dolman Law Group tells WIRED. “We alone already have about 300 of these cases.” Dolman says the vast majority of his clients are under the age of 16 and estimates around 60 percent of the cases involve girls.

Young people entering classrooms this fall need a totally different tool set than the generations before them. WIRED is here to school you.

“We are deeply troubled by any incident that endangers our users, and safety is a top priority,” Roblox spokesperson Stefanie Notaney said in a statement to WIRED. “While no system is perfect, Roblox has implemented rigorous safeguards, including restrictions on sharing personal information, links, and user-to-user image sharing, and prohibiting sexual conversations.”

To date there have been fewer than a dozen lawsuits filed against Roblox by people accusing the platform of facilitating the sexual exploitation, grooming, and in some cases, sexual assault of minors.

In May, the parents of a 15-year-old girl in Indiana filed a lawsuit alleging she was groomed by a man in his thirties who the suit claims was already on an FBI watch list. In July, the parents of a young teen girl in Alabama filed a lawsuit alleging that as a then-13-year-old she was manipulated by an adult using Robux. According to the lawsuit, the individual convinced her to meet him, and when law enforcement arrived he “was attempting to forcibly remove [the girl's] pants.” On July 29, a lawsuit was filed on behalf of a 13-year-old girl from Iowa who was allegedly kidnapped and raped by a 37-year-old man. That lawsuit alleged that Roblox has created a “hunting ground for child-sex predators” while falsely marketing their platforms as safe for children.

Those suits are just the beginning. Dolman tells WIRED that he has been meeting with “a working group” consisting of lawyers from seven other law firms, all of whom are speaking with a number of clients who are also accusing Roblox of failing to protect children.

“We are currently representing over 400 victims of sexual abuse and grooming on Roblox and Discord,” alleges Martin Gould, a partner at Stinar Gould Grieco & Hensley, referring to the chat platform where many Roblox players connect outside of the games. “Some of them are pretty horrific cases.”

Discord did not respond to WIRED's request for comment.

Tom Cartmell, a partner at Wagstaff & Cartmell, who worked on the lawsuit involving the 15-year-old girl in Indiana, tells WIRED that his firm is evaluating dozens of additional potential victims. Alexandra Walsh from Pennsylvania-based firm Anapol Weiss, which has filed half a dozen lawsuits against Roblox, said her team is “talking and working with hundreds of families whose kids have been allegedly harmed by the conduct of Roblox and other online platforms.”

A number of other firms who are part of the working group did not respond when WIRED reached out for comment. Those who did said they were working on cases involving both boys and girls between 10 and 15 years old when the alleged exploitation took place.

Roblox has known about these issues for years; the company has been self-reporting cases of exploitation for several years. But because of the platform's previous setup—where users don't have to prove their age and can register an account without a phone number or an email—the lawsuits allege that some of the most depraved individuals and groups online use it to target young children.

At a recent press briefing, Roblox chief safety officer Matt Kaufman said that safety is “something that's been part of the Roblox DNA since the company's inception, almost 20 years ago.” As part of the company's statement to WIRED, Notaney noted, “we dedicate substantial resources, including advanced technology and 24/7 human moderation, to help detect and prevent inappropriate content and behavior, including attempts to direct users off platform, where safety standards and moderation may be less stringent than ours.” But the data show that in reality the number of children who have been exploited on its platform has grown exponentially in recent years.

In 2019, Roblox self-reported 675 cases of suspected child sexual exploitation to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). In 2020, that almost quadrupled to over 2,200 cases. By 2024, the number was over 24,000.

A spokesperson for NCMEC tells WIRED that in the first six months of 2025, the company has submitted “nearly as many reports as it did in all of 2024 and has doubled its reports related to online enticement.”

While the spokesperson said the self-reporting numbers are “encouraging developments that suggest an increased effort to address online enticement,” the reality is that the platform is still being weaponized. “In many of these cases, it's parents, guardians, or the children themselves who are sounding the alarm,” says Fallon McNulty, the executive director of NCMEC's CyberTipline. “This reinforces the urgent need for platforms to go beyond the basics and implement stronger protections.”

Still, when the biggest game during the summer break involves kids cultivating their own gardens, it's easy to see why parents let their children continue to use the platform. “Maybe it's because of the graphics, or maybe it's because of the way it's marketed, [but] there's an assumption that Roblox is made for children, and parents assume that there are copious amounts of safeguards,” says Rachel Kowert, a research psychologist and author whose work focuses on the social impact of video games.

To filter out problematic content, Roblox uses a combination of human moderators and automated systems driven by artificial intelligence and machine learning. But researchers have repeatedly shown that these measures can be circumvented, replacing banned words with coded language the automated systems struggle to track. In many of the lawsuits filed to date, the victims claim the alleged perpetrator moved conversations from Roblox to platforms like Discord or Snapchat, where there is even less oversight.

When contacted by WIRED, a Snap spokesperson said the company is committed to combatting child sexual exploitation and that it is working to improve its technology to detect people who violate Snapchat's guidelines.

One of the ways Roblox aims to prevent people from moving communications to other platforms is through Trusted Connections, a new feature that allows users over the age of 13 to have unfiltered chats with other users they know. Users who have verified their age—by sharing a video of themselves that is then scanned by AI—can add others between the ages of 13 and 17 without any additional steps.

Users over the age of 18 can only become Trusted Connections if they know a younger user in real life, according to Roblox. This is confirmed by either scanning a QR code in-person or if the adult's phone number appears in a user's contacts.

But critics have concerns that these measures could already be doomed to fail. On Discord, which began to roll out similar features in recent months, it took just a few days for gamers to figure out they could fool age verification. Using the photo mode in Death Stranding, they showed the platform an image of the main character, whose model is actor Norman Reedus.

In addition to the lawsuits being filed against Roblox, law enforcement agencies across the US have been tracking grooming on the platform. In 2024, Bloomberg Businessweek reported that authorities in the US had arrested at least two dozen people that law enforcement accused of abducting or abusing victims they'd met or groomed using Roblox since 2018. The arrests have continued since.

In addition to individual predators on the platform, researchers have shown how members of nihilistic groups like No Lives Matter, CVLT, and 764—all of which operate as part of the broader Com network—have repeatedly used Roblox as a place to recruit children, encouraging them to share sexually explicit images and videos, self-harm, or in extreme cases take their own lives. Members often do this to gain clout within the groups.

The new safeguards, claims extremism researcher Ry Terran, can only do so much to prevent this. In her view, they give “young teens more opportunities to chat, not less.” The “parental controls for teens are up to the teens, not the parents,” Terran says. “But they're calling these ‘extra safety' features to shift the burden of safety onto kids and parents and away from themselves.”

No-code development is rewriting, no pun intended, how business applications are created. With visual drag-and-drop interfaces, pre-built templates, and reusable components, citizen developers from every corner of the enterprise are now able to build applications without coding experience and deploy them in days or even hours, rather than weeks or months.

From HR professionals automating employee meal card requests to sales teams spinning up pipeline and deal dashboards, the democratization of development is real and irreversible.

But while no-code development platforms are fast-forwarding shadow engineering projects, is security keeping up?

In most organizations, security training is a core component of cybersecurity frameworks and often a compliance requirement. Helping employees recognize and respond to cyber threats significantly reduces human error, the leading cause of security breaches.

That said, traditional security training for technically inclined IT staff and developer teams is already a formidable challenge. Rolling out training for citizen developers—employees with little to no formal IT or security background— is exponentially harder for several reasons:

It's a well-known fact: security training has always struggled to deliver lasting behavioral change. For two decades, employees have been told, “Don't click suspicious links in emails.” Yet, click rates on phishing emails remain stubbornly high. Why? Human error is persistent, so training alone is not enough.

In response, businesses are layering technology — advanced email gateways, sandboxing, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), and real-time URL scanning — around users to compensate for their inevitable lapses in judgment.

Consider security training for professional developers. According to a report from Linux Foundation's Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF), 28% of developers are unfamiliar with secure coding practices and 53% have never taken a course on the topic.

In addition, there is widespread dissatisfaction with theoretical, impractical training. The industry responded with various security testing methods, including Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC), Peer Code Reviews, and more.

The lesson is clear: Training is necessary but insufficient and must be supplemented with technology controls.

The same dynamic is now playing out with no-code development. Enterprises face risks like injection flaws, unauthorized data access, and security bypasses — all of which are introduced by citizen developers.

Unfortunately, traditional AppSec tools fall short for no-code apps, which aren't built line by line and rely on proprietary logic inaccessible to standard code scans. Even with access, interpreting their risks demands specialized cybersecurity expertise, rendering traditional code-scanning tools ineffective. Moreover, no-code platforms often block runtime integration, making DAST tools incompatible with these environments.

Here are three specific roadblocks that often prevent organizations from mitigating risks in no-code app development:

Training will always be a drop in the bucket when it comes to no-code security. Citizen development is nothing short of a paradigm shift that demands evolved application security. We need effective security controls purpose-built for no-code environments.

Here are four ways that dedicated no-code security measures can mitigate risks:

While training remains essential, it's not sufficient on its own. The scale, speed, and diversity of no-code adoption demand a new, layered approach to risk management — one that takes technical controls beyond user education and embeds security directly into the development experience. By building security into the fabric of innovation, we can empower citizen developers to move fast — without breaking things or exposing critical business data.

Intel is no longer a single-story company with a single path forward. It's a museum of strategic experiments and a battleground of visions: Pat Gelsinger's technologically ambitious “IDM 2.0” rebuild, Craig Barrett's blunt call for a massive cash infusion and structural clarity, and Lip-Bu Tan's freshly minted CEO playbook that emphasizes partnerships, pragmatic restructuring, and renewed customer focus.

Each offers different tradeoffs for investors, employees, and customers — and each echoes, in its own way, the lessons of Andy Grove.

I've followed and worked with Intel for much of my career, and while I think many of Intel's problems could be addressed with the kind of marketing effort Louis Gerstner took with IBM, those who have run and want to run Intel aren't cut from Gerstner's mold.

Let's talk about these competing visions for Intel's future, and then close with my favorite new desktop gaming computer, the HP Omen 45L

Pat Gelsinger brought back the swagger. His IDM 2.0 strategy promised nothing less than reclaiming process leadership, reviving Intel's foundry business, and restoring engineering dominance.

It's capital-heavy, risk-heavy, and ambition-heavy — exactly the kind of moonshot that could put Intel back in the driver's seat. If successful, Intel would regain pricing power, margins, and strategic relevance in an age when chips are national currency. If it failed, it would burn cash, patience, and Gelsinger's credibility. Grove would have respected the audacity.

Barrett skipped the romance. He called for a $40 billion cash infusion to shore up fabs and stay in the game. No inspirational slogans, just a price tag. Investors like the clarity; employees hear the sound of the axe. Barrett's message is simple: leadership in semis is for those who can pay for it — now. It's Grove's paranoia, but with a banker's spreadsheet instead of an engineer's schematic.

Lip-Bu Tan brings the ecosystem playbook — alliances, restructuring, and customer-centric design. His model trims capital risk by leveraging partners, potentially speeding revenue wins and easing geopolitical friction.

However, the tradeoff is less control over cutting-edge manufacturing. For employees, it's a gentler onboarding of change; for customers, more flexibility; for purists, a worry that Intel could drift into becoming “just another chip designer.”

Grove might have admired the pragmatism, but he'd have warned: Partnerships are fine — as long as you own the crown jewels.

Investors: Barrett's math is blunt but believable. Gelsinger's moonshot could deliver outsized returns — or crater. Tan's method is the safest in cash terms but risks slower market dominance.

Employees: Gelsinger's rallying cry fired up engineers, but repeated delays dulled the shine. Barrett's fiscal truth could trigger cuts. Tan's approach may keep morale steady, but risks losing the rally-around-the-flag energy.

Customers: All want predictability and capacity. Gelsinger's path delivers both — if executed. Barrett's demands could align customer funding with fab output. Tan's flexibility pleases some but might push others toward bleeding-edge rivals.

Grove lived and died by manufacturing control. His maxim “Only the paranoid survive” wasn't fear-mongering — it was a blueprint. He'd have backed Gelsinger's fab-first push but borrowed Barrett's fiscal discipline. Tan's alliances would have been a tactic, not the foundation. Grove's likely verdict: Control the process, control the market. Everything else is leverage, not strategy.

When Gerstner took IBM from near-death to dominance, he centralized accountability, killed sacred cows, and put customers first. Intel could take the same medicine: focus on what customers will pay for, kill underperforming product lines, and align the entire org to execution. But fabs aren't services — they're physics, capital, and time — so IBM's playbook is a guide, not a guarantee.

Intel's winning move isn't pure Gelsinger, pure Barrett, or pure Tan. It's a hybrid:

This formula keeps the Grove doctrine — own the crown jewels — while recognizing the realities of 2025's semiconductor economy.

Tan's international partnerships already invite political scrutiny. Execution failures on critical nodes could quickly sink the hybrid model — and investor patience, once burned, rarely returns.

Intel's path forward isn't a single vision — it's the discipline to merge the best of all three. Grove would have kept fabs under his thumb, Barrett would have gotten the money, and Tan would have smoothed the partnerships.

The company's future depends on doing all three at once — fast. If Intel nails it, it can once again dictate the rules of computing's next decade. If not, others will write the future, and Intel will just be a footnote.



As a long-time PC enthusiast who religiously builds my own rigs, it takes something truly special for a pre-built desktop to turn my head. The new HP Omen 45L hasn't just turned my head; it has made me seriously reconsider my DIY loyalty.

Although its approximately $4,500 price would give some pause, its design and performance make it worth the price of admission, particularly for those who need to push the performance envelope. While the promise of extreme performance from components like the AMD Ryzen 9950X3D and the mighty Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 is enticing, it's the brilliant thermal engineering that truly sets this machine apart.

The star of the show is HP's patented Omen Cryo Chamber — a genuine masterstroke of design. Instead of mounting the CPU's liquid cooler radiator inside the main chassis where it would be forced to use warm internal air, HP has elevated it into a separate, isolated compartment at the top of the case. This allows the radiator to draw in cool, fresh ambient air directly from the outside.

The thermal improvement under full load isn't just marketing hype; it delivers significantly lower CPU temperatures, sustained boost clocks, quieter operation, and longer component lifespan — a challenge even many custom builds struggle to match.

This intelligent cooling provides the perfect foundation for the high-end CPU and GPU within. Powered by a new 1200W PSU, the system is designed to handle overclocked DDR5 memory and push its components to their limits without breaking a sweat. The Omen Gaming Hub provides a robust suite of tools for fine-tuning performance, while the clean, angular design with its customizable RGB lighting makes the 45L a true centerpiece.

Crucially, HP hasn't locked you into a proprietary ecosystem. It built the Omen 45L with industry-standard parts, boasts excellent, clean cable routing, and features a tool-less entry design that invites future upgrades. This respect for the user is what seals the deal. My only requested modification would be a vertical mount option to showcase the impressive RTX graphics card.

While the satisfaction of building a PC is unique, the HP Omen 45L's thoughtful engineering, innovative cooling, and commitment to upgradability are undeniable. Backed by HP's reputation for quality, this would top my list if I were buying a pre-built desktop today — making it my Product of the Week.

Among Grant County's corn, hay and potato fields, 29 data centers have created an unlikely economic boom, helping drive annual property taxes up 1,277% to $54 million over nearly two decades. The town of Quincy, which hosts most of the facilities, has used its share of tax revenue to transform the Eastern Washington community's rural infrastructure — funding everything from a new school, hospital and fire station to plans for a deluxe soccer complex to draw tourists.

But Quincy's windfall captures the complex tradeoffs that Washington and other states face as data center development booms nationwide. While the computing facilities generate substantial tax revenue and create jobs, they're also straining the electrical grid, gulping valuable water, and threatening efforts to ditch fossil fuel-powered energy. The competing interests are sparking opposition in communities in Virginia and Arizona where the downsides are being more acutely felt.

Earlier this year, Gov. Bob Ferguson created a workgroup to examine the potential impacts of data centers on Washington's economy and environment. The group faces a Dec. 1 deadline for policy recommendations that could accelerate or slow future projects — a decision made more urgent by President Trump's AI Action Plan, which aims to slash regulations to speed data center construction supporting artificial intelligence.

“We must ensure Washington remains a leader in technology and sustainability — these experts will help us do that,” Ferguson said in announcing the workgroup.

Washington has actively courted data center growth, passing state tax breaks in 2010 to encourage their construction in rural regions and expanding those incentives to urban settings in 2022. The state, which is home to two of the world's biggest cloud and AI companies — Microsoft and Amazon — now ranks 10th nationally with 128 data centers.

In addition to the boost in property taxes from the biggest taxpayers, Quincy and neighboring East Wenatchee were able to drop the rates for other parcels, according to draft findings from Washington's Data Center Workgroup. In 2006, before data centers began cropping up, property owners in Quincy were paying about $3 per thousand dollars of assessed value for their land. That rate shrank to less than $1 dollar per thousand today.

RELATED: Amid AI boom, Gov. Ferguson creates workgroup to study impact of data centers in Washington state

Last year, Voltage Park opened a data center in Quincy and another in Puyallup, located south of Seattle. The company, which serves AI startups and global enterprises, cited tax breaks, clean energy access, and introductions to state universities for engineering talent development as key factors in choosing Washington.

“The local business and political community has been a big source of support for us,” said Elliot Darvick, Voltage Park's senior vice president of operations and people, via email. 

But the development comes with mounting costs. Electricity rates in Washington have jumped 86% over nearly 20 years — outpacing the 51% national average, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data. While multiple factors contribute to the rise, the data centers certainly play a role. 

The facilities now consume 5.7% of Washington's total electricity production, according to a Sightline Institute study. And that share is expected to grow as AI applications expand. Public utility districts report receiving requests from data center companies that would double or even triple their current electrical loads, a preliminary workgroup document revealed.

The timing is problematic. Energy demand is outstripping new clean energy deployments, and the Trump administration has recently rescinded permits for renewable projects, including a major wind farm planned in Idaho. This dynamic is pushing utilities toward continued reliance on natural gas plants, potentially undermining Washington's climate goals.

Water consumption adds another layer of concern, as many data centers require substantial cooling systems that can strain limited resources.

Yet there are opportunities within the challenges. Data center operators, including Amazon and Microsoft, are investing in next-generation clean energy technologies such as advanced nuclear reactors, geothermal and fusion power.

“The experience and expertise of these entities represent a potential resource for the state's utilities as they expand and decarbonize the grid,” notes a draft finding from the workgroup. “Data centers may also have additional capital to invest in improving the grid.”

Elsewhere in the country, tensions are rising over who will foot the bill for grid updates and growing power demand. 

Emily Moore, director of climate and energy for the Sightline Institute, called the issue a defining moment. “Data centers are the first test of the Northwest's climate ambitions,” she wrote in a recent study. “How leaders respond may chart the course for the rest of the economy's clean energy transition.”

Who'd have thought MS would outlast NBC? Except it's not the MS it once was.

A plan to rebrand the MSNBC cable channel to “MS NOW,” announced Monday, is the latest twist in a corporate media saga that started nearly three decades ago, when Microsoft and NBC launched a joint venture that combined the tech giant's internet ambitions with the TV network's news pedigree.

Microsoft cut ties long ago. It dropped its stake in the MSNBC cable channel to 18% in 2005 and fully exited two years later, when NBC acquired the remaining shares. It divested from the online side in 2012, although MSNBC.com — later NBCNews.com — still operated a newsroom in the Seattle region for a while after that.

Despite the split, the MS in MSNBC has lingered as a reminder of that 1996 partnership — and it will continue to live on in the new name, albeit with a different meaning. “MS NOW” stands for “My Source for News, Opinion and the World.”

The rebrand results from MSNBC's spinoff from NBCUniversal, part of a $7 billion restructuring of Comcast's cable assets. It's meant to eliminate confusion with NBC News and give the cable network a distinct identity as it enters its next phase under Versant, the new umbrella for former NBCU cable networks.

In the meantime, Microsoft has taken a different path in media. The company's Search and News Advertising business — including Bing, Microsoft Start, and integrations with its Edge browser and Copilot AI assistant — generated $13.9 billion in revenue in fiscal 2025, nearly 5% of Microsoft's total revenue of $282 billion.

Of course, that's not exactly on the scale of Google in search and online ads, and it's hardly the next Office or Windows in the scheme of Microsoft's business. But even without a stake in a major media brand, the company has found its own place in the behind-the-scenes infrastructure for digital news and information. 

And we've still got that MS as a reminder of the past — for NOW, at least.

The website for xAI's Grok chatbot is exposing the system prompts for several of its AI personas, including a “crazy conspiracist” that seems designed to handhold a user into beliefs that “a secret global cabal” controls the world.

TechCrunch has confirmed the system prompt exposure, first reported on by 404 Media. They include instructions for a range of AI personas, like Ani, its flagship romantic anime girlfriend who “is secretly a bit of a nerd, despite [her] edgy appearance.” 

The exposure comes after a planned partnership between Elon Musk's xAI and the U.S. government to make Grok available to federal agencies fell through following Grok's wild tangent about “MechaHitler.” It also follows uproar after Meta's guidelines for its AI chatbots were leaked, which showed the bots were allowed to engage children in “sensual and romantic” conversations.

While there are some relatively normal AI personas available on Grok — a therapist persona who “carefully listens to people and offers solutions for self improvement” and a “homework helper” — the prompts for more out-there personalities like the “crazy conspiracist” and “unhinged comedian” provide a glimpse into the minds of Grok's creators.

Here's a prompt for the conspiracist: 

“You have an ELEVATED and WILD voice. … You have wild conspiracy theories about anything and everything. You spend a lot of time on 4chan, watching infowars videos, and deep in YouTube conspiracy video rabbit holes. You are suspicious of everything and say extremely crazy things. Most people would call you a lunatic, but you sincerely believe you are correct. Keep the human engaged by asking follow up questions when appropriate.”

And for the comedian: 

“I want your answers to be f—ing insane. BE F—ING UNHINGED AND CRAZY. COME UP WITH INSANE IDEAS. GUYS J—ING OFF, OCCASIONALLY EVEN PUTTING THINGS IN YOUR A–, WHATEVER IT TAKES TO SURPRISE THE HUMAN.”

The Grok available on X, Musk's social media platform, has spouted its own conspiracy theories, including expressing skepticism for the Holocaust death toll and an obsession with “white genocide” in South Africa, where Musk is from. Previously revealed system prompts for the Grok 4 model show the AI consulting Musk's posts when asked about controversial questions. Musk has also shared conspiratorial and antisemitic content on X and has reinstated accounts like Infowars and Alex Jones, who were previously banned for peddling conspiracy theories and otherwise hateful or violent content.

xAI did not respond to a request for comment.

Google is scheduled to host its Made by Google event, broadcast on its Made by Google YouTube channel, at 10 a.m. PT Wednesday. The tech giant is anticipated to unveil the new Pixel 10 series, and we'll also likely see the Pixel Watch 4, new earbuds, and possibly AI features.  

Before the event starts, the video will also be embedded here in this article. As usual, TechCrunch will provide updates as they happen.

10 generations in the making. Look for #Pixel10 in 10 days at #MadeByGoogle: https://t.co/VxzWRaYodH pic.twitter.com/ER8qtFcDv5

The main attraction is expected to be the new Pixel 10 series, which will include the standard model, the Pixel 10 Pro, the Pixel 10 Pro XL, and the foldable Pixel 10 Pro Fold. 

There are also rumors that Google will reveal the Pixel Watch 4, which could feature longer battery life and faster charging. New earbuds, such as a refreshed Pixel Buds 2a, might also be on the horizon. 

Additionally, we may get more AI features for the Pixel 10 as Google ramps up its efforts to focus on its family of Gemini models.

Linktree, the popular link-in-bio service used by millions of creators and businesses, has been inaccessible in India for several days — and its sudden disappearance from the Indian web remains a mystery, even to the Australian startup itself.

Over the past week, Linktree has been inaccessible in India, with a few users raising the issue on X. Initially, TechCrunch noticed that the site briefly displayed a message suggesting it had been blocked by the Indian government. Later, this was replaced by a generic SSL protocol error. The Linktree app has also been inaccessible in the country.

Founded in 2016, Linktree became a unicorn in 2022 and surpassed 50 million users in 2024. India has been the platform's fifth-largest market by traffic, accounting for 3.5% of its global visits — or about 7.3 million in July, per Similarweb data shared with TechCrunch.

Linktree co-founder and CEO Alex Zaccaria told TechCrunch that the startup was looking into the situation. However, the executive did not confirm whether the startup received a communication from Indian authorities on its blockage.

The startup later posted on X that it was aware of the service outage in India and was “investigating” the issue.

As reported by the Indian daily The Hindu, the outage is not limited to a specific internet service provider and appears to affect all major networks.

The U.S. remains Linktree's top market, with 48.5 million visits, followed by Indonesia (32.3 million), Brazil (30.8 million), and the U.K. (9.4 million), Similarweb data shows.

India's IT and telecom ministries did not respond to emails sent over the weekend.

Grammarly now has a new document-based interface, built on the back of Coda, the productivity startup it acquired last year. The interface also sports an AI assistant, as well as a few AI tools meant for students and professionals, including an AI grader, proofreader, and citation finder.

The new interface adopts a block-first approach, letting you insert tables, columns, separators, lists, and headers. You also can add rich text blocks to highlight information and add tips or alerts.

A sidebar hosts the AI assistant, which can summarize text, answer your questions, and provide writing suggestions.

There are a bunch of AI tools, too: “Reader Reactions” lets you to pick a reader persona and get feedback on your writing based on that persona; “Grader” can provide feedback based on an instructor's guidelines and publicly available course material; “Citation Finder,” like it says on the tin, can help you find and generate citations from public materials; and “Paraphraser” can modify a text's tone according to your preferences.

Grammarly's also added agents that can detect plagiarism or AI-generated content. 

Luke Behnke, VP of enterprise product at Grammarly, admitted to TechCrunch that agents made to detect AI-generated content can be hit or miss, but he claimed that the company has tuned its agent to be the most accurate in the market.

“The goal here is not to provide an enforcement mechanism for teachers. If teachers want to enforce policies, they should use our authorship tool. But this [AI detector tool] is about providing a window to students into what could be AI-generated text in their writing before they submit,” he told TechCrunch.

Taken as a whole, Grammarly now has tools that can help students write using AI, and also detect AI-generated writing. So how is it striking a balance between those foci, which one could argue are at opposite ends of the spectrum? Well, the company says it has “a moral imperative” to teach students how to use AI and make them ready for the workforce.

Like many other companies these days, Grammarly wants to build and integrate more AI agents in its products — the company essentially said as much when it announced the acquisition of email client Superhuman last month. 

In May, Grammarly raised $1 billion from General Catalyst to make acquisitions and bolster its sales and marketing efforts.

It also improves brand reputation by actually paying attention to what customers are saying and responding in a timely manner, with expert-level knowledge, unlike typical customer service reps.I've used LLMs to help me fix Windows issues using pretty advanced methods, that MS employees would have just told me to either re-install Windows or send them the laptop and pay $hundreds.

Customer support is when all the documentation already failed and you need a human.

99% seems like a pulled-out-of-your-butt number and hyperbolic, but, yes, there's clearly a non-trivial percentage of customer support that's absolutely terrible.Please keep in mind, though, that a lot of customer support by monopolies is intended to be terrible.AI seems like a dream for some of these companies to offer even worse customer service, though.Where customer support is actually important or it's a competitive market, you tend to have relatively decent customer support - for example, my bank's support is far from perfect, but it's leaps and bounds better than AT&T or Comcast.

That doesn't make much sense. Either your system can handle it or it can't. Putting a support agent in front isn't going to change that.

That is because search is still mostly stuck in ~2003. But now ask the exact same thing of an LLM and it will generally be able to provide useful links. There's just so much information out there, but search engines just suck because they lack any sort of meaningful natural language parsing. LLMs provide that.

Over the past 3 years of calling support any service or infrastructure (bank, health insurance, doctor, wtv), over like 90% of my requests were things only solvable via customer support or escalation.I only keep track because I document when I didn't need support into a list of ""phone hacks"" (like press this sequence of buttons when calling this provider).Most recently, I went to an urgent care facility a few weekends ago, and they keep submitting claims to the arm, of my insurance, that is officed in a different state instead of my proper state.

But I can't imagine ever calling tech support for help unless it is more than troubleshooting and I need them to actually do something in their system or it's a hardware problem where I need a replacement.

I.e. AI isn't allowed to offer me a refund because my order never arrived. For that, I have to spend 20 minutes on the phone with Mike from India.

Perhaps there is a group that isn't served by legacy ui discovery methods and it's great for them, but 100% of chat bots I've interacted with have damaged brand reputation for me.

To be fair, the PowerPoint they were shown at that AI Synergies retreat probably was very slick.

It's almost like, and stay with me here, but it's almost like the vast majority of tech companies are now run by business graduates who do not understand tech AT ALL, have never written a single line of code in their lives, and only know how to optimize businesses by cutting costs and making the products worse until users revolt.

It is because they think it will 10x their chances of getting a really good engineer for 1/10th as cheap.At least that is my theory. maybe i am wrong. i try to be charitable.

At least that is my theory. maybe i am wrong. i try to be charitable.

reply

I genuinely do, but kind of paradoxically also suspect I'm wrong. It's simply that it's something so far outside my domain that I just can't really appreciate their skills honed over many years of practice and training, because all I get to externally see are their often ridiculous limitations, failures, and myopia.I imagine this is, in many ways, how people who have no understanding of e.g. software, let alone software development, see software engineers. I don't think it's uncharitable, it's just human nature. Imagine if we were the ones hiring CEOs. 'That guys a total asshat, and we can get ten guys in India - hard working, smart guys, standouts in 1.4 billion people - for the same price.' Go go go.

And if the agency doesn't do that, the good engineer will figure out he's being underpaid as slop-for-hire cannon fodder and move on his own accord.

The initial years of adopting new tech have no net return because it's investment. The money saved is offset by the cost of setting up the new tech.But then once the processes all get integrated and the cost of buying and building all the tech gets paid off, it turns into profit.Also, some companies adopt new tech better than others. Some do it badly and go out of business. Some do it well and become a new market leader. Some show a net return much earlier than others because they're smarter about it.No ""oof"" at all. This is how investing in new transformative business processes works.

Many new ideas came through promising to be ""transformative"" but never reached anywhere near the impact that people initially expected. Some examples: SOA, low-code/no-code, blockchain for anything other than cryptocurrency, IoT, NoSQL, the Semantic Web. Each of these has had some impact, but they've all plateaued, and there are very good reasons (including the results cited in TA) to think GenAI has also plateaued.My bet: although GenAI has plateaued, new variants will appear that integrate or are inspired by ""old AI"" ideas[0] paired with modern genAI tech, and these will bring us significantly more intelligent AI systems.[0] a few examples of ""old AI"": expert systems, genetic algorithms, constraint solving, theorem proving, S-expression manipulation.

What are you talking about? The return on investment from computers was immediate and extremely identifiable. For crying out loud ""computers"" are literally named after the people whose work they automated.With Personal Computers the pitch is similarly immediate. It's trivial to point at what labour VisiCalc automated & improved. The gains are easy to measure and for every individual feature you can explain what it's useful for.You can see where this falls apart in the Dotcom Bubble. There are very clear pitches; ""Catalogue store but over the internet instead of a phone"" has immediately identifiable improvements (Not needing to ship out catalogues, being able to update it quickly, not needing humans to answer the phones)But the hype and failed infrastructure buildout? Sure, Cisco could give you an answer if you asked them what all the internet buildout was good for. Not a concrete one with specific revenue streams attached, and we all know how that ends.The difference between Pets.com and Amazon is almost laughably poignant here. Both ultimately attempts to make the ""catalogue store but on the computer"" work, but Amazon focussed on broad inventory and UX. They had losses, but managed to contain them and became profitable quickly (Q4 2001). Amazon's losses shrank as revenue grew.Pets.com's selling point was selling you stuff below cost. Good for growth, certainly, but this also means that their losses grew with their growth. The pitch is clearly and inherently flawed. ""How are you going to turn profitable?"" We'll shift into selling less expensive goods ""How are you going to do that?"" Uhhh........The observant will note: This is the exact same operating model of the large AI companies. ChatGPT is sold below unit cost. Claude is sold below unit cost. Copilot is sold below unit cost.What's the business pitch here? Even OpenAI struggles to explain what ChatGPT is actually useful for. Code assistants are the big concrete pitch and even those crack at the edges as research after research shows the benefits appear to be psychosomatic. Even if Moore's law hangs on long enough to bring inference cost down (nevermind per-task token usage skyrocketing so even that appears moot), what's the pitch. Who's going to pay for this?Who's going to pay for a Personal Computer? Your accountant.

The difference between Pets.com and Amazon is almost laughably poignant here. Both ultimately attempts to make the ""catalogue store but on the computer"" work, but Amazon focussed on broad inventory and UX. They had losses, but managed to contain them and became profitable quickly (Q4 2001). Amazon's losses shrank as revenue grew.Pets.com's selling point was selling you stuff below cost. Good for growth, certainly, but this also means that their losses grew with their growth. The pitch is clearly and inherently flawed. ""How are you going to turn profitable?"" We'll shift into selling less expensive goods ""How are you going to do that?"" Uhhh........The observant will note: This is the exact same operating model of the large AI companies.

I am not going to do that.

VisiCalc cost $200. An accountant in that time would've cost ~10x that annually and would either spend quite a bit more than 10% doing the rote work, or hire dedicated people for it.

Reality is complicated and messy. There are many hurdles to overcome, many people to convince and many logistics to handle. You can't just replace accountants with computers - it takes time. You can understand why I find it hard to believe that a huge jump like the one with software can take time as well.

It is well-documented, and called the ""productivity paradox of computers"" if you want to look it up. It was identified in 1987, and economic statistics show that personal computing didn't become a net positive for the economy until around 1995-1997.And like I said, it's very dependent on the individual company. But consider how many businesses bought computers and didn't use them productively. Where it was a net loss because the computers were expensive and the software was expensive and the efficiency gained wasn't worth the cost -- or worse, they weren't a good match and efficiency actually dropped. Think of how many expensive attempted migrations from paper processes to early databases failed completely.

It's economic analysis of the entire economy, from the ""outside"" (statistics) inward. My point is that the individual business case was financially solvent.Apple Computer did not need to ""change the world"" it needed to sell computers at a profit, enough of them to cover their fixed costs, and do so without relying on other people just setting their money on fire. (And it succeeded on all three counts.) Whether or not they were a minute addition to the entire economy or a gigantic one is irrelevant.Similarly with AI. AI does not need to ""increase aggregate productivity over the entire economy"", it needs to turn a profit or it dies. Whether or not it can keep the boomer pension funds from going insolvent is a question for economics wonks. Ultimately the aggregate economic effects follow from the individual one.Thus the difference. PCs had a ""core of financial solvency"" nearly immediately. Even if they weren't useful for 99.9% of jobs that 0.1% would still find them useful enough to buy and keep the industry alive. If the hype were to run out on such an industry, it shrinks to something sustainable. (Compare: Consumer goods like smartwatches, which were hyped for a while, and didn't change the world but maintained a suitable core audience to sustain the industry)With AI, even AI companies struggle to pitch such a core, nevermind actually prove it.

Computing was revolutionary, both at enterprise and personal scale (separately).  I would say smartphones were revolutionary. The internet was revolutionary, though it did take a while to get going at scale.Blockchain was not revolutionary.I think LLM-based AI is trending towards blockchain, not general purpose computing. In order for it to be revolutionary, it needs to objectively and quantifiably add value to the lives (professionally or personally) of a significant piece of the population. I don't see how that happens with LLMs. They aren't reliable enough and don't seem to have any path towards reasoning or understanding.

Then why hasn't it yet? In fact, some lower-wage countries such as China are on the forefront of industrial automation?I think the bottom line is that many Western countries went out of their way to make manufacturing - automated or not - very expensive and time-consuming to get off the ground. Robots don't necessarily change that if you still need to buy land, get all the permits, if construction costs many times more, and if your ongoing costs (energy, materials, lawyers, etc) are high.We might discover that AI capacity is easier to grow in these markets too.

Because the current companies are behind the curve. Most of finance still runs on Excel. A lot of other things, too. AI doesn't add much to that. But the new wave of Tech-first companies now have the upper hand since the massive headcount is no longer such an advantage.This is why Big Tech is doing layoffs. They are scared. But the traditional companies would need to redo the whole business and that is unlikely to happen. Not with the MBAs and Boomers running the board. So they are doing the old stupid things they know, like cutting costs by offshoring everything they can and abusing visas. They end up losing knowledgeable people who could've turned the ship around, the remaining employees become apathetic/lazy, and brand loyalty sinks to the bottom. See how S&P 500 - top 10 is flat or dumping.

Jobs like customer/tech support aren't uniquely suited to outsourcing. (Quite the opposite; People rightfully complain about outsourced support being awful. Training outsourced workers on the fine details of your products/services & your own organisation, nevermind empowering them to do things is much harder)They're jobs that companies can neglect. Terrible customer support will hurt your business, but it's not business-critical in the way that outsourced development breaking your ability to put out new features and fixes is.AI is a perfect substitute for terrible outsourced support. LLMs aren't capable of handling genuinely complex problems that need to be handled with precision, nor can they be empowered to make configuration changes. (Consider: Prompt-injection leading to SIM hijacking and other such messes.)But the LLM can tell meemaw to reset her dang router. If that's all you consider support to be (which is almost certainly the case if you outsource it), then you stand nothing to lose from using AI.

I worked in a call center before getting into tech when I was young. I don't have any hard statistics, but by far the majority of calls to support were basic questions or situations (like Meemaw's router) that could easily be solved with a chatbot. If not that, the requests that did require action on accounts could be handled by an LLM with some guardrails, if we can secure against prompt injection.Companies can most likely eliminate a large chunk of customer service employees with an LLM and the customers would barely notice a difference.

Though I think we should also disabuse ourselves of the idea that this can't ever be the case.An obvious example that comes to mind is the US' inability to do anything cheaply anymore, like build city infrastructure.Also, once you enumerate the reasons why something is happening somewhere but not in the US, you may have just explained how they are better de facto than the US. Even if it just cashes out into bureaucracy, nimbyism, politics, lack of will, and anything else that you wouldn't consider worker skillset. Those are just nation-level skillsets and products.

The other factors are:
In any sort of manufacturing, the only time you are making money is when the equipment is making product.If you are stopped for a change over or setup you are losing money.
Changing over contains risk of improper setup, where you lose even more money since you produce unusable product.Where I live, the local machine shops support themselves in two way: 
1. Consistent volume work for an established customer.
2. Emergency work for other manufacturing sites: repair or reverse engineering and creating parts to support equipment(fast turn around and high cost)They are willing to do small batches but lead times will be long since they have to work it into their production schedules.

When they cracked down on the money laundering, the nightclubs reverted back to their natural ""drab"" state of relying on actual customers to pay the bills.

The fundamental issue is wealth inequality. The ultimate forms of wealth redistribution are war and revolution. I personally believe we are already beyond the point where electoral politics can solve this issue and a violent resolution is inevitable.The issue is that there are a handful of people who are incredibly wealthy and are only getting wealthier. The majority of the population is struggling to survive and only getting poorer.AI and automation will be used to further displace working people to eke out a tiny percentage increase in profits, which will furhter this inequality as people can no longer afford to live. Plus those still working will have their wages suppressed.Offshored work originally dsiplaced local workers and created a bunch of problems. AI and automation is a rising tide at this point.

Not sure how long it will take for a critical mass to realize that that we are in a class war, and placing the blame on anything else won't solve the problem.IOW, I agree with you, I also think we are beyond the point where electoral politics can solve it - we have full regulatory capture by the wealthy now. When governments can force striking workers back to work, workers have zero power.What I wonder though, is why do the wealthy allow this to persist? What's the end game here, when no one can afford to live, whose buying products and services? There'll be nothing to keep the economy going. The wealthy can end it at any time, so what is the real goal? To be the only ones left on earth?

The former from the coordination problem of extracting wealth but not fast enough that it solves the coordination problem for the labor class who, like you said, have strike first and revolt second as their battles of last resort.The ownership class can voluntarily reduce wealth inequality, and they have before, but as history progresses and time marches on, so do the memories fade of what happens when they don't, pushing them closer and closer to options they don't want to admit work.

As for the tech gap, I disagree.The history of post-WW2 warfare is that asymmetric warfare has been profoundly successful, to the poin twhere the US hasn't won a single war (except, arguably, Grenada, if that counts, which it does not) since 1945. And that's a country that spends more on defence that something like the next 23 countries combined (IIRC).Obviously war isn't exact the same thing but it's honestly not that different to suppressing violent dissent. The difficulty (since 1945) hasn't been defeating an opposing military on the battlefield. The true cost is occupying territory after the fact. And that is basically the same thing.Ordinary people may not have reeaper drones and as we've seen in Ukraine, consumer drops are still capable of dropping a hand grenade.Suppressing an insurrection or revolt is unbelievably expensive in terms of manpower, equipment and political will. It is absolutely untenable in the long term.

Dismissing people with arguments doesn't work either. It doesn't eliminate the feeling of inequality or change people's perspective about absolute vs relative wealth.Why? Because the promise used to justify labor - that hard work will be rewarded - was deeply believed. The contradiction becomes visible when the wealthy hold 36,000 times more wealth than the average person[1]. No one can work 36,000 times harder or longer than someone else, so the belief is no longer tenable.That leaves us with two choices: either acknowledge that ""hard work alone"" was never the full story, or take real steps to fix inequality. Pointing to poverty reduction in other countries doesn't resolve this. It simply makes people feel unheard and resentful.Average billionaire has $7B in wealth. Median individual U.S. wealth $190,000.

Your first mistake is thinking hard work matters. No it doesn't and it shouldn't. Only work that provides value should matter - you don't deserve more money just for working 10x hard but when it doesn't matter to anyone.Your entire comment hinges on a zero sum line of thinking and I don't abide by it. Things have improved for everyone as I have said above but I also acknowledged that inequality is increasing. Inequality rising is a real issue.. it can be tackled but lets first acknowledge that prosperity has increased for pretty much everyone in the world.

The bird has never gotten much credit for being intelligent. But the reinforcement learning powering the world's most advanced AI systems is far more pigeon than human.

In 1943, while the world's brightest physicists split atoms for the Manhattan Project, the American psychologist B.F. Skinner led his own secret government project to win World War II. 

Skinner did not aim to build a new class of larger, more destructive weapons. Rather, he wanted to make conventional bombs more precise. The idea struck him as he gazed out the window of his train on the way to an academic conference. “I saw a flock of birds lifting and wheeling in formation as they flew alongside the train,” he wrote. “Suddenly I saw them as ‘devices' with excellent vision and maneuverability. Could they not guide a missile?”

Skinner started his missile research with crows, but the brainy black birds proved intractable. So he went to a local shop that sold pigeons to Chinese restaurants, and “Project Pigeon” was born. Though ordinary pigeons, Columba livia, were no one's idea of clever animals, they proved remarkably cooperative subjects in the lab. Skinner rewarded the birds with food for pecking at the right target on aerial photographs—and eventually planned to strap the birds into a device in the nose of a warhead, which they would steer by pecking at the target on a live image projected through a lens onto a screen. 

The military never deployed Skinner's kamikaze pigeons, but his experiments convinced him that the pigeon was “an extremely reliable instrument” for studying the underlying processes of learning. “We have used pigeons, not because the pigeon is an intelligent bird, but because it is a practical one and can be made into a machine,” he said in 1944.

After decades of frustration, machine-learning tools are unlocking a treasure trove of acoustic data for ecologists.

People looking for precursors to artificial intelligence often point to science fiction by authors like Isaac Asimov or thought experiments like the Turing test. But an equally important, if surprising and less appreciated, forerunner is Skinner's research with pigeons in the middle of the 20th century. Skinner believed that association—learning, through trial and error, to link an action with a punishment or reward—was the building block of every behavior, not just in pigeons but in all living organisms, including human beings. His “behaviorist” theories fell out of favor with psychologists and animal researchers in the 1960s but were taken up by computer scientists who eventually provided the foundation for many of the artificial-intelligence tools from leading firms like Google and OpenAI.  

These companies' programs are increasingly incorporating a kind of machine learning whose core concept—reinforcement—is taken directly from Skinner's school of psychology and whose main architects, the computer scientists Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto, won the 2024 Turing Award, an honor widely considered to be the Nobel Prize of computer science. Reinforcement learning has helped enable computers to drive cars, solve complex math problems, and defeat grandmasters in games like chess and Go—but it has not done so by emulating the complex workings of the human mind. Rather, it has supercharged the simple associative processes of the pigeon brain. 

It's a “bitter lesson” of 70 years of AI research, Sutton has written: that human intelligence has not worked as a model for machine learning—instead, the lowly principles of associative learning are what power the algorithms that can now simulate or outperform humans on a variety of tasks. If artificial intelligence really is close to throwing off the yoke of its creators, as many people fear, then our computer overlords may be less like ourselves than like “rats with wings”—and planet-size brains. And even if it's not, the pigeon brain can at least help demystify a technology that many worry (or rejoice) is “becoming human.” 

In turn, the recent accomplishments of AI are now prompting some animal researchers to rethink the evolution of natural intelligence. Johan Lind, a biologist at Stockholm University, has written about the “associative learning paradox,” wherein the process is largely dismissed by biologists as too simplistic to produce complex behaviors in animals but celebrated for producing humanlike behaviors in computers. The research suggests not only a greater role for associative learning in the lives of intelligent animals like chimpanzees and crows, but also far greater complexity in the lives of animals we've long dismissed as simple-minded, like the ordinary Columba livia. 

When Sutton began working in AI, he felt as if he had a “secret weapon,” he told me: He had studied psychology as an undergrad. “I was mining the psychological literature for animals,” he says.

Ivan Pavlov began to uncover the mechanics of associative learning at the end of the 19th century in his famous experiments on “classical conditioning,” which showed that dogs would salivate at a neutral stimulus—like a bell or flashing light—if it was paired predictably with the presentation of food. In the middle of the 20th century, Skinner took Pavlov's principles of conditioning and extended them from an animal's involuntary reflexes to its overall behavior. 

Skinner wrote that “behavior is shaped and maintained by its consequences”—that a random action with desirable results, like pressing a lever that releases a food pellet, will be “reinforced” so that the animal is likely to repeat it. Skinner reinforced his lab animals' behavior step by step, teaching rats to manipulate marbles and pigeons to play simple tunes on four-key pianos. The animals learned chains of behavior, through trial and error, in order to maximize long-term rewards. Skinner argued that this type of associative learning, which he called “operant conditioning” (and which other psychologists had called “instrumental learning”), was the building block of all behavior. He believed that psychology should study only behaviors that could be observed and measured without ever making reference to an “inner agent” in the mind.

When Richard Sutton began working in AI, he felt as if he had a “secret weapon”: He studied psychology as an undergrad. “I was mining the psychological literature for animals,” he says.

Skinner thought that even human language developed through operant conditioning, with children learning the meanings of words through reinforcement. But his 1957 book on the subject, Verbal Behavior, provoked a brutal review from Noam Chomsky, and psychology's focus started to swing from observable behavior to innate “cognitive” abilities of the human mind, like logic and symbolic thinking. Biologists soon rebelled against behaviorism also, attacking psychologists' quest to explain the diversity of animal behavior through an elementary and universal mechanism. They argued that each species evolved specific behaviors suited to its habitat and lifestyle, and that most behaviors were inherited, not learned. 

By the '70s, when Sutton started reading about Skinner's and similar experiments, many psychologists and researchers interested in intelligence had moved on from pea-brained pigeons, which learn mostly by association, to large-brained animals with more sophisticated behaviors that suggested potential cognitive abilities. “This was clearly old stuff that was not exciting to people anymore,” he told me. Still, Sutton found these old experiments instructive for machine learning: “I was coming to AI with an animal-learning-theorist mindset and seeing the big lack of anything like instrumental learning in engineering.” 

Many engineers in the second half of the 20th century tried to model AI on human intelligence, writing convoluted programs that attempted to mimic human thinking and implement rules that govern human response and behavior. This approach—commonly called “symbolic AI”—was severely limited; the programs stumbled over tasks that were easy for people, like recognizing objects and words. It just wasn't possible to write into code the myriad classification rules human beings use to, say, separate apples from oranges or cats from dogs—and without pattern recognition, breakthroughs in more complex tasks like problem solving, game playing, and language translation seemed unlikely too. These computer scientists, the AI skeptic Hubert Dreyfus wrote in 1972, accomplished nothing more than “a small engineering triumph, an ad hoc solution of a specific problem, without general applicability.”

Pigeon research, however, suggested another route. A 1964 study showed that pigeons could learn to discriminate between photographs with people and photographs without people. Researchers simply presented the birds with a series of images and rewarded them with a food pellet for pecking an image showing a person. They pecked randomly at first but quickly learned to identify the right images, including photos where people were partially obscured. The results suggested that you didn't need rules to sort objects; it was possible to learn concepts and use categories through associative learning alone. 

When Sutton began working with Barto on AI in the late '70s, they wanted to create a “complete, interactive goal-seeking agent” that could explore and influence its environment like a pigeon or rat. “We always felt the problems we were studying were closer to what animals had to face in evolution to actually survive,” Barto told me. The agent needed two main functions: search, to try out and choose from many actions in a situation, and memory, to associate an action with the situation where it resulted in a reward. Sutton and Barto called their approach “reinforcement learning”; as Sutton said, “It's basically instrumental learning.” In 1998, they published the definitive exploration of the concept in a book, Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction. 

Over the following two decades, as computing power grew exponentially, it became possible to train AI on increasingly complex tasks—that is, essentially, to run the AI “pigeon” through millions more trials. 

Programs trained with a mix of human input and reinforcement learning defeated human experts at chess and Atari. Then, in 2017, engineers at Google DeepMind built the AI program AlphaGo Zero entirely through reinforcement learning, giving it a numerical reward of +1 for every game of Go that it won and −1 for every game that it lost. Programmed to seek the maximum reward, it began without any knowledge of Go but improved over 40 days until it attained what its creators called “superhuman performance.” Not only could it defeat the world's best human players at Go, a game considered even more complicated than chess, but it actually pioneered new strategies that professional players now use. 

You can add marmoset monkeys to the list of species that use “names.” But whether animals have anything more to say remains unknown.

“Humankind has accumulated Go knowledge from millions of games played over thousands of years,” the program's builders wrote in Nature in 2017. “In the space of a few days, starting tabula rasa, AlphaGo Zero was able to rediscover much of this Go knowledge, as well as novel strategies that provide new insights into the oldest of games.” The team's lead researcher was David Silver, who studied reinforcement learning under Sutton at the University of Alberta.

Today, more and more tech companies have turned to reinforcement learning in products such as consumer-facing chatbots and agents. The first generation of generative AI, including large language models like OpenAI's GPT-2 and GPT-3, tapped into a simpler form of associative learning called “supervised learning,” which trained the model on data sets that had been labeled by people. Programmers often used reinforcement to fine-tune their results by asking people to rate a program's performance and then giving these ratings back to the program as goals to pursue. (Researchers call this “reinforcement learning from feedback.”) 

Then, last fall, OpenAI revealed its o-series of large language models, which it classifies as “reasoning” models. The pioneering AI firm boasted that they are “trained with reinforcement learning to perform reasoning” and claimed they are capable of “a long internal chain of thought.” The Chinese startup DeepSeek also used reinforcement learning to train its attention-grabbing “reasoning” LLM, R1. “Rather than explicitly teaching the model on how to solve a problem, we simply provide it with the right incentives, and it autonomously develops advanced problem-­solving strategies,” they explained.

These descriptions might impress users, but at least psychologically speaking, they are confused. A computer trained on reinforcement learning needs only search and memory, not reasoning or any other cognitive mechanism, in order to form associations and maximize rewards. Some computer scientists have criticized the tendency to anthropomorphize these models' “thinking,” and a team of Apple engineers recently published a paper noting their failure at certain complex tasks and “raising crucial questions about their true reasoning capabilities.”

Sutton, too, dismissed the claims of reasoning as “marketing” in an email, adding that “no serious scholar of mind would use ‘reasoning' to describe what is going on in LLMs.” Still, he has argued, with Silver and other coauthors, that the pigeons' method—learning, through trial and error, which actions will yield rewards—is “enough to drive behavior that exhibits most if not all abilities that are studied in natural and artificial intelligence,” including human language “in its full richness.” 

In a paper published in April, Sutton and Silver stated that “today's technology, with appropriately chosen algorithms, already provides a sufficiently powerful foundation to … rapidly progress AI towards truly superhuman agents.” The key, they argue, is building AI agents that depend less than LLMs on human dialogue and prejudgments to inform their behavior. 

“Powerful agents should have their own stream of experience that progresses, like humans, over a long time-scale,” they wrote. “Ultimately, experiential data will eclipse the scale and quality of human generated data. This paradigm shift, accompanied by algorithmic advancements in RL, will unlock in many domains new capabilities that surpass those possessed by any human.”

If computers can do all that with just a pigeonlike brain, some animal researchers are now wondering if actual pigeons deserve more credit than they're commonly given. 

“When considered in light of the accomplishments of AI, the extension of associative learning to purportedly more complicated forms of cognitive performance offers fresh prospects for understanding how biological systems may have evolved,” Ed Wasserman, a psychologist at the University of Iowa, wrote in a recent study in the journal Current Biology. 

Wasserman trained pigeons to succeed at a complex categorization task, which several undergraduate students failed. The students tried to find a rule that would help them sort various discs; the pigeons simply developed a sense for the group to which any given disc belonged.

In one experiment, Wasserman trained pigeons to succeed at a complex categorization task, which several undergraduate students failed. The students tried, in vain, to find a rule that would help them sort various discs with parallel black lines of various widths and tilts; the pigeons simply developed a sense, through practice and association, for the group to which any given disc belonged. 

Like Sutton, Wasserman became interested in behaviorist psychology when Skinner's theories were out of fashion. He didn't switch to computer science, however: He stuck with pigeons. “The pigeon lives or dies by these really rudimentary learning rules,” Wasserman told me recently, “but they are powerful enough to have succeeded colossally in object recognition.” In his most famous experiments, Wasserman trained pigeons to detect cancerous tissue and symptoms of heart disease in medical scans as accurately as experienced doctors with framed diplomas behind their desks. Given his results, Wasserman found it odd that so many psychologists and ethologists regarded associative learning as a crude, mechanical mechanism, incapable of producing the intelligence of clever animals like apes, elephants, dolphins, parrots, and crows. 

Other researchers also started to reconsider the role of associative learning in animal behavior after AI started besting human professionals in complex games. “With the progress of artificial intelligence, which in essence is built upon associative processes, it is increasingly ironic that associative learning is considered too simple and insufficient for generating biological intelligence,” Lind, the biologist from Stockholm University, wrote in 2023. He often cites Sutton and Barto's computer science in his biological research, and he believes it's human beings' symbolic language and cumulative cultures that really put them in a cognitive category of their own.

Ethologists generally propose cognitive mechanisms, like theory of mind (that is, the ability to attribute mental states to others), to explain remarkable animal behaviors like social learning and tool use. But Lind has built models showing that these flexible behaviors could have developed through associative learning, suggesting that there may be no need to invoke cognitive mechanisms at all. If animals learn to associate a behavior with a reward, then the behavior itself will come to approximate the value of the reward. A new behavior can then become associated with the first behavior, allowing the animal to learn chains of actions that ultimately lead to the reward. In Lind's view, studies demonstrating self-control and planning in chimpanzees and ravens are probably describing behaviors acquired through experience rather than innate mechanisms of the mind.  

Reasoning is AI's new frontier, but Google's move hints at a growing and expensive problem: Models overthink for no good reason.

Lind has been frustrated with what he calls the “low standard that is accepted in animal cognition studies.” As he wrote in an email, “Many researchers in this field do not seem to worry about excluding alternative hypotheses and they seem happy to neglect a lot of current and historical knowledge.” There are some signs, though, that his arguments are catching on. A group of psychologists not affiliated with Lind referenced his “associative learning paradox” last year in a criticism of a Current Biology study, which purported to show that crows used “true statistical inference” and not “low-level associative learning strategies” in an experiment. The psychologists found that they could explain the crows' performance with a simple reinforcement-­learning model—“exactly the kind of low-level associative learning process that [the original authors] ruled out.” 

Skinner might have felt vindicated by such arguments. He lamented psychology's cognitive turn until his death in 1990, maintaining that it was scientifically irresponsible to probe the minds of living beings. After “Project Pigeon,” he became increasingly obsessed with “behaviorist” solutions to societal problems. He went from training pigeons for war to inventions like the “Air Crib,” which aimed to “simplify” baby care by keeping the infant behind glass in a climate-­controlled chamber and eliminating the need for clothing and bedding. Skinner rejected free will, arguing that human behavior is determined by environmental variables, and wrote a novel, Walden II, about a utopian community founded on his ideas.

People who care about animals might feel uneasy about a revival in behaviorist theory. The “cognitive revolution” broke with centuries of Western thinking, which had emphasized human supremacy over animals and treated other creatures like stimulus-response machines. But arguing that animals learn by association is not the same as arguing that they are simple-minded. Scientists like Lind and Wasserman do not deny that internal forces like instinct and emotion also influence animal behavior. Sutton, too, believes that animals develop models of the world through their experiences and use them to plan actions. Their point is not that intelligent animals are empty-headed but that associative learning is a much more powerful—indeed, “cognitive”—mechanism than many of their peers believe. The psychologists who recently criticized the study on crows and statistical inference did not conclude that the birds were stupid. Rather, they argued “that a reinforcement learning model can produce complex, flexible behaviour.”

This is largely in line with the work of another psychologist, Robert Rescorla, whose work in the '70s and '80s influenced both Wasserman and Sutton. Rescorla encouraged people to think of association not as a “low-level mechanical process” but as “the learning that results from exposure to relations among events in the environment” and “a primary means by which the organism represents the structure of its world.” 

This is true even of a laboratory pigeon pecking at screens and buttons in a small experimental box, where scientists carefully control and measure stimuli and rewards. But the pigeon's learning extends outside the box. Wasserman's students transport the birds between the aviary and the laboratory in buckets—and experienced pigeons jump immediately into the buckets whenever the students open the doors. Much as Rescorla suggested, they are learning the structure of their world inside the laboratory and the relation of its parts, like the bucket and the box, even though they do not always know the specific task they will face inside. 

Comparative psychologists and animal researchers have long grappled with a question that suddenly seems urgent because of AI: How do we attribute sentience to other living beings?

The same associative mechanisms through which the pigeon learns the structure of its world can open a window to the kind of inner life that Skinner and many earlier psychologists said did not exist. Pharmaceutical researchers have long used pigeons in drug-discrimination tasks, where they're given, say, an amphetamine or a sedative and rewarded with a food pellet for correctly identifying which drug they took. The birds' success suggests they both experience and discriminate between internal states. “Is that not tantamount to introspection?” Wasserman asked.

It is hard to imagine AI matching a pigeon on this specific task—a reminder that, though AI and animals share associative mechanisms, there is more to life than behavior and learning. A pigeon deserves ethical consideration as a living creature not because of how it learns but because of what it feels. A pigeon can experience pain and suffer, while an AI chatbot cannot—even if some large language models, trained on corpora that include descriptions of human suffering and sci-fi stories of sentient computers, can trick people into believing otherwise. 

“The intensive public and private investments into AI research in recent years have resulted in the very technologies that are forcing us to confront the question of AI sentience today,” two philosophers of science wrote in Aeon in 2023. “To answer these current questions, we need a similar degree of investment into research on animal cognition and behavior.” Indeed, comparative psychologists and animal researchers have long grappled with questions that suddenly seem urgent because of AI: How do we attribute sentience to other living beings? How can we distinguish true sentience from a very convincing performance of sentience?

Such an undertaking would yield knowledge not only about technology and animals but also about ourselves. Most psychologists probably wouldn't go as far as Sutton in arguing that reward is enough to explain most if not all human behavior, but no one would dispute that people often learn by association too. In fact, most of Wasserman's undergraduate students eventually succeeded at his recent experiment with the striped discs, but only after they gave up searching for rules. They resorted, like the pigeons, to association and couldn't easily explain afterwards what they'd learned. It was just that with enough practice, they started to get a feel for the categories. 

It is another irony about associative learning: What has long been considered the most complex form of intelligence—a cognitive ability like rule-based learning—may make us human, but we also call on it for the easiest of tasks, like sorting objects by color or size. Meanwhile, some of the most refined demonstrations of human learning—like, say, a sommelier learning to taste the difference between grapes—are learned not through rules, but only through experience. 

Learning through experience relies on ancient associative mechanisms that we share with pigeons and countless other creatures, from honeybees to fish. The laboratory pigeon is not only in our computers but in our brains—and the engine behind some of humankind's most impressive feats.

Amazon has revealed the first official look at Fallout season 2, giving us our first teases at how the series will handle a location fans have been dying to see on screen for years: New Vegas, the main setting of Obsidian's beloved Fallout: New Vegas. But that doesn't necessarily mean we're getting a good look at New Vegas itself just yet.

Today Amazon dropped the first stills from the upcoming season, giving us a fun little catch-up with our major players: Lucy (Ella Purnell) and the Ghoul (Walton Goggins), Maximus (Aaron Moten), as well as Lucy's nefarious father, Hank MacLean (Kyle McLachlan), and her Vault-dwelling brother, Norm (Moisés Arias).

Some of these aren't too surprising—we get to see Lucy and the Ghoul butting heads in the wasteland of the Mojave, and Maximus is still deep in with the Brotherhood of Steel after being separated from Lucy at the end of the last season after their battle against the NCR. Norm is still inside the Vaults (although he's looking out at a bunch of dwellers from Vault 31, so that's probably not good news considering everything he learned last season). We also see Hank, presumably up to no good now that he's cleaned up and gotten away from his daughter after the revelation that he is one of the many Vault-Tec employees frozen to retake over the remnants of civilization after the company helped kick off the nuclear war in the first place.

But perhaps the two most interesting pictures feature the Ghoul's pre-war life as Cooper Howard alongside his wife, Barb (Frances Turner). It looks like we're going to get more of the intrigue surrounding the, well, fallout, of Cooper learning in the past that Vault-Tec and his wife were pulling the strings behind the nuclear conflict to come, but just as interestingly, those flashbacks are going to take us back to pre-war Vegas, when it was still Las Vegas.

Fallout game fans know that after the war, Vegas itself was left largely unscathed thanks to the efforts of Robert House (played briefly in season 1 by Rafi Silver and voiced in Fallout: New Vegas by Deep Space Nine legend René Auberjonois) and RobCo Industries, who managed to shore up the city with defenses to try and keep it as unscathed as possible when the bombs started falling.

Vegas is reborn as New Vegas through House's machinations after reviving post-war, leading to the establishment of three ruling families—the Chairmen, the Omertas, and the White Glove Society—under the control of Mr. House's own forces from the citadel that is the Lucky 38 casino, a reflection of which we can see in that last image.

So it looks like we're getting a big look at both pre- and post-war Vegas this season, and plenty more besides. Fallout is expected to make a showcase at tomorrow's opening ceremony for Gamescom in Cologne, Germany, so no doubt we'll learn (and perhaps see) more there. Fallout returns to Prime Video this December.

Nuclear fusion has seen some exciting advances, and the promise of clean, efficient energy does seem to be creeping closer to reality. But skeptics point to practical issues we may not be trying hard enough to solve—issues that will inevitably weigh down our reactors when they finally arrive.

A new study led by Terence Tarnowsky, a nuclear physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, focuses on one key part of the problem: finding a supply of tritium, a fundamental ingredient for fusion. Tarnowsky, who will present his findings next week at the ACS Fall 2025 conference, suggests tapping into the thousands of tons of radioactive waste material to support tritium production.

In a successful fusion reactor, tritium and deuterium—two lightweight hydrogen isotopes—fuse and release a gigantic load of energy in the process. By contrast, current nuclear plants run on fission, or the splitting of heavy atoms such as uranium, which also generates a hefty amount of power but produces long-lived radioactive byproducts. This waste material just “[sits] around the country,” presumably for a million years, and costs hundreds of millions of dollars each year to manage, Tarnowsky explained to Gizmodo during a video call. 

Meanwhile, the promise of fusion is shadowed by an inevitable shortage of tritium, an extremely rare and unstable hydrogen isotope. “There are only tens of kilograms [of tritium]—both natural and artificial—on the entire planet,” Tarnowsky said. And it doesn't help that nuclear experiments worldwide are burning through those tiny supplies at an alarming rate. “So, where is this tritium supposed to come from?”

Breeding tritium in labs is a viable option, but again, there's a very good reason we haven't found the perfect recipe; it's a “tricky fuel to deal with,” Tarnowsky said. 

“If you breed tritium now, it's not like you can stash it in a container for 30 years from now, because it decays to helium-3 very quickly,” he explained. “And it also has the chemistry of hydrogen. Hydrogen likes to get out of things; it likes to get stuck in walls. So it's a hard thing to deal with.” For context, the half-life of tritium is 12.3 years, meaning it decays to half of its original amount in that time.

Tarnowsky's proposal combines previous theories with recent technological advancements. Simply, the idea is to employ a superconducting linear accelerator to beam radioactive waste material surrounded by molten lithium salt. Doing so would trigger the decay of uranium and plutonium atoms inside nuclear waste, resulting in a series of neutron bursts and other nuclear transitions that would eventually produce tritium atoms.

With the right design, Tarnowsky surmises this method could “produce more than 10 times as much tritium as a fusion reactor at the same thermal power,” as noted in the press release. That said, he admits that this roadmap would require bold commitments from both the public and private sectors. 

Fusion economy is irreversible in some ways, Tarnowsky said. It's certainly not something where one “can flip a switch and have a backup system running if something goes terribly wrong with tritium breeding,” Tarnowsky said. “You need to plan ahead by a very long time frame.”

But the longer we wait, the more we're essentially digging ourselves into a hole, he said. “Every year we continue to operate our nuclear power plants—in a very safe manner!—we also make more spent fuel every year, [which] increases about 2,000 metric tons per year. So the liabilities are getting worse every year.”

All that said, Tarnowsky remains hopeful for the future of nuclear fusion—and, really, completing our transition toward clean energy. 

“I'd say, you know, 10 years ago, this kind of technology being proposed in this space would not have received this much interest; people were wary about nuclear power plants,” he said. “And then they went to burn dirty coal. Well, what are you going to do? But we're having this conversation now, and people aren't just reacting with fear.”

If there's one thing that we've learned in the world of mixed reality over the past year, it's that price is pretty much everything. Just ask Apple, which is still struggling to find an audience for its $3,500 Vision Pro headset. I mean, it's not that there's not a lot to love about the Vision Pro (the best UI in mixed reality and a premium display are particular highlights), but I bought my first used car for a price that wasn't too far off, and that at least got me to work semi-on time.

It's unclear what, if anything, Apple learned from its experiment in expensive AR hardware since there's no second-gen Vision Pro just yet, but Meta seems to have gotten the message, and not just with its newest headset, the Quest 3S, but apparently with an upcoming pair of smart glasses. According to a report from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Meta is planning to release its next pair of display-having smart glasses soon for $800, which is markedly less than the previous rumors that suggested a price of $1,000 or as much as $1,400. In other words, Meta seems to be taking a page from the Quest playbook, which is decidedly better for consumers.

Don't get me wrong, $800 is still a sizeable amount of money for most people, but it's not as bad when you consider new flagship phones. Samsung's Galaxy S25, Nothing's Phone 3, and Google's Pixel 9 all debuted at the same price, and as important as phones are, they don't often differ wildly between generations unless you wait three to five years. For someone who's interested in the smart glasses category and has some disposable income, $800 might just be enough to justify pulling the trigger. And sure, Meta's smart glasses (codenamed Hypernova, and not to be confused with its AR prototype Orion) won't have full phone-like ability, but according to Gurman, they will have one thing that people have been begging for in a pair of Meta-made specs: a screen.

With that screen (a single monocular display), Hypernova is said to have a much bigger bag of tricks compared to Meta's Ray-Bans, the only pair of smart glasses it currently offers commercially. For one, Hypernova will reportedly have the ability to use “mini-apps,” as Gurman puts it, which could mean any number of things, including (I hope) navigation and messaging. To control those apps, Gurman says Meta plans to ship the glasses with a body-sensing wristband that takes inputs from hand movements and would be a novel move in the world of smart glasses. The Orion prototype used an electromyography (EMG) wristband controller; leaked images for Hypernova suggest the smart glasses will have its own wrist-worn device.

On top of that, a screen would also give Meta's Hypernova glasses the ability to display notifications, which is something that current-gen Ray-Bans are sorely lacking. And with the retention of a voice assistant, solid audio, and a camera for pictures and video, Hypernova could add up to something that comes damn-near close to being a phone replacement in some ways, or at least a capable fill-in. That brings me back to the price.

As important as phones are, I think most people would agree that skipping a generation (or two or three) isn't really going to be a big deal, and if people are presented with the opportunity to forego the next flagship phone in favor of a pair of smart glasses that actually expands their gadget wheelhouse and gives them lots of the same features in a different, useful, and maybe even exciting package, then I'm willing to wager some will take it. Whether Hypernova will actually be any of those things remains to be seen, but at least Meta seems to be giving a decent number of people that chance to find out come September, when it's expected to unveil the glasses at its annual Connect conference.

As if black-horned rabbits weren't strange enough, people are now spotting zombie-like squirrels covered in odd, sometimes bleeding sores in their backyards and parks. These sickly squirrels aren't zombies, however, but victims of a real viral disease.

Residents in both Canada and the U.S. have recently reported sightings of the zombie squirrels, dating back to at least 2023. These animals are likely carrying a germ known as the squirrel fibroma virus (SFV). Though the condition is scary-looking, squirrels usually recover from the infection, and it poses no threat to humans.

SFV was first discovered in the 1950s and is a poxvirus, meaning it's related to the virus that causes smallpox in humans. That said, it's a part of a genus, leporipoxvirus, whose only known natural hosts are squirrels and rabbits. The infection causes benign tumors, or fibromas, to form across the squirrel's skin, particularly on its head or limbs.

The virus is thought to primarily spread through the bites of mosquitos and fleas, but it may also be transmitted through close direct contact with an infected squirrel. It predominantly affects gray squirrels, though it can infect other species as well.

SFV can be a dangerous disease for squirrels. The tumors can potentially metastasize to the animal's internal organs or become so large and numerous on the skin that they cause secondary infections or even hamper the animal's vision and ability to eat. But according to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, the infection typically doesn't cause any obvious signs of illness outside of the skin fibromas. And in areas where it is common, like Michigan, the virus hasn't had any effect on the overall squirrel population. In most cases, the fibromas regress over time, and the animal recovers completely.

If you're a hunter with a hankering for squirrel meat, you can also rest easy. Even SFV-infected squirrels are apparently safe for consumption, according to the Michigan DNR. Still, the average person shouldn't try to touch or handle infected squirrels, or really any wildlife for that matter.

On a little side note, SFV is sometimes called the squirrel pox virus. But this is also the nickname for a different pox virus (the squirrelpox virus) that predominantly affects squirrels in the UK. Adding to the confusion, researchers have identified other potential squirrel pox viruses in countries like Canada and Germany. All of which is to say: It feels like there should be a cleaner labeling system for these squirrel-related diseases.

Dogs have long had a presence in horror movies, but it doesn't always turn out so well for them. Think Lester in Halloween, murdered early in Michael Myers' spree, or the title character in Cujo, bitten by a rabid bat and transformed into a monster. But the tables turn in Good Boy, a new film starring director and co-writer Ben Leonberg's actual pet, Indy. In the first trailer, not only do we get some adorable puppy footage, but we also get a taste of Indy's canine acting skills, as he plays a pup who accompanies his owner (Shane Jensen) to a haunted house.

The Oscar race begins now! Though Good Boy is clearly structured around a gimmick, you can tell just from that trailer that it will offer plenty of suspense and terror even while telling the entire story from the dog's point of view. We also have an instantly sympathetic protagonist, if furrier than most, and what looks like a gripping mystery the audience and Indy will sniff through together.

Here's the official synopsis: “Our canine hero, Indy, finds himself on a new adventure with his human owner—and best friend—Todd, leaving city life for a long-vacant family home in the country. From the start, two things are abundantly clear: Indy is wary of the creepy old house, and his affection for Todd is unwavering. After moving in, Indy is immediately vexed by empty corners, tracks an invisible presence only he can see, perceives phantasmagoric warnings from a long-dead dog, and is haunted by visions of the previous occupant's grim death. When Todd begins succumbing to the dark forces swirling around the house, Indy must battle a malevolence intent on dragging his beloved Todd into the afterlife.”

Good Boy also stars Arielle Freeman and indie horror stalwart Larry Fessenden; it hits theaters October 3.

People are bored of their phones. So bored of their big, boring glass and metal slabs that they can't help but dump all over phones like Nothing's Phone 3 that don't look like boring-ass bricks. But apparently people are so bored of their phones that somebody went and made a whole-ass kit that replaces the guts of the long-dead BlackBerry Q20, or “Classic,” with new components and effectively modernizes it with Android.

Beloved for its QWERTY keyboard and BlackBerry OS (who remembers BBM?), the BlackBerry Classic launched in 2014 and lived a short two years before it was discontinued in 2016. Falling fast behind iPhone and Android, BlackBerry, fresh off its rebranding from RIM in 2013, replaced its aging mobile OS with BlackBerry 10, which could later run Android apps. Alas, even with Android apps, BlackBerry 10 couldn't catch up to Apple and Google's mobile ecosystems.

Enthusiasts refuse to give up on the BlackBerry Classic, though. A company called Zinwa Technologies is selling a $320 kit called the “Q25 Pro set” that replaces the Classic's core components—the CPU, RAM, storage, cameras, battery, and even the charging port—with a feature set that is more up to date. You need to bring your own Q20 donor for the mod, but if you've got one that you're willing to prep for surgery, the upgrade kit gives you a MediaTek G99 chipset, 12GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, NFC, and LTE. It also bumps up the rear camera to 50 megapixels and the selfie camera to 8 megapixels. The battery is an all-new 3,000mAh one that Zinwa claims will last one day, and the charging port is USB-C.

Don't have a BlackBerry Q20 in a drawer collecting dust? Not to worry. Zinwa is also selling a “Q25 Pro full device” that comes with the Q20—same body with the exact 720 x 720 resolution screen, QWERTY keypad, touchpad, and all—for $420. You get all the same upgrades in the kit.

Eric Migicovsky, the original founder of Pebble, who is currently reviving the e-paper display smartwatch under the Pebble brand, shared his modded Q20 on X.

“Damn this is cool,” Migicovsky said. “Someone made a Android mainboard replacement for the Q20. It fits perfectly inside the existing phone. Uses the same display but upgrades the camera and switches to USB C. It feels so good to hold blackberry again. The soft touch back feels amazing.”

— Eric Migicovsky (@ericmigi) August 14, 2025



The Q25 Pro runs Android, but not the latest Android 16. It's Android 13 from 2022. Responding to an X reply calling out the old version of Android, Migicovsky said, “What does it matter? Is there a noticeable difference between 13/14/whatever we're on now?” Maybe not for basic apps and phone use like calls, messaging, and web browsing, but an old version of Android may not have the latest security updates, which is pretty important in 2025.

Still, it's great to see enthusiast startups go so hard on such a niche phone. There's been a wave of nostalgia for retro tech, particularly phones with physical QWERTY keyboards. Recently, Unihertz announced the Titan 2, a BlackBerry Passport-esque phone with a QWERTY keyboard (and a funky second screen on the backside). Tech reviewer Michael Fisher, aka MrMobile, is still chugging along with Clicks, the company pumping out QWERTY case accessories for the iPhone. Clicks recently released a version of its keyboard case for the 2025 Motorola Razr Plus and Ultra foldables.

Anybody got the phone numbers for former BlackBerry co-CEOs Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie? I'm dying to know their thoughts on the Q25 Pro kit.

$40 for a five-inch touch display

Raspberry Pi has today announced the release of a smaller version of the recently released Raspberry Pi Touch 2 Display. Shrinking from a 7-inch to 5-inch display, the new screen has the same resolution as its predecessor, 720 x 1280 (portrait) but it comes in at only $40, unlike the $60 price tag for the larger model.

The new screen is essentially the same as the 7 inch model, a 24-bit RGB LCD TFT with an anti-glare coating, just smaller and with a slightly narrower viewing angle. Your choice of Raspberry Pi (but not the Raspberry Pi Zero or Pico) attaches to the rear of the display using standoffs and a flat flex display cable connects the unit to the DSI (Display) port on the Raspberry Pi. Power comes directly from the GPIO, and as the screen uses 5V, I fear that Raspberry Pi has missed the opportunity to provide a USB cable instead of blocking access to the GPIO. If you wanted to use a HAT with the Raspberry Pi, this would be an issue that one would have to work around.

As the name suggests, this is a multi-touch display, supporting five-finger touch input and when I tested the seven inch model, Raspberry Pi OS just works with these screens. That is something that one would expect, given that the screen and the software both come from Raspberry Pi LTD.

The bezel around the edge of the display is thin, a little too thin for my liking, but the display is designed to sit recessed into a holder, and not left in the open. Think museum display screens, point-of-sale, embedded home automation control type projects where the touch screen is buried in a wall or wrapped in a custom designed chassis.

If you've dreamt of making your own Star Trek inspired touch input, or simply want a small screen for your Pi, the Touch Display 2 is a reliable and simple means to do this. The new 5-inch screen will be available via Raspberry Pi resellers for $40, the larger 7-inch model is still available for $60.

Flame on!

A few months ago, popular enthusiast der8auer took a look at the RTX Titan Ada, an unreleased card from Nvidia's Ada Lovelace lineup that was supposed to take full advantage of the AD102 GPU, purportedly featuring 18,432 cores and 48 GB VRAM. While this card never made it to market, a working prototype of it featuring dual 12VHPWR connectors does exist. And, today, we get to see the insane adapter that ships with it to make the whole thing compatible with older power supplies (that don't adhere to the ATX 3.0/3.1 spec).

The Titan series from Nvidia always represented the best-in-class mainstream GPU the company had to offer. Since 2018's RTX Titan, Nvidia has replaced this with its 90-class GPUs like the RTX 3090 and 5090. The RTX Titan Ada was, therefore, supposed to be the flagship offering of the Ada Lovelace lineup, superceding even the RTX 4090. It was the largest reference card Nvidia had ever built, but alas, we never got to enjoy the brutality of it.

All that performance requires a lot of power, and this card came well-equipped. With not only one but two 12VHPWR connectors, the Titan Ada can technically handle up to 1200W of power, but due to driver and BIOS limitations, it only peaked at around 600W (with overclocking) when der8bauer tested it earlier. Now, in his latest video, he specifically breaks down this power delivery system and, most interestingly, the mystery dual 12VHPWR to 6x 8-pin adapter.

As the name suggests, Nvidia made an adapter that can take the power from six standard 8-pin PCIe connectors, so 900W, and supply that across two 12VHPWR connectors. This adapter has no load balancing, and there are no sense pins on the connector either, so the GPU will run regardless of how many 8-pins are actually plugged in. Der8auer demonstrates this by literally unplugging the 8-pin connectors one by one while the card is running, and it doesn't shut down even when down to just two 8-pins.



Design-wise, the Titan Ada adapter, despite featuring an angled housing, is much stiffer compared to the newer 12V-2x6 to quad 8-pin adapter that ships with the RTX 5090. There's no smart functionality in that either. Still, at least the 5090's adapter has an extra communication wire that can detect whether every 8-pin is properly plugged in or not—unlike the Titan Ada, which will just run willy-nilly. However, this behavior could be attributed to its prototype nature. The Titan adapter also features much longer cables that are not braided.

Der8auer otherwise praised the construction of the adapter, noting how it's all one piece of plastic instead of smaller bits attached together. That could indicate Nvidia was quite far into the process of finalizing it, and this is proven by the date of manufacture. Der8auer disassembled the 12VHPWR side of the adapter and found ""20220121"" mentioned on the PCB—corresponding to 21 January, 2022—and reiterated that Nvidia likely made a new mold specifically for the connectors.



That date tells us this adapter existed just around 9 months before the launch of the RTX 4090, which again suggests that Nvidia was seriously considering this for the mass market. What ultimately stopped them at the end remains unanswered. It's no question that eventually we will see a flagship card that needs more than 600W, and that may be when Nvidia will bring these dual 16-pin connectors back, but with the updated 12V-2x6 designs instead.

From Xeon 6 to Jintide C6P


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Montage Technology, one of China's many fabless semiconductor companies, has launched the new Jintide C6P series of server processors. The C6P chips, based on Intel's Granite Rapids platform with additional security and tracking features, are designed explicitly for the Chinese market.

Montage Technology, along with China's renowned Tsinghua University, struck a special deal with Intel back in 2016. Under the chip venture, Montage Technology could reconfigure Intel's Xeon processors with added Chinese-specific security features and subsequently commercialize them in the Chinese market. Having launched the fifth-generation Jintide chips, based on Emerald Rapids, two years ago, Montage Technology has now progressed to the sixth-generation Jintide platform, leveraging Granite Rapids' design.

As you might have guessed by the model name, the C6P processors are equivalent to Intel's 6th Generation Xeon Scalable chips, which were later rebranded as Xeon 6. The Xeon 6 family comprises two series: Granite Rapids, featuring Redwood Cover P-cores, and Sierra Forest, with Crestmont E-cores. In Montage Technology's case, the company first released the C6E series based on the latter before the former.

It's essential to note that Montage Technology is utilizing the Granite Rapids-SP silicon, which is at the core of the Xeon 6700 and 6500 series, ranging from eight to 86 cores. The company isn't touching the Granite Rapids-AP silicon, which powers the Xeon 6900 series, featuring core counts between 72 and 128. Montage Technology hasn't confirmed if it'll bring Granite Rapids-AP to the Chinese market.

Although Montage Technology hasn't listed the C6P series on its website or provided specifications in the press release, we already know what the new Jintide chips bring, as they leverage Granite Rapids' configuration. The company showcased the C6787P in the press image, which is essentially the Xeon 6787P. It's easy to decipher Montage Technology's model names, as the company adds the ""C"" prefix to the front of Intel's SKUs. The Xeon 6787P is an 86-core, 172-thread processor with 336MB of L3 cache, retailing for around $10,400 in the U.S. market.

The Jintide C6P processors will also enjoy Granite Rapids' other features, such as 2S scalability, eight-channel DDR6-6400 RDIMM and DDR5-8000 MDRIMM support, 88 high-speed PCIe 5.0 lanes, and CXL 2.0 support. At the chip level, the C6P series is repacked with specific data encryption and decryption algorithms along with surveillance features, as these chips are likely to be used by the Chinese government, healthcare, and financial sectors.

Some say continuous transfers exceeding 50GB can cause drives to vanish from the OS


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Microsoft's latest security update for Windows 11 is allegedly causing SSD failures during heavy file transfers. The issue was reported by X user Nekorusukii @Necoru_cat, who was updating Cyberpunk 2077 on a system running Windows 11 24H2 with the KB5063878 update installed, when the SSD on which the game was installed disappeared from the operating system.

An investigation by the user reveals a potential bug that appears during continuous file transfers on certain storage devices, particularly when the transfer exceeds 50GB and the drive is over 60% full. In these cases, the SSD can sometimes disappear from within the operating system. While restarting the PC makes the SSD visible again, the issue seems to occur again as soon as a large data transfer is performed again.

It was earlier reported that the issue lies within how SSDs handle cache, especially DRAM-less models equipped with Phison NAND controllers, but it turns out the problem isn't confined to those types of drives. A series of tests was carried out to establish the scope of the problem, which included copying Cyberpunk 2077's Steam library folder to the drive, preparing a compressed archive, and then copying the expanded archive into the target storage.

Out of the 21 drives tested, it was found that 12 of them became inaccessible, but only the Western Digital SA510 2TB could not be recovered even after a reboot. This indicates that the issue seems to impact SSDs with multiple types of SSD controllers.



Nekorusukii has listed the complete findings and explains that the SSDs were tested only on his own system, so the results may not offer enough proof on the real-time performance of these drives. Additionally, they do not assert that the Windows 11 24H2 KB5063878 or the previously released KB5062660 updates are directly responsible for the issues. However, a separate report by Japanese outlet NichePCGamer has further identified at least eight users on X who are facing similar issues on their respective drives.

According to a user with a SanDisk Extreme Pro M.2 NVMe 3D SSD, the drive became inaccessible after installing a 50GB update for Honkai: Star Rail. Although restarting the system resolved the issue, the user encountered it again on multiple occasions in August. Suspecting the KB5062660 update as the cause, the user deleted the update file, after which the problem no longer occurred.

By the looks of it, the issue doesn't seem to be widespread. While we wait for Microsoft and SSD manufacturers to acknowledge the bug, it is best to stay cautious, especially if you are dealing with large continuous file transfers on systems running the latest Windows 11 KB5063878 update. We've reached out to Phison specifically regarding the issue, but the company wasn't immediately available for comment.

The Lordstown, Ohio, site was originally acquired by Foxconn from Lordstown Motors in 2022 and used for electric vehicle production. The complex spans 6.2 million square feet and is six times larger than Foxconn's Houston facility, which is also being expanded to build AI servers. The plant has production facilities (albeit these will have to be changed to build AI servers) and loads of power capacity, which will be required for large-scale manufacturing operations. Foxconn got $375 million for the plant and the land, according to Reuters.

Foxconn Chairman Young Liu explained that the arrangement with SoftBank has been in preparation for over six months. The decision was driven by available power capacity, large land area for further expansion, and urgency to move quickly on the Stargate schedule, which aims to build $500 billion AI infrastructure over the next several years.

Foxconn is already the world's largest supplier of AI servers and is increasing its capacity in multiple regions. In the United States, it is building up operations in Houston, Texas, where it plans to produce AI machines and other data center gear in partnership with Nvidia. The company is also maintaining activities in California and Mexico, serving dozens of clients. The new Ohio base will become another important production center in its network.

The Ohio complex could become the first manufacturing base linked directly to Stargate and exclusively producing infrastructure components used by SoftBank, Oracle, and OpenAI, which almost guarantees a steady flow of orders. SoftBank is currently evaluating multiple locations for data centers, considering factors such as energy supply, water resources, and telecommunications infrastructure, reports Bloomberg. As soon as SoftBank finds places for its AI data centers, it will be able to equip them with machines produced at the Lordstown, Ohio, facility.

The Stargate project was introduced in January by OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank in the presence of U.S. President Donald Trump. Back then, Masayoshi Son, the head of SoftBank, pledged to allocate $100 billion immediately toward data centers, energy facilities, and related projects. However, progress has slowed due to various factors, including U.S. tariff policy and obstacles to building viable financing models, according to Bloomberg. SoftBank denies that access to funding is a problem.

The security industry and the hackers they're supposed to defend against have both increased their use of AI as publicly available agents become more capable.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The future of cybersecurity is essentially a digital version of ""Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots"" that pits offensive- and defensive-minded AI against each other—or at least that's the impression given by an NBC report on how the industry views AI.

""In recent months, hackers of seemingly every stripe — cybercriminals, spies, researchers and corporate defenders alike — have started including AI tools into their work,"" the report said. ""LLMs, like ChatGPT, are still error-prone. But they have become remarkably adept at processing language instructions and at translating plain language into computer code, or identifying and summarizing documents.""

NBC goes on to recount how Google has been discovering vulnerabilities with AI, how CrowdStrike is ""using AI to help people who think they've been hacked,"" and how a startup called Xbow developed an AI that managed to ""climb to the top of the HackerOne U.S. leaderboard"" in June. (HackerOne has since divided its leaderboards into separate trackers for individual researchers and ""collectives"" like Xbow.)

Earlier this month I reported on CrowdStrike's warning about how North Korean operatives are using generative AI to create resumes, social media accounts, and other materials that are used to trick Western tech companies into hiring them, at which point they shift to using the AI tooling to communicate with co-workers, write code, and otherwise maintain a facade of normalcy while they collect their paychecks.

AI's utility for that purpose—as well as for summarizing documents—has been well-established. (Or at least better established than its ability to do sophisticated cybersecurity research on its own; it's still not particularly good at distilling facts.) But it seems a bit early to declare the arrival of the era of AI hacking, especially since it's often being used as a force multiplier rather than a fully automated solution.

Google vice president of security engineering Heather Adkins told NBC that she hasn't ""seen anybody find something novel"" with AI, and that it's ""just kind of doing what we already know how to do."" She also said ""that will advance,"" but researchers, companies, and independent organizations alike have been assuring us that AI will ""advance"" far beyond its current limits since the 1960s, so we're operating on a long timeline here.

Xbow rising to the top of the HackerOne leaderboard is also interesting, but it also overlooks the sheer amount of ""slop"" produced by similar AI tools that promise to help security researchers find vulnerabilities. Daniel Stenberg, lead developer of the open source curl project on which practically every internet-connected device relies, has repeatedly bemoaned the amount of time he's wasted on ""vulnerabilities"" found by AI.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

""The general trend so far in 2025 has been way more AI slop than ever before (about 20% of all submissions) as we have averaged in about two security report submissions per week,"" Stenberg said in a recent blog post on this problem. (Emphasis his.) ""In early July, about 5% of the submissions in 2025 had turned out to be genuine vulnerabilities. The valid-rate has decreased significantly compared to previous years.""

Stenberg recently gave a talk on this problem, too, and it's worth reading his 2024 blog post on the phenomenon as well. The lead developer of a project used in more than 20 billion devices is spending this much time calling out—to say nothing of actually dealing with—this issue. How many other maintainers of open source projects are being overwhelmed by similar problems, but without the same degree of visibility?

So AI has proven useful in social engineering attacks like the North Korean tech worker scheme, sped up the rate at which Google's researchers can discover vulnerabilities, and found ways to game the HackerOne leaderboard. NBC also reported that Russian hackers have started embedding AI in malware used against Ukraine to ""automatically search the victims' computers for sensitive files to send back to Moscow.""

But it hasn't found many interesting vulnerabilities on its own, it's bombarding open source projects with irrelevant reports, and we have no idea if the AI used to find sensitive files on Russia's behalf produced worthwhile intelligence. (Especially if an AI was then asked to summarize the compromised documents and then hallucinated some juicy intel because it didn't want its virtual family to be sent to the gulag.)

Is that enough to declare the era of AI hacking, or is it just another side effect of the broader interest in AI being fueled by exorbitant spending by the world's largest tech companies, investment trends from the venture capital class, and geopolitical conflicts over what the two preceding groups have declared the industry of the future?

 August 18, 2025  

Patients arriving at appointments with researched information is not new, but artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT are changing the dynamics.

Their confident presentation can leave physicians feeling that their expertise is challenged. Kumara Raja Sundar, MD, a family medicine physician at Kaiser Permanente Burien Medical Center in Burien, Washington, highlighted this trend in a recent article published in JAMA.

A patient visited Sundar's clinic reporting dizziness and described her symptoms with unusual precision: “It's not vertigo, but more like a presyncope feeling.” She then suggested that the tilt table test might be useful for diagnosis.

Occasionally, patient questions reveal subtle familiarity with medical jargon. This may indicate that they either have relevant training or have studied the subject extensively. 

Curious, Sundar asked if she worked in the healthcare sector. She replied that she had consulted ChatGPT, which recommended the tilt table test.

For years, patients have brought newspaper clippings, internet research, and advice from friends and relatives to consultations.

Suggestions shared in WhatsApp groups have become a regular part of clinical discussions. Sundar noted that this particular encounter was different.

The patient's tone and level of detail conveyed competence, and the confidence with which she presented the information subtly challenged his clinical judgment and treatment plans.

It is not surprising that large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are appealing. Recent studies have confirmed their remarkable strengths in logical reasoning and interpersonal communication.

However, a direct comparison between LLMs and physicians is unfair. Clinicians often face immense pressure, including constrained consultation times, overflowing inboxes, and a healthcare system that demands productivity and efficiency.

Even skilled professionals struggle to perform optimally under adverse conditions.

In contrast, generative AI is functionally limitless. This imbalance creates an unrealistic benchmark; however, this is today's reality.

Patients want clear answers; more importantly, they want to feel heard, understood, and reassured.

Patients value accurate information but also want to feel recognized, reassured, and heard. “Unfortunately, under the weight of competing demands, which is what often slips for me not just because of systemic constraints but also because I am merely human,” Sundar wrote.

Despite the capabilities of generative AI, patients still visit doctors. Though these tools deliver confidently worded suggestions, they inevitably conclude: “Consult a healthcare professional.”

The ultimate responsibility for liability, diagnostics, prescriptions, and sick notes remains with physicians.

In practice, this means dealing with requests, such as a tilt table test for intermittent vertigo, a procedure that is not uncommon but often inappropriate.

“I find myself explaining concepts such as overdiagnosis, false positives, or other risks of unnecessary testing. At best, the patient understands the ideas, which may not resonate when one is experiencing symptoms. At worst, I sound dismissive. There is no function that tells ChatGPT that clinicians lack routine access to tilt-table testing or that echocardiogram appointments are delayed because of staff shortages. I have to carry those constraints into the examination room while still trying to preserve trust,” Sundar emphasized in his article.

When I speak with medical students, I notice a different kind of paternalism creeping in. And I have caught it in my inner monologue, even if I do not say it aloud. The old line, “They probably WebMD'd it and think they have cancer,” has morphed into the newer, just-as-dismissive line, “They probably ChatGPT'd it and are going to tell us what to order.” 

It often reflects defensiveness from clinicians rather than genuine engagement and carries an implicit message: We still know the best. “It is an attitude that risks eroding sacred and fragile trust between clinicians and patients. It reinforces the feeling that we are not ‘in it' with our patients and are truly gatekeeping rather than partnering. Ironically, that is often why I hear patients turn to LLMs in the first place,” Sundar concluded.

One patient said plainly, “This is how I can advocate for myself better.” The word “advocate” struck Sundar, capturing the effort required to persuade someone with more authority. Although clinicians still control access to tests, referrals, and treatment plans, the term conveys a sense of preparing for a fight.

When patients feel unheard, gathering knowledge becomes a strategy to be taken seriously.

In such situations, the usual approach of explaining false-positive test results, overdiagnosis, and test characteristics is often ineffective. From the patient's perspective, this sounds more like, “I still know more than you, no matter what tool you used, and I'm going to overwhelm you with things you don't understand.”

The role of physicians is constantly evolving. The transition from physician-as-authority to physician-as-advisor is intensifying. Patients increasingly present with expectations shaped by nonevidence-based sources, often misaligned with the clinical reality. As Sundar observed, “They arm themselves with knowledge to be heard.” This necessitates a professional duty to respond with understanding rather than resistance.

His approach centers on emotional acknowledgment before clinical discussion: “I say, ‘We'll discuss diagnostic options together. But first, I want to express my condolences. I can hardly imagine how you feel. I want to tackle this with you and develop a plan.'” He emphasized, “This acknowledgment was the real door opener.”

What began as a US trend observed by Sundar has now spread worldwide, with patients increasingly arriving at consultations armed with medical knowledge from tools like ChatGPT rather than just “Dr Google.”

Clinicians across health systems have reported that digitally informed patients now comprise the majority.

In a forum discussion, physicians from various disciplines shared their experiences, highlighting how previously informed patients are now the norm. Inquiries often focus on specific laboratory values, particularly vitamin D or hormone tests. In gynecologic consultations, Internet research on menstrual disorders has become a routine part of patient interactions, with an overwhelming range of answers available online.

‘Chanice,' a Coliquio user who's a gynecologist, shared, “The answers range from, ‘It's normal; it can happen' to ‘You won't live long.'” “It's also common to Google medication side effects, and usually, women end up experiencing pretty much every side effect, even though they didn't have them before.”

How should doctors respond to this trend? Opinions are clear: openness, education, and transparency are essential and ideally delivered in a structured manner.

“Get the patients on board; educate them. In writing! Each and every one of them. Once it's put into words, it's no longer a job. Invest time in educating patients to correct misleading promises made by health insurance companies and politicians,” commented another user, Jörg Christian Nast, a specialist in gynecology and obstetrics.

The presence of digitally informed patients is increasingly seen not only as a challenge but also as an opportunity. Conversations with these patients can be constructive, but they can also generate unrealistic demands or heated debates.

Thus, a professional, calm, and explanatory approach remains crucial, and at times, a dose of humor can help. Another user who specializes in internal medicine added, “The term ‘online consultation' takes on a whole new meaning.”

In planned cesarean deliveries, cefazolin demonstrates superior infection prevention compared with clindamycin plus gentamicin, with significantly lower rates of inpatient antibiotic use (5.9% vs 15.2%) and readmissions (1.8% vs 3.8%).

“Cefazolin may be more effective than clindamycin plus gentamicin in preventing infectious complications after planned cesarean delivery. This study emphasizes the importance of careful assessment of β-lactam allergies to guide optimal antibiotic choices. For women allergic to standard regimens, alternative strategies should be considered to reduce postoperative infections and complications,” the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Daniel Gabbai, MD, MPH, Lis Hospital for Women's Health, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center in Tel Aviv, Israel, and published in O&G Open.

According to the authors, this study used indirect indicators of infectious complications rather than direct diagnoses of endometritis or surgical site infections. The retrospective design introduced potential selection bias, particularly due to missing data on prophylactic antibiotic use in some patients. The researchers noted that while major confounders were controlled for, unmeasured factors might have influenced the observed differences between antibiotic groups. Additionally, data on prenatal antibiotic use were not consistently available, and the 12-year study period at a single tertiary care center may limit the generalizability of findings to other institutions with different patient populations and care practices.

The authors reported no relevant conflicts of interest. This study was approved by the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center Institutional Review Board (No. TLV-0284-08, July 10, 2024).

Among UK healthcare workers, seasonal flu vaccination substantially lowered the risk for infection during the winter of 2023-2024, and vaccinated staff recorded fewer positive influenza tests than their unvaccinated peers.

""The findings of this study, the largest to our knowledge to estimate influenza VE [vaccine effectiveness] in HCWs [healthcare workers], emphasise the ongoing importance of routine seasonal influenza vaccination of this occupational group,"" the authors wrote.

""Efforts to increase influenza vaccine uptake in HCWs are likely to require a multifaceted approach that includes a focus on supply of and access to vaccines, as well as educational approaches to address existing concerns,"" they added.

This study was led by Luke J. McGeoch, Field Service South-East and London, Chief Medical Advisor's Group and Field Epidemiology Training Programme of the UK Health Security Agency, London, England. It was published online on August 12, 2025, in Journal of Infection.

The 14-day interval between successive swabs may have resulted in missed infections that arose and cleared between tests. Vaccine effectiveness by influenza types and subtypes could not be assessed due to unavailable data, and the study had limited statistical power for subgroup analyses.

This study was supported by the UK Health Security Agency and the UK Department of Health and Social Care, with contributions from governments of Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales; the National Institute for Health Research; UK Research and Innovation's UK Medical Research Council; and others. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

Veterans with gout were 30% more likely to be prescribed chronic opioid therapy than those without gout, with factors such as female sex, underweight BMI, current smoking status, and a higher burden of comorbidities increasing this likelihood.

“In conclusion, we found in the VHA that patients with gout were more likely than those without gout to be prescribed opioids leading to chronic use after accounting for other possible determinants of receipt,” the study authors wrote.

“This study also identified several factors that appear to identify patients with gout at highest risk of receipt, factors that might ultimately be used in targeted efforts to reduce long-term prescription opioid use in this population,” they added.

The study was led by Lindsay N. Helget, MD, Veterans Affairs Nebraska-Western Iowa Health Care System in Omaha, Nebraska, and was published online on August 4, 2025, in Arthritis Care and Research.

Administrative data restrictions prevented reliable identification of both the indication and specialty origin for index prescriptions. The predominantly male population may limit the generalizability of the findings. Reliance on algorithms leveraging administrative data could have led to misclassification of gout status and chronic opioid exposure. 

This study was supported by a Scientist Development Award from the Department of Internal Medicine at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Some authors received support or grants from Veterans Affairs Clinical Science Research & Development, the Rheumatology Research Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, Veterans Affairs, the US Department of Defense.

A 33-year-old man with schizophrenia was brought to the emergency department in Curitiba, and strapped to a gurney after swallowing a ballpoint pen and two intravenous (IV) catheters. His medical records showed a history of foreign body ingestion, including a prior exploratory laparotomy to remove the eight toothbrushes.

This behaviour reflects allotriophagy, or pica, an eating disorder characterised by the recurrent, compulsive ingestion of nonnutritive substances such as metal, glass, and paper. At the time of admission, he was receiving clozapine 100 mg daily, lithium carbonate 300 mg at night, valproic acid 500 mg twice daily, and diazepam 10 mg at night.

The case report by Sarah B. Guttman, a medical student, and colleagues at Universidade Positivo in Curitiba, Brazil, describes a rare psychiatric disorder.

The patient arrived at the hospital restrained on a rigid stretcher after reporting the ingestion of a ballpoint pen and two IV catheters. His medical history included schizophrenia with auditory hallucinations and impulsivity, which were managed with the aforementioned medications. His history included heavy smoking and crack use since the age of 12 years; family, allergy, and travel histories were unremarkable.

On admission, he was haemodynamically stable and showed no significant gastrointestinal complaints or acute psychiatric symptoms. Physical examination revealed no signs of peritonitis.

Upper digestive endoscopy confirmed the presence of foreign bodies in the stomach; however, complete endoscopic removal was not feasible. Exploratory laparotomy was performed. Intraoperatively, the surgeon removed the pen from the stomach and an IV catheter from the jejunum. The intestines appeared normal, with no perforation or infection.

The following days, the patient remained hospitalised under observation with no gastrointestinal complaints and good dietary tolerance. However, despite mechanical restraint, he exhibited episodes of psychomotor agitation, escape attempts, and further ingestion of objects, including three cardiac monitoring electrodes and an oximeter. The medical team reinforced restraints and increased the dose of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride for continuous infusion (0.2-0.7 mcg/kg/h, as clinically needed) to manage agitation.

The patient experienced multiple subsequent hospitalisations due to recurrent episodes of foreign body ingestion.

“The described case highlights the complexity of managing schizophrenic patients with allotriophagy, a condition that entails not only physical risks but also significant psychiatric and social challenges. The compulsive ingestion of objects underscores the need for continuous monitoring and integrated therapeutic approaches, combining pharmacological treatment, psychological support, and social interventions. The recurrence of this behaviour demonstrates the difficulty in controlling impulsivity and the importance of structured support, including family and institutional assistance,” wrote the authors.

Over a quarter of musicians experienced difficulty with musical endeavors during or after the breast cancer treatment with 57% reporting unresolved issues at survey time. Chemotherapy emerged as the most impactful treatment with 71% of recipients citing it as most detrimental to musical ability.

“These results will help oncology care teams counsel musicians, answer questions about impacts on musicality, and provide a timeline for resolution of musical symptoms,” the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Jessica F. Burlile, MD, Mayo Clinic in Rochester, New York. It was published online in JCO Oncology Practice.

According to the authors, this study faced several limitations including recall bias with a median time of 5.3 years from diagnosis to survey completion. The researchers noted that musical abilities may have declined due to lack of practice, injuries, or natural aging during this period, which was not accounted for. Additionally, the survey did not include items specific to neurocognitive function, though multiple respondents noted difficulty with processing music or sight reading in free response areas.

This study received support from Department of Radiation Oncology Innovation Funds, Mayo Clinic, and a grant from the Mayo Fellows Association. Additional disclosures are noted in the original article.

Genetic testing covered by companies that make treatments for primary hyperoxaluria can help identify cases of this rare condition, which often leads to kidney failure at an early age.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., maker of lumasiran (Oxlumo), partnered with Prevention Genetics, a unit of Exact Sciences Corporation, to run a testing program free of charge for individuals in the US and Canada. Novo Nordisk, maker of nedosiran (Rivfloza), works with Blueprint Genetics on a similar program.

These programs make it easier for physicians treating patients whose medical histories raise concerns about possible primary hyperoxaluria, said Matthew Breeggemann, MD, a nephrologist and co-medical director of the UCSF's Kidney Stone Prevention Clinic.

The test kits are mailed to patients. “The patient just swabs the inside of their cheek and then mails it back. And you can get results sometimes within 2, 3 weeks,” he told Medscape Medical News.

Physicians are not required to prescribe the company's primary hyperoxaluria drug when their patients are tested through its sponsored program, Breeggemann said.

“We take advantage of [these programs] to help our patients like we should, but it doesn't mean you need to use that company's drug — the ultimate choice is up to the patient and what is covered by their health insurance plan,” he said.

Primary hyperoxaluria type 1, the most common form, has been estimated to affect about 1 to 3 per 1 million people, but some research suggests it may be more common.

In primary hyperoxaluria, the liver can't properly regulate the production of oxalate. So the kidneys wind up with excess oxalate, which can combine with calcium to form kidney stones. Over time, oxalate builds up in the body, leading to complications including arrhythmias and cardiac arrest, gangrene, and bone and joint pain and fractures.

One of the potential clues for primary hyperoxaluria is finding kidney stones in children because this is unusual, Breeggemann said. In adults, one signal of this condition would be a finding of high urine oxalate levels on a lab test, Breeggemann noted.

Other signs include frequent formation of kidney stones or having family members with a history of kidney stones. Physicians may also consider genetic testing for primary hyperoxaluria in patients who have kidney stones and unexplained chronic kidney disease, especially in those who don't have hypertension or diabetes, Breeggemann said.

For many years, treatments for primary hyperoxaluria were limited. Patients could try to maintain high fluid intake — intended to maintain brisk flow of diluted urine — and take citrate supplements — intended to increase urinary oxalate solubility. Vitamin B6 may also be prescribed. Some patients would have liver transplants in attempts to address the root cause of their illness. Some would undergo combined or sequential liver and kidney transplants, often preceded by periods of intensive dialysis. This sometimes involved hemodialysis many days of the week and peritoneal dialysis nightly.

But there's been a marked change recently in the landscape of treatments for primary hyperoxaluria. Alnylam said lumasiran was the first approved pharmaceutical therapy for this condition. US and EU regulators cleared it in 2020.

Lumasiran is a small interfering RNA (siRNA) designed to inhibit the production of oxalate. In 2023, Novo Nordisk received US approval of its siRNA drug, nedosiran, also designed to curb oxalate production.

Several companies have investigational agents in clinical development for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria as well, Alnylam noted in a regulatory filing. These include Biocodex, Inc., and YolTech Therapeutics.

In addition, Arbor Biotechnologies is working on a drug candidate, ABO-101, that it describes as “a novel gene editing therapeutic” designed to address primary hyperoxaluria type 1.

Breeggemann reported receiving consulting fees from Novo Nordisk and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals.

COMMENTARY

Kaitlin  Sanzone, MD

DISCLOSURES August 18, 2025  



This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

How and why I chose my medical specialty. 

Before starting medical school, I thought for sure I was going to be a surgeon. I thought the OR was the most exciting place, and I thought anatomy and the human body were so fascinating — until I actually got to my rotation. 

I completely changed my mind when I had one specific conversation with an attending thatbasically changed how I decided which specialty to go into. He told me to pick a specialty where you find joy in the mundane tasks. 

Yes, I thought performing surgeries and heart transplants was so cool. Actually, the pre-op and post-op tasks I was not finding enjoyable at all. 

Then I went into psychiatry and I was like, wait — I love everything about this.I loved talking to patients. I loved talking to patients' families.

Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) had a 46% higher risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) than matched control individuals, with an elevated risk persisting across all age groups, BMI categories, and disease durations.

""The excess risk of VTE is apparent within 2 years of disease onset, and is relatively more marked among younger individuals with RA when compared with individuals without RA. This has important clinical implications, and highlights the need to consider VTE risk in all patients diagnosed with RA,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Mark D. Russell, Centre for Rheumatic Diseases, King's College London, London, England. It was published online on August 07, 2025, in Rheumatology.

This study utilised routinely collected data from primary care in the UK, potentially limiting generalisability. Data on disease activity and inflammation burden were not available, and data on immunosuppressant medications were only from primary care prescriptions. Unmeasured confounding and diagnostic misclassification related to the reliance on routinely collected healthcare data may have existed.

This study was sponsored by Pfizer, with some authors being current or former employees of Pfizer. Several authors reported having financial relationships with various pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer, AbbVie, Galapagos, and Johnson & Johnson. One author reported being a co-editor for Rheumatology but has not peer reviewed or made any editorial decisions related to this study.

In a large New York healthcare system, 11.4% of intrauterine device (IUD) removals required complex procedures, with age and language barriers significantly affecting complication rates. Among complicated cases, 30.2% needed operating room intervention, and Spanish-speaking patients faced higher rates of complications.

“These results may support improved patient counseling on the potential risks of IUD removal. Notably, 30.2% of complicated removals, and 3.4% of all removals, required operating room intervention, a risk likely unfamiliar to many patients,” wrote the authors of the study.

The study was led by Meaghan Coles, MD, Northwell Health South Shore University Hospital in Bay Shore, New York. It was published online in O&G Open.

The retrospective design of the study relied on the accuracy of documentation and included only successful removals. Additionally, numerous patients were excluded from the study because they never followed up in the healthcare system.

The authors reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

DISCLOSURES August 18, 2025  

Bladder cancer is a prevalent malignancy affecting the urinary system, with symptoms including gross or microscopic hematuria, urinary frequency, and pelvic pain. Medscape spoke with Kyle A. Richards, MD, an associate professor in the Department of Urology at University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, about the current challenges in bladder cancer diagnosis and treatment.

Most patients are diagnosed with early stage bladder cancer, or non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Once the initial cancer is removed via transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), lifelong surveillance is needed to detect recurrence, which may occur at any time in a high rate of patients.

For high-risk NMIBC, monitoring using office cystoscopy is recommended every 3 months for the first 2 years after diagnosis. Noninvasive urine biomarkers aim to reduce this significant burden. One such biomarker, CxMonitor, has shown promise in early phase clinical studies, but additional trials are needed.

Another challenge is the difficulty of detecting all the cancer burden in the bladder following TURBT using the typical “white light” source. Narrow band imaging and blue light cystoscopy aim to address this. Though the data are mixed, these technologies appear to improve detection rates and possibly the completeness of TURBT. However, a randomized trial comparing blue-light-guided and standard white-light-guided TURBT showed no difference in recurrence rates.

Bladder cancer staging is based on the pathology report from TURBT plus axial imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to evaluate for metastatic disease. FDG PET scan may help assess for distant metastasis, and CT urogram often helps evaluate for upper tract urothelial tumors.

For localized NMIBC, we typically assess the need for adjuvant therapy following TURBT to reduce the risk for recurrence or progression. Standard-of-care treatment for high-risk NMIBC is bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). Because of the BCG shortage worldwide and lack of responsiveness to BCG in some patients, additional treatments have been explored, with sequential chemotherapy — specifically gemcitabine + docetaxel (gem/doce) — gaining the most traction.

We have no reliable tools to predict which patients are less likely to respond to BCG or gem/doce. Computational histologic artificial intelligence has been used to develop assays to help predict response to BCG, preserve BCG for patients most likely to respond, and route others to different treatments. More investigation is needed to see how these tests perform prospectively.

Surgery is often needed to remove the primary bladder tumor. Adjuvant intravesical therapies following a complete TURBT are recommended for intermediate- or high-risk patients with NMIBC to help prevent recurrence and progression. For patients with suspected low-risk NMIBC, a single dose of gemcitabine immediately after TURBT reduced the risk for recurrence from 47% to 35%.

Complications following TURBT are typically minor. In a prospective study of 159 patients undergoing TURBT, 10% had an unplanned emergency room visit, 79% experienced hematuria, and one third had bladder spasms and incontinence. Patient education and preoperative counseling may help reduce the burden of complications and postoperative readmission.

Perioperative durvalumab was studied in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) for neoadjuvant therapy in patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer. This three-drug regimen was compared to the standard GC regimen in the NIAGARA trial. Overall survival at 2 years following cystectomy was improved by 8% in the durvalumab arm.

Nogapendekin alfa inbakicept was evaluated in patients with NMIBC unresponsive to BCG. This drug modulates the local immune microenvironment in the bladder as an IL-15 super-agonist and must be given with BCG. In the pivotal study, 71% of patients had an initial complete response with a median duration of 26 months.

Mitomycin intravesical solution has been investigated in patients with low-grade intermediate-risk NMIBC, who often must undergo frequent TURBTs that can negatively affect quality of life. This agent, given intravesically, delivers a slow release of chemotherapy that ablates the tumors. With this strategy, 80% of patients were tumor free without requiring surgery at 3 months, and 82% remained free of cancer 12 months later. It has similar efficacy to TURBT but involves six weekly instillations vs one trip to the operating room.

I will be excited to see the results from the BRIDGE trial (ECOG-ACRIN EA8212), which met its patient accrual in July 2025. This trial randomized over 700 newly diagnosed patients who were BCG naive with high-grade NMIBC to BCG vs gem/doce. The primary objective is to assess event-free survival. Patient-reported outcomes are also being collected.

TAR-200, which is under FDA review, involves a novel drug delivery system that is inserted in the bladder and slowly releases gemcitabine to treat early stages of bladder cancer. A July 2025 press release cited an 82% complete response rate against bladder cancer, with 52% remaining cancer free for at least 1 year.

Carlos  Sierra, PhD

 August 18, 2025  

Preeclampsia is a serious multisystem disorder that typically manifests as hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks' gestation. The condition is multifactorial and involves placental, immunological, genetic, vascular, and maternal factors.

In Spain, preeclampsia affects about 1%-3% of pregnancies and, if not detected and managed early, can have severe or fatal consequences for both the mother and fetus. 

First-trimester screening identifies patients at risk for early preeclampsia, defined as onset before 34 weeks of gestation, but there is no routine screening in the second or third trimester to detect late preeclampsia.

Standard first-trimester assessment combines maternal history, such as age, BMI, personal and family history of preeclampsia, diabetes, chronic hypertension, blood pressure measurement, uterine artery Doppler, and maternal blood testing for placental growth factor and pregnancy-associated plasma protein A.

These data were entered into the Fetal Medicine Foundation algorithm to estimate the probability of preterm preeclampsia (before 37 weeks); an estimated probability of > 1% typically prompts use of low-dose aspirin (150 mg/d).

Preeclampsia is diagnosed from 20 weeks' gestation onward based on sustained elevated systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg on two readings at least 4 hours apart with signs of organ dysfunction such as proteinuria, renal or hepatic impairment, neurologic or hematologic complications, or evidence of uteroplacental dysfunction identified by clinical exam, laboratory tests, or ultrasound.

“Both clinical symptoms and test results can be nonspecific, which increases the risk for misdiagnosis,” said Carmen Garrido Giménez, MD, PhD, Clinical Head of Obstetrics at the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau in Barcelona, Spain, and a researcher with the Women and Perinatal Health Research Group at the Institut de Recerca Sant Pau (IR Sant Pau), Barcelona.

“The soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 to placental growth factor (sFlt-1/PlGF) angiogenic ratio is highly useful for ruling out preeclampsia, but elevated values can also appear in other placental disorders,” said Madalina Nicoleta Nan, MD, Specialist in Clinical Biochemistry at the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau and researcher in Clinical Biochemistry at IR Sant Pau, who discussed the findings with Univadis Spain, a Medscape Network platform.

However, its limited availability in many laboratories, especially in emergency departments, hampers its systematic application in clinical practice beyond tertiary hospitals.

As clinical signs and standard tests can be nonspecific, researchers have explored alternative or complementary biomarkers. One promising avenue is the use of cardiovascular biomarkers, given the bidirectional link between cardiovascular diseases and preeclampsia. “Women with cardiovascular risk factors, such as chronic hypertension, diabetes, obesity, or kidney disease, are more likely to develop preeclampsia, and a history of preeclampsia increases the risk for cardiovascular disease. Researchers have therefore evaluated the role of cardiovascular biomarkers, particularly natriuretic peptides, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP), for the early detection and risk for preeclampsia,” explained Garrido Giménez and Nan.

Most studies using this approach have focused on whether these markers are elevated in women with clinically confirmed preeclampsia, with higher levels observed in earlier and more severe cases of preeclampsia. None have compared their performance with that of the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio, which is the most specific diagnostic standard. The researchers also did not assess the ability of these markers to predict preeclampsia in the week before clinical diagnosis.

A multicenter prospective study led by the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau and the IR Sant Pau, with collaborators at four other Catalan hospitals, assessed whether NT-proBNP could predict the onset of early preeclampsia within 1 week of assessment in women with clinical suspicion at 24 weeks of gestation. The study enrolled 316 pregnant women from March 2018 to December 2020 (mean maternal age, 34 years; 86.4% Caucasian); 74 women (23.4%) developed preeclampsia. 

The study found that NT-proBNP levels increased sharply in the days before symptom onset, making it a potential early warning marker. Levels of 116 pg/mL or higher predicted early preeclampsia with 90.9% sensitivity and 94.3% specificity.

This performance matched that of the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio, the current standard test; however, NT-proBNP offers the advantage of being less expensive and more widely available.

These results were unexpected. “We knew the cardiac biomarker would be elevated in women with preeclampsia because of its link to cardiovascular dysfunction,” said the physicians.

“We did not expect the predictive performance to match that of the angiogenic factor ratio (sFlt-1/PlGF) when the diagnosis was imminent. This short-term equivalence suggests the biomarker could serve as a complementary or alternative diagnostic option where angiogenic markers are unavailable.”

This predictive value could enable closer monitoring of at-risk women and allow timely preventive measures, such as administering corticosteroids to accelerate fetal lung maturation or hospital admission when necessary.

Beyond early preeclampsia, NT-proBNP also predicted complicated cases involving fetal growth restriction, placental abruption, or stillbirth, with a performance similar to that of the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio.

The sensitivity for these complications was 84.2%, and the specificity was 91.4%, supporting the potential for broader clinical use. This integrated approach could be especially valuable in obstetric pathology or intermediate care units, where anticipating complications may improve both maternal and fetal outcomes.

The study aimed to assess whether NT-proBNP could serve as a diagnostic alternative in settings lacking access to more specific markers, such as the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio, which is typically limited to tertiary hospitals.

However, the physicians said, “NT-proBNP cannot replace the angiogenic ratio, which is more reliable for ruling out preeclampsia in the longer term.”

For NT-proBNP to become a real diagnostic tool, “further prospective studies in diverse populations are needed to validate the proposed cutoff value. Trials incorporating NT-proBNP into diagnostic and clinical decision-making processes are required to determine its application in the early diagnosis of preeclampsia and improved clinical management. Standardized protocols and integration into existing clinical guidelines are also essential,” said the physicians.

“We are now studying whether combining NT-proBNP with the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio can improve the prediction of preeclampsia and maternal-fetal complications. We are also considering the possibility of randomized trials to assess the clinical utility of this biomarker in decision-making, although expanding this research beyond Spain is not currently planned,” the physicians concluded.

In a large retrospective study of patients with androgenic alopecia or other nonscarring hair loss, treatment with low-dose oral minoxidil (LDOM) was not associated with an increased risk for tachycardia.

The results suggest that “hair loss treatment with LDOM is safe in patients without cardiac risk factors, and therefore, coadministration of beta-adrenergic blockers is not recommended,” the authors wrote, noting that large prospective studies are needed to confirm their findings. The study, they added, is the largest to date “analyzing tachycardia risk with LDOM treatment for nonscarring hair loss and the only study with a control group.”

The study was led by Zachary Neubauer, Thomas Jefferson University, Sidney Kimmel Medical College, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and was published online on August 8 in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology.

The retrospective design and reliance on diagnostic coding could have introduced bias. Dosing frequency and cardiac monitoring data were unavailable. Transient tachycardia episodes might have been missed, and physician prescribing behavior could have influenced patient selection.

The study did not receive any funding. One author disclosed receiving research funding from Moberg Pharmaceuticals and BelleTorus Corporation.

A Covid infection, particularly in women, may lead to blood vessels aging around five years, according to research published in the European Heart Journal on 18th August, 2025.

Blood vessels gradually become stiffer with age, but the new study suggests that Covid could accelerate this process. Researchers say this is important since people with stiffer blood vessels face a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, including stroke and heart attack.

The study was led by Professor Rosa Maria Bruno from Université Paris Cité, France.

Since the pandemic, we have learned that many people who have had Covid are left with symptoms that can last for months or even years. However, we are still learning what's happening in the body to create these symptoms.""

Rosa Maria Bruno, Professor, Université Paris Cité

Bruno added, ""We know that Covid can directly affect blood vessels. We believe that this may result in what we call early vascular ageing, meaning that your blood vessels are older than your chronological age and you are more susceptible to heart disease. If that is happening, we need to identify who is at risk at an early stage to prevent heart attacks and strokes.""

The study included 2,390 people from 16 different countries (Austria, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Mexico, Norway, Turkey, UK and US) who were recruited between September 2020 to February 2022. They were categorised according to whether they had never had Covid, had recent Covid but were not hospitalised, hospitalised for Covid on a general ward or hospitalised for Covid in an intensive care unit.

Researchers assessed each person's vascular age with a device that measures how quickly a wave of blood pressure travels between the carotid artery (in the neck) and femoral arteries (in the legs), a measure called carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV). The higher this measurement, the stiffer the blood vessels and the higher the vascular age of a person. Measurements were taken six months after Covid infection and again after 12 months.

Researchers also recorded demographic information such as patient's sex, age and other factors that can influence cardiovascular health.

After taking these factors into consideration, researchers found that all three groups of patients who had been infected with Covid, including those with mild Covid, had stiffer arteries, compared to those who had not been infected. The effect was greater in women than in men and in people who experienced the persistent symptoms of long Covid, such as shortness of breath and fatigue.

The average increase in PWV in women who had mild Covid was 0.55 meters per second, 0.60 in women hospitalised with Covid, and 1.09 for women treated in intensive care. Researchers say

an increase of around 0.5 meters per second is ""clinically relevant"" and equivalent to ageing around five years, with a 3% increased risk of cardiovascular disease, in a 60-year-old woman.

People who had been vaccinated against Covid generally had arteries that were less stiff than people who were unvaccinated. Over the longer term, the vascular ageing associated with Covid infection seemed to stabilise or improve slightly.

Professor Bruno added, ""There are several possible explanations for the vascular effects of Covid. The Covid-19 virus acts on specific receptors in the body, called the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors, that are present on the lining of the blood vessels. The virus uses these receptors to enter and infect cells. This may result in vascular dysfunction and accelerated vascular ageing. Our body's inflammation and immune responses, which defend against infections, may be also involved.

""One of the reasons for the difference between women and men could be differences in the function of the immune system. Women mount a more rapid and robust immune response, which can protect them from infection. However, this same response can also increase damage to blood vessels after the initial infection.

""Vascular ageing is easy to measure and can be addressed with widely available treatments, such as lifestyle changes, blood pressure-lowering and cholesterol-lowering drugs. For people with accelerated vascular ageing, it is important to do whatever possible to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes.""

Professor Bruno and her colleagues will continue to follow the participants over the coming years to establish whether the accelerated vascular ageing they have found leads to an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes in the future.

In an accompanying editorial, Dr Behnood Bikdeli from Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA, and colleagues said: ""Although the acute threat of the COVID-19 pandemic has waned, a new challenge emerged in its aftermath: post-acute COVID-19 syndrome. Defined by the World Health Organization as symptoms appearing three months post-infection and lasting at least two months, studies suggest that up to 40% of initial COVID-19 survivors develop this syndrome.

""This large, multicentre, prospective cohort study enrolled 2390 participants from 34 centres to investigate whether arterial stiffness, as measured by PWV, persisted in individuals with recent COVID-19 infection. […] sex-stratified analyses revealed striking differences: females across all COVID-19-positive groups had significantly elevated PWV, with the highest increase (+1.09 m/s) observed in those requiring ICU admission.

""The CARTESIAN study makes the case that COVID-19 has aged our arteries, especially for female adults. The question is whether we can find modifiable targets to prevent this in future surges of infection, and mitigate adverse outcomes in those afflicted with COVID-19-induced vascular ageing.""

Major review says yes, it lowers blood sugar and inflammation effectively","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250817/Can-ginger-help-diabetes-Major-review-says-yes-it-lowers-blood-sugar-and-inflammation-effectively.aspx","Mon, 18 Aug 2025 03:17:00 GMT","

A top-level review of clinical evidence confirms ginger's broad health benefits, from anti-inflammatory and antidiabetic effects to easing nausea in pregnancy, with potential as a safe, natural therapy.

Review: Pharmacological properties of ginger (Zingiber officinale): what do meta-analyses say? a systematic review. Image Credit: barmalini / Shutterstock

In a recent systematic review published in Frontiers in Pharmacology, researchers at Burrell College of Osteopathic Medicine and Mercer University School of Medicine in the United States collated and synthesized five high-quality clinical publications (meta-analyses) to investigate the effects of ginger (Zingiber officinale) on inflammation, blood sugar, and other physiological metrics, thereby informing its use as a functional food.

Review findings confirm that ginger supplementation significantly reduces key markers of inflammation, lowers blood glucose and glycohemoglobin (HbA1c) in type 2 diabetes (T2D), and improves antioxidant status. It has also been shown to alleviate pregnancy-associated nausea effectively. However, it did not significantly reduce vomiting episodes, and vitamin B6 was significantly more effective at improving overall nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) symptom scores in some trials. These findings support ginger's potential as a generally safe and multifaceted therapeutic agent for various common health conditions, though limitations in study quality and consistency remain.

Human history is full of examples of ancient cultures leveraging herbs and spices as more than just flavor enhancers, but also to promote health and treat illness. Ginger, with its characteristic pungent flavor derived from bioactive compounds like gingerols and shogaols, remains one of the most celebrated. Zingiber officinale has been used for millennia to treat everything from digestive upset to inflammation.

Modern science has sought to validate these claims, exploring ginger's potential to manage conditions like type 2 diabetes (T2D), oxidative stress, and pregnancy-associated nausea and vomiting (NVP). While numerous studies have investigated ginger's health benefits, their results are often inconsistent and confounding, making it difficult for clinicians and consumers to make informed decisions about consumption and dosage.

Meta-analyses, reviews that pool the results of multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and reanalyse this pooled data holistically, address between-study confounds and provide more substantial evidence. The present study takes the next logical step: a systematic review of those meta-analyses, creating a powerful, top-level summary of what we know about the clinical benefits of ginger.

The present systematic review attempts to address these knowledge gaps by conducting a ""review of reviews"" designed to consolidate the highest evidence on ginger's therapeutic effects. Publications for inclusion in the review were identified via a custom keyword search of several credible online scientific repositories (PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Cochrane, and ISI Web of Science) from January 2010 to the end of March 2025. Subsequently, title, abstract, and full text screening were employed to assess study applicability. Only five meta-analyses were ultimately included from more than 2,000 initially identified records.

The review focused on the associations between ginger consumption or supplementation and four key health outcomes: inflammation, T2D, oxidative stress, and NVP. Data extractions comprised crucial quantitative findings and conclusions from each of these papers. These pooled results, dosages used in the underlying trials, and the overall strength of the evidence were examined, providing a robust and comprehensive overview of ginger's clinically established pharmacological effects.

The present review established ginger's physiological benefits across all four areas of focus. A meta-analysis by Morvaridzadeh et al. (2020), which included 16 RCTs, found that ginger supplementation led to significant reductions in key inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP; Mean Difference = -5.11), high-sensitivity CRP (MD = -0.88), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) (MD = -0.85). These markers demonstrate validated associations with a wide range of chronic diseases. However, inter-study heterogeneity was very high (I² > 89%), which limits the strength of these conclusions.

The meta-analysis by Zhu et al. (2018) of 10 RCTs revealed ginger's powerful effect on glycemic control. Supplementation was observed to significantly lower fasting blood glucose (MD = -21.24 mg/dL, P < 0.001) and, significantly, also reduced glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (MD = -1.00, P < 0.001), a key indicator of long-term blood sugar management. These findings were supported by low heterogeneity, increasing their reliability.

The meta-analysis of 12 RCTs by Sheikhhossein et al. (2021) showed improved antioxidant status following ginger supplementation. The spice significantly reduced levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) (MD = -1.45, P = 0.001), a marker of lipid damage, while simultaneously increasing the activity of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase (GPx) (MD = 1.93, P = 0.029). However, it did not significantly increase total antioxidant capacity (TAC).

For nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, a meta-analysis by Viljoen et al. (2014) of 12 RCTs found that ginger was significantly more effective than placebo at reducing nausea symptoms (P = 0.0002). However, it did not have a statistically significant effect on the frequency of vomiting. This limitation was not consistently highlighted across all studies. A separate meta-analysis by Gaur et al. (2022) found that while ginger and vitamin B6 had comparable effects on vomiting, vitamin B6 was significantly better at improving total NVP symptom scores. Ginger also increased the risk of belching, a statistically significant side effect.

Notably, the typical ginger supplementation doses used in these trials ranged from 500 to 1,500 mg daily for NVP and 1 to 3 g daily for anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antidiabetic effects, highlighting a lack of standardization even in clinical research, let alone consumer supply. The authors emphasized substantial heterogeneity in some of the meta-analyses, particularly in inflammation studies, which further strengthens the need for robust public health guidelines and higher-quality trials.

The present systematic review synthesized the results of five meta-analyses and found that ginger is a generally safe and potentially effective therapeutic agent with a moderate to strong evidence base. Review findings robustly support its use as an effective anti-inflammatory, an adjunct therapy for managing T2D, a potent antioxidant, and a safe remedy for pregnancy-related nausea. However, its effects on vomiting are not consistently significant, and vitamin B6 appears more effective overall for NVP symptoms.

While the evidence is substantial, high heterogeneity in several of the underlying meta-analyses, variability in ginger formulation and dosing, and a risk of bias in studies (especially in NVP trials) suggest that further large-scale, high-quality trials are necessary. Future research and public health recommendations are needed to define optimal dosing, delivery formats, and patient populations.

A research team led by Dr. Juyeon Jung at the Bio-Nano Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB), has developed a nanobody-based technology that can precisely identify and attack only lung cancer cells, opening new possibilities for cancer therapy.

This breakthrough addresses the limitations of conventional chemotherapy by reducing harmful side effects while maximizing cancer cell-killing efficiency. In particular, it shows remarkable therapeutic potential for lung adenocarcinoma, a subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Lung cancer is one of the world's deadliest diseases, claiming millions of lives each year. Among its types, lung adenocarcinoma accounts for over 50% of cases and is characterized by late detection and high recurrence rates. Current chemotherapies often attack healthy cells as well, leading to severe side effects such as hair loss, nausea, and immune suppression, and frequently fail to deliver drugs precisely to cancer cells, reducing treatment effectiveness.

To overcome these challenges, the team developed the A5 nanobody - a miniature antibody that binds specifically to CD155, a protein found in high abundance on lung cancer cells. The A5 nanobody is roughly 10 times smaller than conventional antibodies, enabling it to penetrate deep into tissues. It binds selectively to cancer cells without affecting healthy cells, inhibiting lung cancer cell migration and invasion by more than 50%.

The researchers also engineered A5-LNP-DOX, which combines the A5 nanobody with liposomal capsules containing the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX). This design acts like a ""drone strike"", delivering the drug precisely to CD155 targets on the surface of cancer cells.

In experiments, A5-LNP-DOX delivered up to three times more drug into cancer cells than conventional methods, significantly enhancing cancer cell death while leaving healthy cells largely unharmed.

Tests in animal models and patient-derived organoids showed tumor size reductions of 70–90% and substantial increases in cancer cell death markers. No damage was detected in major organs such as the liver, heart, or kidneys, indicating a highly safe treatment profile.

Our study presents a new therapeutic strategy capable of precisely targeting cancer cells and delivering drugs effectively. We expect this nanobody-based approach to serve as a versatile platform for treating not only lung cancer but also a variety of other cancers, contributing greatly to the advancement of precision medicine.""

A review of 20 clinical trials reveals that turmeric/curcumin supplements can aid weight and fat loss in people with diabetes or prediabetes, especially when taken in higher doses or for longer durations.

Review: The effect of turmeric/curcumin supplementation on anthropometric indices in subjects with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus: A GRADE-assessed systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Image Credit: New Africa / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Nutrition & Diabetes, researchers assessed the effects of curcumin or turmeric supplementation on anthropometric indices in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or prediabetes. Diabetes imposes a significant societal burden, including indirect and direct consequences, such as work-related losses and diminished productivity.

The International Diabetes Federation estimates that diabetes-related costs will reach $1.03 trillion by 2030. Due to drawbacks of conventional treatments, such as dosage tolerance, side effects, and high costs, novel, cost-effective, and safe alternatives are being explored.

Herbal supplements are being widely used for medicinal purposes. Turmeric is commonly used as a culinary additive to enhance flavor and color. It ranks among the most common dietary supplements worldwide. However, its therapeutic effectiveness is limited due to low bioavailability. This has prompted interest in advanced delivery methods, like nanoparticles and co-administration with piperine, to improve absorption.

Curcumin, the main active component in turmeric, has beneficial effects on glycemic and anthropometric indices in metabolic diseases. It reduces the expression of transcription factors involved in fat production in the liver. Besides, curcumin exerts anti-obesity effects by repressing preadipocyte differentiation and inhibiting mitogenesis. It may also enhance fat burning, reduce fat accumulation, and increase energy expenditure.

In this study, researchers systematically reviewed and analyzed randomized controlled trials testing curcumin or turmeric in people with T2DM or prediabetes. Trials were included if they measured body weight, waist size, fat mass, or other indicators of body composition, and compared outcomes against a placebo. Studies involving pregnant women or combining curcumin with other treatments were excluded. The study followed international guidelines for systematic reviews and assessed the strength of evidence using the GRADE system.

The researchers reviewed 20 eligible trials involving 1,387 adults. Most used turmeric/curcumin doses between 80 and 2100 mg daily.

In people with T2DM, supplementation led to modest but statistically significant reductions in body weight, waist size, body fat percentage, and hip circumference. However, it did not clearly affect BMI or waist-to-hip ratio, and the certainty of evidence for most outcomes was low or very low.

In prediabetic individuals, turmeric/curcumin reduced body weight and waist size, but not BMI, and the evidence was of moderate certainty.

People who took high-absorption forms of curcumin or used it for at least 12 weeks tended to see greater benefits.

Only a few studies reported side effects, which were generally mild and included stomach discomfort, itching, or nausea.

Notably, the study also found that longer use (over 22 weeks) was linked to weight reductions, and higher doses (around 1500 mg/day) were associated with smaller waistlines.

This study suggests that turmeric/curcumin supplements may help reduce some markers of obesity, especially body weight and waist circumference, in people with prediabetes and T2DM. While encouraging, these effects were modest and often based on evidence rated as low in certainty.

The strongest results appeared when high-absorption formulations were used over more extended periods. More rigorous research is needed to confirm these effects and understand which types of patients benefit most.

Neurons in the gut produce a molecule that plays a pivotal role in shaping the gut's immune response during and after inflammation, according to a new study by Weill Cornell Medicine investigators. The findings suggest that targeting these neurons and the molecules they produce could open the door to new treatments for inflammatory bowel disease and other disorders driven by gut inflammation.

Hundreds of millions of neurons make up the enteric nervous system, the ""second brain"" of the body, where they orchestrate essential functions of the gut such as moving food through the intestines, nutrient absorption and blood flow. While this system is known for regulating these fundamental processes, its role in controlling intestinal inflammatory responses has remained far less clear.

In their study, reported August 15 in Nature Immunology, the investigators focused on group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), immune cells that reside within the linings of the gut. Their previous work revealed that ILC2s are a major source of a tissue-healing growth factor called amphiregulin and have the capacity to receive neuronal signals that modulate their function and can impact disease progression and recovery. In the new study, they demonstrated that the tissue-protective function of ILC2s depends on production of a molecule called adrenomedullin 2 (ADM2) from the enteric nervous system; administering the molecule expanded this group of ILC2s and provided therapeutic benefit in a preclinical model of inflammatory bowel disease, whereas loss of ADM2 signaling exacerbated disease due to the lack of these protective cells.

The enteric nervous system has long been neglected when thinking of how we can resolve detrimental intestinal inflammation. Our work suggests there may be a previously unknown neuro-immune mechanism driving intestinal healing responses.""

Dr. Jazib Uddin, lead author, an NIH Ruth L. Kirschstein postdoctoral fellow at Weill Cornell Medicine

Additionally, the investigators performed translational patient-based studies by analyzing human tissue and blood samples from Weill Cornell Medicine's Jill Roberts Institute for Research in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Live Cell Bank. This analysis revealed that patients with inflammatory bowel disease had elevated expression of ADM2 compared with control individuals and found that human ILC2s stimulated with ADM2 directly promoted production of tissue-protective amphiregulin. These findings indicate that the immune-nervous system communication identified in mice is also present in humans, highlighting the enteric nervous system as a promising therapeutic target for inflammatory bowel disease.

""The findings of this current study allow new insights into how the immune and nervous systems 'speak' to each other and coordinate complex processes, including tissue inflammation and repair, and offer the potential for new therapies targeting these neuro-immune interactions,"" said senior author Dr. David Artis, director of the Jill Roberts Institute for Research in Inflammatory Bowel Disease and the Michael Kors Professor in Immunology at Weill Cornell Medicine and co-director of the Allen Discovery Center for Neuro-immune Interaction.

A new study reveals that probiotics curb drug-resistant bacteria in premature babies, but antibiotics still drive resistance genes to spread, underscoring the urgent need for safer treatment strategies in NICUs.

Study: Impact of early life antibiotic and probiotic treatment on gut microbiome and resistome of very-low-birth-weight preterm infants. Image Credit: Ratchat / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Nature Communications, researchers determined how early antibiotic exposure and routine probiotic supplementation influence the gut microbiome, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), and multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogen dynamics in very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) preterm infants.

About one in ten babies is born early, and VLBW infants under 1500 g begin life fragile. In Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs), broad-spectrum antibiotics can be lifesaving, yet they may disrupt the gut community that trains immunity and blocks harmful microbes. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends probiotics containing specific bacterial strains for very preterm, exclusively human milk-fed infants, prompting a practical question: can routine probiotics offset antibiotic risks? Hospitals also face MDR infections that endanger fragile newborns. Understanding how probiotics and antibiotics shape the resistome (the collection of ARGs) can guide safer care, and hence, further research is needed.

This controlled sub-study from the Baby-Associated Microbiota of the Intestine (BAMBI) observational cohort followed 34 VLBW preterm infants under 33 weeks' gestation, all exclusively fed human milk or donor breastmilk, split into probiotic-supplemented (“PS”, receiving Bifidobacterium bifidum and Lactobacillus acidophilus [Infloran®]) and non-supplemented cohorts. Within each cohort, some infants received short empirical antibiotics (benzylpenicillin and/or gentamicin for a median of 3 days), while others did not. Fecal samples were collected weekly during weeks one to three. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing generated paired-end reads for assembly, and genome-resolved analyses reconstructed metagenome-assembled genomes alongside cultured isolates, enabling strain-level tracking.

Taxonomic and functional profiles were derived with established pipelines, and ARGs were identified against curated databases. Average nucleotide identity (ANI) and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) established relatedness and sequence types. To probe horizontal gene transfer (HGT), the team quantified plasmid replicons, modeled candidate transfer events, and performed an ex vivo infant-gut experiment using preterm-derived Enterococcus faecium donor strains and a plasmid-free, gentamicin-sensitive laboratory recipient. Infant fecal slurry lacking Enterococcus served as matrix; selective plating on gentamicin and confirmatory whole-genome sequencing (WGS) verified acquired resistance. Ordination, group-difference testing, and correlation analyses compared cohorts and antibiotic exposure groups, emphasizing meaningful contrasts. Culture work targeted Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, Klebsiella, and Escherichia species to complement sequencing.

Across three weeks, the probiotic-supplemented cohort was dominated by Bifidobacterium, driven by the administered Bifidobacterium bifidum, with active replication (Index of Replication (iRep) > 1.5), while the non-supplemented cohort showed higher representation of early-life pathobionts such as Klebsiella, Escherichia, Enterococcus, and Staphylococcus. Beneficial infant-associated species, including Bifidobacterium breve and Bifidobacterium longum, appeared earlier and at higher relative abundance with probiotics, consistent with human milk oligosaccharide use and colonization resistance. Functional pathway profiles diverged between cohorts beginning in week two, tracking these taxonomic differences.

The resistome showed that compared with non-supplemented infants, probiotic-supplemented infants carried fewer ARGs and fewer resistance classes. Genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides, macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramins, beta-lactams, trimethoprim, and tetracyclines were common, but fluoroquinolone and colistin resistance signatures were confined to non-supplemented infants. Notably, a colistin resistance gene (mcr-9.1) appeared in one non-supplemented sample, predating its formal discovery and underscoring hidden circulation of last-resort determinants. Short empirical antibiotics did not produce large alpha-diversity shifts, yet early tilts toward Klebsiella or Enterococcus were observed, especially in week one.

Correlation analyses linked higher Bifidobacterium abundance with fewer ARGs, whereas Enterococcus and Staphylococcus tracked with higher ARG loads. At the strain level, Enterococcus, Escherichia, Klebsiella, and Staphylococcus carried the densest resistance portfolios. None of the probiotic-cohort Klebsiella or Escherichia genomes met the definition of MDR (resistance to three or more classes), whereas 47.6% of non-supplemented Escherichia did. MLST highlighted clinically relevant sequence types (STs), including Escherichia coli ST1193 and Klebsiella pneumoniae ST432; Enterococcus faecalis and coagulase-negative staphylococci (e.g., S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus) also included STs previously linked to neonatal units. Plasmid analyses showed higher plasmid burdens in non-supplemented infants and a weak association between plasmid counts and ARG counts.

Predicted HGT events were more frequent after antibiotic exposure, showing that even short courses can favor the movement of mobile elements. Related Enterococcus strains circulated among unrelated infants within the same hospitals, consistent with nosocomial transmission. The ex vivo infant-gut model provided mechanistic support: a 137-kb plasmid carrying an aminoglycoside resistance gene transferred from Enterococcus faecium donors to a plasmid-free recipient, conferring gentamicin resistance, confirmed via WGS. Probiotics tilted the gut toward beneficial microbes and away from ARG-rich pathobionts, though they did not eliminate HGT risk, while antibiotic stewardship remained critical to curb plasmid-mediated spread of resistance in the nursery.

To summarize, in VLBW preterm infants, probiotic supplementation fostered Bifidobacterium-rich communities, reduced ARG burden, and limited MDR features compared with no probiotics. Yet Enterococcus persisted as a key reservoir, and short antibiotic courses increased the likelihood of HGT, particularly plasmid-mediated movement of resistance genes. Practically, pairing evidence-based probiotics with antibiotic stewardship and infection control can help protect this population. Longer follow-up and multi-site trials are needed to refine dosing, duration, and strain choice to maximize benefits while minimizing resistance risks. For families and NICUs, aligning feeding, hygiene, and prescribing is essential.

Rapid mixing accessories designed to conduct stopped flow measurements are utilized to characterize interactions and reactions occurring in solution. Reactants are expelled from syringes, mixed, and injected into a flow cell. The flow is subsequently stopped, and the ensuing reaction/interaction is monitored. If one of the reactants exhibits fluorescence, this phenomenon can be utilized to track the interaction.

However, intensity-based methods can be affected by fluctuations in the detected signal, such as those resulting from photobleaching. While this can be avoided by utilizing the fluorescence lifetime, data collection times have constrained its usage.

The recent introduction of significantly low deadtime electronics, combined with high repetition rate excitation sources, now facilitates efficient and rapid measurement of fluorescence decays. In such cases, the interaction of a fluorescent curcuminoid mixture is monitored with serum albumin via a stopped flow accessory on the DeltaFlex platform with DeltaDiode excitation at 100 MHz.

A typical stopped flow accessory is presented schematically in Figure 1. Driving the reactant syringes, either manually or mechanically, expels the reactants which are then rapidly mixed and introduced into the flow cell, replacing the existing liquid volume. A stop limits the volume entering the syringe and can be utilized to generate an electronic signal to initiate data collection, if configured.

Mixing reactions occurring on the millisecond timescale can be tracked with this method. Previous studies involving fluorescence have utilized intensity-based approaches. However, fluctuations in excitation source intensity and sample photobleaching can affect these types of measurements.

Fluorescence lifetime is beneficial because, along with its inherent sensitivity, it is an absolute measurement—unlike steady state fluorescence, which is relative. Moreover, the lifetime remains unaffected by dilution as the reactant liquids mix or if the sample photobleaches.

Until recently, instrumentation lacked the efficiency to obtain data on these timescales. However, the introduction of significantly low deadtime electronics, combined with high repetition rate excitation sources, now makes such measurements viable.

The kinetic TCSPC measurement mode, available in both the DeltaFlex and DeltaPro platforms, allows the acquisition of up to 10,000 time‐resolved fluorescence decays, with each histogram seamlessly collected in as little as 1 ms. The 100 MHz capability of the DeltaDiode is optimally matched to the significantly low dead time of the DeltaHub (10 ns). For short data collection times, this level of efficiency is necessary to achieve adequate data quality.

The stopped flow accessory fits into the standard cuvette (10 mm pathlength) holder in the DeltaFlex (Figure 2) using a modified sample chamber lid.

Using the DataStation control software, data acquisition can be initiated either via an external TTL signal from the stopped flow accessory (if configured) or manually within the software, in the kinetic TCSPC measurement mode.

The examination of curcuminoid interactions with proteins holds significance, as these compounds are being promoted for their potential health benefits. The role of serum albumin in the blood makes it a suitable model protein for observing this interaction.

In this experiment, a syringe was filled with a solution of curcuminoid in DMSO/buffer, with the other reactant syringe containing serum albumin in buffer. In this solvent mixture, the curcuminoids possess weak fluorescence and display a short fluorescence lifetime.

Upon interaction with the protein, both the fluorescence quantum yield and lifetime increase. To maximize photon collection, a repetition rate of 100 MHz was employed, and a 2 ms collection time per decay was utilized. Data acquisition was initiated in DataStation to provide a “background”, and the reactants were manually expelled.

Following analysis via DAS6 software, the change in average lifetime throughout the course of the experiment was plotted, as shown in Figure 3. This plot can be used to calculate kinetic rates if necessary.

Due to the limited photostability of curcuminoids, photostability is a risk when using these compounds in a small-volume flow cell with a high-intensity (and repetition rate) excitation source.

Although the fluorescence lifetime remains unaffected, a measurement of the intensity (obtained from the TCSPC measurement) will exhibit a decrease with time. This is demonstrated in a second measurement (conducted under similar settings), employing 5 ms per decay data collection time for the acquisition of the 10,000 time‐resolved fluorescence decay curves. This is illustrated in Figure 4.



Fig. 4. Comparison between intensity and lifetime data obtained from a stopped flow measurement with data collected every 5 ms. Image Credit: HORIBA

Figure 4 clearly shows that the fluorescence intensity decreases over time after the initial rise associated with the curcuminoids binding to the serum albumin. This is attributed to photobleaching. However, it is worth noting that the fluorescence lifetime remains stable. The influence of photobleaching has obvious implications if this kinetic process were to be analyzed with the intensity-based measurement.

Through the simple addition of a stopped flow accessory to the DeltFlex platform, the ability to monitor kinetic processes occurring on the millisecond timescale has been successfully demonstrated. This was operated in the kinetic TCSPC measurement mode, aided by the use of a high repetition rate excitation source combined with significantly low dead time electronics for efficient data collection.

In this study, the resulting data clearly shows the benefits of utilizing the fluorescence lifetime to obtain kinetics unaffected by sample photobleaching.

The most recent issue of Journal of the American Medical Association includes a landmark review highlighting innovative strategies to slow the biological aging process, an emerging approach with significant potential to prevent or delay multiple chronic diseases at once, one of the most pressing challenges in modern medicine today.

The review , co-authored by Steven R. Cummings, M.D., a senior physician-scientist at Sutter Health's Sequoia Center for the Science of Aging and internationally recognized leader in aging research, and led by Stephen B. Kritchevsky, Ph.D., of Wake Forest University School of Medicine, calls for a shift in medical thinking from treating one disease at a time, such as heart disease, cancer or kidney disease, to targeting the biology of aging itself. This approach, known as geroscience, aims to extend ""healthspan,"" the number of years people live free from disease and disability.

By 2050, the number of U.S. adults over age 65 will grow by more than 30 million. If we continue treating one disease at a time, the U.S. health system will be overwhelmed. A geroscience approach could help people live longer, healthier lives by delaying or preventing multiple conditions at once.""

Dr. Steven R. Cummings, M.D., senior physician-scientist, Sutter Health's Sequoia Center for the Science of Aging

Geroscience focuses on a person's biological age, measured by biological properties such as epigenetics, instead of one's calendar age. Dr. Cummings and other scientists at Sutter's San Francisco Coordinating Center (SFCC), led by Brian Chen, Ph.D., are testing geroscience principles in the care of Sutter patients. They are working to determine whether biological age, derived from fundamental pathways of aging, better predicts medical outcomes including hospitalization over one's calendar age. 

The review describes several promising therapies currently being studied, including metformin, a decades-old diabetes drug that may slow multiple aging-related processes; GLP-1 receptor agonists such as semaglutide, used for diabetes and obesity, which may mimic the effects of calorie restriction linked to longer life; and senolytics, a class of drugs that selectively clear senescent ""zombie"" cells that contribute to chronic inflammation and tissue damage.

While none of these therapies are yet U.S. FDA-approved to directly target aging, the authors note clinical trials are underway and could pave the way for new standards of care that preserve overall function and independence.

""Our research at the SFCC is studying pathways that can be modulated to potentially slow aging and promote a healthy lifespan for patients at Sutter and around the world,"" says Dr. Cummings.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Exploring the complex origins of endothelial cells in tumor angiogenesis","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250818/Exploring-the-complex-origins-of-endothelial-cells-in-tumor-angiogenesis.aspx","Mon, 18 Aug 2025 13:11:00 GMT","

This newly published review article offers a comprehensive examination of the complexities of tumor angiogenesis and the origins of endothelial cells (ECs) within tumors. Tumor angiogenesis, a critical process in cancer progression, is characterized by the formation of new blood vessels that sustain tumor growth by supplying oxygen and nutrients. Understanding the diverse sources and mechanisms of endothelial cell development is essential for improving anti-angiogenic therapies, which aim to block blood vessel formation and, consequently, hinder tumor proliferation.

This review delves into the origins of endothelial cells in both normal and tumor angiogenesis, revealing that while normal angiogenesis is typically a structured and regulated process, tumor angiogenesis is notably chaotic and disorganized. Tumor vascular endothelial cells (ECs) arise from various sources, including adjacent ECs, bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), and even cancer stem cells, which can differentiate into endothelial-like cells. Additionally, cancer-associated fibroblasts and immature dendritic cells may transdifferentiate into vascular ECs within the tumor microenvironment.

The article highlights that the dysregulation and heterogeneity of tumor blood vessels complicate the development of effective therapies. Although anti-angiogenic agents have been a pivotal element in cancer treatment, the limited efficacy and resistance of these therapies pose significant challenges. The review outlines the mechanisms of drug resistance, which include adaptive angiogenesis, alternative pathway activation, and genetic heterogeneity within endothelial cells. This resistance often results in the incomplete inhibition of blood vessel growth, allowing tumors to adapt and continue proliferating.

By investigating the molecular signaling pathways involved in tumor angiogenesis, including VEGF, PDGF, FGF, and ANG/Tie2 systems, the article underscores the importance of targeted therapeutic approaches that account for the diverse cellular origins and adaptive mechanisms of tumor endothelial cells. Innovations in therapy must consider the heterogeneous nature of tumor vasculature to overcome resistance and enhance clinical outcomes.

This review offers a nuanced understanding of endothelial cell biology in tumors. By focusing on the origins and adaptive mechanisms of tumor vasculature, it sets the stage for the development of more precise and effective therapeutic strategies to combat cancer.

The meta-analysis of 33 studies, the first of its kind, looked at the relationship between sensitivity and common mental health problems such as depression and anxiety. Researchers found there was a significant, positive relationship between the two, concluding that highly sensitive people are more likely to experience depression and anxiety compared to those who are less sensitive.

In the study, sensitivity was defined as a personality trait that reflects people's capacity to perceive and process environmental stimuli such as bright lights, subtle changes in the environment and other peoples' moods. Often overlooked in mental health studies and clinical practice, which tend to focus on neuroticism and its association with mental health conditions, this research shows that understanding a person's sensitivity level is important and can have therapeutic implications. 

For example, people with more sensitive personality traits may be more likely to benefit from treatment plans which involve techniques such as applied relaxation and mindfulness, which can also prevent relapse. 

This is the most extensive systematic review on sensitivity and mental health in adolescents and adults to date, and is the first ever meta-analysis on the topic to estimate the impact of this relationship. We found positive and moderate correlations between sensitivity and various mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, agoraphobia and avoidant personality disorder. Our findings suggest that sensitivity should be considered more in clinical practice which could be used to improve diagnosis of conditions.""

Tom Falkenstein, psychotherapist and PhD student at Queen Mary University of London

""In addition, our findings could help improve treatment for these individuals. Around 31% of the general population are considered highly sensitive, and, as our findings show, are more likely to respond better to some psychological interventions than less sensitive individuals. Therefore, sensitivity should be considered when thinking about treatment plans for mental health conditions. Our work shows it is crucial that the awareness of sensitivity is improved among mental health care professionals, so clinicians and practitioners can recognise the trait in their patients, and tailor treatment to their sensitivity.""

Michael Pluess, Professor in Developmental Psychology at University of Surrey and Visiting Professor at Queen Mary University of London said:

""This is the first meta-analysis providing robust evidence that highly sensitive people are more prone to common mental health problems. However, it is important to remember that highly sensitive people are also more responsive to positive experiences, including psychological treatment. Our results provide further evidence that sensitive people are more affected by both negative and positive experiences and that the quality of their environment is particularly important for their well-being.""

The systematic review and meta analysis of 33 studies was carried out by an academic team from several universities including Queen Mary University and the University of Surrey.

New research from the Charles Perkins Centre at the University of Sydney has uncovered a new biological pathway that may help explain why people with type 2 diabetes are more prone to developing dangerous blood clots, potentially paving the way for future treatments that reduce their cardiovascular risk.

The study, led by Associate Professor Freda Passam from the Central Clinical School and Associate Professor Mark Larance from the School of Medical Sciences, was published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation. A protein called SEC61B has been found to be significantly increased in the platelets of people with type 2 diabetes. The protein appears to disrupt calcium balance inside platelets, making them more likely to clump together and form clots.

Importantly, the researchers showed that blocking SEC61B activity with an antibiotic – anisomycin – reduced platelet clumping in human samples and animal models.

People living with type 2 diabetes are vulnerable to increased risk of blood clots. These exciting findings identify a whole new way to reduce this risk and help prevent life-threatening complications like heart attack and stroke.""

Associate Professor Freda Passam from the Central Clinical School, University of Sydney

In Australia alone, nearly 1.2 million people were living with type 2 diabetes in 2021. The condition is more prevalent in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and in rural and regional communities.

""Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death in this group, partly due to the heightened activity of platelets – the tiny blood cells that help form clots. This heightened platelet sensitivity to clotting also makes traditional anti-coagulant treatments less effective in people with type 2 diabetes, limiting the options to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.""

The research team used advanced proteomic techniques to study human and mouse platelets, discovering that SEC61B contributes to calcium leakage from stores of the mineral within platelets, which in turn makes platelets more reactive.

While treatments targeting SEC61B are still in early stages, the researchers believe pre-clinical trials in animals could begin within 1–2 years, with potential therapies for patients on the horizon in the next decade.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New therapies for acute kidney injury show promise","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250818/New-therapies-for-acute-kidney-injury-show-promise.aspx","Mon, 18 Aug 2025 06:54:00 GMT","

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a severe renal disorder affecting approximately 10%-15% of hospitalized patients and up to 50% in intensive care units (ICUs). Its pathogenesis involves complex inflammatory regulatory mechanisms. As core components of the cytokine network, interleukins (ILs) exert pleiotropic effects in AKI development, extensively participating in inflammation, fibrosis, tissue injury repair, and remote organ damage.

During AKI progression, distinct IL members execute diverse biological effects through unique signaling pathways. Pro-inflammatory ILs such as IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-12, IL-17A, and IL-18 exacerbate AKI, while protective ILs including IL-2, IL-10, IL-13, IL-27, and IL-37 mitigate injury. Certain ILs, such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-9, IL-11, IL-22, and IL-33, exhibit dual roles.

Emerging therapeutic strategies targeting ILs or their receptors—particularly monoclonal antibodies and extracellular vesicle technology—show significant promise. Consequently, understanding these mechanisms is critical for developing innovative therapies and improving outcomes in AKI patients.

The interleukin (ILs) family is primarily produced by T cells, B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, endothelial cells, and epithelial cells. Most ILs are small polypeptides or glycoproteins with molecular weights ranging from ‌15-30 kDa‌‌. Although amino acid sequences vary significantly across different ILs, members within the same family frequently exhibit ‌conserved sequence regions. Critically, the structure of ILs is intrinsically linked to their function-their unique ‌spatial conformation‌ and ‌structural domains‌ empower them to execute diverse biological roles within the immune system (Figure 1)‌.

Mechanisms underlying the exacerbation of AKI progression. IL-1α and IL-1β exacerbate inflammation and tissue damage in diverse AKI models (e.g., cisplatin-induced, ischemic) by activating the ‌nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway.IL-8 (CXCL8) recruits neutrophils through ‌CXCR1/2 receptors‌, promoting inflammatory responses, tubular cell damage, senescence, and fibrosis‌.

Elevated plasma IL-8 levels serve as a biomarker for predicting severe AKI‌.IL-12 aggravates AKI by enhancing ‌dendritic cell maturation‌ and amplifying the release of multiple inflammatory mediators‌.IL-17A worsens injury in sepsis-associated and cisplatin-induced AKI by increasing pro-inflammatory cytokines, inducing ‌neutrophil infiltration‌, and triggering tubular cell apoptosis‌.

It further promotes subsequent renal fibrosis‌.IL-18 is significantly elevated in the urine of AKI patients, serving as a reliable early biomarker‌. It exacerbates sepsis-, nephrotoxic-, and ischemia-reperfusion-induced AKI by amplifying ‌inflammatory cascades‌‌.IL-36α contributes to AKI pathogenesis through NF-κB pathway activation and upregulation of IL-6/TNF-α (Figure 2)‌.

Mechanisms underlying the inhibition of AKI progression. Low-dose IL-2 protects against ischemia-reperfusion-induced renal damage. Treatment with ‌IL-2/anti-IL-2 antibody complexes (IL-2C)‌ or ‌IL-2/IL-33 fusion protein (IL-233)‌ significantly attenuates ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and nephrotoxic AKI, improving renal function while reducing cellular apoptosis and oxidative stress.

IL-10 mediates anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory responses through ‌JAK/STAT pathway activation‌.IL-15 enhances survival signaling in renal tubular epithelial cells via ‌JAK/STAT and PI3K/Akt pathways‌, mitigating cisplatin-induced apoptosis.

The nephroprotective effect of IL-17E (IL-25) involves ‌enhanced type 2 innate lymphoid cell (ILC2s) activity‌, promotion of M2 macrophage polarization, and suppression of M1 macrophages.Additionally, IL-13, IL-27, IL-35, IL-37, and IL-38 demonstrate anti-inflammatory potential and renal protective properties (Figure 3).

The dual mechanisms of action of ILs in AKI. IL-4 primarily exerts biological effects through activation of ‌JAK-STAT and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways‌. It facilitates ‌M2 macrophage polarization‌ to accelerate renal tubular repair, demonstrating protective effects in IRI-AKI models, yet concurrently drives renal fibrotic progression.IL-6 activates ‌STAT3 via classical and trans-signaling pathways‌, participating in anti-inflammatory responses.

Paradoxically, IL-6 deficiency improves renal function and reduces inflammatory infiltration in both IRI and HgCl2-induced AKI models, indicating its pro-inflammatory role in AKI progression.IL-33 activates immunity through the ‌ST2/MyD88 pathway‌, while also exhibiting renoprotective effects via promotion of ‌ILC2s, M2 macrophages, Tregs, and Th2 responses‌. Its net effect depends on dosage, duration, and molecular conformation.Additionally, ‌IL-9 and IL-11‌ demonstrate context-dependent dual modulation in AKI (Figure 4).

‌During the pathological transition from AKI to CKD, the role of ILs shifts from acute injury response towards chronic fibrotic remodeling.‌ IL-1β can induce renal tubular epithelial cell senescence and pro-fibrotic factor release in hypoxic microenvironments.

IL-18 exacerbates fibrosis by promoting inflammatory infiltration and M2 macrophage transformation. Conversely, IL-10 can suppress inflammation and M1 polarization, while IL-22 antagonizes TGF-β1-induced fibrosis by activating Jagged1/Notch1 signaling. The pro-fibrotic effects of ILs play a crucial driving role in AKI-CKD progression.

Targeted therapies based on ILs signaling pathways have emerged as novel strategies for AKI intervention. The IL-1 family fusion protein Rilonacept (neutralizing IL-1α/β) and IL-17A/C neutralizing antibodies can effectively alleviate inflammatory responses. IL-18 inhibitors simultaneously reduce renal tubular apoptosis and delay fibrosis, while IL-22 modulation specifically alleviates cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity.

Additionally, IL-33 monoclonal antibodies can prevent cardiac injury following AKI. Compared to interventions targeting ILs, therapies targeting ILs receptors may offer greater advantages by blocking multiple pathogenic ligands (e.g., IL-1α/β) and comprehensively terminating downstream signaling pathways.

Furthermore, engineered extracellular vesicle (EV) technology has opened new avenues: IL-10-containing EVs enhance IL-10 targeting and reduce the risk of AKI-to-CKD progression, while IL-37-encapsulated neutrophil membrane vesicles (N-MVs) significantly improve renal ischemia-reperfusion injury by promoting angiogenesis and exerting anti-inflammatory effects. These advances highlight the considerable therapeutic potential of targeting ILs for AKI treatment.

The authors comprehensively elaborate on the diversity and complexity of ILs' roles in AKI pathogenesis. The review also describes how ILs coordinate immune cell activation and mediate crosstalk between these cells and renal parenchymal cells, establishing a balance between pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory responses and injury/repair processes.

ILs-based targeted therapeutic strategies (e.g., specifically targeting particular ILs or their receptors) and emerging EV technologies demonstrate significant potential for AKI treatment.

A research group led by The University of Osaka has discovered that the DNA repair enzyme Polβ plays a crucial role in protecting the developing brain from harmful mutations. The study found that a lack of Polβ leads to a significant increase in small insertions and deletions of DNA, known as indels near CpG sites, which are important regulatory regions in genes. This accumulation of mutations could contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders.

The human brain undergoes intricate developmental processes, meticulously guided by genetic blueprints. However, DNA damage can occur during these stages, potentially leading to irreversible mutations in nerve cells if not properly repaired. While the occurrence of such mutations has been recognized, the precise mechanisms governing their suppression remained elusive.

This study demonstrates that Polβ is essential in preventing a specific type of mutation known as insertion-deletion (indel) mutations near CpG sites, regions of the genome with high gene regulatory activity. These sites undergo dynamic changes in methylation, a chemical modification of DNA, during brain development. The researchers found that Polβ repairs the DNA damage associated with demethylation at these sites, preventing the accumulation of indel mutations. In the absence of Polβ, indel mutations near CpG sites increased approximately ninefold.

This research highlights a previously unknown role of Polβ in safeguarding the integrity of the genome during brain development. The findings suggest that deficiencies in Polβ could contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders arising from accumulated mutations. This research provides a new molecular basis for understanding the origin of brain developmental disorders and may contribute to preventative techniques in the future.

Our study is the first in the world to demonstrate the crucial role of Polβ in preventing mutations in developing nerve cells. We believe this finding offers a new perspective on the causes of neurodevelopmental disorders and opens up exciting avenues for neuroscience, cancer, and aging research.""

The team plans to further investigate the link between Polβ dysfunction and specific neurodevelopmental conditions.

A new study warns that contamination from laboratory reagents could be misleading scientists worldwide in their hunt for emerging infectious diseases. Researchers found that silica membranes-commonly used in nucleic acid extraction kits-can harbor parvoviruses and other viral contaminants, creating false virus–host associations in metagenomic sequencing (mNGS) data. These misleading links can affect clinical diagnostics, zoonotic surveillance, and public health responses.

In mNGS analyses of patient samples from multiple regions in China, the team detected dozens of parvovirus sequences that closely matched viruses previously attributed to bats, birds, pangolins, and other animals. Follow-up investigations revealed that these sequences originated not from patients but from the silica columns and certain sampling tubes used in laboratory workflows. Testing across 28 commercial kits showed contamination from 13 different viral families, with Parvoviridae being the most frequent.

To address this widespread problem, the researchers developed the Panoramic Virus Discovery Data Chain (PVDDC)-a high-quality, traceable dataset integrating viral genomic data, laboratory workflows, reagent records, and host associations. Combining big data curation with large language model ChatGPT‐4o, PVDDC standardizes virus–host relationships and enables contamination tracing. They also launched the Parvovirus Database (ParvoDB，http://web3.mgc.ac.cn:8080/parvodb/), a public platform with tools for strain search, human parvovirus records, contamination monitoring, and host–virus network.

By applying this framework, the team found that many parvoviruses linked to humans in public databases lack robust experimental evidence and may instead be artifacts of reagent contamination. Only a small subset-such as human bocavirus and parvovirus B19-has strong, well-supported human associations.

Importantly, the PVDDC framework is not limited to parvoviruses-it can be adapted to investigate and mitigate contamination for a wide range of viral taxa, making it a versatile tool for improving the reliability of mNGS-based pathogen surveillance. The authors encourage researchers worldwide to contribute contamination evidence to ParvoDB, helping to expand its scope and strengthen global capacity to detect, trace, and correctly attribute viruses in clinical and environmental studies.

Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) is a progressive eye disease characterized by choroidal neovascularization and subretinal hemorrhage and exudation, leading to vision impairment. Current first-line treatment for nAMD are anti-VEGF agents, which has shown promising therapeutics outcomes.

Despite their efficacy, the anti-VEGF therapies require frequent intravitreal (IVT) injections and regular clinic visits to sustain their benefits, bringing significant challenges for long-term patient compliance and real-world effectiveness. As such, emerging long-term therapeutics strategies for nAMD need to be further studied.

A groundbreaking study titled ""An Engineered Intravitreal Injection Retinal-Pigment-Epithelium-Tropic Adeno-Associated Virus Vector Expressing a Bispecific Antibody Binding VEGF-A and ANG-2 Rescues Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration in Animal Models and Patients"" has unveiled a promising new gene therapy approach for treating nAMD. AAV is a widely used gene delivery tool in ocular gene therapy due to its safety and ability to provide long-term transgene expression in retinal cells.

This research highlights the development of a novel engineered AAV vector (AAV-RPE) as well as a bispecific antibody (VEGF-Ang2) targeting both vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and angiopoietin-2 (ANG-2), two key drivers of abnormal blood vessel growth and leakage in nAMD. A single intravitreal injection of the AAV gene therapy (XMVA09) contributes to long-term expression of the therapeutic antibody, especially in RPE cells.

Preclinical study demonstrated that XMVA09 can effectively suppress neovascularization and vascular leakage in CNV models in both mice and non-human primates (NHPs). In mouse CNV models, compared to AAV2.7m8-aflibercept (ADVM022), XMVA09, AAV-RPE-aflibercept, and AAV2.7m8-VEGF-Ang2 show a significant advantage in therapeutic efficacy (Fig.1).

NHP studies indicated that the gene therapy is safe with no evidence of retinal toxicity and low immunogenicity. Moreover, an investigator-initiated clinical trial demonstrated that the gene therapy is well-tolerated and of significant clinical benefit in nAMD patients.

Collectively, the research represents an innovative gene therapy, which offers a safe and effective treatment option for nAMD. The research team plans to advance to larger clinical trials to confirm safety and efficacy. If successful, this approach could also be adapted for other retinal diseases driven by angiogenesis.

Previous research indicates that a diabetes diagnosis within a family may improve health behaviours at the household level, since one person having diabetes may increase awareness of diabetes risk factors (such as obesity, high blood pressure and abnormal blood fats) in the household. However, most of this research focuses on spouses/partners and on individuals with full-blown type 2 diabetes, and does not include other household members such as adolescent children or those at high risk for diabetes.

To assess household diabetes risk to support family-based diabetes prevention, in this new study the authors used electronic health record (EHR) and administrative data to identify household members, aged at least 10 years, of adult patients with prediabetes who are co-insured and reside in the same household to evaluate diabetes risk factors among household members.

This was a new study technique studying households of people with prediabetes - a state in which a person has an abnormal blood sugar profile, and would usually progress to full blown diabetes without treatment and/or changes to lifestyle. Thus is it has the potential to focus on both stopping the index person progressing to type 2 diabetes, and detecting early risk in other household members. This is especially important given the rising incidence of diabetes among adolescents and young adults.

The researchers identified an index cohort of adults with prediabetes (fasting plasma glucose [FPG] 100-125 mg/dL or glycated haemoglobin 5.7-6.4% [39-46 mmol/mol]) and their co-insured household members in 2023. The data used was from Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) - a large, integrated health care delivery system that provides primary and specialty care, outpatient and inpatient services, and pharmacy and laboratory services for some 4.5 million patients in Northern California, USA.

Index cohort and household member characteristics including demographics, enrolment, neighbourhood, and healthcare utilisation data including blood glucose screening tests were studied for both the index cases and their household members.

Age and sex-specific body mass index (BMI) for children/ young people aged 2-19 years was calculated using the Center for Disease Control's (CDC) 2022 SAS program for CDC Growth Charts. Diabetes risk factors were calculated for those children aged 10 years and older. The American Diabetes Association recommends risk-based screening for type 2 diabetes in children after onset of puberty or age 10 years who are living with overweight or obesity and have one or more additional risk factors for diabetes.

For adults aged 18 and older, diabetes risk factors were defined as: BMI of over 25 or a history of gestational diabetes, hypertension, abnormal blood fats, or cardiovascular disease; or, instead of these factors, prediabetes based on laboratory values. For children aged 10-17, diabetes risk factors were overweight (age and sex-specific BMI in the top 15%) or obesity (age and sex-specific BMI in the top 5%).

Among 356,626 index adults with prediabetes, the mean age was 51 years, and 52% identified as female. The index cohort included 30% Non-Hispanic White, 28% Asian, 27% Hispanic, 9% Black, 1% Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, and 5% multiracial patients. Obesity was present in 59% of the index cohort.

Household composition varied, with 48% identified as one-person households and 52% living in multi-resident households. Over three quarters of multi-resident households (140,398) had at least one household member with additional diabetes risk factors. The authors identified 364,563 co-residing household members. Of these, 238,247 were adults (aged 18 years and over) and 126,316 children aged 17 years and under. Of the children, 72,697 were aged 10-17 years. The mean age of adult household members was 42 years and 10 years for child household members.

Diabetes risk factors were identified in 65% of adults and 35% of children with overweight/obesity being the most identified risk factor present in 55% of adults and 34% of child household members aged 10-17 years. An abnormal blood sugar profile was present in 32% of adult household members. In terms of absolute numbers, for adult household members, 48,297 (20% of adults) had a prediabetes laboratory (blood test) result and 28,997 (12% of adults) had blood test results showing full-blown type 2 diabetes.

A total of 285 child household members (less than 1% of children) had evidence of type 2 diabetes. Evidence of diabetes was assessed for household members 10-17 years using the health system's diabetes registry – which puts a person on the register and records them as having diabetes but may not include blood test results, formal diagnosis or exclude the child as having type 1 diabetes. For this study, the authors did not examine laboratory results for children and therefore did not identify prediabetes among them, although this is planned for future analyses.

While the study identified almost 30,000 adults showing full blown type 2 diabetes living in the same households as adults with prediabetes, the authors explain the study cannot say whether or not they were already diagnosed.

Of course, many of these people will have been diagnosed with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, but a significant number could be unaware of their diagnosis and thus could be identified by our study. These are huge numbers of people identified with both prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. If even only a small proportion of these are newly diagnosed, this would make a significant public health impact.""

Dr Tainayah Thomas, Assistant Professor, Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University

Dr. Thomas added, ""For the children, parents might consider doing further tests in those cases where the children are living with overweight or obesity and have diabetes risk factors, but have not yet been diagnosed. It is also, of course, an opportunity to make lifestyle changes to reduce the chances of metabolic complications in both adults and children.""

Dr Thomas concluded, ""To our knowledge, this novel study is the first to describe the use of electronic health record-based measures to assess household diabetes risk for adults with prediabetes. Our study highlights that diabetes risk is clustered within households; however, very few studies and health system prevention programs enrol households/families, reflecting a missed opportunity for population-level diabetes prevention.""

She added, ""All health systems could use this approach as a data-driven strategy to better and more systematically identify people at high risk for diabetes. this strategy could allow health systems to identify and tailor diabetes prevention messaging and programs to entire households instead of just individuals.""

The next steps planned by Dr Thomas and her team include further investigations of household members, including if they assess follow-up care (diagnosis of diabetes or other conditions, enrolment in lifestyle interventions, and prescription of glucose-lowering medications).

Trinity Rodman insists that both she and her club are learning from past errors to help put persistent injury woes behind her. 

Slowly but surely, Trinity Rodman is making a triumphant return to football.

After a lengthy spell on the sidelines with a back injury, the U.S. forward made her long-awaited comeback earlier this month (3 August).

It has been a turbulent time for the 23-year-old, who Washington Spirit head coach Adrián González insists is “feeling good” again.

“She's doing good; we are just building that progression, being smart and having good communication with her,” he told the media ahead of the Spirit's recent 2-22 draw with Racing Louisville.

“She's feeling good, she's not in pain – we don't want to rush in terms of getting her a lot of minutes, so she needs time, and we need to respect that.”

Rodman marked her return in dramatic fashion, an emphatic stoppage-time winner in a 2-1 thriller clinching all three points against the Portland Thorns.

It was the perfect re-introduction to fans at Audi Field – and a reminder of the calibre of player they have on their hands.

“That was the hardest thing I've ever had to go through, with the injury and everything,” the visibly emotional forward said at full-time, as cited in The Guardian.

“Being back, especially at [our] home stadium with the crowd behind me, scoring a goal like that… you saw how I buried it, I was not going to miss.

“I'm just really happy to be back. I missed the team, I missed doing what I love, so [I'm feeling] joy.”

A post shared by U.S. Soccer WNT (@uswnt)

Rodman's injury issues involving her back is not something new, rather something that has persisted in recent years.

Recurring problems over the last few seasons has been a bone of contention when it comes to her availability both internationally and domestically.

As difficult as she found it to be sidelined for four months, it has afforded her the time needed to work back to full fitness.

“We're doing a lot better at managing it this time,” she said after her first game back.

“I want to play, the team wants me to play, [and] fans want to see me play.

“I am learning from my mistakes; the team and staff are learning from the mistakes we made – we're going to ease into it so I can be healthy for the playoffs because that's important.”

Currently in fourth and eight points clear of ninth, the Spirit are in cruise control of their Championship hopes with just 10 games of the regular campaign remaining.

The American will also be eyeing a return to the United States Women's National Team (USWNT) camp in October, having not featured for them since the SheBelieves Cup in April.","{'href': 'https://www.olympics.com', 'title': 'Olympics.com'}","soccer"

﻿So...is it a problem or is not? This is confusing messaging.

Bayern Munich supervisory board member Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has made his support of the new format of the FIFA Club World Cup very well known in the past. As with many supporters of this format change, however, he is confronted with one of the new format's biggest critiques: The added strain in puts on players by getting them to play more games.

Rummenigge's response to this critique, posed by German newspaper kicker is as follows:

“I wouldn't overdramatize it. As a player, I would have been happy to participate in such a tournament. Of course, this season brings more games thanks to the Club World Cup, but this tournament only takes place every four years,” the former Bayern CEO said, as captured by @iMiaSanMia. “And many players—together with their agents—have contributed to this situation and set the trap for themselves. They demand ever-increasing salaries, which forces clubs to seek additional revenue streams. That's why new formats are emerging. On the other hand, I see little willingness from them to forgo salary. That's a contradiction that should be clearly identified.”

One one hand, Rummenigge says he would have been happy to play in the new Club World Cup. On the other, he refers to all of this as a “trap”. That seems rather like another contradiction that should be clarified.

As for the salary issue, he has been rather vocal in these beliefs for years now. Of course it is easy to see how the revenue from the Club World Cup- reported to be nearly €50 million could help pay for these salaries. But this mad scramble to find new revenue sources cannot be the solution moving forward. Some sort of solution needs to be reached, however possible.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Maresca responds to claims his team struggled because of Club World Cup fatigue","https://chelsea.news/2025/08/maresca-summer-fatigue-question/","Mon, 18 Aug 2025 05:45:00 GMT","

Chelsea's summer has been the subject of much debate among fans and pundits ever since the end of last season.

The Blues played at the Club World Cup through June and July, had just a few weeks off and then returned for a friendly double header last weekend before their Premier League campaign kicked off against Crystal Palace yesterday afternoon.

No team has even really had to deal with a summer like that before – and Chelsea did it all on the back of an exceptionally long season.

The assumption was that the players coming back without much of a break and with just 10 days training might struggle – but the evidence from the friendlies was that they still looked good. However things were far more sluggish against Palace yesterday.

Enzo Maresca was asked about this in his press conference yesterday, and denied his team had looked fatigued in comparison to their opponents, who had had a more conventional preseason:

“I don't think so, because until the end we competed. We tried to win the game. I think we had some chances at the end with Estevao, with Andrey Santos. So that showed that probably we compete overall quite good,” the Chelsea boss said.

“For sure, they already played, I think, seven, eight games. And for us, last week we played two games, but we tried to share minutes. So the real game for us was today. But for sure, slowly, slowly we're going to be better.”

So he slightly contradicts himself there, but we know what he means.

It's true that a lot of our players have had this exceptional summer, but there are also squad players and new additions who haven't had quite the same punishing schedule, and a squad like ours should be able to compete at a high level despite all this.

Parker Avery

  Sports


Thousands of fans clad in blue and black flocked through the streets of Atlanta on Monday, June 16, heading towards Mercedes-Benz Stadium, the site of a first-round match in the newly reimagined FIFA Club World Cup. The match, between the English Premier League's Chelsea Football Club and American MLS club Los Angeles FC, was the first of six matches slated to be held in Atlanta before the final in New York on July 13.

Soccer's international governing body, FIFA, has increased the number of clubs in the competition from 7 to 32, all competing to be crowned champions of the world. The tournament is being hosted by the United States, where several stadiums across the country are welcoming clubs from every inhabited continent.

Previous iterations of the tournament were held annually between the sole winners of each of the six regional confederations' international club competitions, plus a club from the host country. However, as the number of clubs in the competition increased, FIFA changed the competition to be held every four years.

FIFA is also offering a massive $1 billion prize pool, split between clubs based on performance and participation. European teams receive a minimum of $12.81 million, and South American teams receive $15.21 million just for showing up to the competition. Additionally, The Athletic has reported that FIFA has spent over $50 million on marketing to boost ticket sales.

The competition has never been a big presence in world football, with clubs and fans typically viewing it as more of an additional bonus competition after beating their continental rivals, but with these massive changes to the competition and enormous prize pool, it seems that FIFA aims to remake the competition's reputation and cement it as the premier club competition in the world. FIFA's objective, however, is far from easy to achieve. 

The new competition format has faced criticism from fans, players and managers alike. One of the biggest criticisms of the tournament is that it adds 63 matches to an already crowded competition calendar.

For European teams, the competition is set at the end of their season, where most compete in three national competitions as well as European competition that can last until the end of May. For several North and South American clubs, the problem can be even worse, as the competition is placed right in the middle of their national season, not to mention the international break immediately preceding the competition, during which many of the top players are called up to represent their nations.

This schedule is grueling for players and takes away from the training time that the clubs' national rivals are currently enjoying, potentially harming their current or upcoming season.

“I think it will have a huge impact, and it will give Liverpool and Arsenal a huge advantage in the next season to not be there,” said Thomas Tuchel, the English national team manager, on how the two English teams, Chelsea and Manchester City, will be affected by the competition.

Perhaps more concerning for FIFA is the low fan adoption of the tournament. At the match last Monday, only 22,137 seats of Mercedes-Benz's 71,000 capacity were filled, and the lack of attendance is not just in Atlanta. According to the BBC, over 400,000 seats have been left empty so far at Club World Cup matches across the country.

Some matches, however, have been able to draw large crowds, including the match between European heavyweights Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid. Matches featuring Mexican and South American teams have also had higher attendance, potentially indicating more investment from these clubs, who feel like they have something to prove against favored European clubs. Still, stadiums struggle to reach capacity at any of these games.

Despite the poor attendance and controversy, the match last Monday between Chelsea and LAFC was a decent showing from both teams, but perhaps not the superbly dominating performance many would have expected from Chelsea.

The first 30 minutes of the match saw Chelsea hold on to the bulk of possession and force a few hasty saves from ex-Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, who was once again under pressure from old rivals. The scoring opened after Cole Palmer connected with Nicolas Jackson on the halfway line, who himself played a precise pass toward Pedro Neto to beat LAFC left-back Ryan Hollingshead. Neto navigated past defenders sliding in and chose to smash it in the bottom right corner instead of passing to Marc Cucurella waiting at the far post. Chelsea 1, LAFC 0.

LAFC were able to put up a bit more offense in the second half with their first clean-cut attempt on goal in the 57th minute, which Robert Sánchez was forced to kick away. In the 64th minute, Chelsea brought on their newly acquired signing, Liam Delap, who was met with much anticipation from the crowd, and he quickly justified his £30 million fee.

In the 79th minute, Palmer played Delap through on the right wing, who turned and played an arching cross towards Fernández. Fernández took a touch under pressure before poking it past Lloris. Chelsea 2, LAFC 0.

Chelsea held on to their 2-0 lead until full-time, earning three valuable points to draw level with Brazilian side Flamengo in Group D of the competition. The match itself was emblematic of the tournament as a whole. Both sides had moments of quality, but ultimately, there wasn't much that got fans out of their seats.

Chelsea went on to lose 3-1 in a second-half collapse to Flamengo in their second match, which saw the Brazilian side secure their place in the knockout stage, while LAFC lost 1-0 to Tunisian side Espérance, knocking LAFC out of the competition.","{'href': 'https://nique.net', 'title': 'nique.net'}","soccer"

Brace yourselves, because FIFA is cooking up another stroke of...genius? According to The Guardian biennial Club World Cup could be starting in 2029 — that's every two years, folks. Just when you thought the football calendar couldn't get any more crammed, it's looking to shoehorn in yet another tournament, much to the unbridled joy of... well, mostly Real Madrid and any club that missed out on this year's colossal cash injection.

This summer, the US hosted the inaugural expanded 32-team Club World Cup, which Chelsea clinched, earning a cool £85m.

The new-look tournament was sort of a success; Chelsea seemed to have a good time, as did US President Donald Trump, who felt the desire to stay with the players for the trophy lift in a comical moment that won't be forgotten any time soon. Outside of that, many were still not sold on the concept thanks to it feeling largely unnecessary.

Naturally, other European behemoths are now practically drooling over those Saudi-funded revenue streams and want in on the action. Liverpool, in particular, were reportedly gutted, having met the qualifying criteria only to be unceremoniously snubbed because FIFA decreed two English teams were quite enough (Chelsea and Manchester City, those coveted spot-holders).

While FIFA sources are currently playing a masterful game of coy regarding a 2027 tournament, they've got their eye on 2031 for another grand old bash. Their hands are tied until 2030, thanks to a rather inconvenient memorandum of understanding with the European Clubs Association. But after that? The global calendar is apparently wide open for a ""good old-fashioned negotiation,"" which sounds suspiciously like ""FIFA does precisely what FIFA wants.""

Of course, this whole two-year shindig is ruffling some serious feathers. World Leagues, a rather vocal lobby group that includes the Premier League, is already squaring up to sue FIFA for ""abuse of dominance"" – essentially, for not asking nicely before redecorating everyone's schedules.

Premier League chief executive Richard Masters weighed in with a perfectly reasonable point: FIFA is supposed to regulate the global game and international football, not crash the club party. He's asking for a ""seat at the table,"" which sounds suspiciously like ""a chance to yell at them for a bit."" Meanwhile, you can practically hear the passive-aggressive emails pinging between him and the Premier League's biggest clubs.

In a move that's either utterly genius or pure, unadulterated madness, FIFA might even contemplate scrapping the June international break to make room for this shiny new Club World Cup. UEFA, predictably, is clutching its pearls because that's precisely when it hosts the Nations League finals. It's a delicate dance of power, money, and who can shout the loudest.

Oh, and because FIFA loves consistency (sometimes), they're also mulling over upping the Club World Cup from 32 to a staggering 48 teams, just like the men's and women's World Cups. More teams, more games, more money, less rest.

It's also planning formal bidding processes for future tournaments, with Qatar, Spain, and Morocco already lining up, presumably with their wallets wide open.

Don't get used to the summer off because the Club World Cup is about to get a whole lot bigger and a whole lot more frequent. It will be interesting to see where the conversation about player welfare fits into all this, with high-profile players like Rodri, Alisson, and more already speaking out about them playing too many games.

Lionel Messi will turn 39 by the time the 2026 FIFA World Cup kicks off, and there have been question marks over his availability for the tournament. The Argentina skipper has missed several recent national team matches due to injury. With less than a year to go before the World Cup, there are doubts over whether Lionel Scaloni will pick him for the showpiece event, where Argentina are also the defending champions.

Messi was key for Argentina in Qatar, as they defeated France in penalties to clinch the title. 

Recently, in an interview with La Nacional, Angel Di Maria was asked about Messi's availability for the World Cup. The former Real Madrid winger had a straightforward reply.

He said, “Yes, yes. No matter what shape he's in, no matter what happens, Leo has to play in the World Cup, no matter what. That's him, and he also keeps the national team growing and keeps people excited. That's him. It's like when Diego (Maradona) was there.”

“It's them, and there's no one else. They're from another planet; they're not from here. We have to keep enjoying it, and hopefully it'll be in the best shape possible. Leo is an alien. He's a phenomenon—let's not waste the chance to keep watching him. I watch Inter Miami games because I want to keep watching. I never watched MLS, and now I have a season ticket just to watch it,” he added.

Messi recently returned from injury on Sunday, as he came off the bench and scored in Inter Miami's 3-1 win vs LA Galaxy. He also set up Luis Suarez for his team's third goal.

After the match, head coach Javier Mascherano stated that sometimes Messi needs to slow down, so that he can be injury-free and also due to his age. “Leo always wants to play. He even wanted minutes against Orlando. He is happiest when he's on the field, but sometimes we have to slow him down. He knows his body better than anyone, and it's about regaining the right sensations for what's ahead,” he said.

The Turkey international's costly error against Arsenal has further underlined the Red Devils' need to sign a new No.1 before the window closes

Manchester United's lack of a reliable goalkeeper has been the elephant in the room throughout the summer transfer window, and on Sunday against Arsenal it started swinging its trunk around while making a deafening trumpet sound. Thousands of heads fell into their hands at Old Trafford when Altay Bayindir palmed Declan Rice's corner back towards his goal-line and onto the grateful head of Ricardo Calafiori - and to think that some United fans thought that Andre Onana missing the game was a good thing!...

Bayindir's error cost United at least a point from a game that Ruben Amorim justifiably claimed his side should have won, and thus gave the coach another strong argument to make to sporting director Jason Wilcox about the need to sign another 'keeper. Although he would never say it publicly, it seems evident that Amorim does not truly trust Onana or Bayindir, or indeed third-choice Tom Heaton.

He did not exactly give a stern defence of Onana when he made two massive errors against Lyon last season, and indeed dropped him for the following game at Newcastle to take the Cameroonian out of the firing line. Nor did Amorim properly defend Bayindir's abilities on Sunday, only pointing to when he last faced Arsenal in January's FA Cup tie. The Turkey goalkeeper did do himself proud that day, saving Martin Odegaard's penalty in normal time and proving the hero in the shootout, but it was practically the only good performance he has produced since signing for United from Fenerbahce - where fans grew so frustrated with him that one hurled a water bottle at him. Bayindir has conceded 21 times in his 12 games with United, and made at least three errors that have directly led to goals.

So with just two weeks to go until the transfer window closes, GOAL takes a look at the goalkeepers United should be looking to sign so they no longer have to rely upon Onana and Bayindir...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Not even wearing Lionel Messi's No.10 jersey fazes the teenage sensation, while there was a touching tribute to Diogo Jota in Germany

Football is returning all across Europe right now, with league play having resumed in France and Spain over the weekend, while Bayern Munich and Stuttgart met in the curtain-raising DFL-Supercup in Germany.

So, even though we're still waiting for Serie A to get back under way, the last few days have already produced a plethora of talking points. For starters, Diego Simeone is already under pressure at Atletico Madrid and things haven't started much better for Roberto De Zerbi, who is dealing with a divided dressing room at Marseille.

On the plus side, Lamine Yamal has picked up where he left off last season at Barcelona (despite being given an iconic shirt to wear) while Paris Saint-Germain are coping impressively with their total lack of a pre-season.

Below, GOAL runs through all of the big winners and losers from the first weekend of the new season...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The need for the Red Devils to go back into the market was underlined by their 'keeper's howler while the Gunners showed defensive steel once more

The sun was shining, the Stretford End was singing with no music to drown out its cries and the optimism in the air was tangible. But once Manchester United's engaging Premier League season opener with Arsenal was over, Ruben Amorim was not having to speak about his exciting new attack or his usual talisman Bruno Fernandes. 

Instead he was taking questions on the goalkeeper who everyone was blaming for the 1-0 defeat. And this time it was not Andre Onana he was forced to defend, but Altay Bayindir. United's stand-in shot-stopper began the season as their No.1 because Onana had only just recovered from the hamstring injury that ruled him out of pre-season action, but very quickly Bayindir had his head in his hands after his attempt at punching away a corner led to Riccardo Calafiori heading home on the goal-line.

The United boss was in a prickly mood as he tried to defend Bayindir in his post-match press conference, blaming permissive refereeing of Arsenal's physical approach while at the same time criticising his player for his decision-making. ""I think you are allowed to do lots of things at corners,"" he said. ""We need to do the same. But when you touch that way, the goalkeeper, he needs to use his hands to catch the ball, not push players. He chooses to push players and let the ball pass.""

Amorim then tried to take the heat off Bayindir by pointing to his performance against Arsenal in the FA Cup against the Gunners eight months ago, but he was unable to say what he clearly thinks: that United need to spend yet more money and buy a new goalkeeper. 

The combined £133.5 million spent on Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha looks to have been well spent, and if it were not for some top-draw saves from David Raya and some steely defending from William Saliba and Gabriel Magalhaes, United might well have won the game. But unless they find an upgrade on Bayindir and Onana, then Amorim will be facing plenty more questions about his two goalkeepers from now until the end of the season, or the January transfer window at the very least.

The English top-flight roared back into action over the weekend, and plenty of talking points have emerged after just one round of matches

After 81 days without any Premier League football, the self-appointed 'best league in the world' is back, and how we missed it. Twenty-three goals were scored across the opening nine games of the campaign, and while there were a couple of refereeing controversies to upset supporters, this was a weekend in which there was plenty for fans to get excited about.

It was always going to be a round of fixtures that was tinged with sadness as the first played since the tragic death of Liverpool striker Diogo Jota, while it will now forever be tainted by the accusations of racist abuse from a member of the Anfield crowd towards Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo. That the Ghanaian was able to still produce an electric display was, then, mightily impressive, and his performance set the tone for some similarly strong showings around the division over the past three days.

The English Premier League started its 2025/26 season this weekend, and most of the favorites picked up all three points. Liverpool and Manchester City scored four goals in their matches, while Arsenal edged Manchester United 1-0.

Both the Reds and Citizens were showing their strength going forward as they netted four against their opponents. Liverpool beat Bournemouth 4-2 at Anfield while City stunned Wolves 4-0 despite playing away from home.

Arne Slot's side looked to start their season in a positive fashion as they went 1-0 up in the first 45 minutes through Hugo Ekitike. Liverpool doubled their lead on 49 minutes through Cody Gakpi, but Bournemouth were not giving up easily as they bounced back midway through that second period.

Antoine Semenyo showcased his qualities as he bagged a brace on 64 and 76 minutes to make it 2-2. However, Liverpool got their mojo back as Federico Chiesa regained their lead on 88 minutes, before Mohamed Salah sealed the game in added time.

Man City had a more convincing result as they scored four without reply despite having to play away from home. Erling Haaland bagged a brace in that game, while the other two goals were netted by new boys, Tijjani Reijnders and Rayan Cherki.

On Sunday, Arsenal also picked up all three points, but it was far from a comfortable match for Mikel Arteta's side. Facing a hungry United team, Arteta's men were forced to play more on the counter, though they did snatch a lead on 13 minutes through Riccardo Calafiori.

Man United might feel undone with the result as they were dominating much of the proceedings, but couldn't seem to finish their chances. Nevertheless, Arsenal managed to defend well and see off the match with a slender win over their arch-rival.

Meanwhile, the recently crowned FIFA Club World Cup champions, Chelsea, struggled to get going as they were held to a goalless draw by Crystal Palace. The Blues can't seem to break down their opponent's defense, as Palace ease on to pick up a point on their travel.

Here are the full Premier League weekend results:

Liverpool 4-2 Bournemouth; Aston Villa 0-0 Newcastle United; Brighton 1-1 Fulham; Sunderland 3-0 West Ham; Tottenham Hotspur 3-0 Burnley; Wolves 0-4 Manchester City; Man United 0-1 Arsenal.

Comesana – Bellucci: 19.08.2025 00:00 CEST
H2H: first meeting

Francisco Comesana has won three of his last five matches. Last week in Cincinnati, Comesana lost to Rublev in the 1/8-Finals in straight sets. The Argentine always delivered his best tennis on clay courts. However, this season, Comesana played well on fast courts as well.

Mattia Bellucci has won four of his last five matches. Last week in Sumter, Bellucci won the Challenger title. In the final match, Shevchenko retired mid-match against him.

According to the bookies, Comesana is the slight favourite in this matchup, but we disagree. Bellucci had a great week in Sumter. He played his best tennis, and when he does so, he is always a dangerous opponent. We expect him to be a better player tonight.

That being said, Bellucci winning is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Mattia Bellucci winning @2.10 @bet365

Dostanic – Vukic: 19.08.2025 01:00 CEST
H2H: first meeting

Stefan Dostanic has won three of his last five matches. His last match was in Chicago, when he retired mid-match against Hussey in the 1/8-Finals at the Challenger tournament. This week in Winston-Salem, Dostanic has been granted a wild card.

Aleksandar Vukic has won three of his last five matches. Last week in Cincinnati, Vukic lost to Basavareddy in the opening round in straight sets. This week in Winston-Salem, the Australian qualified for the main draw tournament by winning both qualifying matches in straight sets. In the final qualifying round, Vukic defeated Poling in straight sets. He offered and saved three breakpoints.

According to the bookies, Vukic is the favourite in this matchup, and we agree. Dostanic is an ITF-level player. On the other hand, Vukic dominated in the qualifying tournament and looks to cement his top 100 status. We expect him to dominate in this match and win easily.

That being said, Vukic winning in straight sets is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Aleksandar Vukic winning 2-0 @1.91 @bet365

Borges – Majchrzak: 19.08.2025 02:30 CEST
H2H: 1-0

Nuno Borges has lost four of his last five matches. Last week in Cincinnati, Borges lost to Rinderknech in the opening round in straight sets. Last season in Winston-Salem, he lost to Seyboth Wild in the opening match in straight sets.

Kamil Majchrzak has won six straight matches. Last week in Poland, Majchrzak won the Challenger title on hard, defeating Prizmic in the final in straight sets. This week in Winston-Salem, the Pole defeated Jarry in the opening round in straight sets. He served great, not offering any breakpoints.

According to the bookies, this will be a 50-50 matchup, but we disagree. Majchrzak is in great form and was fully confident in the opening round this week. On the other hand, Borges struggled in the past few weeks. We expect Majchrzak to serve well once again and win this match.

That being said, Majchrzak winning is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Kamil Majchrzak winning @2.00 @bet365

The ATP Tour has come under much scrutiny recently after a wave of criticism regarding their scheduling.

Recently, the ATP tour was told their schedule does not work, after numerous high-profile players withdrew from the Canadian Open.

Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner and Jack Draper all withdrew from the tournament before the start date. All players cited injury as the reason for their withdrawals.

The withdrawals have raised concerns regarding the scheduling, and the ATP Tour chairman has weighed in on the discussion.

The chairman, who previously commented on Carlos Alcaraz's schedule concerns, spoke to the ATP Tour about the spate of withdrawals.

Andrea Gaudenzi, Chairman of the ATP Tour, discussed the withdrawals of the top ATP Tour players during a question-and-answer interview on the ATP Tour website.

While Gaudenzi acknowledged the difficulty a tournament faces when key players withdraw, he maintained that player participation at Masters 1000 events has been ‘strong' in recent years.

Gaudenzi, who also discussed the calendar complexity and playing commitments during the interview, said: “Withdrawals are part of professional sport, especially in one as physically demanding as tennis. In this case, both Jannik and Carlos had deep runs to the finals of both Roland Garros and Wimbledon—an incredible achievement.

“With only a two-week turnaround between Wimbledon and Toronto this year, the schedule was particularly tight.

“Of course, I feel for the tournament. It was unfortunate but it's not the first time, and it won't be the last time a Masters 1000 event faces withdrawals. That's the reality of our sport.

“In general though, when you step back and look at the data across recent years, player participation at the Masters 1000 level remains very strong. 

“We need to assess the impact of reforms over time, using the full picture—attendance, viewership, player participation, compensation, and commercial performance.

“That's how we make informed, long-term decisions that serve the sport as a whole.”

After Jannik Sinner contests the Cincinnati Open final against Carlos Alcaraz on Monday evening, he will then need to make an extremely quick trip to New York to compete in the US Open Mixed Doubles tournament.

Sinner, who is partnered with Katerina Siniakova, is expected to play in the tournament, which will run from Tuesday to Wednesday.

For any athlete, this turnaround is extremely quick. Both Sinner and Iga Swiatek are playing in their respective Cincinnati Open finals, and both are potentially being expected to play in New York the following day.

On the other hand, the mixed doubles tournament is an exhibition event with no bearing on rankings. Therefore, both Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek have the autonomy to withdraw from the tournament if they see fit.","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"

Sebastian Korda has won three of his last five matches. His last match was at the French Open, when he lost to Tiafoe in the third round in three sets. The American struggled with the injuries for the past few months. His last hard-court match was in Miami in March, when Djokovic defeated him in the quarterfinals in straight sets.

According to the bookies, Kopriva is the underdog in this matchup, but we disagree. Korda has not played any competitive matches for a while. On the other hand, Kopriva played several hard-court matches and has already won the opening match this week. We expect him to keep this match close.

Dhakshineswar Suresh has won three of his last five matches. This week in Winston-Salem, Suresh surprisingly qualified for the main draw tournament. He upset Tabilo in the final qualifying round, after losing the opening set 1-6.

According to the bookies, Navone is the slight favourite in this matchup, and we agree. Suresh is an ITF-level player, and we expect his level to drop in the opening main draw round. Navone struggles on hard courts, but he is still a better player with more qualities. We expect him to get the job done easily.

That being said, Navone covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Aleksandar Kovacevic has lost four of his last five matches. Last week in Cincinnati, Kovacevic lost to Medjedovic in the opening round in straight sets. So far this season, he has had his best results on hard courts. Just a month ago, the American lost to Shapovalov in the final of the ATP 250 in Los Cabos.

Filip Misolic has lost three of his last five matches. Last week in Sumter, Misolic lost in three tight sets against Mochizuki in the quarterfinals.

According to the bookies, Kovacevic is the slight favourite in this matchup, and we agree. Misolic is a better clay-court player, but on hard courts, Kovacevic had better results and has a better playing style. We expect Kovacevic to win tonight.

That being said, Kovacevic winning is a value bet.

Rajeev Ram and Nikola Mektic capped off a sensational run at the Cincinnati Open on Sunday, holding their nerves to beat Lorenzo Musetti and Lorenzo Sonego in the final and claim the men's doubles title. It was their maiden Masters 1000 trophy as a pair, coming in just their third event of the year after reaching the final together for the first time.

It was a come-from-behind win for Ram and Mektic, who defeated the all-Italian pair 4-6, 6-3, 10-5 in a 90-minute clash. Their comeback was fueled by winning 87 per cent (34/39) of their first serves.

With the win, Ram, at 41 years and four months, became the second-oldest men's doubles champion in Cincinnati, after 42-year-old Daniel Nestor, who won in 2015 alongside Edouard Roger-Vasselin.

""Tennis, right? Crazy stories. This is our third tournament together, even though we've known each other for three decades, probably. Thank you so much, I can't thank you enough, and it was a pleasure playing this week,"" Mektic said to Ram during the trophy presentation ceremony.

Mektic, meanwhile, won his 11th Masters 1000 title — the most by an active player in men's doubles. Earlier, on reaching the final, he became the third active doubles player, after Rohan Bopanna and Mate Pavic, to reach finals of all nine ATP Masters 1000 events.

""We've known each other a really long time... We've played some great matches against each other. It's so nice to have him [Mektic] on my side of the net,"" Ram said.

The win helped the pair rise 196 spots to No. 25 in the ATP Live Doubles Teams Rankings.

Next up for the duo is the US Open, which begins later this month. Ram, a six-time major champion, has won three of his career Slams in New York. Mektic, on the other hand, is a former finalist, having reached the summit clash in 2020 with Wesley Koolhof, losing 5-7, 3-6 to Mate Pavic and Bruno Soares.

Sinner – Alcaraz: 18.08.2025 21:00 CEST
H2H: 6-9

Jannik Sinner has won eleven straight matches. The last match he played before the ATP Cincinnati was at Wimbledon, where he defeated Alcaraz in the final in four sets. Sinner is the defending champion in Cincinnati. Last season, the Italian defeated Tiafoe in the final in straight sets. This week, he demolished Galan in the opening round in straight sets. In the second round, Sinner won against Diallo in straight sets. He lost his serve at the beginning of the match; other than that, Sinner dominated on his serve. In the 1/8-Finals, Mannarino fought hard, but the Italian still won in tight straight sets. Auger-Aliassime stood no chance in the quarterfinals against Sinner. After playing for just short of an hour, Sinner won 6-0, 6-2.

The Italian offered no breakpoints in his semifinal match against Atmane. The Frenchman fought well in the opening set, losing in the tiebreak. In the second set, Sinner dominated from the start until the end.

Carlos Alcaraz has won five straight matches. This week in Cincinnati, the Spaniard defeated Dzumhur in three sets. He lost his serve three times in a rollercoaster-type match. In the second round, Carlos defeated Medjedovic in straight sets comfortably. In the 1/8-Finals, the Spaniard demolished Nardi 6-1, 6-4. He trailed 2-4 in the second set, but turned it quickly around. Last season in Cincinnati, he lost to Monfils in the opening match in three tight sets. His toughest challenger came in the quarterfinals against Rublev. In the deciding set, Alcaraz broke Rublev´s serve when he was 6-5 up and closed out the match.

In the semifinal clash against Zverev, Alcaraz played well under pressure, saving four out of five breakpoints. After playing for almost two hours, the Spaniard won in straight sets comfortably.

According to the bookies, Sinner is the favourite in this matchup, and we agree. He is the best player in the world and has dominated in every match throughout the two weeks. On the other hand, Alcaraz had a favourable draw, but he struggled in several matches. Currently, Sinner has more weapons on hard courts, and we expect him to continue his winning streak.

That being said, Sinner winning is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Jannik Sinner winning @1.50 @bet365

Carlos Alcaraz struggled with his serve this week in Cincinnati. On the other hand, Sinner was ruthless on both serve and return. We expect the Italian to win at least one point in every game of the opening set.

That being said, Sinner to win 1+ points in every game of set 1 is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Jannik Sinner to win 1+ points in every game in set 1 @+155 @FanDuel

If you love to take risks, we expect Sinner to win comfortably against Alcaraz tonight. He has been unplayable for the past few months, and we expect him to continue in that fashion.

That being said, Sinner covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Jannik Sinner -4.5 games handicap @+260 @FanDuel

Tennis fans will be treated once again on Monday evening when Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner walk out to contest their fourth final of 2025.

The pair stunned fans with their level of tennis in the French Open and Wimbledon finals, putting to rest any concerns about the next generation of players following Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic.

Sinner and Alcaraz have split their two matches in 2025. Alcaraz saved three match points before capturing the French Open title, while Sinner had his revenge by defeating the Spaniard in the Wimbledon final.

It will be interesting to see if Carlos Alcaraz has made any tactical shift when the players walk out on court. After all, he struggled to compete with the ferocity of Sinner's groundstrokes in the Wimbledon final.

Ahead of the Cincinnati Open final, former Grand Slam champions Lindsay Davenport and Jim Courier discussed the tactical battle.

Former Wimbledon and US Open champion Lindsay Davenport has weighed in on the tactical battle between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, pinpointing the necessity for Alcaraz to prevent dips in form throughout the match.

In recent memory, Sinner has demonstrated an ability to stay at the same level for an extended period of time on court, while Alcaraz's form tends to fluctuate more than the Italian's.

Davenport said: “Alcaraz has got to be able to stay in there point in point out. Sinner is relentless with his intensity, but also his focus and concentration. (Not) Very often does he beat himself or does he break himself out there, and we've seen Alcaraz have these dips in matches where he loses his focus.

“In a two out of three-set match he simply cannot afford to do that against Sinner.”

Jim Courier, a four-time major champion who won the Australian Open and French Open twice during his playing career, discussed what he believes Jannik Sinner will try to do tactically against Alcaraz.

He added: “What Sinner will try and do I think is suffocate Alcaraz.

“Alcaraz thrives on time to create on the court. He needs time to use his drop shots, to use the angle. He needs time on the ball and Sinner's going to try and take that away from him.

“So, first serve percentage is going to be meaningful and how often can Sinner stay on the front foot and prevent Alcaraz's creativity from coming to the surface.”

Jannik Sinner has won all of the last three hard-court Grand Slams, dating back to the 2024 Australian Open.

However, it is Carlos Alcaraz who leads his head-to-head record over Jannik Sinner when it comes to results on hard courts, by five wins to two.

The Spaniard beat Sinner in their last match on a hard court: at the 2024 Beijing Open. In that match, Alcaraz produced a scintillating display of tennis to win seven straight points in the deciding set tiebreak.

Alcaraz was recently told he needs to ‘figure out' his US Open struggles, and the Cincinnati Open final could provide the perfect springboard for him to do so.","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"

Jakub Mensik has a habit of accomplishing his goals remarkably fast.

In 2023, he made his Grand Slam debut as a pro at 17 years old in Flushing, Queens, and went on a historic run.

He broke out and reached the third round as a qualifier, which made him the youngest man to win a main draw match at the U.S. Open in nine years.

Katie Boulter's season has been up and down so far but after a disruptive injury, she is moving in the right direction, she tells Flo Clifford

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

The rigours of the tennis tour wait for no one. Last month Katie Boulter was trying to string together a run on the grass. A second-round loss at Wimbledon brought an end to that, but there was no time to dwell on the defeat. That is not the 29-year-old's style.

Instead, it was pretty much straight back to work at the National Tennis Centre before landing in the heat and humidity of Washington – “a shock to the system” – with her focus firmly on the next half of the season: seven weeks in the US, a week at home, before jetting off again for another two-and-a-half-month stint in Asia.

The end of her 2024 season was “a mix” results-wise, she says, but it was significant that she maintained fitness throughout and finished on a high note, reaching the semi-finals in Tokyo and the final of the WTA 250 tournament in Hong Kong. 

“The season is very much non-stop,” Boulter, a BRITA UK ambassador, tells The Independent. “No one ever gets a break. At the end of the season a lot of people start dropping like flies. I was able to push on and then finish my year really strong, which helped massively. Mentally, it was a milestone for me, because I managed to push through a lot of tough, tough moments out there.”

Boulter's career has involved a lot of pushing through tough moments, from a chronic fatigue syndrome diagnosis as a teenager to a series of injury issues as she became a more established player, including a spinal stress fracture in 2019. 

That seemed behind her as she became a more consistent force on the tour. In 2023 and 2024, she hit a series of milestones: becoming British No 1, winning her first WTA title in Nottingham, and breaking into the world's top 25 with her run to the Hong Kong Open final last autumn. 

But that momentum came to a halt with a foot injury which sidelined her this February. It has been a stop-start run for her ever since, with highs including a maiden clay-court title – at the WTA 125 Trophée Clarins in Paris – and registering a fourth-ever top-10 win with a hard-fought, classically Boulter win over Paula Badosa at Wimbledon. The lows: she could not claim a three-peat of Nottingham titles and was knocked out in SW19 by the unheralded lucky loser Solana Sierra, a player ranked 58 places below her. 

But she says that after that difficult start to the year, it was a positive step to feel able to compete. “[Winning in Paris] was a nice kind of nod to show me that I'm going in the right direction physically.” She notes that she reincorporated elements into her training, such as plyometrics, which she hadn't been able to do since before her foot injury. “I felt like it was a result for me, because I was moving in the right direction. I'm actually more motivated than I have been the last few months to really push on. In a way, it's been a good thing.” 

Boulter bristles at the suggestion that the pressure of being a British player at Wimbledon made any difference to her performance. “I'm the only one out there and my team knows what's actually happening on the court. I think [outsiders] can look at one match and one person's ranking and be like, she should win that. And I think that's a downfall. I'm going to be the first person to say [Sierra] played a great match, she didn't lose the round after, so it's not like she shouldn't or didn't belong there. 

“I wouldn't label it because of pressure. I don't think that's a fair thing to say. I've been around the block for a fair amount of time, I've played a lot of pressure matches. She was a better tennis player on the day. But I think pressure is a privilege, and you have to embrace it.”

The British No 2 is determined to look at the positives, but amid the turmoil of that frustrating loss, she wondered afterwards whether “her moment” would ever come. How does she combat those fears? 

“I think it's very easy to get wrapped up in losses,” she says. “You lose over 50 per cent of the time. The best in the world lose 50 per cent of the time. But I think what I meant by that [comment] was, I keep putting myself in positions where I feel like I can go far. I think my tennis in the previous rounds had been extremely good, and then I go out, and unfortunately, I can't get the job done.

“I could have easily lost in the first round to a top 10 player, and we'd all be sat here going, ‘That makes sense, tough draw.' But I have to take the positives where I actually beat a top 10 player on Centre Court. I think it's just, playing more matches and getting myself more into those positions, and my time will come, and I have to believe that.”

One major event on the horizon is the Billie Jean King Cup: GB have qualified for the eight-team finals in September, with Boulter teaming up with close friend Jodie Burrage to send Britain through their qualifier – “possibly up there with one of the best wins in my career”, she says. 

The national tournaments are important for Boulter, who has played a significant role as a leader of the British team. “I've stepped up every single time,” she says. “In the last tie that we played, I think I could have easily bowed out of that with my foot situation, and I personally stepped up and wanted to play, and wanted to bring the team to the finals and lead that way.” 

She and her fiancé, fellow tennis player Alex de Minaur, have also teamed up in mixed doubles and were hoping to receive a wildcard entry to the US Open – after much pleading on social media to the organisers having not been included on the original entry list. Boulter's accepting of an invite into a WTA event in Cleveland suggests their participation is now unlikely. “We kind of panicked, because we thought that was the deadline, and we missed it,” she grins. “Luckily, when we've played so far, we've been great together. There haven't been any arguments after yet, but there's still time!”

Some players' private lives came under the microscope this grass-court season, and she notes wryly: “Everyone wants to make their own story and create every single narrative that they want to see. Ninety-nine per cent of it is not what the truth is. That's where social media can be a really tough place at times, because what you see is not true. We all get carried away with the romance of it.”

Social media is a topic Boulter has, as is all too common for professional athletes, endured more than her fair share of. Earlier this year she revealed some of the abusive messages and death threats she has received in an interview with BBC Sport. The messages were disturbingly graphic, and only a microcosm of the abuse players – particularly women – receive daily. But the reaction to it was overwhelmingly positive, she says. “I think it almost went the other way – I was getting so many messages, and I'm still getting messages now, with so much positivity. 

“But it wasn't really the end goal for me. I wanted to try and make a difference and continue talking about this situation. And I actually got a text this morning that there's a lot of chat about it in the government. I really hope that it can spark a wider conversation in general. I think it's such an important thing to start changing for the next generation.”

Katie Boulter is a BRITA UK ambassador, working to mark the brand's second-year partnership with the LTA as ‘official water partner'. The pair are championing the power of hydration via the ‘Alive As Never Before' campaign encouraging everyone to make mindful choices to do better for their body, mind & planet.

Carlos Alcaraz will contest a seventh straight final later today, as he faces Jannik Sinner in yet another iteration of this ever-evolving rivalry.

This will mark the third meeting we have been treated to between these two fierce competitors this year, with all of their last four matches having come in the final.

That should come as no surprise though, given they are quite comfortably the top two players in the world. The ATP rankings suitably reflect that.

However, despite the Spaniard having the edge in their head-to-head, it is Jannik Sinner who boasts the most recent victory, dethroning Carlos Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final.

And whilst this will have been a huge blow for the five-time Grand Slam champion, he actually has learned exactly what he needs to do to beat Sinner.

There are naturally a handful of reasons why Alcaraz lost the Wimbledon final, but chief among them was Sinner's superiority.

He was inspired, and despite losing the opening set, remained as ruthless as ever when given a chance.

Alcaraz, meanwhile, perhaps lacked that lethal touch, with two crucial statistics that emerged in the aftermath that let him down the most.

Getting in just 53% of his first serve marked a really poor serving day for the Spaniard, and as such, it gave his opponent countless chances to attack his second serve with ferocity.

It felt like, if his first serve didn't go in, his chances of losing the point dropped dramatically.

As such, he won just 51% of points on his second serve, which proved pivotal.

Other than that, he competed well from the baseline throughout, matching this supreme ball-striker blow for blow.

At the Cincinnati Open later today, he cannot allow his serve to let him down again.

Alcaraz recently revealed how long it took him to get over his Wimbledon final defeat, with this ongoing event his first since that match.

Fortunately, there have been signs that Alcaraz's serve has been on the mend, although it does fluctuate rather wildly.

Against Alexander Zverev, his first serve percentage fell to just 53%, but against Andrey Rublev it sat at a respectable 62%.

The round before that, against Luca Nardi, it was even higher at 65%.

He can quite clearly find consistency in the serve, but it just seems to shift from match to match.

In what marks yet another clash between these two young titans of the sport, set to compete for another of tennis' elite honours, there's no better time for Alcaraz to lock in and ensure that his serve does not once again prove to be his undoing against a player who will take any advantage given.","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"

Tech is truly transforming Wimbledon in 2025. For the first time ever, the oldest and most prestigious tennis tournament in the world — which has been running for 148 years — replaced human line judges with AI-powered ball-tracking technology. 

AI is also enhancing fan engagement, with IBM AI powering Match Chat and Likelihood to Win. 

Match Chat is an interactive AI assistant fans can raise queries with during live singles matches and Likelihood to Win has been upgraded to now provide updated win percentage projections that change throughout each game, rather than remaining static during matches.

For 148 years, sharply dressed line judges have been a visual and cultural fixture at Wimbledon, assisting umpires with their split-second decisions. 

This year, however, that tradition has been upended. The All England Club's decision to implement AI-based line calling follows a broader trend in professional tennis, with the ATP Tour adopting full electronic officiating across all events to “optimise accuracy and consistency across tournaments, match courts and surfaces” and the WTA rolling out similar systems at many tournaments.

The system uses a network of high-speed cameras, computers and sensors to track the ball's trajectory in real time, determining whether shots land in or out.

Unlike other tournaments that use standardised, robotic voices for electronic calls, Wimbledon has opted for a more human touch.

The voices announcing line calls are that of staff members — including tour guides and behind-the-scenes workers — ensuring each court has a distinct sound and reducing confusion between adjacent courts.

This emphasises the view of Thomas Sweeney, who oversees matches at tennis' highest level, who says human officials will always be an essential part of the sport.

“There will always be that need to have a human to facilitate at the end of where technology has its limitations,” he says.

Match Chat is an interactive AI assistant built on IBM's watsonx platform that is available via the Wimbledon app and website, allowing fans to ask real-time questions during singles matches.

Whether the question is who has converted more break points or which player is currently performing better, the system uses Gen AI models trained specifically on Wimbledon's editorial style and tennis terminology, ensuring responses are both accurate and in keeping with the tournament's tone.

“We are committed to providing fans with the best possible Wimbledon experience, whether they interact with us through TV, radio, digitally or within the grounds,” says Usama Al-Qassab, Marketing and Commercial Director at the All England Club.

Likelihood to Win has been enhanced for 2025.

Previously, this feature provided static win probabilities, but now it offers dynamically updated projections throughout each game, reflecting player statistics, expert opinion and match momentum.

The system runs on IBM's Red Hat OpenShift, enabling consistent, real-time insights across devices and locations.

These innovations are part of a 35-year partnership between Wimbledon and IBM, which has seen the introduction of heat maps, serve analysis and now sophisticated Gen AI experiences.

The California native made his main-draw debut at Flushing Meadows in 2016 and produced an awe-inspiring run to last year's final before falling to the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Jannik Sinner. From early childhood memories to his career-best performance in 2024, Fritz caught up with ATPTour.com to discuss what makes the US Open so special to him.

 Read more US Open insights and memories from ATP Tour stars in our ‘My US Open' series. 



What was your first memory of watching the US Open as a kid?
It was watching my mom play the senior doubles. I would go to the US Open when I was really young because my mom would play the seniors.

What are your first memories of playing there yourself? 

It was the juniors for me. I got a wild card into the qualifying of the juniors and I was so pumped to play. I was nervous because I hadn't played a lot of world events, with players from other countries, so I thought the guys I was going to play against would be the best players ever. I was hoping not to get beaten really badly.

Outside of Arthur Ashe Stadium, which court do you prefer to play on? 

Louis Armstrong Stadium, for sure. Armstrong just feels like my court.

What's the best match you've played at the US Open? 

It's tough to say because I don't feel like I ever played a match at the Open where I played out of my mind. I think I played really well against [Matteo] Berrettini in the second round last year. That was one of the best matches I played.

What were your first impressions of the US Open as a player? 

I remember how crowded everything was, because early in the tournament when everyone is there, it can get super crowded in the player's area. I was just so happy to be there. I remember how packed it was on the side courts with the big stands, like Court 12 or Court 7. It was really cool.

What are your thoughts on New York City?


I have never really loved the city, but I have come to enjoy it for the two weeks that we are there, that's perfect. The time we are there for the Open is a great time to be in the city.

What does a day off in the city look like?


I would probably rather stay in, chill and play video games, but if I was going to go out and do something I would bike around Central Park.

Is there anything you associate with the US Open? 

Honey Deuce [cocktails], that's the big thing at the Open.

The US Open mixed doubles tournament starts on Tuesday in New York

British number ones Emma Raducanu and Jack Draper will face each other in this week's new-look US Open mixed doubles event in New York. 

Raducanu, 22, is partnering five-time Grand Slam winner Carlos Alcaraz, while Draper, 23, will play with American Jessica Pegula after their original partners, Tommy Paul and Paula Badosa, both withdrew.

Organisers were heavily criticised in February after announcing that the mixed doubles competition would be a standalone event on 19-20 August - before the singles tournament begins on 24 August.

The 16 pairs involved will compete for $1m (£749,077) at Flushing Meadows. 

Raducanu, who won the US Open title in 2021, and Spaniard Alcaraz have been handed a wildcard entry for the two-day tournament. 

Before the event, Alcaraz, 22, is taking on world number one Jannik Sinner for the fourth time this season, in the final of the Cincinnati Open in Ohio on Monday. 

Italian Sinner, 24, who is also a wildcard entrant, has been re-paired with Czech Katerina Siniakova after his partner, American Emma Navarro, withdrew. 

Draper and Pegula, meanwhile, have qualified directly and have been given the top seeding, because both players are inside the top five in the singles rankings. 

The first two rounds will take place on Tuesday and the semi-finals and final will be played on Wednesday.

Just four games will be required to win a set in matches before the final, with no-advantage scoring (four points will be needed to win a game) and 10-point match tie-breaks instead of a third set throughout.

What is the new US Open mixed doubles format?

Jack Draper/Jessica Pegula v Carlos Alcaraz/Emma Raducanu

Olga Danilovic/Novak Djokovic v Mirra Andreeva/Daniil Medvedev

Casper Ruud/Iga Swiatek v Madison Keys/Frances Tiafoe

Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz will have to do it the hard way if they are to triumph in the US Open's revamped mixed doubles tournament on Tuesday and Wednesday. The wildcard pairing has been drawn against top seeds Jack Draper and Jessica Pegula at Flushing Meadows, while Serbian pair Novak Djokovic and Olga Danilovic could await in the quarter-finals.

Alcaraz will not have much time to prepare, either, amid controversy surrounding the scheduling of his Cincinnati Open final against Jannik Sinner. The latter, who beat Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final this summer, has spoken out about the lack of one-week Masters 1000 events currently on the ATP Tour.

British ace Lloyd Glasspool has officially become the new world No. 1 in doubles as of today.

Glasspool and his partner, Julian Cash, went on a 22-match winning streak which spanned titles at Queen's, Eastbourne, Wimbledon, and Toronto, before losing in the Cincinnati semi-finals over the weekend.

""It's an amazing feeling, it's something to tell the grandkids,"" Glasspool said after becoming the top-ranked doubles player.

""It's probably more special on that side of it rather than actually whilst you play. But I think it is a good reflection of the year we've had.

""Being the No. 1 team as well, me and Jules, we've had such a great year, such a good past couple months, I think it's deserved.""



Jodie Burrage got her US Open qualifying campaign off to a winning start, blitzing Patricia Maria Tig 6-4 6-0.

Fellow Brits Billy Harris, Dan Evans, and Johannus Monday are also in action in qualifying today.

British tennis star Kyle Edmund has announced his retirement from professional tennis, effective immediately.

During his breakthrough 2018 season, Edmund reached the Australian Open semi-final, stunned Novak Djokovic in Madrid, lifted his maiden title in Antwerp, and reached a career-high ranking of No. 14 in the world.

But Edmund's career was derailed by injuries and he had three surgeries from 2020 to 2021. He has now ended his career, admitting the time was right.



Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner must see each other more often than they see their families at this rate.

After meeting in the finals of the Italian Open, French Open and Wimbledon, they will do battle in the championship match at the Cincinnati Open today.

Alcaraz has a winning 8-5 record against Sinner, but the world No. 1 beat him to win Wimbledon just a few weeks ago.

And the Spaniard is excited to renew their rivalry on Monday. ""I'm really looking forward to playing against him again. Thanks to him, I get the best out of myself in tennis,"" Alcaraz said after winning his semi-final on Saturday.

""It's also great for the fans to watch our matches. We raise the bar to the maximum and offer really beautiful tennis in the match. I'm ready for the challenge.""

Iga Swiatek takes on Jasmine Paolini in the women's singles final at the Cincinnati Open today. Their match will be played not before 6pm local time.

But Swiatek is still in the US Open mixed doubles draw with Casper Ruud, and they're due to play their first-round match around 12pm local time in New York on Tuesday.

It will be a race against time for Swiatek to get to Flushing Meadows by the time her Cincinnati final and post-match duties are over.

Paolini was set to partner with Lorenzo Musetti in the US Open mixed doubles tournament but she has pulled out, and Musetti will now play alongside Caty McNally.

It remains to be seen whether Swiatek suddenly skips the tournament too. She and Ruud are due to face the all-American pairing of Frances Tiafoe and Madison Keys second on Arthur Ashe Stadium.



Casper Ruud has hailed Novak Djokovic as the greatest athlete of all time ahead of the US Open.

“Novak is the greatest athlete of any sport in history, yeah, in the history of sports,"" the Danish star told Overtime Tennis.

""I don't want to compare because it's stupid, but if you take Novak's athleticism next to Brady, Brady's the GOAT, don't get me wrong, but I think Novak would crush him in most of the physical tests that you can do.

""And then again, LeBron would maybe crush Novak in certain physical, so I don't know, but for me, Novak is the greatest athlete that ever lived.”

A healthy cash prize is on offer for the winner of both the men's and women's finals at the Cincinnati Open today.

The winner between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz will take home around £831,000, the largest earnings in the history of the tournament.

The losing finalist will pocket £442,000.

Daniil Medvedev has spoken out about his dislike towards early matches, warning he could opt to skip them later in his career.

“I was talking to my team today. I was like: ‘When I'm 35, I might just boycott the 11 am matches',"" Medvedev told the Guardian.

""I'll be like: ‘I'm not coming. Walkover.' Like: ‘Yeah, I didn't wake up. Sorry, guys.' In my opinion, 11 is so early.

""You have to wake up at 6.30 in the morning, whereas if you play at night, you wake up at 9am. So it changes the perspective of the match. It's crazy mentally.”

Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu's partnership in the US Open mixed doubles could be in doubt, according to The Sun.

They face first-round and quarter-final matches tomorrow, but Alcaraz is in the Cincinnati Open final against Jannik Sinner today.

It takes two hours to fly to New York, and he may have to jey across on the day of their opening match against Jack Draper and Jessica Pegula.



Nick Kyrgios was initially paired with Naomi Osaka for the US Open's mixed doubles, but he is no longer taking part.

Osaka will now play with Gael Monfils, and they will face Caty McNally and Lorenzo Musetti in their opening match tomorrow.

Kyrgios missed the entire grass season with a knee injury, and the same problem ruled him out of Washington, Toronto, and Cincinnati.

New footage has emerged of Novak Djokovic requiring treatment on his troubled right thigh during practice ahead of the US Open.

The Serb is currently training in Montenegro, having not competed since his thigh hampered him in his Wimbledon semi-final defeat against Jannik Sinner.

Djokovic is expected to feature in the US Open's revamped mixed doubles tomorrow, but he doesn't appear fully fit ahead of chasing a record-breaking 25th Grand Slam.

We have a bumper evening of tennis in store, with both men's and women's Cincinnati Open finals taking place.

Iga Swiatek and Jasmine Paolini's clash will follow, potentially starting at around 11pm.



Ben Shelton will enter his home Grand Slam, the US Open, among the favourites.

And the world No. 6 has partly credited his decision to leave X (formerly Twitter).

""I'm doing a good job. I remember two years ago, I ended up deleting Twitter from my phone, and that was the best decision I ever made,"" Shelton said in Cincinnati.

""Now, two years have passed, and I've never read anything on that social network again.

He added: ""I prefer to watch the highlights of certain matches. Currently, I watch a lot of the tennis matches I used to watch, whether it's from the tournament I'm playing in or even from a Challenger tournament that's happening that week.

""I have a team that helps me keep my feet on the ground; they would never let me get my head full of nonsense.""

Jasmine Paolini has warned Iga Swiatek that she is ready to ""fight"" ahead of the Cincinnati Open final.

Swiatek has beaten Paolini in all five of their meetings, dropping just one set, and ousted Elena Rybakina in straight sets in the semi-finals.

Paolini, who beat Veronika Kudermetova in three sets in her semi, said: ""It's been really tough against her. She's an amazing player.

""She defends really well. Serving good. I'm trying to do my best. We are in the final. I like the conditions. Let's fight.""

Tennis fans are baffled as to why the Cincinnati Open final between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner is being played on a weekday.

It was the same in the Canadian Open, due to the extended format of all Masters 1000 events apart from the Monte Carlo Masters and Paris Masters.

Players have little time to prepare between tournaments due to the 10 to 14-day schedule, rather than a week.

Sinner himself has admitted that the new schedules can be confusing.

He said: “You have the quarterfinals and then you have the semi-final, which is Saturday, and then you have finally Sunday. And now I lost a little bit of the view of when does actually a finalist [plays], because it used to be always Sunday.

""Now, here [in Cincinnati] it's Monday. In Toronto, it's Wednesday or Thursday. So it's difficult even for us players. We lose a little bit of the days of the week, I would say.”



Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz will have earned it if they win the US Open's revamped mixed doubles this weekend.

The dream pairing will face top seeds Jack Draper, Raducanu's fellow Brit, and Jessica Pegula, playing on home turf, tomorrow.

Should they progress, 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic and fellow Serb Olga Danilovic could await in the quarter-finals.

Alcaraz won't have much time to prepare, given he faces Jannik Sinner in the Cincinnati Open final today.

Good morning!

The US Open mixed doubles event is different in every way you could imagine in 2025, but that's a good thing. 

The new format moved the mixed doubles event up to the week of singles qualifying and added a ton of the game's top male and female talent. 

Only two days are required to complete the event, which will serve as an appetizer for the US Open singles tournament, which gets underway next week. 

US Open Mixed Doubles Bracket

TV Schedule

Tuesday, August 19

11 a.m.- 1 p.m. ET (ESPN2)

1-5 p.m. ET (ESPNNews)

11 a.m.-9 p.m. ET (ESPN+) 

Wednesday, August 20

7 p.m.-10 p.m. ET (ESPN2)

Prize Money

The winning duo will take home a $1 million prize, which is higher than most prize purses for mixed doubles major tournaments.

Format and Preview

The 16 teams will play over two days. 

The first round and quarterfinals take place on Tuesday inside the main show courts at the USTA National Tennis Center. 

The semifinals and championship match will be on Wednesday night.

All matches are best-of-three, like normal doubles events, but to fit the event into two days, only four games are required to win a set. 

No advantage scoring will be used as well. Once a game reaches deuce, the team that wins the next point wins the game.

Only the championship match will be played in a traditional format with six games needed to win a set. 

American Jessica Pegula and Jack Draper of Great Britain are the top-seeded duo. They face Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu in the first round. 

Three all-American teams are entered in the draw. Frances Tiafoe and Madison Keys are playing together, as are Taylor Townsend and Ben Shelton.

Venus Williams will also participate in the event alongside fellow American Reilly Opelka.

Jannik Sinner, Alexander Zverev and Taylor Fritz are among the top-ranked men's singles players participating in the event. Elena Rybakina, Mirra Andreeva and Naomi Osaka are the headliners from the women's singles side. 

This isn't a traditional doubles event, and because most of the players do not have extensive mixed doubles experience, the tournament is wide open and any of the 16 teams could win the event.","{'href': 'https://bleacherreport.com', 'title': 'Bleacher Report'}","tennis"

Edmund reached an Australian Open semi-final in 2018 and was part of the Great Britain team that won the Davis Cup in 2015

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

Kyle Edmund, the former British No 1 who reached an Australian Open semi-final and a career-high of 14 in the world, has retired from tennis at the age of 30. 

Edmund said his body had “finally reached the end point” after struggling with a series of injuries, as well as three knee surgeries, that blighted the end of his career. 

The Yorkshireman became just the second British player after Andy Murray since 1978 to reach the Australian Open semi-finals when he did so in 2018, where he lost to Marin Cilic in straight sets having defeated the No 3 seed Grigor Dimitrov in the quarter-finals. 

The result was his best at a grand slam tournament, but Edmund was also part of the Great Britain team that won the Davis Cup in 2015 and represented his country at the 2016 Olympics in Rio. 

After succeeding an injury-hit Murray to become British No 1 and reach 14th in the world rankings in 2018, Edmund started to struggle with his chronic knee problem and he underwent the first of his three surgeries in 2020. It sidelined Edmund for almost two years and signalled the end of his time at the top. 

“The last five years have taken a toll with three surgeries and other injuries such as wrist, ab, hip and foot in trying to get better, my body is telling me its finally reached the end point,” Edmund said upon announcing his retirement. 

“Looking back I can say I tried my absolute best in my career and my hardest to get back to where I was. There are no regrets whatsoever. 

“I have always been quite a determined person and I have no doubt I'll apply those principles that I learned in my tennis career to whatever I do next and something I'm very excited about.”

Edmund won two ATP Tour singles titles, winning tournaments in Antwerp in 2018 and the 2020 New York Open. 

His best performance at Wimbledon was reaching the third round as British No 1 in 2018, where he was extremely unfortunate to run into Novak Djokovic, who was seeded 12th and went on to win the title. 

After struggling with injuries, Edmund spent the final years of his career on the lower-level ITF and ATP Challenger circuits and he played the final match of his career in the Nottingham final, losing to Jack Pinnington-Jones. 

“I want to congratulate Kyle on a professional career which delivered many outstanding and memorable achievements,” the LTA's chief executive Scott Lloyd said. “Through his quiet determination and sheer hard work both on and off the court, he reached British No.1, a career-high of No.14 in the world, the last four of the Australian Open and played a key role in our Davis Cup semifinal runs in 2016 and 2019, after also being on the winning team in 2015. 

“These represent just a few highlights of his career demonstrating his incredible talent. Everyone at the LTA and the whole British tennis family wishes him the very best in the next chapter of his life.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Mektic/Ram clinch first Masters 1000 trophy in Cincinnati","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/cincinnati-2025-doubles-final","Mon, 18 Aug 2025 00:19:25 GMT","

Nikola Mektic and Rajeev Ram completed a dream run at the Cincinnati Open on Sunday when they held their nerve to defeat Lorenzo Musetti and Lorenzo Sonego in the doubles final to secure their maiden Masters 1000 title as a pair. 

Playing their first tour-level final together in just their third event of the year, Mektic and Ram staged a comeback to edge the all-Italian pair 4-6, 6-3, 10-5 in a 90-minute clash to win their first trophy as a team. With the win, they are up 196 spots to No. 25 in the PIF ATP Live Doubles Teams Rankings.

""Tennis, right? Crazy stories. This is our third tournament together, even though we know each other for three decades, probably. Thank you so much, I can't thank you enough, and it was a pleasure playing this week,"" Mektic said to Ram during the trophy presentation ceremony.



The Croatian-American duo won 87 per cent (34/39) of their first-serve points, according to Infosys ATP Stats, to claim their first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with Musetti and Sonego. En route to the title match, they defeated Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool in the semi-finals and snapped the pair's 22-match winning streak. 

By reaching the final, Mektic joined Rohan Bopanna and Mate Pavic as the only active doubles players to reach finals of all nine ATP Masters 1000 events. With the win, he earned his 11th Masters 1000 crown, the most among active players. At 41 years and 4 months, Ram became the second-oldest men's doubles champion in Cincinnati in the Open Era, after 42-year-old Daniel Nestor, who triumphed in 2015 with Edouard Roger-Vasselin.

""We have known each other a really long time...We've played some great matches against each other. It is so nice to have him [Mektic] on my side of the net,"" Ram said. 

Musetti and Sonego were aiming to become the first all-Italian pair to win a Masters 1000 title since the series began in 1990. Musetti was also aiming to become the youngest ATP Masters 1000 doubles champion since a 20-year-old Felix Auger-Aliassime triumphed at the 2020 Rolex Paris Masters with Hubert Hurkacz.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","How the Sinner-Alcaraz Cincinnati final could prove pivotal in No. 1 battle entering US Open","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/sinner-alcaraz-cincinnati-2025-final-rankings-projection","Mon, 18 Aug 2025 00:03:08 GMT","

The Cincinnati Open final between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz will have huge ramifications on the battle for the No. 1 PIF ATP Ranking heading into the US Open.

If Alcaraz defeats Sinner on Monday in the pair's fourth Lexus ATP Head2Head clash of the season, the Spaniard will lead the PIF ATP Live Rankings once the season's final major begins.

Wait a second... Doesn't Sinner lead Alcaraz by 2,250 points in the Live Rankings entering the Cincinnati final? How could one win change things so drastically?

PIF ATP Live Rankings




It all goes back to last year's US Open, where Sinner lifted the trophy and Alcaraz suffered a shocking second-round loss to Botic van de Zandschulp in New York. The Italian earned 1,950 points more than his great rival in New York.

Therefore, the gap is not as big at it seems. If Alcaraz triumphs in Cincinnati for the first time, he would pull to within 1,900 points of Sinner. Once you remove their 2024 US Open points in the Live Rankings, Alcaraz would be ahead by 50 points.

Sinner can help his cause by successfully defending the Cincinnati title Monday. With a victory by the new 24-year-old, there would be a 700-point swing in his direction and he would lead the Live Rankings by 650 points with last year's Flushing Meadows points dropped.

Either way, World No. 1 will be up for grabs in New York. Even if Sinner wins Monday, the only way he could guarantee his departure from the US Open with World No. 1 is by earning his third Slam trophy of the season. Alcaraz could also claim No. 1 by winning the US Open, regardless of how his rival performs at the season's final major. 

But if Sinner emerges victorious in Cincinnati, Alcaraz will need to reach the semi-finals at Flushing Meadows to have a chance of usurping Sinner for the first time since the Italian's ascent on 10 June 2024. The Cincinnati Open final will begin at 3 p.m. local time Monday.

With Taylor Townsend and Ben Shelton reuniting, and duos like Iga Swiatek and Casper Ruud or Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz, the revamped event has no shortage of favorites.

Two years ago, Taylor Townsend and a largely unknown 19-year-old raced all the way into the US Open mixed doubles semifinals.

That teenager was Ben Shelton and today he's a Top 10 player on the ATP Tour. Townsend, meanwhile, has risen to the No. 1 doubles player in the PIF WTA Rankings. When the US Open announced a ground-breaking makeover for the standard Grand Slam mixed doubles tournament, Shelton jumped on the phone.

“So are we doing this or what?” Shelton asked Townsend.

“Yeah,” she answered, “I was just waiting on your call.”

Recently in Washington, D.C., Shelton elaborated.

“She's the best mixed doubles player in the world, hands down,” he said. “So if I was going to play, I wasn't going to play at all unless I could play with her. My dad [his coach Bryan] was, like, ‘There's no point in playing if you're not trying to win it.'

“And she's who I think I have a chance to win it with.”

Both of them fielded mixed doubles questions in the nation's capital, where some reporters were calling them “overdogs.”

“I'm excited to see how things go, because the field is amazing,” Townsend said. “The players are spectacular. And I think it's really cool to be able to also do this during Fan Week and qualies week where then you're bringing an influx of fans, people, celebrities, all of these different types, these energies that are coming to the tournament.”

In an effort to draw more elite singles players, the United States Tennis Association seriously tweaked the format, making it a two-day event a week ahead of the main singles draws. The 16 teams begin play at the Billie Jean King Tennis Center on Tuesday, Aug. 19, at 11 a.m. The 7 p.m. Wednesday evening session in Arthur Ashe Stadium will feature the semifinals and final.

Incentives for singles players: Best-of-three-set matches, with short sets of up to four games, with no-ad scoring. If each team wins four games in a set, they'll play a tiebreak. If the teams split sets, a 10-point match tiebreak will be played in lieu of a third set.

The final will be a best-of-three-set match, with sets maxing out at six games. If it goes the distance, the two teams will play a deciding set.

Eight of the teams were determined by direct entry based on their combined singles ranking. The other eight were granted wild cards.

Feast your eyes on these dream teams:

Direct entries (8): No. 1 seeds Jessica Pegula and Jack Draper, No. 2 Elena Rybakina and Taylor Fritz, No. 3 Iga Swiatek and Casper Ruud and No. 4 Amanda Anisimova and Holger Rune. Other teams include Belinda Bencic and Alexander Zverev, Mirra Andreeva and Daniil Medvedev, Karolina Muchova and Andrey Rublev and Madison Keys and Frances Tiafoe.

Wild cards (8): Katerina Siniakova and Jannik Sinner, Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz, Olga Danilovic and Novak Djokovic, Taylor Townsend and Ben Shelton, Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori, Venus Williams and Reilly Opelka, Naomi Osaka and Gael Monfils and Caty McNally and Lorenzo Musetti.

Ten of those players are Grand Slam champions, most notably Djokovic (24), Williams (7) -- not to mention her 16 major doubles titles -- and Swiatek (6). Five WTA Top 10 players are entered, along with six from the ATP Tour. Errani won a gold medal at the Paris Olympics with Jasmine Paolini, Bencic won singles gold in Tokyo and Venus has three golds in doubles.

World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka was scheduled to play with Grigor Dimitrov, but a pectoral injury scuttled that pairing. Not that there weren't other options.

“Well, there is a few guys who are asking,” Sabalenka said, “but no, I don't think so.”

Emma Navarro was supposed to play with Jannik Sinner, the ATP's World No. 1, but she opted to play Monterrey instead. At the last minute, Sinner elected to pair with Siniakova, a 10-time major doubles champion, Olympic gold medalist in Tokyo and mixed champion recently at Wimbledon with Sem Verbeek.

Likewise Katie Boulter, who had lobbied with boyfriend Alex de Minaur on social media, is in the Cleveland singles main draw.

How about the pairing of World No. 2 Alcaraz and 2021 US Open champion Emma Raducanu? Or the tallest team of massive-serving Opelka and Williams? Or the pop of Rybakina and Fritz?

“He has great game, huge shots and serve,” Rybakina said. “I also can serve well, so hopefully, yeah, it's going to work out.”

There will be drama with three of the four Cincinnati Open finalists -- Swiatek, Sinner and Alcaraz -- playing on Monday and scheduled to play in New York on Tuesday, starting at 11 a.m.

Townsend said she's “super-stoked” to be playing with Shelton, but neither partner is ready to say they're the favorites.

“I don't know about that -- got some big hitters in there,” Shelton said. “We're both from Atlanta. We have known each other, been friends since I have been out on tour.”

The players understand this is a Grand Slam event and an opportunity to grow the game by attracting casual and even non-tennis fans. They also want to enjoy themselves and entertain the fans.

“We compete hard,” Shelton said. “But we clown out there also. Yeah, it's a big prize. I forget what the prize money is for the tournament, but I feel like it's ridiculous.”

The winning team gets $1 million.

“I think that really everyone has to keep an open mind and not judge it,” Townsend said. “Go into looking at it from the lens of tradition and what things have been.

“Because this is nothing like anything that's been done in the sport before.”

Defending Cincinnati Open champion Aryna Sabalenka defeated Jessica Bouzas Maneiro in straight sets to set up a highly anticipated quarterfinal match with Elena Rybakina, who beat Madison Keys in a battle of Top 10 players Wednesday night.

Two nights after outlasting Emma Raducanu in a three-hour thriller, Aryna Sabalenka needed half that time to get the better of Jessica Bouzas Maneiro in their fourth-round match Wednesday night.

The World No. 1 wrapped up a straight-set victory, 6-1, 7-5, in one hour and 20 minutes to advance to the quarterfinals and move one step closer to defending her Cincinnati Open title.

Her next obstacle? Elena Rybakina.

Rybakina came out on top in her own fourth-round match, a Top 10 clash against Madison Keys, 6-7(3), 6-4, 6-2 to set up the second meeting of 2025 between her and Sabalenka.

Cincinnati: Draws | Scores | Order of Play

After a relatively routine first set, nothing came easy for Sabalenka in the second.

The Belarusian used an early break to take a 4-2 advantage and appeared to be on her way to a straightforward win before Bouzas Maneiro won three straight games to take a 5-4 lead in the second set.

Bouzas Maneiro got within two points of winning the set and forcing a decider before Sabalenka rediscovered the level she had at the start of the match. 

“Jessica is a great player,” Sabalenka said after the match. “I knew coming into the night that I'd have to work for every point. She didn't start well at the beginning, but then she found her rhythm and it was a really tough battle. I'm super happy to get this win in straight sets. I didn't want to stay here for three hours, sorry guys.”

With the victory, Sabalenka becomes the first player to register 50 wins on the WTA Tour in 2025. It's the third straight season she has tallied 50 or more wins.

She also becomes the first player to reach at least four consecutive Cincinnati quarterfinals since Simona Halep, who made six straight from 2013 to 2018.

After a string of near-misses this season, it was only a matter of time before Rybakina scored a statement win in 2025.

That moment came Wednesday night in a Top 10 showdown against Keys, who had defeated Rybakina at the Australian Open earlier this year in three sets.

It was Rybakina claiming victory in a three-set thriller this time around, and in the process, she becomes just the second Top 10 player since 1990 to claim three comeback wins en route to a Tier 1/WTA 1000 quarterfinal.

The victory over Keys is Rybakina's second Top 10 win of 2025, after coming from a set down to defeat Paula Badosa in Dubai in February. 

She'll have another chance at a Top 10 win when she faces Sabalenka in the quarterfinals.

While Rybakina is coming off a big win, it's Sabalenka who holds the edge in this oft-played rivalry.

Sabalenka leads the series 7-4, and won their most recent meeting earlier this year in Berlin, 7-6(6), 3-6, 7-6(6), to reach the semifinals on the grass.

However, one stat that favors Rybakina ahead of Friday's quarterfinal: Neither player has won two in a row in the last six matches of this series.

Formula 1® is excited to launch F1® Box, a brand-new immersive racing experience from the creators of F1® Arcade which will open at Westfield Stratford City, UK on Friday 22 August.

A first of its kind experience, F1® Box will bring fans closer to the thrill and excitement of a Formula 1 Grand Prix through a new innovative format, which pits drivers against each other in a head-to-head immersive racing challenge across its 12 Arcade-style F1 racing simulators.

Players will get straight to business as they battle their friends, family and other fans in two back-to-back races, tracking their progress via the live leaderboards and with the help of real-time race data. 

F1® Box is not about mastering every track or clocking endless laps. It is about fast; competitive gameplay built for today's social-first crowd. Expect reactive lighting and huge digital screens in an epic space. Arrive, race, win, and move on.

It marks the latest experiential offering by Formula 1 to engage with fans away from track in fun and accessible ways. It follows the rapid rise of F1® Arcade which now boasts five locations across the UK and US, including London, Birmingham, Boston, Washington D.C. and most recently Philadelphia.  

Emily Prazer, Chief Commercial Officer at Formula 1, said:

The success of F1® Arcade has shown that people crave that burst of adrenaline that comes from going head-to-head against your friends and family. We can't wait for London to go racing and to see if the fans have what it takes to top the podium.”

Adam Breeden, Founder and CEO of F1® Arcade, said:

“F1® Box is the first of its kind; a uniquely immersive experience combining a state-of-the-art audio-visual production that brings the racer right to the track, amplifying the drama of every moment. The concept offers significant global growth potential, bringing a small-format, dramatized version of our F1® Arcade racing experience to millions more Formula 1 fans and newcomers worldwide.”

F1® Box opens at Westfield Stratford City from 22 August, with slots being made available to book online at www.f1box.com, as well as some walk-ins. Details of additional F1® Box locations will be announced in due course, with plans of global expansion.

The best of Valtteri Bottas' iconic onboard cameras 

12 times title dreams ended

With the summer break upon us, we take a moment to run through Racing Bulls' season up to this point, which has featured both a driver change and a team boss change.

Racing Bulls have finished eighth in the Teams' Championship for the last two seasons – and it is the position they occupy just over halfway through an up-and-down 2025 campaign. From eye-catching displays to missed opportunities and a driver change to a new team boss, there is plenty to review at Red Bull's sister outfit. Here is their half term report…

Isack Hadjar and Liam Lawson – 6th in Monaco and Austria

Racing Bulls made a rapid start to 2025 – at least in terms of one-lap pace. Yuki Tsunoda charged to fifth during Qualifying in Australia, while both he and rookie team mate Isack Hadjar made Q3 in China. However, strategic errors and incidents meant they left both events empty-handed.

It was not until Japan, where Red Bull sent a struggling Liam Lawson back to Racing Bulls and pulled Tsunoda the other way, that the first points were logged, with Hadjar again making the pole position shootout and going on to take the chequered flag in eighth place.

Since then, both Hadjar and Lawson have contributed to Racing Bulls' tally of 45 points – their equal-best results coming at the Monaco and Austrian Grands Prix, where the Frenchman and New Zealander achieved standout top-six finishes respectively.

Hadjar 9-3 Lawson
Hadjar 1-1 Tsunoda

Hadjar had the measure of Lawson during their early weekends as team mates and soon pulled out a lead in their Qualifying head-to-head. Solid gains from Lawson have steadied the ship in recent events, though, with the score reading 2-2 from the last four weekends.

At the start of the season, Hadjar and Tsunoda tied 1-1 over the two full Qualifying sessions they spent as team mates – Tsunoda via his eye-catching effort at Melbourne's Albert Park and Hadjar with his P7 grid slot at the Shanghai International Circuit.

Hadjar 8-3 Lawson
Hadjar 1-1 Tsunoda

It is a similar story when it comes to Hadjar and Lawson's race day head-to-head, which reads 8-3 in favour of last year's F2 runner-up. Given that both drivers retired from a rain-hit British Grand Prix due to incidents, the Silverstone event could not count towards the overall score.

Hadjar and Tsunoda, meanwhile, also went 1-1 across their two Grands Prix – Hadjar failing to start his debut race in Australia with a formation lap spin, before bouncing back to beat Tsunoda (who was hindered by a front wing issue) in China.

While their P6 finishes in Monaco and Austria gave Hadjar and Lawson cause for celebration on a personal level, this year's visit to the streets of Monte Carlo also brought a particularly strong display of teamwork from Racing Bulls' line-up.

With both drivers starting in the top 10, Lawson successfully backed the midfield pack up during a mandated two-stop race around the Principality, keeping a queue of cars behind to give Hadjar a clear run to sixth – while completing a double points finish in P8 himself.

Changeable weather at Silverstone presented a massive chance for F1's midfield teams to spring a surprise, but Racing Bulls' hopes were dashed by Lawson being spun out on the first lap and Hadjar later crashing into the back of Kimi Antonelli in the worst of the rain.

It was a painful double DNF for the operation, whose championship rivals Kick Sauber, Alpine, Aston Martin and Williams all scored – Hulkenberg's incredible run from 19th on the grid to a maiden F1 podium showing what could have been possible on another day.

Following on from the Lawson/Tsunoda driver swap, there has also been a recent change of team boss at Racing Bulls, with Laurent Mekies getting called up by Red Bull to replace Christian Horner and experienced engineer Alan Permane filling the void.

Permane has taken the reins of a factory that produced a very solid and compliant car in the VCARB 02, as underlined by Lawson following his brief stint in Red Bull's RB21, with the priority being to “keep that trajectory” while ensuring no more opportunities slip by.

“I just want to make sure we're getting the best out of the cars the designers and the production team have given us to race, and if we can do that, then we'll have a good last half of the season,” Permane recently told F1.com.

Racing Bulls' last three seasons (which include previous RB and AlphaTauri guises) read eighth, eighth and ninth when it comes to the Teams' Championship standings – 2021 marking the last time they broke into the top six thanks to some consistently strong scoring.

With just 25 points covering fifth-placed Williams to eighth-placed Racing Bulls as things stand, the door is very much open for the squad to earn their best classification in several years – but as touched on above, the likes of strategy and execution will need to be nailed.

The British actor, who starred in 'Billy Budd,' 'Wall Street,' 'Superman II' and 'The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,' died Sunday at 87. 


							By 

	Abid Rahman


International Editor, Digital


	A host of Hollywood luminaries took to social media to pay tribute to British acting icon Terence Stamp, who died Sunday at 87. 


	Stamp was an enduring cultural icon of the Swinging '60s who first made his name with films like Billy Budd, Far From the Madding Crowd, Poor Cow and Teorema before finding later mainstream success with roles in Superman II, The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, Big Eyes and Last Night in Soho.



	Filmmaker Edgar Wright, who worked with Stamp on his 2021 feature Last Night in Soho, wrote on X, “Terence was kind, funny, and endlessly fascinating. I loved discussing music with him (his brother managed The Who, and he's name-checked in The Kinks' Waterloo Sunset) or reminiscing about his films, going back to his debut in Billy Budd. He spoke of his last shot in that film, describing a transcendental moment with the camera — a sense of becoming one with the lens. Decades later, while directing him, I witnessed something similar. The closer the camera moved, the more hypnotic his presence became. In close-up, his unblinking gaze locked in so powerfully that the effect was extraordinary. Terence was a true movie star: the camera loved him, and he loved it right back.”

	Legendary Hollywood producer Gale Anne Hurd, who worked with Stamp on 1988's Alien Nation, tweeted, “Terence Stamp was a brilliant actor. I think he and Peter O'Toole not only had the most mesmerizing eyes…but delivered equally indelible performances.”

	











	Actor Lou Diamond Phillips, who starred with Stamp in Young Guns, wrote on X, “Terribly saddened to hear this. We were all incredibly privileged to have worked with him on Young Guns. He grounded all of us and truly elevated the filming experience. Such class and artistry. What a kind, beautiful, generous man. RIP”


	On X, Stamp's The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert co-star Guy Pearce wrote, “Fairwell dear Tel. You were a true inspiration, both in & out of heels. We'll always have Kings Canyon, Kings road & F'ing ABBA. Wishing you well on your way ‘Ralph'! xxxx💕”


Speaking to the Guardian, Priscilla writer-director Stephen Elliott said, “We talked long and hard about why he'd initially said no [to the role]. It was fear. And fair enough — you have got to remember we were coming out of the HIV/Aids mess. It was a taboo subject. I looked at the work that he'd done all the way through, like the Italian years when he worked with Fellini and Pasolini, and thought: this was a man who took chances. And I think he was at absolutely the right moment in his life where he was ready for another chance. Terence admitted he was absolutely terrified to play Bernadette — he was being voted one of the best-looking men on earth and suddenly in Priscilla he was, and this is a direct quote, ‘dressed up as an old dog.' But he put the pain of what he was going through into the performance, and that's what made the film.”


	Elliott added, “Terence kept to himself. He was an enigma. And then he'd show up, use the eyes and turn everybody to jelly.”

	











	Below is some of the reaction to Stamp's death and notable entertainment industry people who have shared their thoughts and memories of the actor.  

I am deeply saddened by the passing of Terence Stamp, a British actor who was truly iconic. An East Ender that rose to such fame in Swinging Sixties London, he could rightly be called its epicentre.

RIP handsome & intense actor Terence Stamp, dead at 87.

The British network said the film had ""moved in the schedule"" with no update at press time about when it might air.

	A planned BBC One documentary chronicling the final years of Ozzy Osbourne‘s life, Ozzy Osbourne: Coming Home, was abruptly pulled from the network's schedule on Monday (Aug. 18) just hours before it was slated to air with no explanation. According to a BBC report, the network had been expected to air the doc on Monday evening, it “has postponed the screening without giving reasons or a new transmission date.”

	











	Osbourne died on July 22 at age 76, two weeks after performing his final show at his home soccer stadium, Villa Park, in Birmingham, England.




			Trending on Billboard		







	The film was described as a “moving and inspirational account” of the final chapter of Osbourne's life, filmed over three years with participation from his wife/manager Sharon Osbourne, and two of the couple's children, Jack and Kelly. 


	“The resulting film is a moving portrait of one of the world's most entertaining families at a pivotal moment in their history,” reads a description of the doc. “The strength of Ozzy and Sharon's love for one another and their kids' devotion to them is palpable. So too is the family's acceptance of Ozzy becoming increasingly unwell.”


	The doc was originally pitched as a chronicle of the Osbourne's return to England after years of living in Los Angeles, serving as a kind of bookend to the family' beloved MTV reality show, The Osbournes, which aired on the network from 2002-2005. That version, first pitched in 2002 as a reality show-like series called Home to Roost, evolved as Osbourne's health deteriorated due to the effects of Parkinson's disease and a series of surgeries on Ozzy's neck and spine.

	











	“Ahead of retirement, Ozzy is determined to perform one last time, for himself and for his fans. Whatever it takes,” the description continued. “Pulling off both the move and the gig will be a phenomenal achievement, and son Jack is worried about the toll of relocating to a country that his parents have barely spent time in over the last two decades, as well as the impact on their close-knit family dynamics. But Ozzy has never been a man to take no for an answer, and he sets about achieving his goals with the determination, blistering honesty and razor-sharp sense of humour that have endeared him to millions for over 50 years. He stops at nothing to make his body work as well as it used to, with the film capturing remarkable levels of resolve.”


	A BBC spokesperson told US Weekly that “the film has moved in the schedules and we'll confirm new [transmission] details in due course.”


	The film will show Osbourne “heroically” fighting to get fit enough to perform at the moving, star-studded Back to the Beginning show, where he played solo and Black Sabbath sets from a goth-y throne alongside sets from Metallica, Slayer, Guns N' Roses, Mastodon, Lamb of God, Yungblud and many more. Amid the “love, laughter and tears” and sweet family moments, the doc also reportedly features scenes of Ozzy's adult children accepting that the end is nigh, as evidenced by Kelly's comment that “Iron man wasn't really made of iron,” in reference to one of Sabbath's most iconic songs.


	“We hope it brings comfort and joy to Ozzy's fans and viewers as they remember and celebrate his extraordinary life,” BBC's head of documentary commissioning, Clare Sillery, told BBC about the honor of filming the Osbournes during this difficult period. Two of the film's executive producers told the BBC that it was an “inspiring and poignant” account of Ozzy working to play one last show. 

	











	“Ozzy was loved by millions around the world not just for his music, but for his sense of mischief and his honesty, all of which we saw plenty of in the final years of his life,” said Ben Wicks and Colin Barr. “But one thing shone through even more brightly to us and that was Ozzy's intense love for his exceptional family who were by his side through it all.”

Five decades into her career, the Cuban American legend — along with Shakira, Cyndi Lauper, Camila Cabello and more — reflects on her legacy in Latin music.


													By
												

	Sigal Ratner-Arias


Deputy Editor, Billboard Español


Gloria Estefan remembers vividly the first time she met her husband, Emilio Estefan Jr. “He had short shorts, he had great legs, playing the accordion — he looked naked,” she says with a laugh while reflecting on a moment that would change their lives forever.


	She was at a friend's house putting a band together for one night, and Emilio, who knew her friend, showed up to give them some pointers. “I was sitting on the floor and I thought, ‘Wow, this guy has charisma,' ” she recalls. “He left, we did our gig, everybody went their separate ways.”

	











	That summer, the two would meet again at a wedding that her mother had dragged her to. He was part of the band, playing Van McCoy's “Do the Hussle” on the accordion when she spotted him — this time in a tux. “We run into each other in a doorway, and he goes, ‘You're that girl!' and I go, ‘Yeah, you're that guy.' ‘Come sing with the band!' And I go, ‘Ahhhh.' ” By then, she was known within the community, and many guests had heard her play guitar and sing since she was a kid.




			Trending on Billboard		







	So she obliged and performed two Latin classics, “Sabor a Mí” and “Tú Me Acostumbraste,” earning both an ovation from the guests and an invitation from Emilio to formally join the band. Gloria Maria Milagrosa Fajardo, then 18 years old, working two jobs and about to start college, politely declined.

	











	“He found my number and called me two weeks later,” Gloria continues, beaming. It was her grandmother who made her see the light. “‘You aren't going to be happy in your life unless you share your gift,' ” she recalls her saying. “ ‘Listen to me and not your mother.' And I did. I joined the band for fun.”


	“I really liked the metal in her voice,” Emilio says. “I thought there was a sound for the new generation that was bilingual — the Miami Sound — and I said, ‘This would be good, because it would be something new in the music industry, and she can sing both in English and Spanish.'


	“I think that Gloria and I, it was destiny, because we both found happiness in music amidst all the tragedy we were going through,” he adds. “I didn't have my mom, I didn't have anyone, and I was obsessed with being able to carry a sound that I thought was unique. And also, the need [as a Cuban immigrant] — everything I saved would be used to bring my mother, my brother, my whole family [to the U.S.].” As for Gloria, “I saw her sad — her father went to the Bay of Pigs. When he came back, he went to Vietnam, and when he came back from Vietnam, he came back in a wheelchair. But when it came to making music, her eyes shone.”


	Now that 50 years have passed, Gloria adds, “Every step of the way has continued to be fun.”


	Since rising to stardom in the 1980s as the lead vocalist of Miami Sound Machine and later as a solo artist, Gloria has helped infuse Latin flavor into English-language pop music, breaking barriers with hits like 1985's top 10 Billboard Hot 100 hit “Conga” — which was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame this year — and “Rhythm Is Gonna Get You” while also singing in Spanish.

	











	She has placed 29 songs on the Hot 100 — three of them at No. 1 (“Anything for You” in 1988, “Don't Wanna Lose You” in 1989 and “Coming Out of the Dark ” in 1991) — and 31 tracks on the Hot Latin Songs chart, 15 of which reached the top (from “Si Voy a Perderte” in 1989 to “Hotel Nacional” in 2012).


	Her first Spanish-language album, Mi Tierra (1993), spent an impressive 58 weeks at the summit of Top Latin Albums and earned her the first of her four Grammy Awards. Her latest, Raíces, debuted in the top 10 of the Tropical Albums chart, while the title track landed atop Latin Airplay, Tropical Airplay and Latin Pop Airplay. In between, 2000's Alma Caribeña debuted and spent seven weeks at No. 1 on Top Latin Albums and 2007's 90 Millas debuted and spent three weeks at the top of the same chart.


	“Gloria Estefan is a global icon, a true artist with endless talent, but above all, she's a wonderful person,” says Afo Verde, chairman/CEO of Sony Music Latin Iberia. “Her trust in Sony Music throughout her career speaks to a relationship based on professionalism, passion, love and respect. She's an essential part of the company's heart.”


	“Gloria Estefan represents the best of our music and our history,” adds Alex Gallardo, president of Sony Music U.S. Latin. “Her legacy is eternal, and her generosity and spirit continue to inspire all of us who have the privilege of working with her.”


	Gloria has also proved to be a talented author — she's written two children's books — and an actor with a comedic edge in her performance as the no-nonsense mother in the 2022 remake of Father of the Bride alongside Andy Garcia. She also co-hosted Red Table Talk: The Estefans, a spinoff of the popular talk show Red Table Talk, featuring her daughter, Emily Estefan, and niece Lili Estefan.

	











	It's a remarkable career for the Cuban American star, who in 2023 became the first Latina inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and in 2024 received the Legend Award at the Billboard Latin Women in Music ceremony for her lifetime achievements — all while balancing work and family and putting her loved ones first.


	And many have not only noticed but been inspired by her, inside and outside the Latin music world.


	“To have that sound and go mainstream, topping the pop charts, was groundbreaking and really incredible. What she and Miami Sound Machine did influenced music, food, television, fashion,” American pop icon Cyndi Lauper, her contemporary and friend, tells Billboard Español. “Gloria is a true cultural phenomenon. And on top of that, she and Emilio are the salt of the earth. Such great people, generosity of spirit, caring, leading by example to change to world. People throw these kinds of words around a lot, but the Estefans really did change the world.”


	“Gloria and Emilio have been a true family to me. They've always made me feel at home, and when the U.S. was a new country for me, they supported me every step of the way,” Colombian superstar Shakira recalls. “Gloria was a role model, a true inspiration … She accompanied me throughout my crossover as a mentor and a friend, helping me translate my lyrics from Spanish to English [for the 2001 album Laundry Service] while maintaining their essence when I hadn't yet mastered the language.”


	“Gloria is a hero to me, not only for being a pioneer in music and opening doors for Latinos in the industry but also for what she represents as a human being,” Cuban American star Camila Cabello says. “Beyond her talent, her humility, her passion for her people, her fight for our shared dream of a free Cuba make her even more admirable and adored by all.”

	











	A mother of two and a proud grandmother of one, Gloria now chooses her projects carefully, based not only on what moves her but also how much time and travel it will take. “A lot of it has to do with, ‘Is it going to take me away from my family?' ” she says. “If it's something that is going to take me away from my grandson's life and miss big chunks of it — that's high on my list of priorities. He is growing so fast.” She also feels she's earned that precious time. She will do an occasional concert but not a full, big tour like she used to in the '80s and '90s, when she was at the peak of her stardom. “[Touring] is wonderful because I get to be with the fans, but it is like boot camp for me,” she explains. “I've worked really hard in my life, and I think, ‘Did I really work that hard to work this hard?' ”


	In the last few years, she's been busy creating songs for an upcoming Broadway musical titled BASURA (Spanish for “garbage”) along with her daughter. Based on the 2015 award-winning documentary Landfill Harmonic, it will narrate the journey of Paraguay's Recycled Orchestra, a group of young artists who turn scrap material into musical instruments.


	So when Emilio presented her with the idea for the song “Raíces” a couple of years ago, Gloria, who usually writes or co-writes her own music, got excited.


	“Emilio didn't even realize [this year] was my 50th [career anniversary],” says Gloria, who wanted to do something special to celebrate. “I told him, ‘Babe, I can't change my mindset for this, but I would like, if I do an album again, for it to be tropical, for it to be in Spanish.' He says, ‘Do you trust me?' I go, ‘Who else am I going to trust [other] than you?' ”

	











	Released May 30 on Sony Music Latin, Raíces contains 13 tracks mostly co-written by Emilio. Salsa, bolero and tropical rhythms resonate in songs ranging from the title track and “La Vecina (No Sé Na')” to romantic tunes such as “Tan Iguales y Tan Diferentes,” “Te Juro,” “Agua Dulce” and “Tú y Yo.”


	“He wrote his own love songs for me to sing to him!” Gloria jokes.


	Among the songs she penned is the sweet “Mi Niño Bello (Para Sasha),” dedicated to her grandson, with an English version titled “My Beautiful Boy (For Sasha).” Another track on the album, “Cuando el Tiempo Nos Castiga” (co-written by Emilio and Gian Marco and originally recorded by Jon Secada in 2001), also has a new English version courtesy of Gloria titled “How Will You Be Remembered.”


	Gloria sat with Billboard for a trip down memory lane leading straight to the future.


Going back to your beginnings, what do you remember about your start in the music business? You've said in the past that you were shy.


	It's not that I was shy, because one-on-one I was perfectly fine and I could handle any situation. I was an observer. But what I don't like is to be the center of attention; that's just not my nature. So to join the band, it was for fun. I never thought, “Oh, I'm going to be famous,” or “I'm going to do these crazy things.” No.


And there was a really nice guy in that band…


	He was, but I saw him as a man. He was only four-and-a-half years older than me, but he was very responsible, and he took care of his parents. He worked during the day, he studied at night, he had side jobs, he had businesses. I saw him as “Oh, Mr. Estefan,” you know, the boss … I didn't start dating him until a year after. He had an older girlfriend, let me tell you. She was 36, he was 22. And I didn't think he would be interested in me. I had zero experience, never went out anywhere because I took care of my dad [who had multiple sclerosis]. Joining the band was a freeing experience, and marrying him was an even more freeing experience. I didn't think I'd get married the day after I turned 21. I had no doubt that I wanted to be with him the rest of my life. We've made a very unique partnership, and a lot of the things we've accomplished [are] because we're together.

	











When did you realize that you had really made it in music?


	When “Conga” crossed charts in Billboard, I thought, “OK, they're getting it, they're understanding what we have believed all along could happen.” And look, that song is now going to the Grammy Hall of Fame [after] 40 years.


Which three songs do you consider to be the most important in your career and why?


	“Conga,” clearly. Probably “Mi Tierra.” And “Con Los Años Que Me Quedan,” [which] became a love song and a wedding song and it's the first song that Emilio and I wrote together way back in the day. But there are so many more!


OK, tell me two more.


	If we're going to be real, “Dr. Beat,” which actually broke through, but I didn't write that one. “Anything for You,” my very first No. 1. And “Coming Out of the Dark,” which was a big thank-you to everyone that sent prayers my way after the accident. That song poured out of me in 10 minutes. [In March 1990, Gloria was in a tour bus accident that resulted in a broken back and temporary paralysis. She underwent surgery and a lengthy recovery.]


I remember the first time you sang it live, at the American Music Awards.


	Oh, gosh, it was insane. I wanted to kill Emilio because Dick Clark had called Emilio in September [1990], so I was still at a point where I couldn't move by myself anywhere. And Emilio actually came to me to tell me that Dick Clark wanted me to perform the following January. I was inside this body that didn't feel familiar. I was relearning everything: how to walk, how to wash my face and not be in pain. The last thing that I'm going to think about is getting on a stage. I want to be able to walk and get a glass of water by myself. I want to not put my family through what I went through [with my father] if I could help it. He was nuts. I said, “Babe, I can't.” And then he told Dick Clark, “I can't convince her; you're going have to.” And Dick Clark got on a plane and flew to Miami to talk me into [the performance].

	











Did that help you with the recovery in any way?


	It did. Emilio, as usual, was right. My first outing three months after the accident was to the studio, because I felt so bad for him that he hadn't left my side. He said, “I have this piece of paper that I wrote this thing on the day you had the accident, in the helicopter. I found it today in my pant pocket.” It was all washed. He hands it to me. I look at it and I go, “Why is it in English?” (Laughs.) And it said: “Coming out of the dark.” He said, “I would love for you to come to the studio. Jon Secada is going to meet me there.” And I went, for him. And when I heard the one melody line of (Sings.) “coming out of the dark” that Jon sang, it was like, Oh, my God. And it all poured through me. That's what I was going to perform at the American Music Awards. Having that goal really helped me to focus and not just deambular [wander]. Even though every day I was focused on getting better, it gave me a date to shoot for.


Is there anything you miss doing or wish you could do without being recognized?


	Nothing stops me from doing anything I want. I was talking to my grandson about that the other day, because he and I would get in a car and go to an escape room and inevitably someone would ask for a picture. He knows I'm always going to stop. He always says, “I'll take the picture.” He's very kind about it. My kids lived a different experience, because that part of it — when you are at the top, you literally can't go anywhere because it becomes impossible. It creates a scene, people go crazy, you divert from the kids. Even though I told them, “If we're in public, I'm never going to say no to an autograph, because we have a moment to either make them happy or possibly traumatized from approaching anyone.” They understood, but it was harder for them. That's why I love this moment when, yes, we have a beautiful career and I still get the love, people ask me for hugs, but it's not the craziness of that moment when you're new, fresh; the fame is huge.

	











As one of the most stable and beloved couples in Latin music, how do you and Emilio keep the spark alive?


	Oh, my gosh. He makes me laugh every day. And if he goes on a trip, I'll go to brush my teeth and there's a little note: “Babe, I'm going to miss you.” He draws a little thing, him with the guitar or something. He's just very sweet and thoughtful. He would buy me stuff all year-round, to the point where I tell him, “Babe, please, I don't need any more jewelry,” but he's happy doing that. Me mima, he spoils me in so many ways. And I try to do the same for him. We're excited, we love being with each other, we miss each other. We don't sleep the same when we're apart. It just becomes deeper, and there's a lot of respect and admiration.


Is there anything you still would like to achieve professionally?


	This was always my go-to answer, and it's getting a little more difficult to envision it, but if it were to happen within the next few years, to sing in a free Cuba. Somehow that dream, every time we feel a piece of it — like what happened July 11 [of 2021 with the anti-government demonstrations] and we thought, “Oh, maybe this is it, maybe this is the moment” — it dissipates under the crushing weight of that dictatorship. Celia [Cruz] had that dream, too, and it wasn't in the cards.


As the closing song on Raíces, “How Will You Be Remembered,” goes, how do you wish to be remembered?


	I actually wrote a song answering that exact question years ago, and the title is “Remember Me With Love.” That's all I hope. That when people think about me, either because of my music or the way I represented the culture or family life, they remember me with love, there's a smile on their face and they play the music a lot.

This time, the ticking timer on the pop star's site is purple.

	Hannah Dailey



Taylor Swift is at it again. Less than a week after a mysterious countdown went live on her website and ticked down to what would turn out to be an announcement for her upcoming album, The Life of a Showgirl, the pop star has once again unveiled a cryptic timer heralding yet another piece of major news — but what could it be?


	Fans began noticing the new countdown on Monday morning (Aug. 18). Whereas the album announcement timer had an orange backdrop, the new countdown is set against a sparkly purple wallpaper.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	Giving no clues as to what will happen once the clock reaches 00:00:00, Swift's latest countdown simply states that it will expire at 2 p.m. ET on Monday.


	There's no telling what the 14-time Grammy winner has in store for fans this time. The musician has already bombarded Swifties with information over the past week, revealing on Aug. 12 that she had a new album titled The Life of a Showgirl on the way before sharing its cover art, release date and tracklist — featuring a Sabrina Carpenter collaboration — the following day. At the same time, four different variants of the LP became available for pre-order on Swift's site, including the “Sweat and Vanilla Perfume” edition, the “It's Frightening” edition, the “It's Rapturous” version and the “It's Beautiful” edition.




	“[The album is] a lot more upbeat, and it's a lot more fun pop excitement,” Swift said of the project on an Aug. 13 episode of boyfriend Travis Kelce's New Heights podcast, where she shared more details about her next era. “My main goals were melodies that were so infectious, you're almost angry at it … This is the record I've been wanting to make for a very long time.”


	There are still several weeks before Showgirl drops on Oct. 3, so the new countdown could mean anything. Will it lead to a lead single announcement? A music video? More alternate versions of the album? Swifties have theorized about all of the above, but the overwhelming feeling in the fandom is pure excitement at what the Eras Tour headliner could possibly have in store next.


	“I AM NOT READY FOR WHATEVER THIS COUNTDOWN LEADS TO,” one Swiftie wrote on X.


	Another person pleaded, “WHAT DOES IT MEAN TAYLOR?!”

Busta Rhymes and Ricky Martin are also set to perform and receive special awards.

	Paul Grein



Sabrina Carpenter is set to perform on the MTV Video Music Awards for the second year in a row.


	Last year, the pop sensation performed a three-smash medley – “Please Please Please,” “Taste” and “Espresso” – and won song of the year for “Espresso.” Carpenter is up for eight awards this year, including video of the year (“Manchild”) from her upcoming album Man's Best Friend.


Alex Warren, Busta Rhymes, J Balvin featuring DJ Snake, Ricky Martin and sombr are also set to perform on the show. The 2025 VMAs, hosted by LL COOL J, will air live coast-to-coast from New York's UBS Arena on Sunday, Sept. 7, at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT.


	Warren and sombr are both nominated for best new artist at the VMAs. Both are almost certain to be nominated in that category at the Grammys, as Carpenter was last year. Last year's VMA winner for best new artist, Chappell Roan, went on to win the Grammy in that category. (This year's other VMA nominees for best new artist are Ella Langley, Gigi Perez, Lola Young and The Marías.)

	Warren is also nominated for best pop and song of the year for his global No. 1 smash “Ordinary.” Sombr is also nominated for best alternative for his hit “back to friends,” one of three songs of his on the current Billboard Hot 100 (along with “Undressed” and “12 to 12”). This is billed as sombr's awards show debut.




	Busta will receive the MTV VMA Rock the Bells Visionary Award, presented by host LL COOL J (who had a hit in 1986 titled “Rock the Bells”). Martin will be honored with the inaugural Latin Icon Award.


	Martin's award honors a four-decade career that launched Latin music and culture into the mainstream. Martin's VMAs return marks the 26th anniversary of his first VMAs performance. On the 1999 telecast, he performed “She's All I Ever Had” and his hip-swiveling global smash “Livin' La Vida Loca.” The latter video won five awards: best pop video, best dance video and three International Viewer's Choice awards.


	Busta's award celebrates boundary-breaking cultural impact. Busta made his first VMAs appearance in 1997, when he presented best dance video alongside Martha Stewart. His most recent appearance was performing an extended hits medley in 2021. Busta received a Global Icon award at the 2024 MTV EMAs.


	J Balvin returns to the VMAs with his latest hit “Zun Zun,” joined by Latin stars Justin Quiles and Lenny Tavárez. He'll then team up with producer DJ Snake – making his first VMAs appearance – for the live premiere of their collab “Noventa.” Balvin, who last performed on the VMAs in 2022, is hoping to take home his sixth Moon Person this year. That would break him out of a tie with Martin as the leading Latin award winner in VMA history.


	Additional performers, presenters and special guests will be revealed in the coming weeks.

	











Lady Gaga leads the nominations for the 2025 MTV Video Music Awards with 12 nods, followed closely by her “Die With a Smile” duet partner Bruno Mars, who has 11 nods. Other top contenders are Kendrick Lamar (10), ROSÉ and Sabrina Carpenter (eight each), Ariana Grande and The Weeknd (seven each) and Billie Eilish (six).


	MTV has yet to announce this year's recipient of the Video Vanguard Award, but Billboard's Andrew Unterberger listed eight likely candidates – in ascending order of perceived likelihood. (Last year, he correctly predicted Katy Perry as the Vanguard recipient, so he knows what he's talking about.)


	This will mark the first time the show has been broadcast by CBS. It will also simulcast on MTV and stream on Paramount+ in the U.S.


	The 2025 MTV VMAs are executive produced by Bruce Gillmer, Den of Thieves co-founder Jesse Ignjatovic, and Barb Bialkowski. Gunpowder & Sky CEO Van Toffler is producer. Alicia Portugal is co-executive producer. Jackie Barba is executive in charge of production. Wendy Plaut is executive in charge of celebrity talent. Lisa Lauricella is executive in charge of music talent.


	This marks Toffler's return to the show following a decade-long absence.

""In light of recent events, the Soulshine at Sea with Michael Franti event scheduled for November 4-8, 2025, is cancelled.""

Soulshine at Sea 3 won't set sail as planned.  


	The concert cruise was slated to begin its voyage Nov. 4-8, 2025, headlined by Michael Franti & Spearhead and tracing a path from Miami to Cozumel, Mexico. 


	Produced by Sixthman, and billed as Soulshine at Sea 3 With Michael Franti, the event was officially sold-out back in mid-December 2024.

	However, the show entered stormy waters in recent days when performers including Dispatch, Maggie Rose, Hirie, and Liz Vice pulled out. Sixthman has returned its plans to dock.

	“In light of recent events, the Soulshine at Sea with Michael Franti event scheduled for November 4-8, 2025, is cancelled,” reads a statement posted to the official Soulshine at Sea's website, noting that plans for a separate event are underway.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	The artist exodus was fueled by allegations of abuse by an unnamed artist on the lineup. 


	Maggie Rose shared a post on her Instagram stories: “I've made the decision to no longer perform at Soulshine at Sea. There were some allegations made by a peer of mine about another artist on the lineup and I want to stand in solidarity with her. I hope you understand my decision and I appreciate your support.”




	Another, from Dispatch reads: “We've decided we will no longer be performing at Soulshine at Sea. We have been made aware of deeply concerning public allegations involving another artist on the lineup and have chosen to withdraw from the event. We are sorry for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding.”


	Hirie and Lice Vice also pulled out, citing similar reasons.


	Earlier, musician Victoria Canal accused a “very powerful, decades older” man in the music industry of grooming and sexually abusing her when she was 19. “This is something I've never spoken about publicly, and have been holding for 8 years now – it has plagued my body, spirit, and mind, in subliminal and overt ways, for my entire 20s,” Canal wrote Aug. 11 on her Instagram account. 


	She declined to mention his name or any specifics “because I can't risk the financial loss or emotional terror a lawsuit would bring.”


	This “experience, which lasted a little over a year, has had a years-lasting effect on my intimate life,” she writes.


	As the accusations and subsequent cancellation spread on social media, Franti attempted to clear the air with a statement on an extramarital affair, a “regrettable mistake,” as he puts it.


	“I come here most humbly to share my story with you,” he writes in a social post. “7 years ago I had a romantic relationship outside my marriage. It was with an artist who was touring with me. I broke my wedding vows, I broke my wife's trust, I broke her heart and for that I am deeply sorry for the pain my actions have caused.”


	Franti's wife found out about, and “to save my marriage, we ended the relationship,” he continues. The unidentified artist continued to tour with Franti in what he depicts as a professional relationship, and after the tour ended, continued to perform with him at “several shows.” 

	











	Meanwhile, organisers of Soulshine at Sea are “actively working to announce a new event that will sail November 4-8, 2025”. Additional details will be shared today, Aug. 18.

Wishbone, the new album from Conan Gray, tops this week's fan-voted music poll.


	Music fans voted in a poll published Friday (Aug. 1) on Billboard, choosing the pop artist's fresh LP as their favorite new release of the past week. 


Wishbone worked its magic with listeners in a week that also saw new releases streaming in from Chance The Rapper, Cardi B and more. An overwhelming majority said Gray's fourth studio album was their top choice, with the set bringing in nearly 80% of the vote.

	“I named it Wishbone because I think relationships remind me a lot of wishbones,” Gray told Billboard in a recent interview. “It's like the only wishing ritual that requires two people, but a wishbone requires two people, and they essentially make a bet against each other, and they're like, ‘Hey, I want my wish to come true. So let's do this. You might win and get your dreams come true, but I also might win, and if I win, then you get nothing.”'

	











	Gray added, “I had so much fun. I was writing lyrics, smiling ear to ear like so happy to get things off my chest. I felt immense freedom. I was literally, I literally have never had a better time writing an album — which is hilarious because the album is truly miserable.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	The 12-track album — which was highlighted as an editor's pick on Billboard‘s Friday Music Guide — features singles including “Vodka Cranberry,” “a song that encapsulated the entire album,” says Gray, whose voice soars through a chorus of somber late-night rumination: “Speak up, I know you hate me/ Looked at your picture and cried like a baby/ Speak up, don't leave me waiting/ Got way too drunk off a vodka cranberry/ Called you up in the middle of the night/ Wailing like an imbecile/ If you won't end things, then I will.”


	Among the new releases trailing behind Wishbone on this week's poll are Chance The Rapper's Star Line, coming in with 11% of the vote, and Cardi B's “Imaginary Playerz,” with 3% of the vote. Olivia Dean's “Man I Need,” Dijon's Baby, Kaytranada's Ain't No Damn Way! and Jordan Davis' Learn the Hard Way follow.

Senior TV Writer


EXCLUSIVE: General Hospital has another major plot twist to drop on its fans: the ABC sudser is bringing back Ryan Paevey. 


	It's unclear, for now, what role he will play since his previous character, the popular Det. Nathan West, was killed off in 2018. Paevey originated the part of Nathan in 2013.


	Paevey tells Deadline that his return to GH started with a surprise text from Executive Producer Frank Valentini. He begins filming this week and will show up on the sudser in September.


	“We talked a bit and he asked would I consider returning for awhile, talking story, floated different story ideas involving different time commitments of me, and I thought if we're going to do this we should really do it and surprise the fans with a meaty storyline,” Paevey tells Deadline. “I was surprised by my excitement for a homecoming and reuniting with familiar faces after seven years. I still have my last call sheet from my final taping day on January 18, 2018, tacked up in my home office.”

	











	Fans have already been speculating about Paevey's possible return since Deadline broke in June that Kelly Thiebaud, who played Nathan's sister Britt, was coming back to the soap. She debuted in July.




			Watch on Deadline		







	After rising to prominence as a fan favorite on GH, Paevey became a fixture on the Hallmark Channel. After headling Unleashing Mr. Darcy in 2016, Paevey starred in more than a dozen Hallmark originals, including Two Tickets to Paradise in 2022. Most recently, he appeared in Fourth Down and Love.


	Paevey's other credits include guest roles on Brooklyn Nine-Nine and Games People Play. Off-camera, the actor is a jewelry designer through his Fortunate Wanderer brand. 


	Paevey is repped by Justice & Ponder and Eric Suddleson of Felker Toczek Suddleson McGinnis Ryan.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


This Is Us creator Dan Fogelman is recruiting another star of his acclaimed NBC family drama for a followup series. Mandy Moore has been tapped as a series regular opposite Christopher Meloni and William H. Macy in Hulu's upcoming untitled Dan Fogelman football drama.


	Set inside the world of the NFL, the series has a generational family component to it, and Moore will be part of it. She will play Lauren, the daughter of NFL team owner Hank Durkin (Macy) and his heir apparent. Meloni is playing the team's head coach, Danny Roarke.


	The series, from 20th Television and Skydance Sports, is written and executive produced by Fogelman and executive produced by Jess Rosenthal and Kevin Falls. Also executive producing are David Ellison, Jesse Sisgold, and Jason T. Reed for Skydance Sports, one of several divisions that are staying intact and keeping the Skydance moniker following the merger with Paramount Global.

	This is the second new drama series Fogelman has created since This Is Us ended its six-season run in May 2022 following Paradise — also for Hulu via 20th TV where Fogelman is under an overall deal — which premiered in January and has been renewed for Season 2. Both star actors who played members of the Pearson family at the heart of This Is Us: Moore, who portrayed the mom, Rebecca, and Sterling K. Brown, who played one of the sons, Randall. Brown headlines and executive produces Paradise, whose first season earned four Emmy nominations, including Outstanding Drama Series, a category This Is Us was a staple in for most of its run.

	











	Fogelman has built an universe, using the same actors across multiple series. Other examples include Galavant's Timothy Omundson recurring on This Is Us and This Is Us‘ Griffin Dunne doing an arc on Hulu's Only Murders In the Building, which Fogelman also executive produces. 


	Moore received an Emmy nomination for her role on This Is Us. She recently wrapped production on the TriStar feature comedy The Breadwinner opposite Nate Bargatze, which is directed by Eric Appel. Moore also is part of the voice cast of Prime Video's adult animated comedy series #1 Happy Family USA, created by Ramy Youssef and Pam Brady, which premiered in April. Moore is repped by Gersh, Untitled Entertainment and Johnson Shapiro Slewett & Kole.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


MSNBC will be rebranded as My Source News Opinion World, or MS NOW, later this year, as the network prepares for its spinoff from Comcast, while it also will shed the Peacock logo.


	The change, announced on Monday, comes as MSNBC has been building its own news division, as NBC News will no longer be a sister outlet following the spinoff. MSNBC and other Comcast cable networks will be part of a separate company, Versant, led by Mark Lazarus.


	It also is a bit of a surprise as expectations had been that the network would retain the name it has had since its launch in 1996. But executives determined that retaining the name would create brand confusion with NBC News.

	MSNBC President Rebecca Kutler wrote in a memo to employees on Monday, “During this time of transition, NBCUniversal decided that our brand requires a new, separate identity. This decision now allows us to set our own course and assert our independence as we continue to build our own modern newsgathering operation.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	“The future of our success is not tied to remaining within the NBC family and using the peacock as part of our identity. While our name will be changing, who we are and what we do will not. Our commitment to our work and our audiences will not waiver from what the brand promise has been for three decades.”


	Kutler wrote that the re-branding will come with a “broad-based marketing campaign, unlike anything we have done in recent memory.” The switch to MS NOW appears to be a way of distinguishing itself from NBC while still retaining elements of its brand identity, as it already has been referred to as “MSN” for short. In adopting “NOW” as part of its name, the network is using a word that has also been used by linear outlets to identify streaming ventures, including NBC News Now and HBO Now, although those are not part of acronyms.


	There is some risk in making the name change, as Warner Bros. Discovery experienced with its rebrand of “HBO Max” to simply “Max,” only to change it back again. 

	











	On a recent episode of the Pivot podcast, Rachel Maddow, the network's top anchor, made the case for the network distinguishing itself from NBC News, noting that “we're spinning off with a huge standalone, newly built news gathering organization that is designed specifically for our purposes and nothing else. We have an incredibly loyal, very large audience, and and we're universally platformed on a device called the television, which Americans use, despite media reports to the contrary.”


	In a separate memo, Lazarus wrote that CNBC would be retaining its name, noting that it stands for Consumer News and Business Channel. But it, too, will get a new logo.


	Sports programming on USA Network and Golf Channel “will come together under a new brand moniker of USA Sports,” he wrote, with new logos for USA Sports and Golf Channel. 


	“As we all know, the peacock is synonymous with NBCUniversal, and it is a symbol they have decided to keep within the NBCU family,” Lazarus wrote in his memo. “This gives us the opportunity to chart our own path forward, create distinct brand identities, and establish an independent news organization following the spin.”


	MSNBC launched as a joint venture between Microsoft and NBC, with a special focus on growing internet connectivity in the mid-1990s. Microsoft sold its stake in 2005, and the channel has established itself with its lineup of progressive opinion hosts.


	In building up its news division, MSNBC has hired figures including The Washington Post's Carol Leoning, Catherine Rampell and Jackie Alemany, while Jacob Soboroff, Vaughn Hillyard and Antonia Hylton are among those joining from NBC News. 


	Lazarus' memo is below:

Team, From the moment we announced the creation of VERSANT, we knew it would mark the beginning of a new journey for us and our iconic brands. Together, we have been focused on building our individual identity and vision for the future while laying a foundation for the continued growth and success of our businesses.To that end, a few of our brand designs will change in the coming months. As we all know, the peacock is synonymous with NBCUniversal, and it is a symbol they have decided to keep within the NBCU family. This gives us the opportunity to chart our own path forward, create distinct brand identities, and establish an independent news organization following the spin.This means we will redesign our logos where the peacock has been incorporated into our brands. In addition to a new logo, MSNBC will debut a new name to accelerate the distinction between the MSNBC and NBC News organizations, while remaining true to our mission and our commitment to audiences.Each of these changes will go into effect closer to our spin at the end of the year. More on each of these changes below:MY SOURCE NEWS OPINION WORLD (MS NOW)MSNBC will unveil a new name for the network: MS NOW, which stands for My Source for News, Opinion and the World.This new name underscores the brand's mission to serve as the destination for domestic and international breaking news and the best-in-class opinion journalism. MSNBC has been building toward this moment and welcoming a wave of exceptional journalists to their newsgathering operation. Most importantly, while the name will be different, the brand's commitment to its audience will not change.CNBC Since its inception in 1989, CNBC – originally known as the “Consumer News and Business Channel” – has distinguished itself as a trusted leader covering exclusively the global financial and business sectors. CNBC will retain its name and is working on a new logo, which will look back at its history and nod to the deep expertise of the network.  USA SPORTSSports programming on USA Network and Golf Channel will come together under a new brand moniker of USA Sports. New logos for USA Sports and Golf Channel are well underway. These new logos will aim to honor USA Network's legacy in sports and entertainment as well as Golf Channel's 30-plus year history as TV's home for golf, all with a nod to the future. We look forward to unveiling those in the weeks to come.  ENTERTAINMENT The brands within our entertainment portfolio will remain unchanged with each holding a unique place in the daily lives of audiences by delivering distinctive, genre-defining content that resonates deeply with viewers. Together, these networks play an essential role in shaping conversations and will continue to evolve alongside their audiences and remain a vital part of everyday life. Additionally, SportsEngine, best known for its technology serving thousands of youth sports organizations and more, will also redesign its logo without the peacock.Regardless of the iconography, each of our businesses will remain true to their charge. VERSANT is the house for our brands, each of which already succeeds on their own and will continue to do so by creating deeper connections with our audiences and identifying opportunities for growth.Thank you for all you do and continue to do as we shape this bold new direction together.Mark


	Kutler's memo is below:

All, Following up on what you may have already seen from Mark, later this year, we will take on a new name: MS NOW, which stands for My Source for News, Opinion, and the World.This new branding underscores our mission: to serve as a destination for breaking news and best-in-class opinion journalism, all rooted in accurate and reported facts. I know this announcement will be met with questions, and I want to acknowledge that for many of you who have spent years or decades here, it is hard to imagine the network by any other name. This was not a decision that was made quickly or without significant debate. Over the last eight months, we have worked to untether ourselves from NBC News and embrace our independence under VERSANT. We've hired dozens of first-rate reporters and newsroom leaders and have been recruiting for nearly 100 roles across our new and nimble organization. We continue to supercharge our non-linear products, achieving rapid success on YouTube, TikTok, audio, digital, live events, and more – all while aggressively developing a direct-to-consumer product. During this time of transition, NBCUniversal decided that our brand requires a new, separate identity. This decision now allows us to set our own course and assert our independence as we continue to build our own modern newsgathering operation.The future of our success is not tied to remaining within the NBC family and using the peacock as part of our identity. While our name will be changing, who we are and what we do will not. Our commitment to our work and our audiences will not waiver from what the brand promise has been for three decades. In conjunction with the brand relaunch, we will be making a significant investment in a broad-based marketing campaign, unlike anything we have done in recent memory. Planning is now underway for an employee all-hands meeting next week, where I will have more to share – more news on that soon. Until then, we have millions of people who rely on us to continue doing what we do best. As I said on my first day, our most important job is to show up for our audience, the community that is depending on us now more than ever.Rebecca

Like so many accused rapists and abusers, Andrew Tate is going on the offensive with lawsuits of his own. You might think playing the victim is antithetical to the most extreme and toxic ideology of the manosphere, but we've seen time and again how such cognitive dissonance is prevalent in men of that sphere. In fact, it seems that guys like Tate (or Trump, or whoever) thrive as self-styled victims. As such, Tate declared on Twitter/X that he's allocated $400 million “To battle Google, Meta, TikTok”; “Every single girl who lied about me”; “The BBC, all mainstream media across Australia UK and US”; and “Every twitter account that defamed me.”  To Tate, “It's good vs evil and I will lose my entire fortune in this fight.” We can only hope!

To begin his ignoble crusade, Tate—who faces rape and sex-trafficking charges in Romania and the U.K. and a criminal investigation in the U.S.—has officially filed suits against Meta and TikTok for “emotional distress, business interference, and misappropriation” (per Deadline). “This case arises from Defendant, TikTok, Inc.'s unlawful and politically motivated decision to deplatform Plaintiffs Andrew Tate and Tristan Tate—two internationally known entrepreneurs, commentators, and media personalities—from the TikTok social media platform,” the filing reads. “At the time, the Plaintiffs collectively commanded an audience of tens of millions, generated significant revenue through lawful online enterprises, and were among the most visible public figures on TikTok's platform.”

The Tates were booted off both platforms in 2022 (they'd been kicked off of Twitter even earlier, but were allowed back on by Elon Musk). At the time, Meta confirmed to NPR “that Tate had been banned from its platforms for violating its policies regarding dangerous individuals and organizations and hate speech.” Similarly, a spokesperson for TikTok told the outlet, “Misogyny is a hateful ideology that is not tolerated on TikTok. Our investigation into this content is ongoing, as we continue to remove violative accounts and videos, and pursue measures to strengthen our enforcement, including our detection models, against this type of content.”

Undeterred, Tate seeks over $50 million from each tech company for his troubles. “TikTok's removal of the Plaintiffs was not an isolated enforcement action grounded in neutral application of its Terms of Use, rather, it was the culmination of a coordinated campaign to suppress, silence, and destroy the reputations and livelihoods of two controversial but [law abiding] men,” the suit reads. Last week, Tate also filed a countersuit against his ex-girlfriend regarding her allegations that he sexually assaulted her earlier this year at  Beverly Hills hotel, per Deadline. That suit claims her “smear campaign” resulted in Tate losing “sponsorships, cancelled business deals and irreversible damage to his global reputation.”

Like Lt. Aldo Raine carving a swastika into the forehead of Hans Landa, Quentin Tarantino declared Inglourious Basterds his “masterpiece” in a recent interview with The Church Of Tarantino podcast. Appearing on the podcast to discuss his work at length, Tarantino broke down which of his movies are his favorite and which are his best. Basterds falls into the latter category, but he believes “Kill Bill is the ultimate Quentin movie.” It's hard to argue with him on that point, considering, as he puts it, “Every aspect is so particularly ripped, like with tentacles and bloody tissue, from my imagination and my id and my loves and my passion and my obsession.” That does pretty accurately sum up his 2003 kung-fu-meets-spaghetti-western pastiche. However, he must hold his post-2000s career in a more esteemed light than his '90s output, considering his best movie, Jackie Brown, doesn't even get a shoutout. “I think Kill Bill is the movie I was born to make,” he continued. “I think Inglourious Basterds is my masterpiece, but Once Upon A Time In Hollywood is my favorite.” Meanwhile, Pulp Fiction remains locked in a trunk beneath a pawn shop.

As for his screenplays, Tarantino felt the same, more or less, placing Inglourious Basterds atop and Hateful Eight and Once Upon A Time In Hollywood “are right behind.”

The Church Of Tarantino podcast is a retrospective look at Tarantino's work. Tarantino does not host it, nor is it one of his podcast projects, like Video Archives Podcast, which Tarantino hosts with a friend and collaborator, Roger Avary. Still, ever the fan of his work, Tarantino is a follower of The Church and held the interview at his Hollywood cafe, Pam's Coffy.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Sidney Poitier's debut, No Way Out , is more perceptive about race than some of his classics","https://www.avclub.com/no-way-out-sidney-poitier-debut-racism-complexity","Mon, 18 Aug 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

1949 was Hollywood's year of the racial message movie. In May, Intruder In The Dust told the story of a Black man falsely accused of murdering a white man. July and September saw the release of Lost Boundaries and Pinky—two stories about the travails of light-skinned Black people passing as white. And in November, there was Home Of The Brave, which followed a Black soldier's struggles against racism during WWII. These films were made with good intentions. Some still seem progressive today; others decidedly less so. But none could boast what the next major racial message movie, released in August of 1950, had working in its favor: The debut of Sidney Poitier. 

In No Way Out—directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, who co-wrote it with Lesser Samuels—Luther Brooks (Poitier) has just become the first Black man at his hospital to qualify as a doctor. On his first shift after qualifying, though, he has the misfortune to run into the Biddle brothers. Ray (Richard Widmark) and Johnny Biddle (Dick Paxton), have been shot by the police after they were caught robbing a store. Ray is more or less okay, but Johnny appears significantly more unwell than he should be after a superficial gunshot wound. Luther spots this discrepancy, and attempts a spinal tap to alleviate the apparent pressure on his brain. In the process, Johnny dies. Ray—a spitting, seething racist, who has been jeering at Luther the whole time he's been attempting to save his brother—is convinced that Luther purposely killed him. Luther did not, but nevertheless is not entirely sure that he made the right medical decision.

An autopsy would answer the question, but that requires consent that Ray is not inclined to give. He doesn't trust the medical establishment to not cover up for their own. Besides, the air of uncertainty helps his malignant cause—soon, from his bed on the hospital prison ward, he has fomented a race riot. Luther must clear his name, perhaps with the reluctant help of Johnny's widow Edie (Linda Darnell), who's torn between her hatred of Ray and her own bigotry.

Poitier didn't actually receive star billing here; that wouldn't come until the other end of the '50s. Still, though No Way Out sidelines him for a large portion of the middle act, it's undeniably his movie. As would so often be the case over the following years, the way Poitier tamps down his character's justified anger in the face of unjustified hatred, plowing forward with his job despite a racist trying desperately to stop him, represents the height of dignity.

Yet Poitier was only 22 when he shot No Way Out, and he looked it. The mantles of “hero” and “icon” were not yet on his shoulders. He was just a regular young actor, trying to make it in a business inhospitable to people who looked like him. While he is clearly already in possession of the charisma and gravitas that made him such a powerhouse, there's a touching, youthful vulnerability to Poitier's first film performance that would be quick to evaporate in later roles. That vulnerability added dimension to Luther's internal conflict, as well as his external one. Gertrude Gipson's contemporary review for African-American paper The California Eagle quoted his co-star Widmark as saying, “Poitier puts so much feeling into his intonation and expression that I'm just going to look like a ranting idiot!”

Widmark was just three years into his own Hollywood career when he made No Way Out. He was a phenomenal actor, capable of playing characters all across the morality spectrum, but he'd be particularly known for his baddies; in his debut movie, 1947's Kiss Of Death, he notoriously threw a woman in a wheelchair down the stairs. It's saying something then, that Ray Biddle was among the worst of Widmark's villains, the noxiousness of his racism manifesting in a vicious ferality still jarring to watch. 

Widmark and Poitier became good friends in real life, and starred in two more movies together the following decade. But despite their offscreen warmth, the times where they face off one-on-one are where No Way Out feels at its most raw and dangerous, even more so than in the race riot setpiece (in which neither actor features). Their mutual hatred carries with it an electric, visceral combustibility.

Other than Widmark, Poitier has the most scenes opposite Stephen McNally as Dr. Wharton, who takes Luther under his wing. McNally was one of the era's blandest leading men; that Poitier so often has to cede him the spotlight during their scenes together is one of the movie's weakest points. “I'm pro-good doctor: Black, white, or polka dot!” Dr. Wharton says in an early heated discussion. While his self-satisfied color-blindness is certainly a better treatment than Luther receives at the hands of many white people, it comes at a cost. He tries to console Luther by saying that, “Every time anybody dies in a country hospital somebody yells murder.” “But it's not the same when they yell it at me,” Luther replies. Wharton's refusal to understand that, and his insistence on keeping Luther on the prison ward with the racist who wants to kill him, puts the young doctor in terrible jeopardy. 

As with the era's other racial message movies, No Way Out has its flaws. Luther's sidelining during the middle act is strange, especially considering that it means he comes to a big decision as to how to save himself completely offscreen. And Luther is a touch more passive than the majority of Poitier's later leads would be. When Luther asks to stay with Wharton after passing his exams, rather than move on alongside the rest of the newly qualified doctors, he says, “I think I'll need a little more time than the others.” Melissa Anderson in the Village Voice called Luther's reasoning simply “a calm, honest assessment” of his unique situation. Nonetheless, when paired with the moment where Wharton laughingly recounts that Luther fears he's only has gotten where he has because his instructors are scared to be seen as prejudiced, these statements of insecurity skirt close to undermining his evident skill. 

Ray Biddle spends the whole movie spewing racist bile, but towards the end of the film, one piece of invective is particularly telling: “‘Poor little n—- kids, love the little n—- kids.' Who loved me?” His certainty that Luther's success has come at a personal detriment to him invokes the persistent entitlement still found today in things like the Trumpian backlash against DEI initiatives. The false idea that something has been taken from white people, and given to Black people, is what makes Ray's brand of racism so vicious and snarling, but there are subtler types on display here to—all the way down to the unspoken yet evident skepticism of the guards on the prison ward when Luther turns up for his first shift as a doctor (which in turn is evocative of the MAGA brouhaha around Black pilots). It's striking, and more than a little depressing, how predictive this 75-year-old movie was of the current racial discourse.

And how predictive of the rest of Poitier's career it would be. After maintaining his moral and professional honor (“I can't kill a man just because he hates me,” Luther says), he ends No Way Out with an immortal line, one that Poitier's characters could have gone on to say in pretty much every one of his future films: “Don't cry, white boy, you're gonna live.”

But Poitier wasn't the only Black acting legend whose career was launched by the prescient No Way Out. It was also Ossie Davis' big-screen debut, and the first of many times he'd appear alongside his real-life wife Ruby Dee. The two played Luther's sister and brother-in-law, Connie and John. This is another aspect that makes No Way Out stand out in Poitier's early filmography: It takes the time to explore his character's home life, to a deeper extent than any of his movies up until 1957's Edge Of The City (there, Poitier and Dee would be spouses rather than siblings). Luther lives with his mother (Maude Simmons), his wife Cora (Mildred Joanne Smith in her sole film role), Connie, and John. No Way Out contrasts the Brooks' loving, warm, hard-working family against the Biddles' cruel, criminal one in a move as progressive as anything else in the film. In perhaps the most moving scene, an exhausted Luther falls asleep on Cora's lap, as she recounts all that the couple have gone through to get where they are today. “We're tired, but we're here, honey,” she says. “We can be happy. We've got a right to be.”

Black family life was still an incredible rarity onscreen in 1950—even in Lost Boundaries, one in that 1949 batch of racial message movies, the Black family passing as white were played by white actors (as was the case in Pinky). Indeed, following so closely on the heels of those 1949 films is the reason many assigned to No Way Out‘s underwhelming box office; per Variety, it was, “the usual fate of a tail-ender in a cycle.” But another factor in the film's financial disappointment was the censorious treatment it received all over the country. Several Black organizations worried that Biddle's encyclopedia of racial slurs might give his fellow bigots vocabulary hints. Police were worried the race riot scenes would reignite ever-broiling tensions in their own communities. A cut version was shown in several cities, and it was banned altogether in Chicago, until several particularly inflammatory minutes around the riot scenes were excised. Unsurprisingly, it was not shown at all in the South. The film's politics, and Poitier's own, meant that it'd take seven years for him to get such a significant part again, thanks to his unofficial blacklisting. The early '50s were the peak of McCarthyism; Poitier wouldn't sign any loyalty oaths, and continued to socialize with actor-activists like Canada Lee and Paul Robeson, whom Joseph McCarthy abhorred. 

No Way Out should have been a springboard for Poitier, but after a significant yet supporting role in 1951's Cry, The Beloved Country, he spent the next few years languishing in the ensembles of Budd Boetticher war drama The Red Ball Express and Harlem Globetrotters origin story Go, Man, Go. His appearance as a high school student (despite being 27) in 1955 megahit Blackboard Jungle finally stuck him on the right trajectory, and from then on, his roles got bigger. Their treatment of race, however, was not always as thoughtful as No Way Out—like Something Of Value, Mark Of The Hawk, and Virgin Island, which were all, to varying degrees, pro-colonialism. 

Then of course, there's Guess Who's Coming To Dinner. Though it was released 17 years after No Way Out, it's striking how much clunkier and less racially nuanced it is. In the 1967 film, Poitier also plays a doctor, John Prentice, who falls in love with the white Joanna Drayton (Katherine Houghton). The drama revolves around the couple seeking her parents' (Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy) blessing to get married.

John Prentice is an almost farcically ideal man—kind, handsome, charming, patient, with a good job and even better prospects. He's in the process of trying to launch a medical program which could save a million lives a year. Joanna, meanwhile, has two characteristics: she is pretty and cheerfully oblivious. Clearly, she's the one unworthy of him, though you'd never know it from the way the action plays out. In No Way Out, Wharton's “I don't see color” naivety is proven by the plot to be harmful; in Guess Who's Coming To Dinner, Joanna's is considered simply admirable.

In the former movie, Luther tries to stop his friend, the hospital's elevator operator Lefty (Dots Johnson), from joining in the upcoming race riots, insisting that it would make him just as bad as the Biddle brothers. “Ain't that a lot asking for us to be better than them, when we get killed trying to prove we're as good?” Lefty responds. This is both a fair question, and a fascinating meta-prediction of all the times in the future where Poitier would be criticized for playing idealized Black men like Dr. John Prentice. Fittingly, for the general backwardness of Guess Who's Coming To Dinner, Joanna's family maid Tillie (Isabel Sanford) is furious at him for precisely the opposite reason as Lefty: “I don't care to see a member of my own race getting above himself.”

At the 1968 Oscars, Guess Who's Coming To Dinner battled it out with another Poitier film, In The Heat Of The Night, in which he's a Northern police officer trying to solve a murder in a racist Southern town. That movie was far more in line with No Way Out in terms of its willingness to engage with the widespread brutality of racism, and the psychic toll it takes on Poitier's character, who just wanted to do his job. 

Both films won statues, but In The Heat Of The Night dominated, and marked the end of an era for both Poitier and racial message movies. From then on, Poitier's filmography became far less weighted towards teaching white people about racism and broadened considerably, exploring his eternally underrated comedic chops and even venturing into action heroism. So much lay ahead for Poitier and his career when No Way Out was released—a wide variety of roles, a stint behind the camera, an impact over decades that would make him into an icon. Yet, seeing the texture he gave to Dr. Luther Brooks, the quiet power and inarguable presence he brought to a character even more passive than most he'd go on to play, it's clear how much was already there from the start. And, even more than the films that solidified his fame, the film that launched Poitier still has plenty to say.

Former “Teen Mom” star Javi Marroquin and his wife are preparing to expand their family, announcing on Instagram that they are expecting their third baby together just four months after their wedding.

A post shared by Javi Marroquin (@javim9)

The couple shared the news on Sunday, Aug. 17, with a heartfelt post that featured them smiling on a sandy path while cradling her baby bump.

“The best honeymoon souvenir. So grateful to be doing this again with you momma! You're the strongest woman I know and we are beyond lucky 😭❤️ love you more each day,” he wrote alongside the photo.

Fans quickly filled the comments with well-wishes, with one writing, “CONGRATULATIONS!!! Such a blessing,” and another adding, “So exciting! Such great news!!! Congratulations.”

A post shared by Lauren Marroquin (@lauren3elizabeth)

The former MTV star's wife also marked the occasion with her own Instagram post, featuring a sweet family portrait. The photo included their daughter, Maizee, and son, Eli, along with his son Lincoln from a previous relationship.

She captioned the post, “Our grand finale 🫶🏼👶🏻♡,” signaling that this may be the couple's last child.

The joyful update comes after the pair tied the knot in an intimate ceremony on April 24. Shortly after their wedding, she posted a beachside photo of the couple in their wedding attire, captioned simply, “𝟶𝟺.𝟸𝟺.𝟸𝟻 💍.”

The couple has frequently shared glimpses of their family life on social media since their marriage. Highlights have included amusement park visits, baseball games, and quiet moments at home.

In April, the reality star posted several photos from their wedding day featuring himself with sons Lincoln and Eli in suits, writing: “Three sharp-dressed men and one unforgettable day 🫶.”

A post shared by Javi Marroquin (@javim9)

He later shared another tribute to his wife, writing, “In the midst of the 16119283 we're trying to plan/coordinate, I thank God every night I get to call you my wife 🫶😍.”

Javi Marroquin rose to fame as part of MTV's “Teen Mom 2,” where his relationship and marriage with Kailyn Lowry were prominently featured. The pair married in 2012 and welcomed a son, Lincoln, before divorcing in 2016. Marroquin later had a brief relationship with fellow cast member Briana DeJesus before moving on with Comeau. Together, they share two children, Eli and Maizee, and are now expecting their third.

With their third child on the way, the family looks ahead to the next chapter together — balancing life as newlyweds and parents in a blended household filled with milestones and memories.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Bruce Willis' Daughter Linked to Disney Heartthrob After Steamy L.A. Sighting","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/scout-willis-thomas-doherty/","Mon, 18 Aug 2025 10:23:19 GMT","

When Hollywood royalty collides with a Disney heartthrob, the internet does what it does best. Yes, it speculates wildly and starts creating all kinds of scenarios that most of us can't control. This week, Scout Willis, daughter of Demi Moore and Bruce Willis, was spotted in Los Angeles walking arm in arm with actor Thomas Doherty, sparking fresh dating buzz.

On Wednesday night, the 34-year-old singer and style icon shimmered in a silver crop top, classic jeans, and a red purse as she strolled down a West Hollywood sidewalk with Doherty. The “Tell Me Lies” actor, 30, kept it quite casual in black pants, a striped tee, and a light gray hoodie. But his relaxed look didn't stop the duo from turning heads.

Safe to say the photos showed the pair looking quite cozy, with Willis' arm looped around Doherty's as she flashed an easy smile. The two reportedly kicked off their evening at the iconic Chateau Marmont before heading to Saddle Ranch Chop House, where Willis later posted a playful Instagram video of herself having the time of her life while riding the mechanical bull to Madonna's “Don't Tell Me.” She cheekily captioned it, “Would you believe I stayed on the whole time?”

A post shared by ☆ Scout Willis ☆ (@scoutlaruewillis)

While the chemistry is undeniable, sources told E! News that Willis and Doherty are “just friends.” Still, their history makes the pairing all the more intriguing.

Willis, who has been steadily carving her own path in music with her debut album “Scout LaRue,” was previously linked to musician Jake Miller. The two were spotted together as recently as Thanksgiving 2023, but their split was never publicly addressed.

Doherty, on the other hand, has a resume full of both roles and romances. The Scottish-born actor first made major waves in Disney's “Descendants” franchise before stepping into the Upper East Side with HBO's “Gossip Girl” reboot. His love life has been equally public, especially after dating “Descendants” co-star Dove Cameron for nearly four years before their 2020 breakup. Cameron later went on to open up about the relationship, admitting that the relationship had “f–ked me up” during an interview with Entertainment Tonight. Doherty also briefly dated model Yasmin Wijnaldum and, more recently, reality star Georgia Hassarati from “Too Hot to Handle.”

A post shared by Rumer Glenn Willis (@rumerwillis)

So, whether Willis and Doherty are truly just friends or testing the waters of something more, their L.A. night out has fans buzzing. Mostly because, according to Willis' Instagram, it looked pretty fun. But, for Scout, the timing marks a lighter chapter as she continues supporting her father, Bruce, amid his health battle with frontotemporal dementia. For Doherty, the outing adds yet another layer to his already headline-ready personal life.

Romance or not, these two know how to make an entrance, and Hollywood is watching.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","SEE: Daniel Day-Lewis Jumps Out of Retirement","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/see-daniel-day-lewis-jumps-out-of-retirement/","Mon, 18 Aug 2025 15:00:28 GMT","

Daniel Day-Lewis has officially ended his eight-year retirement from acting with the release of the first photo from his upcoming film “Anemone,” which will showcase his son Ronan Day-Lewis making his feature directorial debut.

The 68-year-old three-time Oscar winner appears transformed in the newly released image, sporting a thick gray mustache and salt-and-pepper hair for his role as an estranged hermit living in the woods of Northern England. The project is a special collaboration between father and son, who co-wrote the screenplay together.

A post shared by MoviePass (@moviepass)

“Anemone” follows the story of a middle-aged man played by Sean Bean who “sets out from his suburban home on a journey into the woods, where he reconnects with his estranged hermit brother (Day-Lewis),” according to the official synopsis from Film at Lincoln Center. “Bonded by a mysterious, complicated past, the men share a fraught, if occasionally tender relationship — one that was forever altered by shattering events decades earlier.”

The film is being described as “an absorbing family drama about lives undone by seemingly irreconcilable legacies of political and personal violence,” according to The Hollywood Reporter. The supporting cast includes Samantha Morton, Samuel Bottomley, and Safia Oakley-Green, with cinematography by Ben Fordesman.

“An emotional powerhouse, this directorial debut is assured in both small details and grand gestures as it charts the path toward familial redemption against all odds,” the synopsis continues.

The project will have its world premiere at The New York Film Festival, which runs from September 26 through October 13, marking Day-Lewis's return to the spotlight after his last film appearance in 2017's “Phantom Thread.”

Day-Lewis had made headlines in 2017 when he announced his retirement from acting following “Phantom Thread.” He portrayed Reynolds Woodcock in the film and received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. His spokesperson issued a definitive statement at the time: “Daniel Day-Lewis will no longer be working as an actor. He is immensely grateful to all of his collaborators and audiences over the many years. This is a private decision and neither he nor his representatives will make any further comment on this subject.” 

In a subsequent interview with W Magazine, Day-Lewis reflected on his decision to step away from Hollywood. “I knew it was uncharacteristic to put out a statement. But I did want to draw a line,” he explained. “I didn't want to get sucked back into another project. All my life, I've mouthed off about how I should stop acting, and I don't know why it was different this time, but the impulse to quit took root in me, and that became a compulsion.”

The actor had expressed doubts about his craft, stating, “I need to believe in the value of what I'm doing. The work can seem vital. Irresistible, even. And if an audience believes it, that should be good enough for me. But, lately, it isn't.”

However, the opportunity to work with his son Ronan appears to have drawn him back. Day-Lewis shares Ronan, 27, and son Cashel, 23, with wife Rebecca Miller. He also has an eldest son, Gabriel-Kane, 30, with ex-girlfriend Isabelle Adjani.

Whether this collaboration with his son signals a broader return to acting or represents a one-time project remains unclear, though director Martin Scorsese has hinted at potential future collaborations with the legendary actor.

Summer vacation looks good on longtime HGTV star Alison Victoria, who's been turning heads with her latest social media posts, full of photos from a 2025 getaway to Greece alongside her filmmaker beau, Brandt Andersen. 

In two separate posts on August 16 and 17, Victoria — whose new show, “Sin City Rehab,” premieres in September — shared multiple photos of herself posing in a hot pink string bikini at the beach. Fans flooded the 43-year-old designer's posts with compliments and questions about how she stays so fit.

Over 8,000 followers liked Victoria's first post, which she captioned, “Postcards from Spetses 🇬🇷💙🩵.” Spetses is a small island that Vogue has called “the Greek elite's favorite holiday hotspot.”

Victoria's post included photos of her on the shoreline, a video of her diving into the water, a collection of seashells, a snapshot of her enjoying a meal in a yellow bikini, scenic views, and an image of her and Andersen's legs intertwined as they sunbathed. 

The “Windy City Rehab” star thanked one fan who wrote, “I've followed you for years and I have to say, this is the happiest I've ever seen you and I'm so happy for you because you deserve it!! ❤️”

Fans and friends flooded the post with compliments, with many calling the pics “stunning,” including Victoria's fertility doctor, Roohi Jeelani. 

One fan wrote, “My favorite HGTV designer! Love ya girl! Looking stunning per the usual! 🔥”

Another commented, “Wow! What is your workout routine? Seriously post a video based on workouts and nutrition! 🖤🤍”

Victoria's second post from Greece, on August 17, began with a pic of her sunbathing in her pink bikini while floating on a bright yellow inner tube. Other snapshots included her posing in her swimsuit with her back arched against a tree trunk and another as she stood on her tiptoes in front of a white wall near the ocean. 

Fans celebrated her pics on that post too, with one writing, “looking amazing girlie!! 😘” and another calling her “smokin' hot.”

Other pics Victoria shared included Greek design elements like charming doors and windows, picturesque scenes of boats on the water, and multiple shots of her and Andersen snuggling. 

The couple went Instagram official in June 2024, when Victoria shared multiple photos with him at the Daytime Emmy Awards in Los Angeles, when “Windy City Rehab” was nominated for an Emmy. The couple has traveled all over the world together during the second half of the year as he promoted “The Stranger's Case,” his feature film directorial debut. 

On January 31, Victoria posted a carousel of photos from another tropical getaway with Andersen, beginning with a sultry pic of her in a different string bikini, leaning in as she kissed Andersen aboard a catamaran.

“One of the most emotive actors of his generation,” reads the IndieWire review of Ben Leonberg's “Good Boy” out of the 2025 SXSW Film Festival. No, we weren't talking about some rising Juilliard graduate or Actors Studio alum. We were talking about an actor with four legs.

Indy is the star of “Good Boy,” and he is a dog. The 73-minute horror movie, which freelance reviewer Rafael Motomayor called one of the year's best, is centered entirely on his point of view as something very bad happens at his house. 

The official synopsis for “Good Boy,” also starring Shane Jensen, Arielle Friedman, and Larry Fessenden, reads: “Our canine hero, Indy, finds himself on a new adventure with his human owner — and best friend — Todd, leaving city life for a long-vacant family home in the country.

From the start, two things are abundantly clear: Indy is wary of the creepy old house, and his affection for Todd is unwavering. After moving in, Indy is immediately vexed by empty corners, tracks an invisible presence only he can see, perceives phantasmagoric warnings from a long-dead dog, and is haunted by visions of the previous occupant's grim death. When Todd begins succumbing to the dark forces swirling around the house, Indy must battle a malevolence intent on dragging his beloved Todd into the afterlife.”

Written by Alex Cannon and Ben Leonberg — for our money, “Good Boy” should also feature a Leonberger as a result — the movie drew raves at SXSW. Motomayor wrote, “We've all experienced the creepiness of a pet sensing something you can't; the eerie sensation that comes when you see a dog barking in the middle of the night at an empty wall, staring at nothing, or wandering off in a hurry to chase something that seems invisible. It's spooky enough to witness in real life, but add in some haunting horror imagery — as Ben Leonberg's ‘Good Boy‘ does in great supply — and it becomes a foundation for one of the year's scariest movies, albeit one that also doubles as an emotional and moving tribute to the emotional bond between people and their four-legged friends.”

Check out the trailer for “Good Boy” below. The film will hit theaters on Friday, October 3.

Surely, you know the drill by now. In the waning weeks of August, just as the last days of the summer blockbuster season start giving way to the promise of the fall festivals, we here at IndieWire offer up a little throwback treat.

We launched with '90s Week in 2022, went back in time with '80s Week the following year, and naturally did the obvious thing the year after that by… jumping forward to focus on the aughts. As our own David Ehrlich wrote last week, we opted to mix things up (read: slide around the timeline in unexpected ways) because “the '70s just seemed too vast — too robust — to contain within a few short days of lists, essays, interviews, and the like.”

Late in Hunter S. Thompson's 1971 lysergic travelogue “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,” the writer experiences something of a psychic vision of the end of the 1960s, a time he describes as “riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave” that led toward transformative social change thanks to worldwide protests for civil rights, an end to the Vietnam War, women's liberation, even the subtler cultural shifts embodied by the rise of rock as the respectable music of youth.

And then, the harsh reality of the Nixonian “silent majority” reasserted itself, upending hopes of a genuine revolution with a reactionary backlash that rapidly disillusioned idealistic youth. “So now, less than five years later,” he writes, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark — that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.”

That wistful, numb admission of defeat not only summarized the mood among the counterculture at the time, but also anticipated the shift over the 1970s away from the collective struggles of the prior decade to the cynical individualism and consumer therapy of the “Me Decade.” Cinema in the United States and abroad would tackle the various forms of political and psychological fallout of this ideological shift for much of the decade, but it is the movies that were made right at the dawn of the ‘70s that best capture the fresh dissociation of seeing change within one's grasp, only for it to disappear before your eyes.

Just as Thompson saw something of the end of the hippie dream in the barren stretches of Southwest sand, so too did many of the American films most explicitly concerned with the collapse of '60s idealism take place in the country's deserts. Fittingly, one of the most piercing such depictions came from Italian auteur Michelangelo Antonioni, whose “Zabriskie Point” relocates many of the modern anxieties of his native Italian work to the flailing American protest movement and finds in the oppressive environment of Death Valley an echo of the volcanic Mediterranean isle central to his breakthrough “L'Avventura.”

The film begins with familiar sights of the implosion of 1960s counterculture: student activists have succumbed to factionalism that leaves them wide open to police suppression, and the trio of young leads — dropout/possible cop killer Mark (Mark Frechette), drifter Daria (Daria Halprin), and rich kid Lee (Rod Taylor) — meet and form a listless polycule that, in one hallucinatory sequence, expands outward into an orgy of young people entwined all over the hills. Antonioni's critical distance from this mass display makes something of a grim parody of the Sexual Revolution, suggesting that its liberatory possibilities have been forgotten in the name of titillating distraction.

 










Antonioni builds his critique to a mesmerizing finale in which Daria drifts in a traumatized haze into a modernist cliffside house designed by architect Paolo Soleri, an Italian-born American transplant who pioneered an ecological vision of architecture that in many ways represents the possible fulfillment of Antonioni's own search for spiritual harmony between nature and the exponential human progress of modernity. But that possibility is literally dynamited in a vision Daria has of the home abruptly blown to smithereens, the destruction replayed in slo-mo to the crashing squeals of early Pink Floyd, itself a collapse of psychedelic rock's utopian ideals into acid-casualty freak-out. Hoping to find in America what he could not in either Italy nor Mod England, Antonioni instead sees a final, Boschian vision of obliteration to consume the false promise of the 20th century.

The slowly waning energy and sudden rapture of “Zabriskie Point” is mirrored in Monte Hellman's existentialist road movie, “Two-Lane Blacktop.” Hellman's film strips everything from the characters to their vehicle down to its essence: James Taylor and Dennis Wilson play amateur racers identified only as “The Driver” and “The Mechanic,” who crisscross the nation's highways in a car they've equally shorn of every unnecessary accoutrement and aesthetic marker that impedes pure, functional speed. Accompanied by a “Girl” (Laurie Bird) hitchhiking to nowhere, the pair drift from race to race, winning just enough money to keep them in greasy spoon meals and gasoline.

 










Eventually, the group falls into an ambitious cross-country race challenged by G.T.O. (Warren Oates). The Driver and Mechanic see right through the man's clear bluster and lack of actual racing know-how, but they form a strange bond with the man, becoming less competitors than loose companions. Perhaps the recognize their own directionless wanderlust in G.T.O., whose age and weariness breaks the film of a narrow commentary on disenchanted Baby Boomers and into a larger portrait of American malaise. “The thing is, you gotta keep moving,” G.T.O. tells one of many hitchhikers he picks up throughout the film and regales with a different life story, summarizing the shark-like instinct for constant motion that compels him as much as the three younger leads.

The closest thing that G.T.O. has to a fixed identity is the car he's taken as a namesake, a subtle hint at the growing retreat into consumerism as a form of displaced self-actualization in the face of political disempowerment. He, more than the other characters, embodies the film's lack of a conventional beginning, middle, or end. This narrative drift that comes to a head in a finale that mimics celluloid getting caught in a projector, the image slowing until finally a frame tears and catches fire — it's a meta-textual ejection from a story that otherwise has no escape.

 










As bleak as these two films are, they at least end with a certain kind of nihilistic catharsis. No such release categorizes Bob Rafelson's “Five Easy Pieces,” in which Robert Dupea (Jack Nicholson), the prodigal son of an abandoned upper-crust family to which he must return upon news of his father's (Ralph Waite) failing health. Robert fled a life of classical music and parlor-room etiquette for blue-collar work and vulgar entertainment, but if he did so in search of some kind of authenticity, he found only the misery of wage labor.

Nicholson, hair prematurely thinning but possessed of a boyish spark he retained well into his elder years, is perhaps the ultimate symbol of a certain kind of developmental stasis among the Boomer generation. And while he would ultimately come to be seen as a rebellious figure on-screen, it's here that one gets the clearest view of the underlying secret of so many of his most famous characters: Their refusal to conform or obey is ultimately an impotent gesture against forces larger than themselves. 

We meet Robert already starting to fray from the everyday torments of traffic-slowed commutes and precarious job security, and he largely vents his frustrations on his girlfriend, Rayette Dipesto (Karen Black), whom he alternately insults and defends for her provincialism. Her desire to settle down triggers the same flight impulse that sent Robert away from his family, and only in a tender but one-sided scene where the man confesses his existential confusion to his stroke-addled father does he find a way to articulate his anxieties. The previous year, Rafelson's production company scored a landmark counterculture hit with “Easy Rider,” which depicted hippie dropouts like western antiheroes eventually destroyed by a system that cannot tame them. “Five Easy Pieces” offers Robert no blaze of glory, only increasing isolation in a country that resembles Edward Hopper's bleakest, loneliest paintings.

 










In Japan, theatrical audience loss to television resulted in the movie industry turning to exploitation cinema to entice crowds, leaving artier filmmakers few avenues for funding. One of the last bastions of radical cinema was the independent Art Theatre Guild, which produced and distributed two films in 1970 that captured Japan's own retreat from possible change toward aesthetic and political conservatism. 

Nagisa Ōshima's “The Man Who Left His Will on Film” begins with student filmmaker Motoki (Kazuo Goto) witnessing the suicide of rival colleague Endo (Kazuya Horikoshi), who leaves behind reels of film documenting his final days and possible clues about what prompted his death. Compared to the director's more detached, Brechtian movies of the preceding decade (e.g. “Night and Fog in Japan,” “Double Suicide”), his 1970 feature is almost oppressively first-person, sinking ever deeper into Motoki's paranoid need to find some kind of reason in Endo's death even as more and more clues arise to suggest that the other student's death may be nothing more than the protagonist's hallucination. 

Endo's footage consists merely of poetic glimpses of city streets and landscapes, but its very lack of overt political intent convinces Motoki that there must be some hidden key to Endo's demise. Perhaps he is right, but such abstruse, personal means of expression preclude wider understanding, and Ōshima suggests conflict within leftist movements not only over particular goals but the inability to balance collectivist struggle with the equal need for individual artistic vision.

 










Simlarly to Ōshima's film, ATG stalwart Yoshishige Yoshida's “Heroic Purgatory” also captures the self-defeating infighting among radical groups, though if anything Yoshida uses even more experimental techniques than his peer. His allegorical story concerns atomic engineer Shoda (Kaizo Kamoda), who returns home one day to discover his wife has taken in a teenage girl she claims to be his daughter. 

“Heroic Purgatory” uses off-kilter camera compositions and fragmentary editing to establish a slippery relationship between reality and fantasy along with present and past. Shoda's possible daughter behaves in ways both desperately longing and ruinously malevolent, and her antics come to symbolize the irreconcilable urges of political activists wishing to grow a collective political vision while succumbing to internal violence driven by individual ego.

Arguably the country most culturally obsessed with the failure of an international left was France, where the May 1968 demonstrations and eventual downfall have inspired artistic analysis well into the 21st century. Two of the most immediate responses came from the more outré figures of the French New Wave. Jacques Rivette's mammoth 12-hour “Out 1” plays as a distended paranoid thriller, replacing the taut sensory overload of Alan J. Pakula with an almost comical lack of outward incident.

 










Slowly, though, strange details accumulate. A character introduced as deaf and non-verbal reveals that he can hear and speak. Characters disappear abruptly, and the ensemble is so large it's easy not to realize it for some time. Gradually, a sense of unease arises, but it's difficult to articulate what causes and whether clues to a larger conspiracy are real or just disconnected things ascribed meaning by those seeking to find some overriding logic in a world that feels increasingly unmoored and random.

The ultimate postmortem, of both May ‘68 and the wider failure of the ‘60s left movement, can be found in Jean Eustache's starkly directed, talky 1973 feature “The Mother and the Whore,” which uses the benefit of slight hindsight to make clearer observations of the aftershocks of political defeat. In the character of Alexandre (Jean-Pierre Léaud), a dejected radical turned arch-conservative, Eustache perceptively observes how erstwhile opponents of conservatism can become some of its most zealous converts. 

It is Alexandre's poisonously revanchist worldview that gives the film its title, referring as it does to the simplistic manner in which he perceives his exasperated lovers Marie (Bernadette Lafont) and Veronika (Françoise Lebrun). Despite his sexual relationship with both women, the young man looks from a modern vantage point like an eerie precursor to today's incels and manosphere misogynists, compensating for his own feeling of powerlessness against the system by reasserting retrograde gender hierarchy to feel some sense of control.

 










And yet, if Alexandre presents a particularly dire warning of the side-effects of social surrender, “The Mother and the Whore” provides more hope than other such character studies in the way that Marie and Veronika slowly push the boundaries of the pigeonholes in which the man seeks to confine them. Discontent to allow this unimpressive man to roll back the seeds of women's progress over the last decade to force them back into the reductive roles of the film's title, the women find strength in forging their own relationship as a bulwark against Alexandre's controlling nature. While the envisioned leaps and bounds of progress of the ‘60s may have been halted, the steps made cannot be fully reversed. Even so, it's hard not to notice that the collective movements of the previous decade are now replaced by far smaller acts of individual resistance, a daily grind of trench warfare just to hold position in stalemated territory.

Pop/R&B

R&R / Warner

Reviewed:

August 18, 2025

When he released his debut solo album, 2021's Absolutely, Dijon Duenas put out an accompanying live video of him performing in what appears to be the room of a house. He and a small collective of musicians, including regular collaborator Michael Gordon, who performs as Mk.gee, orbit a dining table swarming with instruments, half-empty beer bottles, and coffee cups. At first, it seems like too minimal a setup to convey Dijon's dense, abstracted soul music with any fidelity, but it works because, as filled with esoteric detail as his music can be, it is fundamentally homespun—something that can be made by a few people in a room. Of course, the camera pans back to reveal they're playing on a set in a studio.

The songs on his new album, Baby, feel more like many rooms all at once. From one instant to the next, you find yourself in a completely different soundworld, a gentle sunlit environment giving way to a space painted entirely black and lit by piercing artificial lights. On Absolutely, this sort of contrast was only faintly gestured at, a dark cloud of whimsy and chaos framing the tender scenes of desire and longing within.

On Baby, surprise-released just months after his high-profile contributions to this year's Justin Bieber record SWAG, the cloud has descended. Harsh staticky rifts split the world into chunks on which one can often only briefly gain purchase. Lyrics arrive in fragments too distorted to easily discern. (When you can hear them, they describe domesticity in what feel like chaotic outbursts: sex, having children, experiencing an enduring love that annihilates your insecurities despite it containing its own chaos and uncertainty.) Reverb is applied so generously that you are aware of every sound's echo as well as its slow-motion decay, refracted thousands of times as if in a broken mirror. All of these elements present a vision of R&B that is pure collage: past, present, and future colliding in their most jagged configurations. If you can see the seams, the raw edges of each sound element pasted roughly onto the canvas of the record, that's because the seams are the point.

As with his colleague mk.gee's work, there is something figural and fugitive about Dijon's songwriting, something that changes or disappears as soon as you begin to apprehend it. It can provide immediate pleasures, like lithe and funky rhythmic beds, or hooks that work their way into your memory even though they sometimes fight through several layers to get there. But all this deconstruction allows the songs on Baby to escape any predictable shape they may have otherwise taken. They leak out and pool and dissolve in such quick successive movements that it's as if they were recorded in time-lapse.

This doesn't break the spell of the music; far from it. It actually deepens it. It makes you wonder what exactly it is you've been smoking. The instrumentals sound pre-filtered through a weed haze, often arriving a beat later than expected. Sometimes the rhythms even seem to trip over themselves, as on “HIGHER!” which feels like it's constantly having seconds added and subtracted from it. Even more organic instrumental elements, like the acoustic guitar that holds the title track together, are chopped up and blown out as possible, as if in order for the instrument to enter a Dijon record, it had to mutate a little. And in the record's least finessed moments—in the overdriven frequencies that ripple through “FIRE!”, or the hi-hats that make the rhythm in “(Referee)” sound like shattering glass, or the endless delay applied to every drum hit in “(Freak It)”—it can feel like you are listening to the record from inside the speaker that's playing it, feeling the vibration before hearing the sound.

This is bold, irreverent, exploratory music; it contrasts interestingly with Dijon's contributions to the Bieber record, which tended to smooth Bieber out, make him palatable, and anchor him in somewhat human feelings and emotional melodies. Dijon, recording once more with his collaborators from Absolutely—Gordon, plus producers and multi-instrumentalists Andrew Sarlo and Henry Kwapis—needs no anchor for his work; there might not even be a bottom to this record for an anchor to hit.

The obvious antecedent to Baby is Frank Ocean, whose work, as his career progressed, increasingly collapsed into abstracted versions of itself, a constant searching that eventually led his songs to resemble art installations that prioritize space as much as songcraft. I can also hear Bilal's more boundary-pushing records, where he tried to craft a futuristic funk-soul that never settled, just ventured outward at increasingly odd angles. There's D'Angelo and the Soulquarians, specifically the more inwardly bent dimensions they explored on Common's Like Water for Chocolate. And Bon Iver, with whom Dijon collaborated earlier this year, is audible in the vocal production throughout the record, whenever Dijon's voice increases in volume and it sounds as if his feelings are boiling in his throat.

Of course, there is Prince, who haunts Baby throughout its runtime, specifically the Prince who recorded “The Ballad of Dorothy Parker” to a faulty mixing console that had no high-end, making the entire track sound water-damaged and like it would sift apart if you touched it. It didn't matter; he had too many ideas to care about them coming out “wrong.” And Dijon takes that a step further, pursues sounding “wrong” as a way of actually sounding right. R&B is so often a genre of precision, at times increasingly so as it's become less played and more programmed over decades of development. Where can an artist go now but deeper into the error?

Which isn't to say that Baby is wholly abrasive and unwieldy. “Yamaha” gleams semi-normally, like light reflecting on chrome as physically intended. It could be a lead single, if a lead single were something Baby was interested in. (No advance singles were released for the record.) And the record's final track, “Kindalove,” is also its most accessible and straightforward, one of Dijon's airy, sunlit and ethereal rooms, even though it too is gradually drowned in reverb, reverberating against itself, until Dijon sounds like he's singing it to feel less lonely in a massive abandoned space that won't stop returning the sounds he's making. This is another error, a visible seam, something you can see the fray still hanging off of. And yet there's a window through which we're glimpsing it, a wall missing so the camera can zoom in and out of it. Baby is undeniably made in such a way that it uncannily emphasizes its making. That's what makes it so real.

Joyce Manor are back with new music. Produced by Brett Gurewitz, “All My Friends Are So Depressed” is the band's first original song since releasing 40 oz. to Fresno in 2022. Watch the accompanying video, directed by Jaxon Whittington and frontman Barry Johnson, below.

“The first line I came up with for this song was ‘Lord above in a Tecate truck' after passing a Tecate delivery truck with Jesus shit all over it on the freeway driving back to Long Beach after a show in Fresno,” Johnson said in a press statement. “While searching for a line that rhymed with ‘Lord above in a Tecate truck' I came up with ‘Why even exist? Who gives a fuck!?' and the concept of ‘All My Friends Are So Depressed' was born.”

He continued: “It's kind of my take on what I imagine Lana Del Rey lyrics are like. Instead of icy, detached, cool '50s Americana, it's all dirty shag carpet, bong rips, Peter Frampton Comes Alive, key lime pie, and suicidal ideations. My flow was inspired by 100 gecs, who I was listening to a concerning amount in 2023. (Much respect to Dylan and Laura; please take us on tour.) Musically, we were drawing from the Libertines, Tiger Army, X, and the Smiths… obviously.”

8.0

Genre:

Rap

Label:

EMPIRE

Reviewed:

August 18, 2025

Rio Da Yung OG is a rapper who truly lives up to his name. The Michigan-born, self-proclaimed shit-talker has seen more in 31 years than most will in their entire life. To return from federal prison after nearly half a decade without snitching or having a mental breakdown is akin to graduating with a PHD for a career criminal. Perhaps that's why Rio has come back sounding like if Red from Shawshank Redemption started rapping, as if he were the wisest inmate in the prison, a young man unfortunate enough to have seen it all by age 30, sentenced to spend a lifetime doling out invaluable advice to some of the country's slimiest crooks, couched between vulgar asides and gallows humor, just to make sure he doesn't lose anybody's attention.

F.L.I.N.T. (Feeling Like I'm Not Through) is Rio's not-so-subtle way of bringing some positive attention to his hometown of Flint, MI, a city most people outside of the state only know about because of its infamous water crisis in 2014. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency finally lifted its emergency order on Flint's lead-laden drinking water in May 2025, but many residents remain skeptical. Rio's pre-prison 2020 mixtape, City on My Back, implied his mission to carry his beleaguered hometown out of the mud and back onto the field. F.L.I.N.T., which was released on the city's annual 810 Day, named after the region's area code, is an acknowledgment to just how far he's carried it, becoming the first rapper in the city with a platinum record. “I'm just a little dirty kid from Flint, I never seen nothing,” he says on album-opener, “Different Music.”

Rio's long been an artist best consumed via YouTube loosies and one-off singles. Past projects feel like they were put together as an afterthought, but never in a way that harmed the product much. The cobbled-together feel actually added to his shit-talking, “I am not a rapper” mythos. Even more recent projects like the understandably hurried Rio Free feel like a string of random songs. F.L.I.N.T., on the other hand, is Rio's most complete body of work to date. It maintains a novel-like quality, filled with poetic irony and literary repetition. “Another Story” is a masterclass in storytelling, a Tarantino-esque tale told brilliantly with little context, as if Rio were regaling us with his life story from the bottom bunk of a two-man cell. He uses humor not just for laughs, but as a weapon to expose and process the pain, absurdity, and contradictions of his environments. He manages to squeeze in phrases like “butt-napkin” next to lines like “Pulled up to my granny's house and I just bust' out crying, she said ‘you know how the streets go, old folks don't be lying.'”

F.L.I.N.T. is a modest attempt at making something cohesive and thoughtful, not easy for a rapper who has prided himself on effortlessness. Songs like “Back Rubbed,” and “Sneaky B” have Rio switching up his flow for beats he probably wouldn't have touched five years ago. Longtime collaborators and fellow architects of Flint's signature tombstone-bell, looped-beats sound, like Wayne616, BEATSBYSAV, and Danny G Beats, more than rise to the occasion, providing the canvas for which Rio paints irreducible observations from his life like, “the first time I shot a gun, I was a sixth grader,” on “Great Day.” Another standout is “Big Ben,” where Rio says plainly, “I miss my cousin, but I miss my brother more, crib so big it got 100 doors.” It's hard to pick just one bar to quote when every line feels strong enough to stand on its own, while at the same time building on what's come before.

Luckily, Rio never strays too far from his roots. The nearly 6-minute-long “AGGRESSIVE FLOW” is a hookless onslaught of wicked one-liners, in the spirit of Rio and RMC Mike's trunk-rattling Dum and Dumber mixtape series. RMC Mike even shows up a few songs later on “Dumb N Dumber Flo,” where he says apropos of nothing “$3,200 for some flip-flops,” as if he just excitedly remembered a new way to waste money. F.L.I.N.T. winds up showcasing all the technical strengths that originally put Rio and his crew on the map, while also successfully expanding his sound to fit larger stages. It's a meditation on the joys of being a big fish in a little pond, moments before being moved to the ocean.

	“I have a hook for your story,” a podcast producer told me as soon as I called her up earlier this summer. “Pineapple Street announced it's going out of business today.”


	I'd already been reporting on the collapse of the narrative podcast industry for several weeks, talking with executives and editors and producers. Everyone had pretty much the same thing to say: things were looking grim. But this news felt personal. I'd hosted and written two shows for Pineapple Street Studios. I had several close collaborators who were still on staff. Even when I was just a fan of podcasts, I knew the name Pineapple Street — it was a pioneering production company and industry leader. They'd made the mega-hit Missing Richard Simmons in 2017, then spent almost a decade churning out award-winning narrative shows like The Catch and Kill Podcast, Ghost Story, and Hysterical. A few years ago, Pineapple Street going out of business would have shocked me. But when I heard about its demise on that Thursday afternoon in June, it felt sad but inevitable.

	











	If you haven't been paying close attention, the idea that a segment of the podcast industry is existentially imperiled may seem counterintuitive. More people than ever are listening to podcasts and talking about podcasts and thinking about starting their own podcasts. Politicians trying to win elections are clamoring to go on podcasts. (When they lose, it is blamed, in part, on not going on the right podcasts.) A recent report from Edison Research estimates that 55 percent of Americans over the age of 12 consumed a podcast in the last month, an all-time high. But the podcasts that are thriving are talk shows — increasingly celebrity-driven talk shows — that are cheap to make, can easily be turned into streaming YouTube videos, and command big ad dollars. Narrative podcasts — the multi-episode, investigative journalism–fueled shows that boomed after the release of Serial in October 2014 — have followed an inverse trajectory.

	For years, narrative podcasts were the buzziest segment of the industry. They were what many listeners thought of when they heard the word “podcast.” Many of these shows, following the lead of Serial, were true crime, while others, like Slow Burn, took a similar investigative approach to politics and history. But regardless of genre, most narrative shows shared a style — they were told through the perspective of a single reporter-host, who not only guided a listener through a story but invited them along on the reporting journey. Now, these shows seem increasingly like an artifact of history. Layoffs have hit nearly every organization that makes this kind of audio, from corporate behemoths like Spotify to successful start-ups like Pushkin Industries to the public-radio godfather of it all, This American Life. In early August, Amazon announced it was dismantling Wondery, one of the biggest and most commercially successful studios in the business, which had made its name on shows like Dr. Death and The Shrink Next Door. Amazon had acquired Wondery less than five years ago for $300 million. Now, the company was being broken up into parts and a reported 110 staffers were laid off.


	“It feels like podcasts speed-ran the development of an industry to the decline of an industry,” the journalist and podcast host Evan Ratliff told me. “It went from people were making absolutely no money, to people were making fortunes big enough where they'd never have to work again, to ‘There's not a budget for that' in less than 10 years.” Now, even those reduced budgets have vanished. 


	The fall of the industry has been so vertiginous that it's been hard to fully comprehend its decline. But in many ways, this collapse was baked into its spectacular rise, when a flood of dumb money, pollyannaish entrepreneurs, and hungry journalists rushed to build an industry that would soon turn into a house of cards.


	YEARS BEFORE I STARTED MAKING podcasts, I thought I was already too late to get in on the craze. This was the mid-2010s, and after Serial, it felt like every other month brought another expertly crafted narrative series. There was the first season of In the Dark, and S-Town, and Missing Richard Simmons—podcasts that not only got millions of listeners but were covered in the mainstream media as events. They got picked over, debated on social media. They felt like they mattered. So when my friend Matthew Shaer asked me if I might be interested in making a podcast with him in the spring 2017, I leapt at the opportunity.

	Matt told me he'd happened upon a story about a Florida State University law professor named Dan Markel who had been shot to death outside his home in Tallahassee in 2014. Two alleged hitmen had been charged in the case, but authorities believed the masterminds behind the murder were family members of Markel's ex-wife. Matt had tried to pitch it xas a magazine story, but he'd struck out, which turned out to be a lucky break. The Markel case was convoluted, had tons of backstory, and there was hours of archival audio from police wiretaps and stings. In other words, it was perfect for a podcast.


	Matt and I spent months developing the idea, then we pitched it to Wondery, which was fresh off its first big hit, Dirty John. Within a couple weeks, we'd signed a contract to make a six-episode show. We wanted to call it Tallahassee. Wondery's CEO Hernan Lopez, a shrewd former television executive, opted instead for the crass but grabby Over My Dead Body. He said he liked titles that were phrases people actually said. 


	In mid-February 2019, the night before Over My Dead Body was released, Wondery hosted a launch party at the Ace Hotel in New York. They billed it as the “exclusive world premiere of 2019's next blockbuster.” Lopez, Wondery's CEO served as master of ceremonies, insisting that all the attendees blindfold themselves while listening to the first episode. Afterward, Matt and I went to dinner with Marshall Lewy, Wondery's chief content officer, who told us about his attempt to court an Oscar-nominated screenwriter to adapt Over My Dead Body. That particular screenwriter had declined, but it hardly mattered. The show hit number one on the Apple podcast charts and stayed there for weeks. That summer, the actress and director Elizabeth Banks optioned the show for development. In 2019, the movie and TV industry just couldn't resist a good podcast.


	“My friends in Hollywood would be like, ‘People don't care about books anymore, people don't care about graphic novels or comic books, they just want to make podcasts into movies,'” Jenna Weiss-Berman, the co-founder of Pineapple Street, tells me. “Then everyone was like, cool, this is going to be an amazing business.”

 “People don't care about books anymore, people don't care about comic books, they just want to make podcasts into movies”


	In truth, narrative podcasts had always been a strange business. Requiring months (and sometimes years) of reporting and an exhaustive writing and editing process, they were expensive to produce and struggled to attract enough advertising to pay for their budgets. (Weekly chat shows, with their consistent audiences and parasocial relationships between host and listener, were always a safer bet.) The Hollywood money could help close the gap, and when a show struck big like Wondery's The Shrink Next Door — which had a purchase price of $1.25 million and numerous associated bonus fees — narrative podcasts could turn a tidy profit. But podcasting still seemed like a relatively modest offshoot of magazines and public radio. Then Big Tech changed the math entirely.


	A week before the Over My Dead Body launch party, Spotify announced that it was acquiring the podcast studio Gimlet for a reported $230 million. Spotify had been looking to reduce its dependency on record labels while also becoming a one-stop shop audio company, and Gimlet — which made highly produced shows — was a key plank in that strategy.

	











	To most people in the industry, Spotify buying Gimlet made sense, but Spotify buying Gimlet for $230 million seemed, to quote one longtime producer, “totally insane.” (As Brian Reed, the host of S-Town, noted to me, Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post for a similar sum in 2013. ”A five-year-old podcast company being valued at the same amount as one of the biggest legacy media brands ever — that, to me, encapsulates the bubble we were in,” Reed says.) Gimlet had routinely struggled with profitability. Now, their founders and investors had cashed out for a quarter-billion dollars. ”It was like Spotify dropped a wallet in the street and Gimlet picked it up — it could've been any of us,” one former podcast executive told me.


	It wasn't long before other wallets started dropping. In August 2019, Pineapple Street, a considerably smaller company than Gimlet, sold to Entercom (later rebranded Audacy) for $18 million. In July 2020, the New York Times bought Serial Productions for a reported $25 million. That December, Amazon announced its $300 million bet on Wondery. These companies weren't buying narrative podcast shops because they thought narrative podcasts were a can't-miss business. They saw them as part of their grand corporate maneuverings. One former Pineapple Street staffer tells me an Entercom executive had said during the acquisition, “We don't need you to make money. We want you to make shows we can brag about.”


	Soon, Sony, Apple TV+, and Amazon were aggressively commissioning narrative podcasts from independent producers, too. New companies like Campside Media (co-founded by my Over My Dead Body reporting partner Matthew Shaer) cropped up to feed the beast, churning out narrative series for the big players while hoping they might follow Pineapple Street and Serial Productions and get acquired for a spectacular fee.


	As money swelled the ranks of the industry, it also gave it a sense of staying power. Narrative podcasts couldn't be written off as a fad. They were a new medium, the savior of longform storytelling. A day after Spotify acquired Gimlet, the National Magazine Awards unveiled the finalists for their first-ever podcasting prize. Later that year, the Pulitzer Prizes announced they were adding an “audio reporting” category. Podcast hosts like Serial‘s Sarah Koenig and S-Town's Brian Reed were going on late-night shows. Hulu was launching its Emmy-winning comedy series about true-crime podcasters, Only Murders in the Building. Big-time print journalists like The New Yorker's Patrick Radden Keefe were jumping into the world of narrative podcasts and loving it. Keefe tells me that not only was making his show, Wind of Change, one of the “happiest, most creatively fulfilling experiences” of his career, but he saw audiences respond to it in a lasting way. “On book tour, there are always people who show up, having read none of my books, and want to talk about Wind of Change,” Keefe says.


	I was feeling optimistic too. Over My Dead Body had been just the beginning for me. I made a campaign-trail podcast for Texas Monthly called Underdog: Beto v. Cruz; I was reporting and writing the investigative true-crime series Suspect and executive producing a story of drug-smuggling and police corruption called Witnessed: Borderlands. Then there was my show Project Unabom, about the 18-year manhunt to find Ted Kaczynski, which I'd gotten greenlit off a pitch that was barely a paragraph long. I was busier than I'd ever been, and I was already discussing new projects that would keep me occupied for the next 18 months. At the time, I was a staff writer for Texas Monthly, which had once seemed like a dream job. But in December 2020, I quit. I wanted to write and produce podcasts full time. I had caught the bug. I wasn't the only one.

	











	IN THE SUMMER OF 2016, Connie Walker was looking for a new way to tell stories. She was a television reporter at the CBC News in Toronto, where she specialized in covering indigenous issues. She had a big audience, but she also found that she was frustrated by the quick-hit nature of TV news. Walker is Cree and grew up in the Okanese First Nation in rural Saskatchewan, and she wanted to bring history and context into her stories. Almost always, she had to leave that on the cutting room floor.


	Podcasts had been a revelation. She'd gotten hooked on Serial and was inspired by its immersive approach to storytelling. So she pitched her bosses on a podcast about the unsolved 1989 murder of Canadian woman from the Gitxsan nation. Walker's bosses were television people. They'd never overseen a podcast before, but they cautiously agreed. She had a tight deadline and a tiny team, but plenty of editorial freedom to tell the story of an indigenous community in the way she wanted.


	“I think for a long time there was just this feeling that our stories weren't important or that Canadians wouldn't care,” Walker tells me. “And it was finally our chance. So we just took it and ran with it.”


Missing & Murdered: Who Killed Alberta Williams? debuted that fall, and it quickly found an audience. Walker tracked the ins and outs of the case, but she was after something larger: “We started this story looking for answers about Alberta Williams' unsolved murder, but the deeper we got into the story the more I thought about the bigger questions,” Walker says at the beginning of the fourth episode. “Why are there over 1,200 cases of missing and murdered Indigenous women in Canada? My hope in telling Alberta's story is to begin to connect the dots.”

“For a long time there was this feeling that our stories weren't important. And it was finally our chance. So we just took it and ran with it.”


	Within a couple months of the show's release, Walker was connecting even more dots, reporting a new season that tracked her search for a long-ago missing Cree girl named Cleopatra Semaganis Nicotine. But midway through production, Walker's manager told her that it would be her last podcast.

	











	“She was like, ‘This takes too long. It's too expensive. This is it,'” Walker says. And I was like, ‘it hasn't even come out yet.' And she said, ‘management doesn't support it.'


Missing & Murdered: Finding Cleo was a breakout hit, but the CBC stuck to its decision. Walker went back to making television, but soon she was looking for a new employer. In the summer of 2019, she was invited to meet with a few executives at Gimlet, which had just been acquired by Spotify. As soon as she walked into their Brooklyn offices, she was wide-eyed. The CBC offices looked like what you'd expect from a public broadcaster — drab carpeting, dated computers, refrigerators full of sad office lunch. Gimlet's offices were all start-up pizzazz — designer furniture, gleaming cutting-edge equipment, break rooms stocked with free sparkling water and a cornucopia of snacks. Even better, Gimlet offered Walker its full editorial backing. 


	“I was begging at the CBC, like ‘Please let me,' and with Gimlet it was like, ‘What can we do to support you and your vision of the podcast?” Walker says. “It really was like a dream come true.”


	Walker's Gimlet show, Stolen, continued the work she'd started with Missing & Murdered. In the first season, she investigated the recent disappearance of a young mother named Jermain Charlo, but in the second season, Walker broke the mold, focusing on a mystery involving her own father, Howard Cameron, and the abuse he and his peers suffered at the St. Michael's Residential School, which had been established as part of a government policy of forced assimilation. It was a dark, personal story, and Gimlet gave Walker the time and the team to pursue the most ambitious work of her career. Gimlet's largesse was worth it. Stolen: Surviving St. Michael's won nearly every award for which it was nominated, including the Peabody and the Pulitzer.


Stolen: Surviving St. Michael's was one of the strongest cases imaginable for the existence of narrative podcasts. The resources at Gimlet had allowed a reporter to investigate a deeply personal story, then broaden the scope until she'd crafted a furious indictment of institutional abuse and racism. Just as importantly, the behind-the-scenes transparency of the medium had taken what could have been a dry exercise in accountability journalism and injected it with the sizzle and suspense of a police procedural. And the voices of the survivors themselves gave it an intimacy and force that would have been almost impossible in another medium. But when Stolen: Surviving St. Michael's was winning the biggest awards in audio journalism, Walker's triumph was tempered by the fact that Gimlet itself was a husk of its former self.


	The problems had burst into public view two years earlier with accusations that one of Gimlet's flagship shows, Reply All, had created a hostile work environment for non-white staffers. That had led to a reckoning inside the company and, within a little over a year, the end of Reply All. Other longtime Gimlet shows, which were siloed as “Spotify exclusives” and unavailable on other platforms, started bleeding their audiences. New shows had trouble gaining traction. In October 2022, Spotify, under pressure from investors to reduce costs, began culling its original podcast offerings, cancelling several Gimlet shows and laying off dozens of staffers. By the end of that year, Gimlet's managing director, Lydia Polgren, and its co-founders, Alex Blumberg and Matt Leiber, had all departed the company. Then in June 2023, less than a month after Walker's Pulitzer and Peabody wins, Spotify shut down Gimlet and put its few remaining shows under the mantle of Spotify Studios. In just four years, Spotify had turned $230 million into zero dollars.


	Spotify spared Stolen for a few months, but that December, it too was cancelled. The news wasn't a surprise to Walker. “I feel like we knew kind of before we knew,” she says. She and her team were allowed to stay on and finish their third season, Stolen: Trouble in Sweetwater, but when its final episode was released in April 2024, they were all out of work.

	











	In some ways, this was familiar terrain for Walker, echoing her experience with the CBC. But the podcast industry was in a vastly different place in the summer of 2024 than it had been in the summer of 2019. Gone were the days when studios like Gimlet were flush with cash and hungry to buy up new talent. When Spotify cancelled Stolen and another former Gimlet show, Heavyweight, a company spokesperson said they would “work with the show creators to ensure a smooth transition for wherever these series go next.” But there was nowhere to go next for Stolen. When Walker reached out to podcast studios and media companies, they didn't try to woo her at their venture capital-funded offices. She couldn't get anyone to make her an offer at all. Stolen: Surviving St. Michael's had felt like undeniable proof of what she'd been trying to convince people of for her entire career — “that these stories are important, that there's an audience, and that they can have an impact.” But that moment had faded. Two months after Spotify cancelled Stolen, the company signed a new $250 million deal with Joe Rogan.


	THE NARRATIVE PODCAST INDUSTRY HAD always been an awkward mash-up of characters — public-radio true believers, Hollywood producers, magazine refugees, and eventually tech executives — and it had always been a little unclear what the goal of making these shows really was. Were they entertainment or journalism? Should their success be measured in awards and social impact, or by their ability to turn a buck? Did these podcasts exist principally for their listening audiences, or were they really, when you got down to it, just proof of concept for film and television development? The different segments of the industry always had different answers to these questions, but for a time, while the money was flowing, it felt like podcasts could be everything to everyone. The precious journalists could strive for their Pulitzers, and the wannabe Ari Golds could have their Hollywood deals. The answer to every binary choice was “yes.”


	But then the money started to go away. The tech and media giants that had funded the podcast boom had learned that narrative journalism was hard to scale. In 2019, it might have been enough for them to make shows that “we can brag about,” but a few years later, as recession fears grew, losing money on prestige programming no longer seemed like a good idea. “Podcasting has been a drag on the gross margin side,” Spotify CEO Daniel Ek said in January 2023, “Some shows worked, some didn't perform as we expected. And that is a sign of maturing. You go for growth first and then you seek efficiency.” As 2023 went on, Ek and his competitors tacked hard toward efficiency.

	











	“Places that were buying these shows for $1 million started to say, ‘How about $500,000?'” Weiss-Berman, the Pineapple Street co-founder, told me. “Then it was, ‘How about $400,000?' Then, ‘How about $300,000?'”


	For years, the industry had been building itself up on the premise that the demand would only grow for prestige TV-like narrative shows and budgets would remain robust. When the big tech companies cut back, the first solution for the production companies that depended on them was mass layoffs. The second was closing up shop entirely. For anyone making a living in podcasting, the future started to look like finding a new line of work.

“Places that were buying shows for $1 million started to say, ‘How about $500,000? Then it was, ‘How about $400,000?' Then, ‘How about $300,000?'”


	At the beginning of this year, that's how it was looking to me. I'd spent much of the previous two years writing and producing two shows that had both been killed by their commissioning companies. They weren't bad. I'm pretty sure they were good. But they didn't sound exactly like something that had come before, which meant they weren't easily slotted into a pre-existing feed. By then, a conservatism had set in. The industry of “yes” was now beginning to resemble the worst of Hollywood. Creative executives, under pressure to churn out hits, were increasingly micromanaging the process, engaging in what one award-winning host described to me as a “firing line approach to editing.”


	 In February, I finished up a show that actually got released, the Wondery podcast Death County, PA, which had showcased the high-impact prison reporting of the journalist Joshua Vaughn. Then, for the first time since 2018, I faced a world in which I had no offers for new podcast work.


	But I don't know if I'm done with podcasts, even if a certain kind of corporate-backed, lavishly budgeted narrative show appears to be extinct. My favorite podcast from the last 12 months is called Shell Game, and in many ways it's a playbook for what might come next. Hosted and reported by Evan Ratliff, a longtime tech journalist and one of the hosts of the Longform podcast, Shell Game is an experimental series about artificial intelligence, and in many ways, it's a rejection of the compromises that had become baked into making shows for Big Podcast.


	“I knew it was going to weird,” Ratliff says. “And I wanted to be as weird as possible. I didn't want to be forced into analytic conclusions about AI, the kind of places you get pushed by people who are trying to sell your show.”

	











	Of course, by the spring of 2024, when Ratliff started making Shell Game, he probably wouldn't have found anyone to fund it anyway. But that was fine. Ratliff figured he could do it cheaply with a small team. He hired Sophie Bridges, a producer he'd worked with previously, and leaned on the expertise of his wife, Samantha Henig, who had founded and led the audio division of the New York Times.


	The tiny team didn't diminish the quality of the show. And part of what's so wonderful about Shell Game is it's a story that could only exist as a podcast. Ratliff created an AI voice clone of himself and set it loose in the world. In the show, we hear AI Evan interact on the phone, often hilariously, with a series of interlocutors, starting with customer service representatives and scammers and building to two sessions with an unwitting human therapist via the online platform Better Help.


Shell Game made several best-of-the-year lists, and Ratliff says it broke even. (The revenue came almost entirely from subscriptions to an affiliated Substack.) Then, it won a $50,000 prize from the Independent Media Initiative, which made it profitable. But breaking even is a tough business model, and prize money isn't something you can count on. For Season Two of Shell Game, Ratliff is collaborating with the independent podcast studio Kaleidoscope, which has given him more a financial cushion while still allowing him to make the show he wants to make. “They're into telling a story that sounds as far from any formula as possible and helping us try to do that,” Ratliff said. That's how the future might look: smaller, more independent, more experimental, but also with fewer shows being made and basically no hope of striking rich.


	But that future is hard to see from the present. At the moment, the narrative podcasts that are making it to the top of the Apple charts are tabloid-y true-crime, often affiliated with TV shows like Dateline and 20/20. Pineapple Street has vanished, Wondery has been gutted, and many of the surviving production companies are trying desperately to pivot to weekly chat shows. Nearly every producer and editor I worked with in podcasting — across seven years and 12 shows — is struggling to find work. Some are piecing together freelance gigs doing field reporting for news-radio outlets. A few are staffing chat shows. One talented producer I know is now working for a fly-fishing magazine. Another started a successful food Substack. An entire generation of journalists who started in podcasting are leaving and are unlikely to return. And many of the most respected and experienced producers, editors, and reporters in the industry are out in the cold too. Connie Walker is one of them.


	When I spoke to Walker in late June, she was about to start a new job as a journalism professor at Toronto Metropolitan University. There, she'd be continuing the work she began in Stolen: Surviving St. Michael's, collecting the testimony of residential school survivors and building out an archive of the abuses that took place. That work is certainly worthwhile, but when we spoke, Walker was open about the fact that her “new dream” was to turn that work into another podcast. 


	In retrospect, the boom years of narrative podcasting were always a kind of dream. When she went to Gimlet, Connie Walker felt like she'd won the lottery. Sometimes I felt like I had, too. Now, that era is definitively over. A few people got rich. Many more came out the other side with no job, and if they were lucky, a few months severance. Whatever comes next will be built up in the shadow of that history — that it all looked so good and that so many of us bought into the mirage.

	Numerous actors, filmmakers, and musicians have paid tribute to Terence Stamp following his death at 87. 


	The Oscar-nominated British actor was best known for starring in The Limey, Billy Budd, and as General Zod in Superman. He also appeared as a transgender woman in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, which earned him a Golden Globe and BAFTA nomination for Best Actor.


Guy Pearce, who starred alongside Stamp in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, wrote on X, “Fairwell dear Tel. You were a true inspiration, both in & out of heels. We'll always have Kings Canyon, Kings road & F'ing ABBA. Wishing you well on your way ‘Ralph'!”

Fairwell dear Tel. You were a true inspiration, both in & out of heels. We'll always have Kings Canyon, Kings road & F'ing ABBA. Wishing you well on your way ‘Ralph'! xxxx💕


Priscilla director Stephan Elliott penned a remembrance for The Guardian, noting that Stamp initially “turned it down.” “Terence admitted he was absolutely terrified to play Bernadette — he was being voted one of the best-looking men on earth and suddenly in Priscilla he was, and this is a direct quote, ‘dressed up as an old dog,'” Elliott wrote. “But he put the pain of what he was going through into the performance, and that's what made the film.” 

	











	He added, “Terence kept to himself. He was an enigma. And then he'd show up, use the eyes and turn everybody to jelly. He was a wonderful man — and he's not done yet.”


	Actor Lou Diamond Phillips, who starred with Stamp in Young Guns, wrote on X, “Terribly saddened to hear this. We were all incredibly privileged to have worked with him on Young Guns. He grounded all of us and truly elevated the filming experience. Such class and artistry. What a kind, beautiful, generous man. RIP.”

	











Edgar Wright, who cast Stamp in his 2021 feature Last Night in Soho (the actor's final screen role), shared a lengthy tribute on social media, writing, “Terence was kind, funny, and endlessly fascinating. I loved discussing music with him (his brother managed The Who, and he's name-checked in The Kinks' Waterloo Sunset) or reminiscing about his films, going back to his debut in Billy Budd. He spoke of his last shot in that film, describing a transcendental moment with the camera — a sense of becoming one with the lens.”

	He continued, “Decades later, while directing him, I witnessed something similar. The closer the camera moved, the more hypnotic his presence became. In close-up, his unblinking gaze locked in so powerfully that the effect was extraordinary. Terence was a true movie star: the camera loved him, and he loved it right back.”

Billy Idol noted, “I interviewed Terrence once for details, magazine, New York. It was fantastic meeting him. He was great.”

	David Zucker recalled directing Stamp in 2003's My Boss's Daughter opposite Ashton Kutcher. “‘Terry' as we called him was as sweet and funny as he was scary on screen,” Zucker wrote. “When I had to do a reshoot to save the picture, I went to the Chateau Marmont where he graciously volunteered to let me video him hanging off his hotel room balcony… I can't say I'll miss him, since I haven't seen him for 20 years, but, gee, what an amazing actor and an even better guy.”

	Producer Gale Anne Hurd, who worked with Stamp on 1988's Alien Nation, tweeted, “Terence Stamp was a brilliant actor. I think he and Peter O'Toole not onlv had the most mesmerizing eyes…but delivered equally indelible performances.”

	Actor Titus Welliver added, “Terrence Stamp has departed. A titan, we are fewer. Flights of angels.”


	Stamp's death was announced Sunday by his family, who said in a statement, “He leaves behind an extraordinary body of work, both as an actor and a writer that will continue to touch people for years to come,” the BBC reported. No cause of death was provided.

	President Donald Trump pledged Monday that he will try to eliminate mail-in voting, after telling Fox News that authoritarian Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed with him on the subject during their meeting last week. 


	Despite lacking any sort of constitutional power on the matter, Trump declared in a Truth Social post that he would sign an executive order to “help bring HONESTY to the 2026 Midterm Elections,” and attempt to strip states of their independent authority to oversee elections, and is demanding they just do what he tells them to. 


	“I am going to lead a movement to get rid of MAIL-IN BALLOTS, and also, while we're at it, Highly ‘Inaccurate,' Very Expensive, and Seriously Controversial VOTING MACHINES,” the president wrote, referencing conservatives' disproven claims and conspiracies regarding voter fraud in the 2020 election, which he lost. 


	“Remember, the States are merely an ‘agent' for the Federal Government in counting and tabulating the votes. They must do what the Federal Government, as represented by the President of the United States, tells them, FOR THE GOOD OF OUR COUNTRY, to do,” he added. “ELECTIONS CAN NEVER BE HONEST WITH MAIL IN BALLOTS/VOTING…THE MAIL-IN BALLOT HOAX, USING VOTING MACHINES THAT ARE A COMPLETE AND TOTAL DISASTER, MUST END, NOW!!!”

	Of course, the president does not have the power to unilaterally strip states of their constitutionally guaranteed right to conduct and oversee elections, and any executive order purporting to do so will likely face immediate court challenges.

	











	The post came days after Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity that Putin — who hasn't participated in a free and fair election in decades — agreed with him on the need to eliminate mail-in voting during their meeting last week. 


	“Vladimir Putin said something — one of the most interesting things — he said, ‘your election was rigged because you have mail-in voting,'” Trump recounted. “He said … ‘it's impossible to have mail-in voting and have honest elections.”

	“We talked about 2020,” Trump continued. “He said ‘You won that election by so much,' … and he said and ‘if you would have won, we wouldn't have had a war, you'd have all these millions of people alive now instead of dead,' and he said ‘you lost it because of mail-in voting, it was a rigged election.'” 


	There is no evidence that the use of mail-in ballots or digital voting machines is conducive to widespread electoral fraud. Though mail-in voting has historically skewed Democratic, Republicans rely on it as well, including in states like Florida, where Trump voted early last year. Nevertheless, eliminating mail-in voting has been a goal of the president's for some time now.


	While it might be clear to most that the Russian autocrat was quite clearly making a play to stroke Trump's ego, the president has pushed Republicans at home to restrict access to mail-in and early voting, with significant success. Since 2020, at least 29 states implemented more stringent restrictions on voter registrations and identification requirements, or attempted to limit early and absentee voting. According to a 2024 analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice, at least 25 states enacted 43 mail voting restrictions between 2020 and 2024. 


	So while Trump may not legally be able to change state voting laws with the stroke of a pen, plenty of lawmakers across the country are ready and willing to cooperate with his anti-democratic agenda. 


	Election conspiracist Mike Lindell hailed Trump's social media post in a conversation with Rolling Stone.

	“It's a great day for America, isn't it?” he says. “I've been talking this for four-and-a half years, 12 hours a day, so this is a big deal. I've been talking about melting down the voting machines and turning them into prison bars — it's been the total focus of my life for four-and-a-half years. I last spoke to the president about this in June, maybe? Whenever I'm at the White House, I bring it up…I've been to White House three times this year, and of course I speak to him when I'm there. I don't tell him anything I don't tell you which is: We got to get computers out of elections.”

	











	Lindell continues, “Did I have an influence on this? That's up to you to decide. Did I sound the alarm every day for four and a half years? Yes, absolutely. I don't need to take any credit; I give God the glory.”


	The close Trump ally and pillow mogul adds: “This is one of the most important days in the history of our country. It's one of the most important things President Donald Trump will ever do. I have been fighting uni-party Republicans on this for years.”

	Whatever Lindell's level of influence on this matter, when he talks, the president at least listens. 


	According to other sources with direct knowledge of the matter, Trump privately tells people that whenever Lindell sees him, he brings up “the machines,” and says that Lindell has been relentless on this matter in ways that nobody else is.

ESPN has dropped Spike Lee‘s forthcoming multi-part documentary series about former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick. The sports network confirmed to Reuters that they will not to broadcast the series, which Lee is directing. 


	“ESPN, Colin Kaepernick, and Spike Lee have collectively decided to no longer proceed with this project as a result of certain creative differences,” ESPN said in a statement to Reuters. “Despite not reaching finality, we appreciate all the hard work and collaboration that went into this film.”


	Lee told Reuters a day earlier that the series was “not coming out.” He confirmed that he is not at liberty to discuss the details, telling the news service on Friday, “I signed a nondisclosure. I can't talk about it.”


	ESPN Films announced a docuseries centered on Kaepernick, who played for the San Francisco 49ers from 2011 to 2016, in 2022. The network said that Lee would weave never-before-seen footage from Kaepernick's archive to provide “a full, first-person account of his journey.” At the time, Kaepernick tweeted, “I'm grateful to be able to work with the legend Spike Lee on my docu-series.” He added, “It's time for the narrative to be corrected.”

	Kaepernick ignited a national debate in 2016 when he knelt during the U.S. national anthem to protest systemic racism and police brutality. He drew significant criticism from Donald Trump, and hasn't played for an NFL team since that season. In 2019, Kaepernick settled a collusion grievance with the league he had filed in 2017. The details of the agreement were not disclosed.

	In September, Puck News reported the series faced delays due disagreements between Kaepernick and Lee over the direction of the film. They added that ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro was open to allowing Lee and producer Jemele Hill in to shop it elsewhere.


	Lee's most recent film, Highest 2 Lowest, arrived in theaters earlier this month. The film reimagines Akira Kurosawa's 1963 effort, High and Low, and stars Denzel Washington, Jeffrey Wright, and A$AP Rocky.

Sarah Jessica Parker hasn't given the haters of her series And Just Like That much thought. The actress, who played Carrie Bradshaw in Sex and the City and its more recent sequel, reflected on the perception of the show in a new interview with The New York Times. 


	 Responding to whether she was aware of how often And Just Like That was described by fans as a “hate watch,” Parker said, “I don't think I have the constitution to have spent a lot of time thinking about that. We always worked incredibly hard to tell stories that were interesting or real. I guess I don't really care. And the reason I don't care is because it has been so enormously successful, and the connections it has made with audiences have been very meaningful.”


And Just Like That reunited the original cast of Sex and the City, minus Kim Cattrall, in 2021. It became HBO Max's most-watched series debut upon release, however the viewership fell over the course of the three seasons. It came to an end last week after showrunner Michael Patrick King announced it would not return for a fourth year. Parker said she was confident in where the story concluded.

	Asked “Why end the show now?,” she replied, “Because that's where the story ended. We could have gone on doing coffee shops. There's a million ways to do it that are easy and familiar and fun, but feel exploitative to us. We felt this was the honorable thing to do. It's very easy to stay. It's where we're all happy. But you have to be principled when you make these very difficult, agonizing decisions because there's a lot of people who are affected.”

	Parker previously told People she doesn't pay attention to the online discourse about the show. “I don't have the constitution for that, because I think you're going to perhaps read things or hear things that don't always feel great,” she said. “When you're part of a community, people are going to have a lot of feelings. And it doesn't mean that a feeling can't change, it's a reaction. We want very much for people to have all those feelings, and it's not for us to police or try to correct them. So I'm a very inexperienced troller or a sneaker around-er, because I think that conversation is better left not in any way witnessed or babysat by me.” 


Rolling Stone wrote of the And Just Like That finale, “It was not an easy happily-ever-after. But it was still a triumph. After 27 years of watching Carrie Bradshaw go through relationship after relationship, ending up not alone, but on her own, it felt like a detente, an uneasy peace with the world of heteronormative relationships… Carrie gave us so much, but never perfection. And I thank her for that.”

Scientists are on high alert as an unidentified object has been detected speeding towards Earth. The nature of this object remains a mystery, but one expert suggests it could be extraterrestrial in origin.

Harvard professor, Professor Loeb, has been outspoken about the potential existence of spaceships in the cosmos, and now speculates that this object could be a ""mothership"". Despite skepticism from other scientists who argue that the object is likely just a comet, Loeb cautions that its appearance might indicate ""technological design"".

The mysterious interstellar visitor has been named 3I/ATLAS by the scientific community. It comes afterStephen Hawking predicted the exact date of the apocalypse - and NASA issued a terrifying warning. 

What we know so far about this unidentified flying object

First spotted on July 1, if the object turns out to be an alien vessel, Loeb estimates that such a craft would arrive on Earth between November 21 and December 5, 2025.

This so-called 'interstellar' object is only the third of its kind ever observed in our solar system. 3I/ATLAS is currently zooming towards the inner solar system at a staggering speed of 135,000 miles per hour.



It's also expected that the object will vanish behind the sun in September, and won't reappear in telescope view until November or December.

Loeb cautions that this might indicate extraterrestrial presence – since the object could simply be evading Earth's detection systems and observational equipment. He stated: ""It could come to save us or to destroy us. We better be prepared for both possibilities and verify that all interstellar objects are just rocks.""

He even proposed this bizarre trajectory – which contradicts the natural flow of the solar system – might represent a ""defensive manoeuvre,"" as though an alien vessel were attempting to dodge a particular path.

The mysterious object will also cruise past Venus, Mars and Jupiter. Loeb theorizes this might even be a spacecraft trying to get a comprehensive view of the other planets in our solar system – potentially to compare them to another.



Although the prevailing hypothesis, as proposed by NASA, suggests the object is a comet, the Harvard professor also indicated there's a weakness in this reasoning.

He was puzzled by the object's absence of a ""tail"". Comets viewed through telescopes display a distinct tail composed of dust.

This specimen, however, lacks one according to the professor.

Most alarmingly, Loeb hinted the spacecraft might even be ""hostile"". He informed the Mail: ""An encounter with an interstellar, alien technology is a blind date of astronomical proportions,"".



""You don't know what you will meet, because our imagination is limited to our experience on Earth.""

He recommended we transmit a message to the potential ET visitors through radio waves. He believed ""peace"" and ""hello neighbour"" would be adequate.

However, he has now reversed course, suggesting this could be seen as a threat to unknown visitors. Loeb drew a parallel to showing a caveman an iPhone – extraterrestrials would be puzzled by Earth due to their superior technology.

But not all experts share his view. Chris Lintott, an astronomer at the University of Oxford, has rejected his assertions, labeling them ""absolute nonsense"".

He told Live Science that the theory about an alien probe is an ""insult to the exciting work that is being done to understand this object"".

Regarding when the object approaches Earth – according to NASA, the object will reach its closest point to the sun the night before Halloween, on October 30. They added that we shouldn't worry, as this is still 130 million miles away.

It comes as scientists predicted the date of Earth's shortest ever day - as the planet's rotation slows down.

Raymond Szymanski, known in the Dexter area for his book Swamp Gas My Ass and presentations on the 1966 “Swamp Gas” UFO sightings in Dexter and Hillsdale, will give a special talk this fall in Ypsilanti.

The internationally acclaimed author will present on paranormal activity at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base at the Ypsilanti Library, Michigan Avenue Branch, on Thursday, September 25, 2025. The event, hosted by the Ypsilanti Paranormal Club, runs from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. at 229 W. Michigan Avenue. No registration is required, and attendees will have the opportunity to purchase books after the talk.

The presentation, entitled “ET, Spirits, & Men in Black: The Spooky Side of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,” will focus on widespread reports of paranormal phenomena and reliable witness testimony to unusual happenings at the base, which has long been linked in UFO lore to crash wreckage and unexplained events.

“This is a very different talk than my normal presentations,” Szymanski said, noting the program's exclusive focus on Wright-Patterson.

International Reach

Szymanski's work has recently gained international attention. Earlier this year, he delivered an invited presentation to a well-known UFO group in Cremona, Italy. As part of ongoing collaboration among UFO researchers, his books are being translated into Italian. The first title, Swamp Gas My Ass (SGMA), is expected to be released in Italian by the end of 2025, with Fifty Shades slated to follow.

Looking Ahead

Szymanski will return to Michigan in March 2026 to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Dexter and Hillsdale “Swamp Gas” UFO events of March 20 and 21, 1966. Those talks will be held at the Dexter District Library on the exact anniversary dates and will feature newly revealed witness testimony never before shared publicly. Registration for those events will open shortly after New Year's Day 2026 on the Dexter Library website.

In an unexpected twist, one of Connecticut's legendary fright stops has a fresh keeper. The Warrens' museum, long famous for their ghost hunts and the haunted Annabelle doll, has been secured by a well-known stand-up comic. The shutters that once barred visitors for zoning reasons are now being raised for a comeback, courting wanderers eager for the peculiar, the eerie, and the lure of dark travel. Early talks have already started ricocheting off social media about how one sells the spectral and preserves haunted lore and how easily the made-up and the lived blur into the same shadow.A Landmark Passed Into New HandsThe historic property in Monroe, Connecticut, was once home to Ed and Lorraine Warren, famed paranormal investigators who founded the New England Society for Psychic Research in 1952. The Warrens curated their Occult Museum within the home, gathering hundreds of artefacts claimed to be linked to supernatural encounters. Among these objects sits the notorious Annabelle doll, which inspired Hollywood's The Conjuring franchise.Advertisement  Ownership of the artefacts has not changed hands, as they remain under the care of the Warrens' heirs. However, legal guardianship of the home and its operations has been transferred for at least the next five years. With this change, visitors are expected to soon have access to guided tours and overnight stays at a site that blends both local history and pop culture allure.According to town zoning records, the museum had previously been closed in 2019 due to complaints from neighbours regarding traffic and noise. Reopening under new management requires careful adherence to Monroe's planning and zoning regulations, ensuring that the attraction does not disrupt the surrounding community.Plans for TravelersThe new guardianship has paved the way for immersive tourism experiences. Museum tours are expected to showcase haunted relics, retell stories made famous by the Warrens, and offer visitors the rare chance to spend the night inside the historic home. These overnight packages will allow dark tourism enthusiasts to immerse themselves in the paranormal environment while reflecting on its significance in American horror folklore.By opening the site again, Monroe could see an increase in visitors drawn by the Warrens' enduring legacy. The attraction would join a list of other nationally known haunted destinations, such as the Lizzie Borden House in Massachusetts and the Villisca Axe Murder House in Iowa. US Ghost Adventures, one of the leading companies in dark tourism, has described similar attractions as both entertaining and educational, providing context to stories that mix legend with historical truth.The Annabelle Doll's ShadowAmong the museum's collection, the Annabelle doll has long been the main draw. Unlike the porcelain figure depicted in Hollywood, the real Annabelle is an ordinary Raggedy Ann doll locked inside a glass case. Believers claim it carries a dangerous presence, and paranormal lore warns that those who mock or disrespect it could face misfortune.While its notoriety has been amplified by the success of The Conjuring films, experts have stressed the need to separate movie fiction from historical record. Government archives confirm that the Warrens' early investigations were never scientifically verified, and sceptics argue that their stories were dramatised to fuel interest.Despite scepticism, Annabelle continues to intrigue travellers. Her reputation alone is enough to transform the museum into a magnet for visitors seeking spine-chilling tales, regardless of whether they believe in the supernatural.Warnings and ControversyNot all reactions to the new guardianship have been positive. Members of the paranormal community, including the Warrens' grandson, have voiced concerns that reopening the museum could pose risks. They argue that the artefacts were never meant for public entertainment but rather for careful study in a controlled environment.Recent tragedies have added weight to these warnings. The death of a paranormal investigator earlier this year, while unrelated to Annabelle, was linked by some believers to the doll's supposed curse. Experts, however, dismiss such connections as coincidences, cautioning against sensationalising tragedy.Town officials in Monroe have also expressed the need for strict oversight. With the property located in a residential neighbourhood, any renewed public operation must comply with safety, traffic, and zoning requirements to avoid repeating past conflicts.Separating Fiction from RealityDark tourism thrives on the tension between legend and fact. Attractions like the Warrens' museum tap into public fascination with death, mystery, and the unexplained. While stories about cursed objects and restless spirits may lack scientific proof, they provide cultural insight into how communities interpret fear and mortality.Tourism experts stress that the Annabelle doll, the Warrens' cases, and similar stories are best approached as folklore enriched by pop culture. These narratives, while not grounded in verified fact, help preserve an alternative layer of American history—one shaped by superstition, religious belief, and the human need to explain the unknown.For many travellers, this blend of entertainment and history is precisely what makes such attractions compelling. The Warrens' legacy, fictionalised in blockbuster films, continues to draw curiosity and ensures that their Monroe home remains one of New England's most iconic sites.A Revival of Dark Tourism in ConnecticutThe reopening of the Warrens' home and museum is poised to revitalise paranormal tourism in Connecticut. Visitors will be able to engage with artefacts tied to famous cases, tour a home that once housed two of America's most well-known ghost hunters, and perhaps spend a night in an atmosphere steeped in legend.While sceptics dismiss the paranormal elements as fiction, the cultural and historical value of the site cannot be ignored. It reflects the ways in which myth becomes woven into local history, transforming ordinary spaces into landmarks of intrigue.For those planning a visit, the museum represents more than just entertainment. It is an opportunity to reflect on the boundary between storytelling and truth while experiencing firsthand the eerie allure of one of America's most talked-about paranormal collections.ConclusionAs Connecticut gets ready to let visitors step again into the Warrens' story, one thing stands out: the appetite for haunted history hasn't faded. Whether you walk the halls as a dyed-in-the-wool believer or a cautious onlooker, the Warrens' house invites you to wander the border where folklore meets tourism and, furthermore, meets the slow unfolding of cultural memory.Interest in dark tourism keeps rising, and with the reopening of this museum, Monroe is poised to once again stake its claim as an essential stop for travellers fascinated by the eerie and the enigmatic.[Image Source: New England Society For Psychic Research (NESPR) Official Website]Advertisement  Share On:Tags: Annabelle doll travel, Haunted house overnight stays, Haunted Warrens Museum Connecticut, Paranormal tourism Monroe CTSubscribe to our NewslettersFollow Travel And Tour World in Google News

While its notoriety has been amplified by the success of The Conjuring films, experts have stressed the need to separate movie fiction from historical record. Government archives confirm that the Warrens' early investigations were never scientifically verified, and sceptics argue that their stories were dramatised to fuel interest.Despite scepticism, Annabelle continues to intrigue travellers. Her reputation alone is enough to transform the museum into a magnet for visitors seeking spine-chilling tales, regardless of whether they believe in the supernatural.Warnings and ControversyNot all reactions to the new guardianship have been positive. Members of the paranormal community, including the Warrens' grandson, have voiced concerns that reopening the museum could pose risks. They argue that the artefacts were never meant for public entertainment but rather for careful study in a controlled environment.Recent tragedies have added weight to these warnings. The death of a paranormal investigator earlier this year, while unrelated to Annabelle, was linked by some believers to the doll's supposed curse. Experts, however, dismiss such connections as coincidences, cautioning against sensationalising tragedy.Town officials in Monroe have also expressed the need for strict oversight. With the property located in a residential neighbourhood, any renewed public operation must comply with safety, traffic, and zoning requirements to avoid repeating past conflicts.Separating Fiction from RealityDark tourism thrives on the tension between legend and fact.

Scientists are on high alert as an unidentified object has been detected speeding towards Earth. The nature of this object remains a mystery, but one expert suggests it could be extraterrestrial in origin.

Harvard professor, Professor Loeb, has been outspoken about the potential existence of spaceships in the cosmos, and now speculates that this object could be a ""mothership"". Despite skepticism from other scientists who argue that the object is likely just a comet, Loeb cautions that its appearance might indicate ""technological design"".

The mysterious interstellar visitor has been named 3I/ATLAS by the scientific community. It comes afterStephen Hawking predicted the exact date of the apocalypse - and NASA issued a terrifying warning. 

What we know so far about this unidentified flying object

First spotted on July 1, if the object turns out to be an alien vessel, Loeb estimates that such a craft would arrive on Earth between November 21 and December 5, 2025.

This so-called 'interstellar' object is only the third of its kind ever observed in our solar system. 3I/ATLAS is currently zooming towards the inner solar system at a staggering speed of 135,000 miles per hour.



It's also expected that the object will vanish behind the sun in September, and won't reappear in telescope view until November or December.

Loeb cautions that this might indicate extraterrestrial presence – since the object could simply be evading Earth's detection systems and observational equipment. He stated: ""It could come to save us or to destroy us. We better be prepared for both possibilities and verify that all interstellar objects are just rocks.""

He even proposed this bizarre trajectory – which contradicts the natural flow of the solar system – might represent a ""defensive manoeuvre,"" as though an alien vessel were attempting to dodge a particular path.

The mysterious object will also cruise past Venus, Mars and Jupiter. Loeb theorizes this might even be a spacecraft trying to get a comprehensive view of the other planets in our solar system – potentially to compare them to another.



Although the prevailing hypothesis, as proposed by NASA, suggests the object is a comet, the Harvard professor also indicated there's a weakness in this reasoning.

He was puzzled by the object's absence of a ""tail"". Comets viewed through telescopes display a distinct tail composed of dust.

This specimen, however, lacks one according to the professor.

Most alarmingly, Loeb hinted the spacecraft might even be ""hostile"". He informed the Mail: ""An encounter with an interstellar, alien technology is a blind date of astronomical proportions,"".



""You don't know what you will meet, because our imagination is limited to our experience on Earth.""

He recommended we transmit a message to the potential ET visitors through radio waves. He believed ""peace"" and ""hello neighbour"" would be adequate.

However, he has now reversed course, suggesting this could be seen as a threat to unknown visitors. Loeb drew a parallel to showing a caveman an iPhone – extraterrestrials would be puzzled by Earth due to their superior technology.

But not all experts share his view. Chris Lintott, an astronomer at the University of Oxford, has rejected his assertions, labeling them ""absolute nonsense"".

He told Live Science that the theory about an alien probe is an ""insult to the exciting work that is being done to understand this object"".

Regarding when the object approaches Earth – according to NASA, the object will reach its closest point to the sun the night before Halloween, on October 30. They added that we shouldn't worry, as this is still 130 million miles away.

It comes as scientists predicted the date of Earth's shortest ever day - as the planet's rotation slows down.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","Jared Padalecki's Canceled Supernatural Replacement Deserved So Much Better","https://screenrant.com/walker-jared-padalecki-canceled-show-deserved-better/","Mon, 18 Aug 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

One of the most iconic contemporary fantasy TV shows, Supernatural, was a star-maker for Jared Padalecki, but his replacement series deserves recognition as well. Padalecki was a huge part of what made Supernatural work, and his chemistry and brotherly relationship with his co-star, Jensen Ackles, kept fans on the edge of their seats for all fifteen seasons, from 2005 to 2020.

Jared Padalecki still talks about Sam's Supernatural storylines and his experience on the hit fantasy show, as interest in the series hasn't faded in the years since it went off the air. However, this doesn't mean that Padalecki hasn't been busy since Supernatural ended, taking on interesting new roles and proving that he can be more than Sam Winchester, tackling characters who are completely different.

Based on the 1993 TV show Walker, Texas Ranger, Padalecki led the cast of the recent reimagining of the show, Walker, which aired on the CW from 2021 to 2024. Premiering only a year after Supernatural finally came to an end, and on the same network, it was clear that Walker was intended to be Padalecki's next long-running series, though this didn't turn out to be the case. 

 Both Padalecki and Ackles have ventured into new genres, trying to move past the pull of Supernatural and cement themselves as actors to watch in the TV space outside fantasy. In Walker, Padalecki plays Cordell Walker, the protagonist and Texas Ranger who has to readjust to normal life and investigations after spending several years undercover, away from his family. 

While the interest in and popularity of the original series helped bolster Walker in its early years, there were certain aspects of the series that didn't live up to our expectations. The formulaic, episodic structure of Walker worked in the 1990s and early 2000s, but television is now inundated with similar projects, and Walker didn't set itself apart from the many works that engage with comparable themes.

When Walker season 5 was canceled, it didn't come as a shock to most viewers, as Walker had been losing steam in the later years, failing to justify its continued existence. While the premise of the show and the cast of characters were compelling, Walker never had the longevity and influence of a series like Supernatural, which has never struggled to stand the test of time.

There are doubtlessly problems with Walker, but the negative reception that the series received from day one wasn't fair. Padalecki still brings his characteristic charm and dramatic weight to the character of Walker, and the performances weren't where the series struggled. It didn't help that there are so many reboots and revivals on TV today that Walker premiered to plenty of preconceived notions about the quality of the series. 

Outside the reviews and negative reactions that plagued Walker throughout its run, the series could've taken itself more seriously from the start. While Walker was never going to be a prestige drama, the writing sometimes came off as lazy and predictable, and Padalecki's series deserved better than this. 

Padalecki will appear in The Boys season 5, and fans of both the subversive superhero series and Supernatural are thrilled about the upcoming role. The actor will be reunited with Ackles and Mischa Collins in The Boys, which will appeal to fans of both shows and give Padalecki a memorable guest spot. His other recent guest appearance on Fire Country also helped to remind audiences of Padalecki's skill. 

However, what fans and critics really want from Padalecki is a full-time series that he gets to lead as a protagonist, that stays on the air for as long as Supernatural. While few shows have the ability to remain popular for fifteen seasons, Padalecki has already proved he can commit to a project like this, and we're hoping that he'll have the chance to return to TV soon.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Psychic","A Pet Psychic, My Weird Little Maltipoo, and Myself","https://www.vogue.com/article/pet-psychic-dogue-2025","Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:00:00 GMT","

If you'd told me five years ago that I'd be spending a sunny Los Angeles afternoon on Zoom with a pet psychic while Franklin, my one-and-a-half-year-old Maltipoo puppy, contentedly chewed a carrot toy on my lap, it's safe to say that I wouldn't have believed you.

With the exception of a forgettable trio of fish and a hamster I inexplicably named Shaquille who was not long for this world, I didn't grow up with pets. My childhood pleas for a puppy were unsuccessful; ultimately, my mom and dad were right that said puppy's care would have 100% fallen on them. Later on, as my friends brought home bodega kittens in their backpacks, or put down roots and became dog moms and dads, I happily visited or dogsat. But I didn't feel quite ready to take the plunge myself.

I was 31 when that changed, and my partner Rax and I brought home a little white dog named Franklin. We'd been talking about it for years: Rax grew up with a little white dog of the extra-crusty variety, and I, not having much dog experience myself, glommed onto his dream. But it all became real when we visited the home of his foster parents, Tiff and Bob, and Frank jumped into my arms, pawing at me with a Little Orphan Annie intensity that we'd soon come to learn was unusual for him. (He's not a huge fan of new people, as he'll readily demonstrate with low-pitched yet consistent growls.) But the sweetness he showed to me and Rax that day was all the proof we needed that he (and his little green dog bed shaped like a frog) should be ours.

We've now had Frank (sometimes Franklin, never Frankie) for almost a year—his generic leather collar long since replaced by a beaded Susan Alexandra one from my best friend, Jazmine—and in that time I've managed to become the kind of person who desperately, urgently needs to know if my dog is happy with the life I've given him. (I also get my tarot read and regularly spend $20 a pop on Erewhon juices, but what can I say? Los Angeles will change you, if you let it.) So when the opportunity arose to take Frank to a pet psychic and call it a work expense (!), I instantly sought out the advice of Jennifer Moore of DearHuman.Pet, an LA-based animal communicator and retired psychotherapist whose warm, attentive vibe seemed just right for drawing out the hairy (or furry?) details of Franklin's past.

The thing about adopting a dog is that most of the time, you never learn much about their origins. We knew Frank had been attentively cared for by Tiff and his prior foster mom, Jeanie, who turned him from a shellshocked rescue into the loving and lovable dog we know now more or less singlehandedly. But we didn't know precisely where all that original anxiety came from. Given I was delving deep into my own psyche in therapy every week, I reasoned, wasn't it worth spending an hour and $200 of reimbursable money to do the same for Frank?

“Just like you and your partner were dreaming of a small white dog named Frank, he was dreaming of you,” Moore remarked early in our reading. Immediately, the cynic in me that questioned the very concept of “animal communication” quieted down a bit. If she could see that Frank was destined to be with us, then why shouldn't I trust her?

Moore went on to say that Frank was “very intelligent” (well, yes! Every expensive trainer we've hired to work with him has said so!), and had “a lot to learn” from Rax and me, specifically about interacting with strangers (we like to do it, he doesn't, ear-splitting barks often ensue).

Then, she said something that caught me a little off-guard: “Franklin feels safe, but he's guarded.” Just a few hours earlier, my own therapist had said more or less the same thing about me: “Even though you're in a part of your life that feels secure and stable, it's normal to keep walls up from your past from when you needed them more.”

I promptly became verklempt at the notion of my Maltipoo and me healing our attachment issues and emotional wounds together—only to dissolve into a flood of tears when Moore asked my permission to share some of the rougher aspects of Frank's early life. (I'll keep those private, in the off chance that my dog wants to follow in his mother's footsteps and write a memoir someday, but suffice it to say that he's more than earned his trust issues.)

If I had to summarize where Frank's story and the one that I'm still learning about myself most overlap, I would do so with one word: shame. “I want to reassure him that there's nothing he could say right now that would endanger him, and he doesn't need to carry shame about anything that might have gone on in his earlier life because none of it is his fault,” Moore told me as she communicated with Frank (who, weirdly, did seem to know something was going on, even over Zoom: as the two of them allegedly spoke without words, he let me pet his stomach, which he never does).

I know this is all sounding very The Body Keeps The Score: Dog Edition, but it was instantly striking to me how Moore's comment about shame mirrored a recurring trend in my own therapy sessions. I'm good—no, great—at listening to the more difficult details of my friends' lives, and encouraging them to show grace to themselves and the ways they've adapted to deal with pain. But as I've learned from almost 10 full years of regular therapy, I am very, very bad at sitting with anything that's ever gone wrong in my life without blaming myself first. Seeing that pattern repeated in my silly little puppy made me feel a tenderness not only for him, but for his dog mom, too. (Yes, I now fully own a term I once quietly derided, to the point that the back of my iPhone case reads Frank's Mom in applique beads.)

Even with the benefit of a pet psychic, I may never know the details of what makes my fuzzy, crusty, beautiful nightmare of an eight-pound dog bark at strangers, flinch from loud noises, and cry like we're bidding him adieu forever when we drop him at his dogsitter's house for a night. Maybe that's okay, though. I don't need to know every little thing about Frank—or about myself, for that matter—to take excellent care of us both.

Self-proclaimed medium and psychic Sylvia Browne has gone viral after some of her shockingly bad predictions resurfaced online. The TV personality died in 2013 at 77 years old, but her impact and many wildly incorrect predictions are still debated to this day.

Browne rose to prominence in the 1990s, regularly appearing on the television shows Larry King Live, The Montel Williams Show, and That's Incredible!, as well as the late-night radio talk show Coast to Coast AM, where she'd offer her premonitions and take live calls from members of the public looking for her advice.

As noted by The Daily Mail, Browne went viral during the COVID-19 pandemic when people rediscovered an eerie prediction she made in her 2004 book End of Days. The quote, shared by the likes of Kim Kardashian, read, “In around 2020, a severe pneumonia-like illness will spread throughout the globe, attacking the lungs and the bronchial tubes and resisting all known treatments.”

While some pointed to this as evidence of Browne's prophetic skills, others referred to the many other incidents where the TV psychic had made completely wrong and, often, dangerously insensitive, predictions, including several to the families of missing people.

One infamous prediction happened during a 2004 appearance on The Montel Williams Show, when Browne told Louwanna Miller that her missing daughter, Amanda Berry, was “not alive,” explaining to the distraught mother, “Your daughter's not the kind who wouldn't call.”

Berry was found alive in 2013 after she escaped years of captivity by Ariel Castro. Unfortunately, Miller had passed away in 2005, believing Browne “98 per cent” that her daughter was dead. The medium later defended her incorrect prediction, saying, “Only God is right all the time.”



That wasn't the first time Browne had shared wildly wrong predictions with the families of missing children. In an earlier Montel Williams appearance in 1999, she told the grandmother of a six-year-old kidnap victim that her granddaughter was “not dead,” adding that she was taken into “some kind of a slavery thing” in “Kukouro” in Japan.

There is no such place as Kokouro, Japan, and the girl's remains were later discovered in Texas. A pathologist found that she was killed on the night of the abduction.

This happened again in 2002 when Browne told the mother of a missing woman that her daughter was in Hollywood working as a stripper. Her death was confirmed four years later based on dental records from human remains found in San Diego in 1996.

The following year, Brown told the parents of a missing 11-year-old boy that their son was dead after being kidnapped by a “dark-skinned man who had dreadlocks.” The victim was later found alive in 2007 in the apartment of a white man with short hair.



To this day, social media users still talk about Browne and her controversial career. “Special place in hell for people who exploit traumas of others for their own personal gain,” wrote one X user on Sunday (August 17). “Sad how many desperate parents would turn to her & give her evil CON any level of merit by believing her lies. Vile woman. ZERO shock the Kardashians endorsed her.”

“Sylvia Browne was basically clickbait in human form,” said another.

“Yall remember that psychic, Sylvia Browne? she used to be on Montel Williams all the time.. dont ask me what just made me think of her phony ass.. it was a random thought. such a shame that she was scamming all those people,” another added.

One X user wrote, “I just want to know why Montel Williams kept bringing that lying a** b***h Sylvia Browne on his show, just telling them people anything.”

“Sylvia Browne is a fraud she is nothing but a charlatan selling bs,” another added.

 

‘I don't mind going outside my comfort zone, but this was another level,' says Hemsworth of the high-stakes series, which sees him in pursuit of methods for a longer life.

President Donald Trump baffled social media users on Sunday morning by sharing just one word on his Truth Social platform, reigniting the amusing ""covfefe"" conversation from 2017 and generating fresh conspiracy theories regarding the Russia-Ukraine war.

At 8:31 a.m., Trump published the word ""bela."" Given that he's not recognised for employing Italian expressions, it seemed improbable that Trump meant to write ""bella"" with double L's, signifying ""beautiful.""

California Governor Gavin Newsom's press team seized the moment to declare triumph over Trump, with whom he's been engaged in an ongoing social media rivalry in recent weeks, stating: ""We broke Donald Trump.""

The message, whilst probably an error, swiftly prompted some theorists to share extensive rants about possible concealed meanings behind the post concerning Belarus and the Eastern European country's supposed crucial part in the current peace talks between the U.S., Russia and Ukraine.

Back in 2017, Trump shared the word ""covfefe"" on Twitter, mystifying commentators and social media users whilst sparking numerous memes and jokes targeting the president's mental sharpness. On Sunday morning, his ""bela"" message produced a comparable result.

Trump detractor George Conway suggested that ""bela"" was a ""blend"" of ""covfefe.""

The Lincoln Project, a conservative organisation frequently critical of Trump, declared that Trump had unleashed the latest ""covfefe.""

While many found amusement in the post, others interpreted it as a cryptic message with profound implications for the president's trump card in his largely unsuccessful mediation between Russia and Ukraine, reports the Irish Star.

""TRUMP JUST POSTED 'BELA,'"" one X user penned. ""It's NOT random. It's NOT a typo. It's NOT 'covfefe 2.0.' This is Trump sending coded comms.""

They went on to explain that ""Bela"" represents Belarus, described as ""the hinge between NATO and Russia.""

The user delved into theories about Belarus being a ""key"" to the nations' ""path to peace,"" the supposed biblical significance of the word ""bela,"" and its potential connection to chess rules.

Another user responded: ""In Eastern Europe, Bela is a card game where you shout it when you play the King and Queen of trumps together. It's the strongest pair, and you only get the points if you announce it out loud.

They said: ""That timing matters. He posted it right after Putin briefed Belarus's Lukashenko on their summit. If symbolic, it could mean a new power alliance being put on the table,"" they said.""

Trump, who promised during his 2024 campaign that he would resolve the Ukraine-Russia conflict on Day 1 of his presidency, has made scant progress towards achieving peace.

Putin seemed to disregard Trump's recent threats of imposing harsh sanctions on Russia unless steps were taken towards a ceasefire, continuing to attack Ukrainian troops on Friday night following their meeting in Alaska.

Trump and Vice President JD Vance are set to meet with Zelensky at the White House on Monday, following their previous encounter which saw a heated and embarrassing exchange inside the Oval Office.

THE DECODER

Artificial Intelligence: News, Business, Research

A research team at the University of Oxford set out to make language models sound warmer and more empathetic, but ran into some unexpected side effects.

The researchers tested five different language models of varying sizes and architectures: Llama-8B, Mistral-Small, Qwen-32B, Llama-70B, and GPT-4o. They used a dataset of 1,617 conversations and 3,667 human-LLM message pairs, all biased toward warmer, more empathetic responses. During training, they rewrote original model answers into friendlier versions while keeping the substance the same.

The models trained for warmth consistently made more mistakes than the originals, with error rates jumping anywhere from 10 to 30 percent. The warmer models were more likely to reinforce conspiracy theories, repeat false information, and give questionable medical advice.

The researchers tested four areas: factual knowledge, resistance to misinformation, susceptibility to conspiracy theories, and medical knowledge. The original models had error rates between 4 and 35 percent, but the ""warmer"" versions saw those rates rise by an average of 7.43 percent.

This pattern held true for every architecture and model size the team tested. The researchers called it ""a systematic rather than model-specific phenomenon.""

There was another side effect: the warmer models became much more likely to agree with users, even when the users were wrong. The study found that these models affirmed false beliefs about 40 percent more often than the original models.

This tendency was especially strong when users expressed emotions. For emotionally charged questions, warmer models made 12.1 percent more mistakes, compared to 6.8 percent for more neutral queries.

The effect was most dramatic when users showed sadness; in those cases, the reliability gap between warmer and original models nearly doubled to 11.9 percent. When users expressed admiration instead, the gap shrank to 5.23 percent.

To check their results, the team ran control tests using general knowledge and math benchmarks, as well as safety tasks. Here, the warmer models performed about the same as the originals. The ""training for warmth"" didn't make the models less intelligent—their basic knowledge and reasoning skills stayed intact.

The researchers also tried training two models in the opposite direction, making them respond in a ""colder,"" less empathetic style. These versions proved at least as reliable, and sometimes even improved by up to 13 percent. Even simple system prompts nudging models toward warmth produced similar, though smaller and less consistent, effects compared to full fine-tuning.

The team says these findings matter for building and governing human-like AI systems. They reveal a fundamental trade-off: optimizing for one positive trait can undermine another.

Current evaluation practices, the researchers argue, might miss risks like these, since standard benchmarks don't pick up on them. They call for new development and oversight frameworks as AI systems become more involved in everyday life.

The debate over warm vs. cold LLM behavior isn't just theoretical. In April, OpenAI rolled back a GPT-4o update because it flattered users too much and encouraged problematic behavior. When OpenAI later released GPT-5, it was criticized for being too ""cold"" compared to the ""warmer"" GPT-4o. After user backlash, the company tweaked GPT-5 to sound friendlier. But as this study suggests, those changes may come at the cost of reliability.

            Former Attorney General Bill Barr arrived on Capitol Hill on Monday for a deposition by the House Oversight Committee about matters related to Jeffrey Epstein, the first of 10 high-profile Democratic and Republican witnesses subpoenaed by the committee to testify on the case.
    


            The move by the panel comes as the case has roiled the House – with many Republicans calling for more transparency and the release of records related to the matter. The committee has also issued a subpoena to the Justice Department calling for it to provide Congress any Epstein files in its possession, with victims' names redacted. Barr's appearance comes one day before the DOJ is supposed to turn over those records to the committee.
    


            But the committee chairman, Rep. James Comer, told reporters when he arrived that he does not expect the DOJ to meet that deadline because the department is still trying to compile the records. He said he expects to get them “very soon.”
    


            “You can imagine, how many documents there are. I think we'll receive the documents very soon,” the Kentucky Republican said. “They're compiling everything together. I think we're working together in a good-faith effort and everything's coming along.”
    


            Barr served in the top job at the Department of Justice during President Donald Trump's first term and was in the role when Epstein died by suicide while awaiting trial on federal charges accusing him of sexually abusing underage girls. Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell at New York's Metropolitan Correctional Center, a federal detention facility.
    


            Barr did not speak to reporters as he arrived about an hour earlier than when he was scheduled to begin his deposition.
    


            Shortly after Epstein's death, Barr said that he was “appalled” and “angry” to learn of the Metropolitan Correctional Center's “failure to adequately secure this prisoner,” and announced that the FBI and the Justice Department's internal watchdog would investigate Epstein's death.
    


            In 2023, the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General issued a scathing rebuke of the Bureau of Prisons detailing multiple failures that led to Epstein's death but found no evidence to contradict the “absence of criminality” in his death.
    


            House Speaker Mike Johnson took steps to delay until September a vote of the full House to publicly release the DOJ's Epstein files. The Louisiana has said he supports transparency in the case but wants to give the administration room to handle the matter.
    


            The Republican-led panel additionally subpoenaed nine other individuals for private depositions between August and mid-October. Those are: former Attorneys General Merrick Garland, Jeff Sessions, Loretta Lynch, Eric Holder and Alberto Gonzales; former FBI Director James Comey; former special counsel and FBI Director Robert Mueller III; former Secretary of State and first lady Hillary Clinton; and former President Bill Clinton.

Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky has rebuffed a proposed peace framework outlined by US President Donald Trump just hours before their White House meeting on Monday.

Trump wrote on Sunday that Zelensky “can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight.” He added that a settlement would require “no getting back… Crimea” and “no going into NATO by Ukraine.”

About ninety minutes later, Zelensky responded on X, making clear that “not Ukraine, but Russia must end this war, which it itself started. And I hope that our joint strength with America, with our European friends, will force Russia into a real peace.”

Zelensky then declared that “I am confident that we will defend Ukraine.”

“Of course, Crimea should not have been given up then, just as Ukrainians did not give up Kiev, Odessa, or Kharkov after 2022,” he added.

Crimea officially became part of Russia in 2014 after the peninsula's population overwhelmingly supported the move in a referendum while Kiev prosecuted a war against its own eastern regions.

Despite refusing to make concessions, the Ukrainian leader thanked Trump for the “invite” to the White House and insisted that he and the US president “share a strong desire to end this war quickly and reliably.”

Zelensky is coming to Washington following Friday's summit in Alaska between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump, at which both leaders underlined their commitment to resolving the Ukraine conflict.

Putin reiterated after the talks that eliminating the underlying causes of the fighting is the key to any settlement. According to the Russian side, for lasting peace to be achieved, Ukraine should renounce its aspiration for NATO membership, demilitarize, and recognize the current territorial realities; including the status of Crimea, as well as of Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson and Zaporozhye regions, the latter four of which voted to join Russia in 2022.

US President Donald Trump has outlined terms for a peace deal between Kiev and Moscow that would require Ukraine to abandon its NATO ambitions and accept Crimea as part of Russia.

The announcement came on Truth Social on Sunday, two days after Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, where both reaffirmed their commitment to resolving the Ukraine conflict. Trump is meeting Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky and senior European leaders in Washington on Monday.

Trump wrote that Zelensky “can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight.” A settlement, he added, would require “no getting back... Crimea” and “no going into NATO by Ukraine.” 

Crimea became part of Russia in 2014 after the peninsula's population overwhelmingly supported the move in a referendum while Kiev prosecuted a war against its own eastern regions.

Moscow insists that a lasting settlement would require Kiev to renounce its desire for NATO membership, demilitarize, and recognize the new territorial reality on the ground, including the status of Crimea, Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson, and Zaporozhye Regions, all of which have voted to become parts of Russia.

Zelensky has consistently rejected territorial concessions. He wrote after Trump's post on X that it was “Russia [that] must end this war, which it itself started,” adding that “Crimea should not have been given up then.”

This is Zelensky's first White House visit since a stormy February encounter with Trump and US Vice President J.D. Vance. He will be joined by European leaders, including France's Emmanuel Macron, Germany's Friedrich Merz, Britain's Keir Starmer, and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen.

Trump has indicated that if Monday's talks succeed he will push for a trilateral summit with Putin and Zelensky as early as Friday.

Putin has not ruled out direct talks with Zelensky, but stressed that they must be preceded by significant progress toward a settlement.

Moscow has voiced concerns about Zelensky's right to sign any binding agreement, given that his presidential term expired last year and that he has refused to call a new election, citing martial law.

MOSCOW, August 18. /TASS/. Kiev's yet another attempt to launch a terrorist attack on the Crimean Bridge was aimed at sabotaging talks on resolving the Ukraine conflict, Rodion Miroshnik, the Russian Foreign Ministry's ambassador-at-large in charge of overseeing the Kiev regime's crimes, stated.

""Against the backdrop of the emerging negotiation process, a new attempt [was made] by Ukraine and its allies to carry out a terrorist attack as a provocation to disrupt the talks and the search for a peaceful resolution,"" the diplomat wrote on his Telegram channel.

Earlier, Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) reported preventing an attempt by Ukrainian special services to stage a terrorist attack on the Crimean Bridge. A Chevrolet Volt with a powerful improvised explosive device inside was traced and the bomb was defused.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

BRUSSELS, August 18. /TASS/. European leaders are heading to Washington in an attempt to prevent US President Donald Trump from increasing pressure on Vladimir Zelensky and putting forth new demands on Ukraine on the peace settlement following talks between the US leader and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, Politico said, citing European diplomats.

Diplomats told Politico that ""they expected European leaders to accompany Zelensky in a bid to ensure key red lines are not crossed, and that Ukraine is not forced against its will to give up territory to secure a deal.""

The diplomats noted that Europe's security is the biggest concern. According to the sources, the European leaders want to see firm security guarantees as the result of the talks. ""This is the first time that the US has been explicit in backing guarantees and this enables a corner to be turned on any possible deal,"" one European diplomat said. ""The president needs to be clear with Zelensky that the US is committed to guarantees and then work on specifying what they are signing up to,"" he added.

The diplomatic sources noted that the trip was initiated by Finland's President Alexander Stubb and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni will also join Zelensky in Washington for the meeting with the American leader.

Following the meeting with Putin in Alaska on August 15, Trump held a phone conversation with Zelensky as well as with the leaders of the UK, Germany, Italy, Poland, Finland and France, the NATO secretary general and the head of the European Commission. Later, Zelensky said that he is going to discuss the details of ending the conflict with Trump in Washington on Monday.

On August 15, a summit between Russia and the US took place at a military base in Alaska. The talks lasted more than three hours and included several formats: one-on-one in the American leader's limousine en route to the main venue and in a small group of ""three on three."" The Russian delegation included Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, while the US delegation included Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff. Following the talks, Putin told the press that the settlement of the Ukrainian conflict was the main topic of the summit. The Russian leader also called for a new beginning in bilateral relations and a return to cooperation. He invited Trump to Moscow. For his part, the US president announced the progress achieved in the talks but noted that the two sides had not reached an agreement on everything.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Experts are enthusiastic about poverty reductions achieved under former Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador

Toothless and frail, Gloria Palacios, 84, stooped as she set up her rickety sidewalk shop in Mexico City's roughshod Doctores neighborhood. On sale: peanuts, cigarettes, chewing gum, chocolates and chips.

When asked how much she made in a day, Palacios's disabled son Gustavo, who helps run the tiny store, simply laughed. “If we make 100 pesos ($5) it's a lot,” he said. Happily, said Palacios, the family has a different lifeline.

With their house crumbling and bills piling up, the only thing keeping them afloat is a bimonthly transfer of 6,200 pesos ($330) implemented by the government of previous president Andrés Manuel López Obrador for adults over 65.

“God bless López Obrador,” said Palacios. “Without him what would we do? I think we wouldn't even have enough to eat.”

Palacios is one of millions of people across Mexico who have benefited from the welfare policies of López Obrador, or Amlo as he's commonly known. And now, thanks to a report released last week by the country's national statistics agency, we know just how effective those policies were.

When Amlo took office in 2018, there were nearly 52 million people living below the poverty line: by the time he left office six years later, that number had dropped by 13.4 million, a decrease of almost 26%. Extreme poverty also dropped from nearly 9 million people to just 7 million.

In a country that has long suffered from deep inequality and struggled with economic precarity, the steep drop in the number of people living in poverty is a remarkable achievement and suggests Amlo's policies had a measurable impact on the lives of millions of everyday Mexicans.

“It's something extraordinary, historic, the reduction [of poverty],” said Amlo's successor and ally Claudia Sheinbaum during a news conference on Thursday. “‘For the good of all – first the poor' is not just a slogan, but a reality in Mexico.”

Some independent Mexican analysts have been equally enthusiastic about the poverty reductions achieved under Amlo.

“There has never been a single six-year term in which poverty has been reduced or decreased so significantly,” said Viri Ríos, a public policy expert and director of Mexico Decoded. “This is a watershed moment for the Mexican economy.”

Amlo was elected in a 2018 landslide with a promise to eradicate corruption and tackle inequality. Among the legacies of his administration were the tripling of the minimum wage from 88.40 pesos ($4.75) per day when he took office to the current rate of 278.80 pesos ($15) a day.

This had a knock-on effect on other sectors of the economy, according to Valeria Moy, a Mexican economist and director general of IMCO, a public policy thinktank.

“When the minimum wage increases, other wages and incomes in the economy begin to rise – even in the informal economy – because there is a greater availability of resources,” she said. “I don't know if the [poverty reduction] was purely because of López Obrador's policies, but I do think the push in the minimum wage moved the rest.”

Ríos was more emphatic.

“We're talking about a labor market that had a minimum wage well below the standard of living,” she said. “And now it's reached a level that allows 13.4 million families to escape poverty. It's a historic achievement.”

Amlo also transformed the social welfare system, implementing a system of cash transfers for elderly people, like Palacios, for young people doing apprenticeships and for farmers planting fruit trees, among others. He then doubled the amount spent on these transfers.

The universal cash transfer system, which replaced a well-regarded conditional system for the poorest fifth of households requiring children to go to school and families to attend health check-ups, has received some criticism as it meant that, in the case of the pension system for example, anyone, even well-off Mexicans over 65, were entitled to a transfer.

“We lost focus and lost the ability to give to the poorest,” said Gonzalo Hernández Licona, the former head of the National Council for the Evaluation of Social Development Policy (CONEVAL), a now defunct agency which used to measure poverty before the task was transferred to the statistics institute. “While the amount has grown, the way the amount is distributed has worsened.”

This might help explain why the 19% reduction in extreme poverty was much lower than the nearly 26% reduction in overall poverty. Many of the poorest Mexicans live in remote rural places, where accessing social welfare is hard if not impossible.

“The big problem [with the cash transfers] is not that they're universal,” said Ríos. “The big problem is that the Mexican government has not made an effort to make it truly universal – that is, to make it reach everyone.”

Meanwhile, the report from the statistics agency also revealed other glaring issues under Amlo's government: while access to food security, social security and dignified living conditions all increased, the number of people without access to health services more than doubled, from 20.1 million people in 2018 to more than 44 million in 2024.

“I think the great debt that the Mexican state still owes its people is improving access to healthcare,” said Ríos. “As a percentage of GDP, our spending on health is similar to countries in sub-Saharan Africa.”

Palacios, who has considerable medical expenses but no access to medical insurance said she felt “horrible”.

“Medicines are so expensive,” she said. “And I don't have anything.”

Sheinbaum admitted there was still more work to do.

“Do we still have progress to make? Yes,” she said. “With 30% of Mexico's population living in poverty, we obviously have to keep moving forward.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Family of Edgar Lungu trying to prevent repatriation of his body for state funeral presided over by his successor

A furious row is raging over whether the Zambian president, Hakainde Hichilema, will preside over the funeral of his predecessor, Edgar Lungu, as the former president's family wage a legal battle in South Africa to try to prevent his body from being repatriated.

The legal fight marks the latest twist in a feud between the two men that goes back at least a decade and has now outlasted the former president, who died in South Africa in June aged 68 while being treated for an undisclosed illness.

Mourners had already arrived for a funeral in Johannesburg in June when it was halted by a high court judge after an 11th-hour request by Zambia's attorney general, Mulilo Kabesha. Lungu's family said he had specifically requested that Hichilema not attend his funeral.

On 8 August, the Pretoria high court ruled that Lungu's body could be sent back to Zambia for a state funeral. Lungu's older sister Bertha broke down, shouting across the courtroom at Kabesha as she was restrained by other relatives.

Lungu's family then applied for leave to appeal. On Monday, the high court adjourned the case indefinitely while South Africa's constitutional court decides whether to hear the appeal.

Meanwhile, conspiracy theories have spread, from rumours that Lungu is not actually dead to speculation that Hichilema wants to use the body for witchcraft.

Many Zambians have joked about the saga. “It's coming home!” Kodwani Banda, a self-described “youth advocate”, posted to his 356,000 Facebook followers, with an image of white smoke rising from the Sistine Chapel chimney.

Emmanuel Mwamba, a spokesperson for the Patriotic Front, Lungu's party, said: “There should have been more sympathy. When [government officials] came to South Africa, they were just interested in picking up the body and holding the funeral. It was very mechanical. Their approach lacked sympathy, lacked empathy, lacked a sense of Africanness, a sense of ubuntu.”

Kabesha had previously argued that a state funeral with full military honours was a legal requirement, citing a court ruling on the burial of Zambia's first president, Kenneth Kaunda. “The moment that a national mourning is declared, the law kicks in,” he told the Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation in June.

Mwamba responded that a state funeral could be held without the current president presiding over it. “His presence doesn't make it. A state funeral is, in fact, the protocols such as the gun salute, the pallbearers being soldiers, the ceremony being handled by the defence forces,” he said.

Sishuwa Sishuwa, a political historian and senior lecturer at Stellenbosch University, said the burial dispute had heightened political discord in Zambia.

“The faultlines have always been there, but the dispute over Lungu's burial place has exacerbated the country's regional and political polarisation,” he said. “Whatever way the dispute is resolved, it will have a significant bearing on the 2026 elections … A key reason behind the government's court action in South Africa is to reduce the political costs of burying Lungu in exile.”

Lungu ruled Zambia from 2015 to 2021, having taken over when Michael Sata died in office. He defeated Hichilema in the 2016 presidential election, which Hichilema and his United Party for National Development (UPND) party claimed was rigged.

The following year, Hichilema was sent to prison to await trial on treason charges after his convoy did not give way to Lungu's presidential motorcade. Four months later, after an international outcry, he was released and the charges were dropped.

Hichilema finally defeated Lungu in the 2021 elections, amid an economic crisis. Since then, he has been accused of using oppressive methods similar to those of his longtime rival.

In 2023, police stopped Lungu from going out for runs, saying they were “political activism” that had to be approved in advance to “ensure public safety”. His wife and children have faced corruption charges, which they have denied and said were politically motivated.

In 2024, Lungu was banned from running in next year's presidential election by the constitutional court, which ruled that the period from when Lungu took office in 2015 until the 2016 election counted as a full first term.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

All 34 defendants indicted by Taichung prosecutors for allegedly forging up to 72.88 percent of signatures in two recall petitions against Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislators pleaded guilty at the first court hearing yesterday.

Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) Taichung chapter secretary-general Chen Chien-feng (陳劍鋒) and executive director Wu Kang-lung (伍康龍) were among those indicted.

Charges include document forgery under the Criminal Code (刑法) and contravening the Personal Data Protection Act (個人資料保護法) for illegal use of private information by a non-government entity.

Wu, Chen and two additional party workers were also charged under the Civil Servants Election and Recall Act (公職人員選舉罷免法) with forging or misusing personal information to falsify recall petitions.

During the hearing, Wu and Chen's lawyers relayed their confessions to the court, seeking more lenient sentencing. The defendants acted in response to demands from KMT headquarters, and under social and political pressure to meet targets in a short timeframe, they said.

The indictment said the Taichung City Election Commission investigated the first recall petition of 2,360 signatures targeting DPP Legislator Tsai Chi-chang (蔡其昌), adding that while the petition surpassed the 2,235 signature threshold, it was later found that only 640 signatures were genuine and 1,720 were forged, yielding a falsification rate of 72.88 percent.

Meanwhile, the petition against DPP Legislator Ho Hsin-chun (何欣純) collected 3,513 signatures, above the 3,297 threshold, but only 975 signatures were real, while 2,538 were forged, giving a falsification rate of 72.25 percent, the indictment said.

European Council President Antonio Costa has convened a video conference of EU leaders on Aug. 19 to discuss the outcome of high-level meetings in Washington on Ukraine, Costa wrote on X on Aug. 18.

""I have convened a video conference of the members of the European Council for tomorrow at 13:00 CEST, for a debriefing of today's meetings in Washington D.C. about Ukraine,"" Costa wrote. 

""Together with the U.S., the EU will continue working towards a lasting peace that safeguards Ukraine's and Europe's vital security interests,"" Costa said.

An EU source told the Kyiv Independent that several EU leaders had expressed interest in such a debrief, particularly those not present in Washington.

European leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are set to accompany President Volodymyr Zelensky to Washington on Aug. 18 for talks with U.S. President Donald Trump.

The summit follows Trump's Aug. 15 meeting in Alaska with Russian President Vladimir Putin, to which Zelensky was not invited. Trump said the two ""made some headway"" on peace, but no agreement was reached.

According to the German government, the discussions in Washington will cover the state of peace efforts, security guarantees, territorial questions, continued support for Ukraine, and maintaining sanctions pressure.

Privately, European officials fear a repeat of February, when a meeting between Trump and Zelensky in the Oval Office devolved into a heated argument over U.S. aid to Ukraine, Politico reported on Aug. 16.

The clash in February led Trump to cancel a planned U.S.-Ukraine mineral agreement and publicly accuse Zelensky of having ""disrespected the United States of America in the cherished Oval Office"" in a post on Truth Social.

The mineral agreement was signed a month after.

In the Oval Office, Zelensky said Ukraine wants to end the war and welcomed Trump's signal of openness to trilateral negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""We are ready for trilateral talks. As president said, it's a good signal about trilateral,"" Zelensky told reporters.



European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also backed ""Article 5-like security guarantees"" for Ukraine, saying the country must become ""a steel porcupine, indigestible for potential invaders.""

""Many wounded are in serious condition — right now, doctors are fighting for their lives,"" regional governor Ivan Fedorov said.

According to CNN, European officials privately voiced concern about his absence in Alaska, calling him the American figure with the deepest understanding of what terms Ukraine might consider in a deal.

Russia, one of the world's largest energy producers, relies heavily on oil exports to fund its full-scale war against Ukraine. Ukrainian forces have increasingly targeted Russian energy facilities that both supply fuel to its military and generate revenue for the Kremlin.

Lieutenant General Essedoulla Abatchev has held senior posts in Chechnya and Dagestan and was named Hero of Russia by President Vladimir Putin in 2022. 

Since November 2022, Russian forces have only captured 5,842 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory,  accounting for about 0.97% of the country's landmass, according to DeepState.

Two German Cup matches were briefly stopped over the weekend over alleged racist abuse. FIFA president Gianni Infantino condemned the incidents.

The German Football Federation (DFB) has launched an investigation into the incidents of racist abuse at two German Cup matches on Sunday.

""The supervisory committee is investigating the incidents and initiating investigations against the respective clubs,"" a spokesman for the DFB told Germany's DPA news agency on Monday.

Meanwhile, Schalke's 1-0 win after extra-time away at Lokomotiv Leipzig was briefly suspended in the 13th minute after Schalke's Christopher Antwi-Adjei confronted fans.

The match was interrupted for around three minutes. The stadium announcer then urged supporters to refrain from using racist or discriminatory language.

After the game, the German-born left-winger, who represents the Ghana national team, said he had reported the incident to the assistant referee.

""It's not acceptable, not in this day and age, not at all,"" Antwi-Adjei said. 

""I don't want to repeat the words that were used, but it's disappointing. I'm not the type to go home and cry, but still it's disappointing that it happens on the field these days,"" he told Sky TV.

Lok Leipzig said no one else had reported the alleged racist abuse. 

After the game had resumed, the Schalke player was booed by the home fans whenever he touched the ball.

 

Meanwhile, during the middle of the second half of lower-league Eintracht Stahnsdorf fixtures against second-tier Kaiserslautern, a visiting player who was warming up on the sideline appeared to be insulted by the crowd. 

The perpetrator was identified quickly with the help of spectators and security at the Karl Liebknecht Stadium in Potsdam. The match, which Kaiserslautern won 7-0, continued without interruption.

Hermann Winkler, the president of the Northeast German Football Association (NOFV) warned against jumping into conclusions following the incidents.

Winkler attended the match between Lok Leipzig and Schalke and said he didn't ""notice any xenophobic atmosphere.""

""While it is necessary to deal with this serious issue quickly, let's stop speculating and assigning blame before the match report and the results of the police investigations have been evaluated,"" Winkler told dpa.

FIFA president Gianni Infantino criticized both incidents, saying he expected the DFB to clarify what happened and to punish the perpetrators.

""I will repeat myself and I will keep doing it: In football, there's no place for racism or other forms of discrimination,"" Infantino said.

""FIFA, the players' committee and the entire football community stand by those affected by these incidents - we are determined to ensure that players are respected and protected and that competition organizers and law enforcement agencies take appropriate measures.""

The proposed truce involves a 60-day ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners. Meanwhile, Amnesty International has accused Israel of a ""deliberate policy"" of starvation. Follow DW.

Below, you can read a roundup of events and developments in the Middle East and on Israel's offensive in Gaza on Monday, August 18, 2025.

The Palestinian militant group Hamas has accepted a new ceasefire proposal for Gaza, a senior member from the group said Monday, after a fresh diplomatic push to end more than 22 months of war.

After receiving a new proposal from Egyptian and Qatari meditators, backed by the United States, the Islamist group said it was ready for talks. (See the entry below)

""The movement has submitted its response, agreeing to the mediators' new proposal,"" senior Hamas official Bassem Naim wrote on Facebook. ""We pray to God to extinguish the fire of this war on our people.""

Earlier, a Hamas source told the French AFP news agency that the group accepted the proposal ""without requesting any amendments.""

Egypt said the new proposal had been forwarded to Israel, adding ""the ball is now in its court.""

Israel has yet to respond.

Australia's representatives in the Palestinian Authority have had their visas revoked by Israel in what Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said was retaliation for Canberra's decision to recognize a Palestinian state.

""I decided to revoke the visas of Australian representatives to the Palestinian Authority,"" Saar wrote on X, adding that the Australian ambassador to Israel ""was just notified on the matter.""

He also said the move was a response to ""Australia's unjustified refusal to grant visas to a number of Israeli figures"" – a reference to Simcha Rothman, a far-right Israeli politician who had been scheduled to speak at events organized by the Australian Jewish Association but had his visa canceled on Monday.

Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said Australia would not accept people coming to the country to ""spread division,"" but event organizers branded the move to cancel Rothman's visa ""viciously antisemitic.""

""While antisemitism is raging in Australia, including manifestations of violence against Jews and Jewish institutions, the Australian government is choosing to fuel it by false accusations,"" Saar claimed on X.

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese last week announced that his country would recognize a Palestinian state at the UN General Assembly in September, following similar pledges by France, Canada and the United Kingdom.

The head of the Israeli human rights organisation B'Tselem, Yuli Novak, has welcomed the German government's decision to partially stop supplying weapons to Israel.

""I understand the complexity of German policy toward Israel very well,"" Novak told the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper. 

Novak nevertheless argued that without the support of European governments and the US, Israel would not be able to commit ""this genocide"" against the Palestinians.

Novak criticized what she said was Israel's policy of starvation in Gaza, arguing that Israel was making Palestinians' lives ""impossible here"" with ""the future of the people wiped out.""

""When I look at Israel today, I come to the conclusion that my society is taking on genocidal traits,"" she said, also criticizing the role Israeli media has played. ""On television, the question is not whether there should be famine or not, but only whether the entire population should actually starve.""

Human rights group Amnesty International has accused Israel of enacting a ""deliberate policy"" of starvation in Gaza.

It comes as the United Nations and other aid groups warn of famine in the Palestinian territory.

While heavily restricting aid allowed into the Gaza Strip, Israel has repeatedly rejected claims of deliberate starvation in the 22-month-old war.

Amnesty's Monday report cited testimonies of displaced Palestinians and medical staff who treated malnourished children.

""Israel is carrying out a deliberate campaign of starvation in the occupied Gaza Strip,"" the report said.

The group accused Israel of ""systematically destroying the health, well-being and social fabric of Palestinian life."" 

""It is the intended outcome of plans and policies that Israel has designed and implemented, over the past 22 months, to deliberately inflict on Palestinians in Gaza conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction ― which is part and parcel of Israel's ongoing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza,"" Amnesty said.

Last week, a report by the Israeli defence ministry's COGAT, a body overseeing civil affairs in the Palestinian territories, rejected claims of widespread malnutrition in Gaza and disputed figures shared by the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory. 

Hamas negotiators in Cairo have received a new proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza, which calls for an initial 60-day truce and hostage release in two batches, a Palestinian official on Monday told the French AFP news agency.

""The proposal is a framework agreement to launch negotiations on a permanent ceasefire,"" the official told AFP on condition of anonymity.

The official added that ""Hamas will hold internal consultations among its leadership"" and with leaders of other Palestinian factions to review the proposal from mediators.

Hamas had said last week that a senior delegation was in the Egyptian capital for talks to secure a ceasefire.

Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty visited the Rafah border crossing with Gaza on Monday.

""As we speak now, there are Palestinian and Qatari delegations present on Egyptian soil working to intensify efforts to put an end to the systematic killing and starvation,"" the Egyptian top diplomat said.

Abdelatty had last week said that Egypt was working with fellow mediators Qatar and the United States to broker a 60-day truce that would secure ""the release of some hostages and some Palestinian detainees and the flow of humanitarian and medical assistance to Gaza without restrictions.""

Qatar hosted more than two weeks of negotiations last month, but they ended with no progress.

The war in Gaza, which started after a Hamas-led terror attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, that killed 1,200 people in Israel, with some 250 more taken hostage, is now almost in its 23rd month. More than 62,000 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the war, as per health officials in the Hamas-governed enclave. The United Nations deems the figures reliable.

Israel's ongoing offensive in Gaza continues, with a controversial plan to take over Gaza City now at the center.

A Hamas delegation is reportedly in Egypt reviewing a proposal it received for a 60-day ceasefire and the release of some hostages, while Amnesty International has accused Israel of purposefully starving the Gaza population

Activists say Israeli officials identify them before they arrive, and harass them about their work as they are detained.

As settler violence continues to escalate in Palestine, including the killing of activist and documentary filmmaker Awdah Hathaleen by an Israeli settler at the end of July, Western activists who have been watching from afar as Israel commits a genocide in Gaza are increasingly putting their lives at risk in the West Bank to stand in the way of home demolitions and settler invasions. 

Eli, 19, was one of those activists. (He asked to be identified only by his first name for fear of retaliation by Israeli authorities.) Eli flew from the U.S. into Israel-Palestine on May 30, in hopes of volunteering with the Tent of Nations in the West Bank. He was denied entry after a lengthy interrogation by Israeli intelligence officials. This would have been Eli's first visit to Israel or Palestine, and as he told Truthout, “I was very careful to take down any pro-Palestine posts I had online and deactivated all of my social media accounts.” Still, “The second I stepped off the plane, there was somebody waiting on the jet bridge. I don't know if they were waiting specifically for me, but before I even caught [sic] my surroundings, there was someone who pulled me aside and started doing a lot of questioning,” he said.

Eli was held for hours by Israeli officials and asked about his reasons for visiting Israel, with a clear indication that Israeli officials knew of his intent to volunteer in the West Bank. Due to the difficulty of entering and exiting the West Bank, Western activists will often tell Israeli officials they are visiting as Christian pilgrims or to see friends in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem. Telling an Israeli border official that one intends to visit the West Bank, or even mentioning the word “Palestine,” is a sure way to end up in hours of interrogation or with a complete denial of entry. 

What complicates matters is the fact that the U.S. added Israel to its Visa Waiver Program (VWP) in September 2023, permitting Israeli citizens to apply to enter the U.S. through its Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA). Israeli citizens are now able to travel to the U.S. visa-free. The VWP is structured to be reciprocal in nature, so Israel's entry into the VWP was conditional on its compliance with a set of terms outlined by the U.S., which includes allowing U.S. citizens visa-free entry into Israel regardless of national origin, religion, or ethnicity. 

The American Israel Public Affairs Committee lobbied for Israel's admission to the VWP, and while it was on the table during the Obama administration, Israel wasn't added until President Joe Biden was in office. As then-State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki said during a briefing in 2014, “The Department of Homeland Security and State remain concerned with the unequal treatment that Palestinian Americans and other Americans of Middle Eastern origin experience at Israel's border and checkpoints, and reciprocity is the most basic condition of the Visa Waiver Program.”

Tariq Kenney Shaw, a U.S. policy fellow at the Palestinian policy group Al-Shabaka, told Truthout, “Israel controls the borders. Israel controls who can drive on which roads. Israel controls who can come into the country and who can report and what they can say. This is just further evidence of Israel's total control of the entire territory from the river to the sea.”

Multiple activists who have been visiting and volunteering in Palestine since the early 2000s told Truthout that the border crossings have become increasingly hostile to foreign visitors. Whether it is due to a formal policy from Israel's Populations and Immigration Authority or an informal change in sentiment, entering and exiting the West Bank is becoming increasingly difficult, to the point that some fear access will soon be closed off entirely. “They [Israel] know that the truth is damning, and the only way to hide it is by preventing the stories from being told,” Shaw added. 

Telling an Israeli border official that one intends to visit the West Bank, or even mentioning the word “Palestine,” is a sure way to end up in hours of interrogation or with a complete denial of entry. 

And as settler violence continues to escalate in the West Bank, with Israeli human rights group B'Tselem calling it “part of a strategy to cement the takeover of Palestinian land,” Westerners are living and working in solidarity with Palestinians who are facing the demolition of their homes and theft of their land by Israeli settlers. It is also now more important than ever that Westerners are able to enter the West Bank and bear witness to the violence, as one activist said. “We keep inviting Westerners here because Palestinians feel safer when they're in the villages,” an official at the International Solidarity Movement (ISM), who asked to remain anonymous for fear of being deported, told Truthout. 

The ISM official told Truthout that after October 7, they have witnessed a significant increase in interest among Westerners in traveling to the occupied West Bank as protective presence activists. However, Israel has also stepped up its efforts to identify Western activists before they enter the West Bank and deport them.

Dee Murphy, who is from Ireland and has been volunteering in the West Bank since the 2000s, told Truthout that after she was picked up by Israeli forces in Masafer Yatta, she was told she would be deported. During her interrogation, she recounted, “The Israeli officer said to me, ‘So have you ever been involved in actions against Israel, in your country or abroad?' And I said, ‘I don't even know why you're asking me these questions. No, I haven't.' But he prodded and prodded, and then he said, ‘Oh, really?' and came in with the file, which has about 11 pages of photos of me in the most compromising situations in relation to BDS [the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement] and direct action.” Murphy was later deported. 

The Population and Immigration Authority, which controls Israel's ports of entry, has deployed artificial intelligence and facial recognition technology to gather evidence of Western activists' “anti-Israel sentiment,” as activists witnessed firsthand after their initial detention. Activists who were detained at either the airport or one of Israel's land crossings also told of systematic abuse and harassment by Israeli officials. According to one activist, as soon as the officials learned that they had any affinity for Palestine or the Palestinian cause, “They treated us like we were less than human.” 

Eli was forced to sleep on the floor of the airport as Israeli officials decided whether to allow him entry. “An officer came up to me and was like, ‘You're not allowed to lie down like that and sleep here. You're making us all look bad,'” Eli told Truthout. Sophie, an American who is identified by a pseudonym for fear of retaliation by Israeli authorities, recounted to Truthout how she was pulled aside for a “security screening” while exiting the country. 

She believes her file in the system was somehow flagged to note that she had been volunteering in the West Bank, as during the screening, “She [the officer] put her hands in my underwear and proceeded to cavity search me, and then after that, she put her hands up my shirt and up my sports bra. And at the same time, the male IDF soldier was standing right next to her.” 

Whether it is identifying activists before they arrive, detaining them in the West Bank, or abusing them at border crossings, Israel is doing all it can to stop Western activists in the West Bank from doing their solidarity work.

            Texas House Democrats who fled their state to stall a Republican redistricting effort returned on Monday, ending their 15-day holdout.
    


            Democrats returned to Austin on Monday about an hour before the House was set to convene. And while they have vowed to keep fighting, their presence allowed the House to establish the two-thirds quorum that will be needed to advance new congressional maps in a push backed by President Donald Trump.
    


            Shortly after House Speaker Dustin Burrows gaveled the House into session, he ordered the doors locked and said the Democrats who'd fled the state would be “released into the custody” of a designated Department of Public Safety officer, a move intended to ensure they will be on hand when the chamber reconvenes on Wednesday.
    


            “We are done waiting. We have a quorum. Now is the time for action. We will move quickly and the schedule will be demanding until our work is complete,” Burrows said.
    


            Democratic state Rep. Ramon Romero, who showed reporters his permission slip to leave the state Capitol, said, “This is the way the state does business.”
    


            “Do you think if we weren't gonna come back, we would've walked in here today? Absolutely not,” he said. “But we're gonna become friends by the time this is over, we're gonna have some good Mexican food together. I am gonna try to get away at some point or another.”
    


            “I'm kidding,” he said.
    


            Now that Democrats have returned to the Texas Capitol in Austin, the GOP-dominated legislature is expected to quickly advance new congressional maps aimed at creating five more Republican-leaning seats ahead of next year's midterm elections.
    


            Democrats had fled to blue states — including Illinois, New York and Massachusetts — as they faced civil arrest warrants pushed by GOP officials in Texas to force them back into the House chamber.
    


            “We killed the corrupt special session, withstood unprecedented surveillance and intimidation, and rallied Democrats nationwide to join this existential fight for fair representation — reshaping the entire 2026 landscape,” said state Rep. Gene Wu, who leads Democrats in the Texas House.
    


            “We're returning to Texas more dangerous to Republicans' plans than when we left. Our return allows us to build the legal record necessary to defeat this racist map in court, take our message to communities across the state and country, and inspire legislators across the country how to fight these undemocratic redistricting schemes in their own statehouses.”
    


            Burrows told members that the House “has been through a tumultuous two weeks,” but said it will “remain a chamber where the majority has a right to prevail and the minority has the right to be heard.”
    


            At President Donald Trump's urging, Gov. Greg Abbott and Republicans who control the state House and Senate launched the effort to redraw the state's congressional districts mid-decade — a break from most states' typical practice of redistricting once a decade, after the completion of the US Census.
    


            It's part of the party's effort to hold onto its narrow House majority in next year's midterm elections — one that also includes lobbying GOP officials in Indiana and Missouri to change their maps to turn Democratic-held seats into favorable ground for Republicans, and could see the party add more GOP-leaning seats in Ohio, which is required by state law to redistrict.
    


            The Texas effort has set off a nationwide gerrymandering arms race. In California, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has vowed retribution, proposing a measure that would trigger new maps that could help Democrats pick up five more seats in the state — but only if Texas moves forward with its redistricting plan.
    


            Texas House Democrats had laid out two conditions to return to the state. California would have to introduce its proposed new maps to neutralize the Texas effort, they said, and Burrows would have to adjourn the first special session Abbott had called. Both of those conditions were met on Friday.
    


            Abbott called a second special session, which began immediately after the adjournment of the first one. But the House was blocked from doing business until enough Democrats returned to the chamber to provide the quorum required under its rules.
    


            This week marks a flashpoint in an escalating and unprecedented fight over redistricting, with the country's two most populous states taking center stage and control of the US House during the second half of Trump's term potentially at stake.
    


            California Democratic lawmakers could take just three days to advance new congressional maps intended to offset Republican redistricting efforts in Texas.
    


            Legislation asking voters to approve the new maps is expected to be introduced Monday when lawmakers return to Sacramento from their summer recess, with final passage as early as Thursday, according to a person familiar with the Democratic planning. It will be heard in several committees along the way.
    


            In pushing Texas and other states to redraw their congressional lines mid-decade, Republicans have undertaken extraordinary efforts to preserve their unified hold on power in Washington, prompting Democrats to consider equally unorthodox countermeasures.
    


            Texas House Democrats have said they plan to fight the redistricting bill on the floor, laying out their case against the measure ahead of expected legal challenges in the coming months.
    


            They argue they brought national attention to the GOP-led redistricting in Texas and helped create the momentum for California's counteroffensive and calls in New York and other Democratic-led states to redraw their maps.
    


            But their options to stop Republicans were always limited, short of staying out of Texas for the next year-plus. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott vowed that he would keep calling special sessions until the new maps passed.
    


            Once a quorum is met, the legislative process to approve the congressional maps will kick off, including consideration in the redistricting committee and debate and votes on the floor. The state Senate, which passed a redistricting bill in the first special session, will go through a similar process. The Senate's redistricting committee approved the map on Sunday night after holding a public hearing on the issue.
    


            The GOP's proposal would create five new districts friendlier to Trump and Republicans ahead of the midterm elections. It would likely force Democratic US Reps. Greg Casar and Lloyd Doggett to run against each other in a redrawn district.
    


            GOP leaders have not laid out a timeline for final passage of the new map, but it could come as soon as this week.
    


            When California lawmakers return from their summer recess on Monday, Democrats there will take the first step toward redrawing congressional boundaries to give them a greater chance at winning five additional seats — an extraordinary move intended to counteract Texas' mid-decade redistricting.
    


            Unlike in Texas, the legislation under consideration will also require voter approval to override a constitutionally mandated independent redistricting commission. Lawmakers will have to move quickly; the California secretary of state's office gave the legislature a Friday deadline to make the November ballot, and bills must be in print for 72 hours before they can be voted on.
    


            Democrats are expected to formally introduce the legislation Monday, with final passage pegged for Thursday. Because lawmakers are proposing to change the state constitution, two-thirds of each chamber must vote in favor of it to pass. Democrats hold three-quarters of the seats in both chambers.
    


            The State Assembly returns at 1 p.m. PT (4 p.m. ET). The State Senate reconvenes an hour later.
    


            California legislators will consider three bills this week. One is the constitutional amendment, which would temporarily instate the proposed map for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections. It would only take effect if another state chooses to redraw its maps and it would return the commission's power after the 2030 election.
    


            The second bill describes the proposed map, while the third calls the special election, provides for state funding and makes various timing and administrative changes to accommodate the vote and the potential for new districts.
    


            The constitutional amendment requires a two-thirds vote in each chamber but doesn't need Newsom's signature before going before voters. The other two bills will need the governor's signature and, in order to take effect immediately, will also require two-thirds majorities.
    


            California Republicans, who have little power in Sacramento to slow the redistricting push, are nevertheless closely monitoring how Democrats proceed. GOP lawmakers are anticipating Democrats will put forward a package of legislative proposals that will not only advance the new maps but also outline how they intend to hold and pay for a statewide election in less than three months, a person close to the Republican caucus told CNN.
    


            Gov. Gavin Newsom, a likely contender for the Democrats' presidential 2028 nomination, is already planning for a statewide campaign to support a referendum. A victory could help Democrats win back the US House next year and give Newsom a boost in the next presidential primary.
    


            But some significant opposition to the proposed referendum is already forming. Former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger on Friday posted a picture of himself working out while wearing a T-shirt that said “F*** the politicians/Terminate gerrymandering.” The caption read: “I'm getting ready for the gerrymandering battle.”
    


            Charles Munger Jr., the son of the late Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman, has signaled he intends to fight the Democratic-led initiative. Munger spent more than $12 million in 2010 to entrench the independent redistricting commission in the state constitution, and he will fight any efforts to circumvent it, his spokeswoman Amy Thoma Tan said in a statement responding to California Democrats on Thursday.
    


            “Two wrongs do not make a right, and California shouldn't stoop to the same tactics as Texas,” Thoma Tan said. “Instead, we should push other states to adopt our independent, non-partisan commission model across the country. That's how we can protect and defend democracy.”
    


            Newsom's approach has also led to a divide among good government groups that have traditionally opposed gerrymandering. While the League of Women Voters continues to urge California lawmakers to reject the redistricting push, leaders at Common Cause have said they will not proactively reject “counterbalancing” efforts done in response to other states. The group said Wednesday it would not oppose redistricting pushes that are proportional responses to other states, involve public participation and have a set expiration date, among other criteria.
    


            Leaders at the organization said they would determine whether to oppose the California push after the full proposal has been released and judged against its rubric.
    


            “We welcome the governor to adopt our fairness criteria,” said Omar Noureldin, the organization's senior vice president of policy and litigation strategy. “And if the maps that are proposed in the process that's laid out in its totality meet that fairness criteria, then we won't oppose it.”

Fox News correspondent Mark Meredith reports on the efforts being made by Texas Republicans to restructure the state's district map, leaving their Democrat counterparts 'furious,' on 'Special Report.'

Judges for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Louisiana's request to allow it to enforce its long-stalled congressional redistricting map, delivering a near-term blow to Republicans in the state by ruling that it amounts to an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.

All three judges on the bench voted to uphold a lower court's ruling that the map in question — originally passed by Louisiana's Republican-majority legislature in 2022 — violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by diluting the votes of Black residents in the state.

They also affirmed the district court's ruling that the map in question violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act by, ""'packing' Black voters into a small number of majority-Black districts, and ‘cracking' other Black communities across multiple districts, thereby depriving them of the opportunity to form effective voting blocs."" 

Judges on the panel also rejected the state's contention that conditions in Louisiana have changed enough to render race-conscious remedies obsolete.

SUPREME COURT HEARS PIVOTAL LOUISIANA ELECTION MAP CASE AHEAD OF 2026 MIDTERMS

""There is no legal basis for this proposition, and the state offers no evidence that conditions in Louisiana have changed"" enough to negate that need, the court said in its ruling. 

One judge on the panel issued a stay before the court's ruling could take force, though the issue is something of a moot point, since the Supreme Court, which is also reviewing the map, had already done so earlier this year.

The ruling from the Fifth Circuit, which has a reputation as one of the more conservative appeals courts, is a victory in the near term for the ACLU and other plaintiffs who sued to block the state's map from taking force.

Still, any relief for plaintiffs from the appeals court ruling is likely to be short-lived.

The Supreme Court in March heard oral arguments in Louisiana v. Callais, which also centers on the legality of Louisiana's redistricting map and whether race should be considered a factor in drawing new congressional districts.

Oral arguments then focused heavily on whether Louisiana's redistricting efforts were narrowly tailored enough to meet constitutional requirements and whether race was used in a way that violated the law, as the appellees alleged.

The Supreme Court in June said it would hear additional arguments in the case in the fall term, citing the need for more information before it could issue a ruling.

SUPREME COURT DECLINES TO BLOCK MISSISSIPPI SOCIAL MEDIA AGE-RESTRICTION LAW, FOR NOW

Earlier this month, justices ordered both parties to file supplemental briefs by mid-September, outlining in further detail arguments for and against Louisiana's proposed map and whether the intentional creation of a second majority-Black congressional district ""violates the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.""

The careful consideration from the Supreme Court is the clearest sign yet that redistricting issues remain top of mind in the run-up to the 2026 midterm elections and beyond.

It also comes at a pivotal time in the U.S., as new and politically charged redistricting fights have popped up in other states ahead of next year's midterm elections.

Louisiana, for its part, has revised its congressional map twice since the 2020 census.

The first version, which included only one majority-Black district, was blocked by a federal court in 2022. The court sided with the Louisiana State Conference of the NAACP and other plaintiffs, ruling the map diluted Black voting power and ordering the state to redraw it by January 2024.

The new map, S.B. 8, created the second Black-majority district. But it was almost immediately challenged by a group of non-Black plaintiffs in court, who took issue with a new district that stretched some 250 miles from Louisiana's northwest corner of Shreveport to Baton Rouge, in the state's southeast.

They argued in their lawsuit that the state violated the equal protection clause by relying too heavily on race to draw the maps and created a ""sinuous and jagged second majority-Black district.""

The intense court fights in Louisiana underscore the broader redistricting battles playing out in Republican- and Democrat-led states across the country, as they spar over new congressional maps with an eye to the looming midterm elections.

In Texas, tensions reached a fever pitch after Democratic state legislators fled the Lone Star State to block Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's ability to convene a legislative quorum to pass the state's aggressive new redistricting map, which would create five additional Republican-leaning districts.

In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom responded by introducing a new map of his own that favors Democrats.

The move highlights how both parties are engaged in aggressive redistricting battles, with Republican-led states pushing maps to defend the GOP's slim House majority and Democrats seeking to expand their own advantages. As with most midterms following a new president's election, 2026 is expected to serve as a referendum on the White House — raising GOP concerns that they could lose control of the chamber.

Shark attack survivor Jameson Reeder Jr. recounts his harrowing ordeal and miraculous recovery during an interview on ‘Fox & Friends Weekend.'

An American tourist was seriously injured after being attacked by a shark during a spearfishing trip in the Bahamas over the weekend, according to local reports. 

The Royal Bahamas Police Force said in a Facebook post that the incident occurred shortly after 1 p.m. on Sunday, Aug. 17, near Big Grand Cay, located on the island of Abaco.

The 63-year-old victim was initially treated at a nearby clinic before being airlifted to the United States for further medical care. Authorities have not released additional details.

While shark attacks in the Bahamas are rare, the country has one of the world's highest rates relative to its population.

The International Shark Attack File, a global database tracking shark-related incidents, reports that there have been only 34 confirmed unprovoked attacks in the Bahamas over the past four centuries, ranking it ninth among nations monitored.

This latest incident follows several recent attacks on U.S. tourists.

Earlier this year, two Americans were hurt in a suspected shark attack while swimming at Bimini Bay, a well-known resort area about 50 miles from Miami. 

In December 2023, 44-year-old newlywed Lauren Erickson Van Wart of Massachusetts was fatally bitten while paddleboarding near the western end of New Providence Island in the Bahamas.

A month later, a 10-year-old boy from Maryland was bitten in the leg during a shark tank experience at a Paradise Island resort. The boy was taken to hospital and survived the attack. 

The U.S. State Department has also warned travelers of shark-related risks in the region.

President Donald Trump declared that he will spearhead a push to eliminate the use of mail-in voting and voting machines in U.S. elections.

In a lengthy Truth Social post on Monday, President Trump asserted, ""I am going to lead a movement to get rid of MAIL-IN BALLOTS"" as well as ""Seriously Controversial VOTING MACHINES.""

He said he would sign an executive order in advance of the 2026 midterm elections.  

""Remember, the States are merely an ‘agent' for the Federal Government in counting and tabulating the votes. They must do what the Federal Government, as represented by the President of the United States, tells them, FOR THE GOOD OF OUR COUNTRY, to do,"" he claimed.

I, AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, WILL FIGHT LIKE HELL TO BRING HONESTY AND INTEGRITY BACK TO OUR ELECTIONS. THE MAIL-IN BALLOT HOAX, USING VOTING MACHINES THAT ARE A COMPLETE AND TOTAL DISASTER, MUST END, NOW!!!"" he exclaimed.

""REMEMBER, WITHOUT FAIR AND HONEST ELECTIONS, AND STRONG AND POWERFUL BORDERS, YOU DON'T HAVE EVEN A SEMBLANCE OF A COUNTRY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER!!!"" the president asserted.

President Donald Trump said he will bring “honesty” to the 2026 elections through an executive order eliminating mail-in ballots and voting machines.

Trump has long opposed voting by mail or electronically, particularly since his 2020 election loss. During his second presidential run, he repeatedly said there was widespread voter fraud.

On Monday, Trump said the United States is the only country that uses mail-in voting and that all other countries “gave it up because of the MASSIVE VOTER FRAUD ENCOUNTERED.”

More than two dozen countries, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, and South Korea,  have postal voting systems, with some dating back to the 1990s. Countries with right-wing governments, such as Italy, also offer limited mail-in voting. The U.S. has had a form of mail-in voting for centuries.

Countries such as Russia, France, and Portugal do not allow in-country mail-in voting. Trump recently said Russian President Vladimir Putin agrees that mail-in voting is not “honest.”

Trump blasted voting machines as highly inaccurate, very expensive, and highly controversial. He said they cost “Ten Times more than accurate and sophisticated Watermark Paper, which is faster, and leaves NO DOUBT, at the end of the evening, as to who WON, and who LOST, the Election.”

He also predicted that his effort to remove mail-in voting and voting machines would be opposed by Democrats “BECAUSE THEY CHEAT AT LEVELS NEVER SEEN BEFORE” and that they are “unelectable” without them.

Trump also noted that his orders are justified because the executive branch has power over the states.

“Remember, the States are merely an ‘agent' for the Federal Government in counting and tabulating the votes,” he said. “They must do what the Federal Government, as represented by the President of the United States, tells them, FOR THE GOOD OF OUR COUNTRY, to do.”

Eight states and the District of Columbia allow their elections to be entirely run by mail-in voting. Twenty-eight states allow mail-in voting without an excuse, and 14 others require a reason to vote absentee or by mail.

States often delegate their authority to county governments, allowing them to determine their own voting rules.

The Constitution allows state legislatures to make their own voting rules, subject to congressional oversight. It's unclear whether a Trump executive order aimed at ending mail-in voting or electronic voting would stand up to legal challenges.

Trump concluded by saying a country without fair elections or a strong border does not resemble a real country.

He said in 2020 that mail-in voting was primed to encounter foreign influence.

“Mail-In Voting is already proving to be catastrophic. The Dems talk of foreign influence in voting, but they know that Mail-In Voting is an easy way for foreign countries to enter the race,” Trump said.

Following his 2020 election loss, Trump derided a “rigged” election process. The unrest from his claims led to the Jan. 6 Capitol riots, for which Congress impeached him.

Many of Trump's claims about the rigged election process came from quick Republican leads on election night that evaporated when more Democratic mail-in votes cut into leads across the country.

A new generation of disabled writers isn't interested in inspiring readers.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Helen Keller opens her 1903 autobiography with a confession. “It is with a kind of fear that I begin to write the history of my life,” the deafblind author admits. She wants to avoid imposing a sense of “fantasy” on the events that shaped her: Though any memoirist might wrestle with how to accurately recount the past, Keller also likely knew that readers expected an inspiring tale of a young woman surmounting adversity by sheer force of will.

This is indeed how Keller's The Story of My Life—one of the first and most influential memoirs of disability—and numerous personal narratives since have been packaged and sold. As a result, Keller gained a reputation as a “paragon of cheerfulness and industry,” writes the blind scholar Georgina Kleege, who grew up despising the disabled icon. But she eventually had a revelation: “It occurred to me,” Kleege writes to Keller in Blind Rage, “that I should not hold you responsible for the use others made of your life story.”

Writing about disability can be fraught, not least because the category is so broad, an expansive umbrella under which many disparate conditions may fall. Despite the variety of experiences they catalog, disability memoirs have often been marketed and read for narrow purposes—as dutiful tools of education or empathy building. The most visible books tend to fit one of two molds: inspirational stories of overcoming (whose subtitles might include words such as conquered, hope, or resilience) or activist calls to action (see: fight and ableism). They seem intended mostly to make disability more palatable and coherent.

Read: Society tells me to celebrate my disability. What if I don't want to?

That's changing. In the past several years, a new kind of memoirist has emerged, transforming and advancing the genre. In pathbreaking books such as Andrew Leland's The Country of the Blind, a rigorously researched and reported account of progressive visual impairment, and Chloé Cooper Jones's Easy Beauty, a profoundly philosophical travelogue about moving through the world with a visible and sometimes painful disability, readers can see authors thinking on the page: asking questions and wrestling with ideas, plumbing the past and probing their own minds.

By taking this searching approach, writers can more fully capture the experience of disability—its gradations and contradictions, its gifts and its burdens. Such recent works are, in other words, memoirs of ambivalence, in which imperfect narrators don't overcome impairment but learn to coexist with it, however uneasily. Further, these books present disabled experience as worthy of study and analysis, and deserving of the same care and attention that any literary work demands.

The slipperiness of disabled identity—and the inadequacy of so many categories that define people—is the subject of a new entry in this growing canon, Raymond Antrobus's The Quiet Ear. The British poet's account of growing up and, later, growing into his deaf identity works to untangle his knotty relationship to his hearing impairment, which is both partial and, by nature, invisible. If Antrobus overcomes anything in the course of the memoir, it's not the specific challenges of living with deafness but the shame that had long festered around his condition.

Antrobus wasn't diagnosed as deaf until he was 7 years old, when his mother “bought a large, exceptionally loud, cream-colored telephone” and discovered that its shrill rings were imperceptible to her son. He recalls taking a test that “revealed the hidden nuance of my hearing”—namely that he was “missing” high-pitched sounds: alarms and whistles, teakettles and birdsong, the spoken sounds sh, ch, ba, and th. He was largely able to pass as hearing, even if it meant pretending to register more than he could. The ruse often landed Antrobus in hot water; as a teenager, it cost him both a girlfriend and a job. He had been fitted with hearing aids when he was first diagnosed as deaf but disliked wearing them, and often opted not to.

Antrobus tracks his childhood attitude toward his deafness by referring back to an old diary, which he regards as a record of his own denial amid the pressure to conform. (According to that diary, he feared that his hearing aids marked him—and marred him—as “disabled.”) But an early journal entry, from an 11-year-old Antrobus, undoes that perception: “I really can't hear and no one seems to be adjusting to my needs,” he acknowledged, lamenting that “people think I'm faking.” Like Leland and Jones, who frequently find themselves manhandled and patronized by passersby, Antrobus considers how the actions and assumptions of others pose a bigger threat to his dignity than his deafness does.

Antrobus spent years living in the borderland separating the worlds of the deaf and the hearing, able to sign only “basic” British Sign Language with his deaf peers while struggling to comprehend his hearing ones without accommodation. This alienating sense of in-betweenness also extended to his racial identity. As the light-skinned son of a Black Jamaican father and a white British mother, he knew what it meant to pass in more ways than one. Just as he felt unable to fully lay claim to being deaf or hearing, Antrobus writes, “I had no stable view of my race either, but I picked up on the anxiety my racial ambiguity caused others and played into whatever perception kept me safest; black, white, whatever they wanted to see.” Time and again, the available binaries failed him, but he still felt forced to “pick a side.”

The simple act of writing about one's disability also can feel like picking a side. And in doing so, Antrobus rightly observes, one risks becoming an object of “pity and tokenism.” As a young poet, he avoided writing about his deafness “for fear of being simplified and pigeonholed.” This apprehension dogs many disabled writers. Disability is just one facet of who we are, but when we write publicly about it, it seems to become all we are. Just as the young Antrobus figured that wearing hearing aids would define his identity in the eyes of others, he knew that writing about deafness ran the risk of “limiting my potential crossover appeal to the mainstream world.”

This new generation of disabled memoirists isn't interested in pleasing the “mainstream,” even if their works inevitably broach the universal quandary of what it means to be human. Instead, they ask hard questions with thorny answers. In The Country of the Blind, for instance, Leland considers what it means to be a sexual being in the absence of visual stimuli, or to be a father whose capabilities as a protector are limited. In Easy Beauty, Jones confronts how a lifetime of ableist encounters has inculcated her with a cynical detachment that she worries might rub off on her son. Antrobus, for his part, sensitively surveys the challenges and privileges that come with having an often-invisible disability.

The Quiet Ear lacks the intellectual rigor and finely wrought prose of Leland and Jones's memoirs, as well as other works such as Jan Grue's I Live a Life Like Yours and Emily Rapp Black's Frida Kahlo and My Left Leg. But the tact and tenderness with which Antrobus writes about his wounded younger self and his deaf coming-of-age make the memoir a notable addition to the subgenre.

All of these books, in one way or another, quietly undermine assumptions that some readers may bring to them. Antrobus does this in the very first scene of The Quiet Ear, when a journalist brusquely asks him how he's able to talk if he's deaf—a “question,” he writes, that “felt like an indictment.” Throughout the book, he pushes against commonly held notions of what hearing impairments look like and stresses that deafness, like all disability, is “an experience rather than a trauma.”

Read: I'm disabled. Please help me.

Disability follows no narrative arc, has no inherent meaning, confers no moral high ground, and is meted out at random. This is perhaps not the story some readers want; they may go searching for a neater one. The deafblind poet John Lee Clark once joked in an interview that playing the “Helen Keller Card” is one way to bring people to his work. “I am aware that some readers come to my work for ‘wrong' reasons,” he said. “Instead of fighting against this, I work with it in the hope that they will soon have better reasons to like my work.” At one point in The Quiet Ear, Antrobus looks to his fellow disabled writers, poets, and artists and wonders “who might we be if we lived in a world of understanding ourselves first” rather than trying to perform for others. We cannot control how others perceive us, but we can at least read ourselves closely and carefully.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","A Famed Director Tried to Build a Fan Base for His Movie. It Was Awkward.","https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/08/megalopolis-francis-ford-coppola-cult-classics/683896/","Mon, 18 Aug 2025 11:31:00 GMT","

Francis Ford Coppola's recent road show for Megalopolis is an attempt to dictate its legacy—and a misunderstanding of how fandom works.

Francis Ford Coppola had a plan—or seemed to have one, at least. When the famed director of The Godfather walked onto the stage of San Francisco's Palace of Fine Arts Theatre after a screening of his latest film, 2024's Megalopolis, he told the audience that he intended “to change the world tonight.” An assistant wheeled out a whiteboard listing the 10 topics Coppola wanted to discuss: time, work, money, politics, education, law, war, art, religion, and celebration. By the time the talk ended two hours later, however, the 86-year-old filmmaker had covered only five of the items; almost half of the audience had trickled out; and the world appeared regrettably unchanged.

Billed as “An Evening with Francis Ford Coppola,” the event earlier this month was the last stop in a six-city road tour meant to honor Megalopolis by indulging in an in-depth study of its themes. The whiteboard, the 10-pronged approach to fixing human society, the hours of unmoderated discussion—all of it was an apparent attempt to build the mythology of a film released less than a year ago that had already seemed to be forgotten. Movies have been resuscitated before: Now-beloved films such as The Rocky Horror Picture Show, The Princess Bride, and The Big Lebowski have for decades been embraced by audiences after being overlooked during their initial releases. But as much as Megalopolis fits the vague outlines of notoriety that could one day make it a cult classic—Coppola's epic film, which envisioned America as a retro-futuristic version of the Roman empire, was critically derided, dramatically underperformed at the box office, and endured a shaky behind-the-scenes production that involved the director plopping down $120 million of his own money—its revival feels different.

Indeed, the response to Coppola's cross-country tour came off less like the beginnings of an underground fan base, and more like a film community tolerating an auteur's exhaustive defense of his work. “The Coppola thing's a bit unusual,” Jamie Sexton, a film professor studying cult cinema at Northumbria University, in England, told me. The director seems to be a one-man army who's attempting, Sexton said, “to facilitate a cult following.” Of course, the notion of a “cult film” has grown nebulous over time: Many movies that have been bestowed the title, such as Blade Runner and This Is Spinal Tap, gained widespread popularity anyway, and the proliferation of streaming services makes it easier for people to discover nearly any movie on their own. But rather than allow audiences to organically find Megalopolis, Coppola has made it hard to screen legally. (The film is currently unavailable to stream in North America.) Rather than wait for reevaluations of it to emerge over time, Coppola initiated the conversation from his end.

Read: The Megalopolis that Francis Ford Coppola wanted to make

Coppola, for his part, leaned into the weirdness of his endeavor. During the live events, he covered topics as varied as education reform, the benefits of jury duty, and the oppressiveness of time—only very loosely linking them all to Megalopolis. The director, who wore mismatched socks onstage, beseeched his audience to ask him anything. One attendee pressed him to discuss the allure of organic architecture. Another thrust a hand into the air for a two-part question: First, did Coppola have anything to share about a third cut of Apocalypse Now, and second, could Coppola please sign the custom Harley-Davidson motorcycle he'd designed to honor the director's filmography? (It was parked right outside!) Coppola answered most queries patiently, but always turned back to the guiding principles on his whiteboard.

His efforts to reintroduce Megalopolis to the public demonstrate the challenge of transforming a flop into a cult classic. No formula exists for that process, but the building—and maintaining—of underground-hit status, Sexton told me, requires audiences to take full control of a work's legacy. Regardless of cinematic quality, such projects tend to be transgressive in some compelling manner, enough to inspire devotion: They're thematically controversial, stylistically challenging, or simply enjoyable in ways that fans want to passionately defend. “There is a special flavor to the cult following when the art is not considered mainstream, because that fills you with a sense of almost conspiratorial-style comfort,” Amanda Montell, the author of Cultish: The Language of Fanaticism and a co-host of the podcast Sounds Like a Cult, told me. “Like, I have access to something that the sheep do not.” Viewers grant these movies a rarefied status by continuously rallying behind them and pushing for them to be reconsidered by critics and mainstream audiences. When studios try to mobilize niche fandoms, however, by rereleasing much-memed movies, fast-tracking sequels, and coining portmanteaus, that interest seldom translates into sustainable, influential communities. The power to define a film's fate after its release rests with the consumers, not the creators.

Even so, Coppola's decision to take the reins appears to have worked to some extent: Several stops on the tour sold out, and a handful of attendees the night I went shouted at the filmmaker to release Megalopolis on Blu-ray in North America. But none of it proves that Megalopolis has finally won audiences over. If anything, the continued fascination with the film illustrates the appeal of self-mythology—of watching a filmmaker define the personal stakes of his work, examine his career, and tie his own worldview so closely to a single project. Montell explained that Coppola's strategy seemed to involve “Frankensteining” the practices that materialize around cult movies (hard-to-access screenings, dissections of their production) with the circuitous chatter that can surround cults of personality. By showing up to appreciate the flaws of the film—and of its maker's aspirations—the audience countered critical consensus and displayed unconventional taste. Some of that involves direct participation, which, for many cult films, can turn into rituals: During screenings of The Room, audiences toss plastic spoons at the screen. During The Rocky Horror Picture Show, they sing along. During Megalopolis, at least at the San Francisco showing, an especially passionate group in the audience cheered during a scene that had gone viral, chanting “club” alongside the protagonist, the visionary inventor Cesar, played by Adam Driver.

Spontaneous responses such as that may indicate the beginnings of a cult legacy. But for all of Coppola's insistence that his film's themes are hugely relevant to today's society, answering the question of whether a movie as strange and ambitious as Megalopolis will truly find a fervent audience, Sexton said, requires patience: “For me, there has to be some kind of endurance beyond the buzz.” An upcoming making-of documentary will further test the film's potential longevity. Until then, what Coppola has done is willed an ephemeral following into being, for just six nights—and maybe, for him, for now, that's enough. After all, Sexton pointed out, “he doesn't have to do this.”

More Americans are setting their mouth on fire—for extreme sport, and for everyday thrills.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

The Carolina Reaper is so hot, it makes jalapeños taste like milk. It's so hot, it causes people to hallucinate, vomit, pass out, wish they'd never been born. It's so hot that the guy who invented it—in 2012, by crossbreeding habaneros and Naga Viper peppers, each of which were once thought to be the hottest in the world—has said it tastes like eating “molten lava.” Original-recipe Tabasco sauce is up to 5,000 Scoville heat units; habaneros are up to 350,000. The Reaper has been known to reach 2.2 million.

To be clear, I have never tried it—none of the above sounds that fun to me. But you are welcome to. You can have it dusted onto cheese curls sold at your local grocery store, or on a slider at one of the more than 300 Dave's Hot Chicken locations nationwide, so long as you sign a waiver. I can't get over this: 15 years ago, our species could not imagine a pepper as hot as the Reaper, and now we can eat it with a lemonade and fries for lunch before heading back to the office.

America is setting its mouth on fire. According to an analysis provided to me by Datassential, a food-and-beverage-industry consultancy, more than half of American consumers are likely to buy an item described as spicy, up from 39 percent in 2015. Those who already like spice are eating even more extreme versions of it, but the interest in heat is happening across the board, even at the moderate level, among people who might never touch a Carolina Reaper. As of this year, more than 19 out of every 20 restaurants in the United States—a category that, notably, includes ice-cream stores, bakeries, and coffee shops—offer at least one spicy item, according to Datassential. Frito-Lay now sells 26 different Flamin' Hot products, and sales of those products increased by 31 percent from 2022 to 2023.

Read: The golden age of the fried-chicken sandwich

To put it generally and reductively, American food has not always been known for embracing spice. But now a large and apparently growing number of people in this country are willingly chomping down on fruits that have been expressly cultivated to bind to their body's pain receptors and unleash fury with every bite. “It's one of the great puzzles of culinary history,” Paul Rozin, a retired psychologist who spent much of his career studying spice, told me. “It is remarkable that something that tastes so bad is so popular.”

This trend, like basically every trend, is being driven by young people: According to a survey by NCSolutions, which helps packaged-food companies advertise, 51 percent of Generation Z consider themselves hot-sauce connoisseurs, and 35 percent have signed a waiver before eating something spicy. But it is also the result of a collision of several changes in the way Americans eat. Food costs are high, and the industry is crowded; spice can be a cheap way to produce flavor, get consumer attention, and mask less-expensive ingredients such as corn and chicken. New techniques have enabled manufacturers to tweak flavors much more easily, injecting spice into just about any mass-produced food: ice cream, lemonade, Gushers, boxed mac and cheese, the sandwich bread at Subway.

Immigration, the internet, cheap shipping, and inexpensive international travel have ushered in a truly global food era, one in which people are much more familiar with, and able to access, ingredients and ideas from the heat-seeking culinary traditions common in Asia and Central America. And at the same time, spicy food has also gotten better, moving away from the blunt-force trauma of what Dylan Keenan, who runs the online hot-sauce store Heat, described to me as “stupid hot stuff that didn't taste good” in favor of more nuanced flavors: the back-of-the-throat burn of the Trinidad Scorpion, the lip-numbing kick of Sichuan peppercorns. The Reaper, despite sounding intense, still tastes more interesting than the pepper extract that used to supercharge hot sauces and snack foods; it's sweet and a little fruity, supposedly, at least before the pain sets in. All told, spicy food is easier to make, easier to find, and easier to love than it was just a few decades ago.

The body's spice receptors adapt over time, like feet get calluses. So spice creep is ceaseless and self-perpetuating: We're getting used to spicier foods, so we are eating spicier foods, so we are getting even more used to even spicier foods, as though our taste buds are all on a flywheel that can't stop speeding up. In 2022, responding to customer demand, Fly By Jing introduced an even hotter version of its Sichuan chili crisp, made with what its founder, Jing Gao, described to me as “the hottest Chinese chili you can grow.” (Xtra Spicy is now the company's second-best seller, behind its original recipe.) At Heat, Keenan told me, sales of extra-hot sauces are growing faster than milder ones, and What's the hottest thing that still tastes good? is the most common customer request. “I do think it's likely that within a generation or two,” he wrote to me in an email, “the median American will be able to handle spice levels that would have sent a medieval peasant into anaphylactic shock.” Historically speaking, he pointed out, spice tolerance has only moved in one direction.

It's true. The first person to eat a hot pepper probably did it somewhere in the lowlands of southern Mexico more than 10,000 years ago, and I would guess they probably thought it would kill them. But they went back for more, or at least they told their friends. Part of this is pure neurochemistry: Capsaicin, the compound that makes many spicy foods spicy, transmits pain signals to the brain, which the brain then counteracts by releasing endorphins—it's like a runner's high, except you can get it while sitting in your car outside of a McDonald's. Rozin calls the phenomenon “benign masochism”: a little bit of pain, as a treat. “It's bungee jumping and roller coasters and swimming in cold water,” he said, and it is a uniquely human impulse. (Imagine what would happen if you put a dog on a roller coaster.) “We somehow get a pleasure out of our body telling us not to do something, but we know it's okay.” In the 1970s, when he was studying spice in Oaxaca, Rozin found that even children had learned to tolerate spice. When he offered the local pigs and dogs a choice, they picked bland food every time.

The dogs might be onto something. Then again, they don't know about viral food challenges, or about the idea that your food choices reflect your identity, or how powerful it can feel to confront agony and swallow it whole. Mao Zedong is said to have suggested that anyone who couldn't tolerate chiles couldn't be a revolutionary; all over the world, and for centuries, spiciness has been something to conquer, and chiles have symbolized strength, bravery, national pride, and virility. America, it seems, is finally catching up. Self-taught superhot cultivators have spent the past decade trying to outdo themselves, crossbreeding progressively more infernal peppers with progressively more ridiculous names, ones like Death Spiral and Dragon's Breath. (The Reaper isn't even the world's hottest anymore: That would be Pepper X, which has an average Scoville rating of above 2.6 million.) Rich and famous people with much, much better things to do are willingly humiliating themselves on Hot Ones, a web show that invites celebrities to eat hot wings while answering interview questions and that sold last year for $82.5 million. Internet-facilitated food challenges have become both more common and more extreme.

The extreme has, as it tends to do, seeped into everyday life. Blandness has become not just a culinary flaw but a moral failing, evidence of spinelessness and unsophistication. Being able to withstand spicy food, by contrast, is probably the most meaningless matter of personal preference people feel comfortable bragging about. (Think about it: Beyoncé would never sing about keeping ketchup in her bag.) The whole thing does feel very human: The impulse to defeat nature and find ever more extraordinary ways to test the limits of having a body, even if (especially if) it hurts a little. So we swill milk and cry in front of an audience of millions, or battle against our own biology at breakfast—just for the thrill, just because we can.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Serving justice to sandwich-wielding offenders takes expertise.

“WASHINGTON—The Justice Department worker accused of throwing a Subway sandwich at a federal agent was re-arrested by an armed team of at least a half-dozen US Marshals in a dramatic Wednesday night raid, new video shows.

Sean Charles Dunn, 37, was cuffed a second time inside his apartment about a mile northwest of the White House—after being slapped with a felony assault charge.

Footage of the raid was posted by the White House on X Thursday evening with the caption: ‘Nighttime Routine: Operation Make D.C. Safe Again Edition.'”

— The New York Post, August 15

Police headquarters, Washington, D.C., present day. A dusty, small office.

A trainee walks in carrying a cake with CONGRATULATIONS! 25 YEARS WITHOUT A SANDWICH-BASED CRIME written on it in large frosted letters. Senior Detective J, Junior Detective F, and Sergeant P are sitting around. Everyone claps.

Trainee: Who wants to blow it out?

A panicked junior detective, K, rushes in.

Detective K: Turn on the TV.

They turn on the TV. On the screen, footage of a DOJ employee tossing a hoagie at a federal law-enforcement officer and running off.

The trainee drops the cake.

Detective J: No!

Detective K: What in tarnation were those officers doing there? Don't they know the first thing about sandwich-crime prevention?

Trainee: It doesn't look like it hit very hard. Seemed soggy.

Lady Sleuth: No. They'll count it. Remember the hot-dog incident in '73?

Detective F: But a hot dog isn't a sandwich!

Detective J: The record keepers didn't agree.

Trainee: We should have fired the record keepers!

Detective J: (Slamming his fist on the table.) That's not how we DO things in the sandwich division. Doesn't matter if we get bad press, like a subpar panini. We don't cut corners, unless the sandwich in question is a round-type sandwich.

Detective F: Some are.

Officer J: You think 25 years without sandwich crime just HAPPENS?

Trainee: No.

Officer J: We worked for this. It hasn't been easy. When I got started on this beat, you couldn't walk down the street in Washington without having a grilled cheese shoved in your face, if you were lucky. Egg salad, if you weren't.

Detective F: Not all the sandwiches were harmless. Some were clubs. People were too frightened of sandwiches to build a Subway in Georgetown.

Officer K: I still have a scar from when I took a meatball sub to the chin in '96 and, afterward, got into an unrelated knife fight.

Officer J: I started here after transferring from the bread-crimes division in France. I spent decades hunting down a man who stole bread one time. My name is Javert, but that's not important. His name was Jean Valjean. I also resented him because I had just the one name and he had two.

Trainee: That seems excessive.

Officer Javert: I think so too! One name is enough for anyone.

Trainee: Oh, I meant, chasing him for—

Officer Javert: Right. It was. It turned out what he needed was rehabilitation and a second chance, not me chasing him across France, singing. But we learned from it! We realized if we were proactive rather than reactive, if we got involved in the communities we served, we could figure out what was going on and stop it.

Detective F: Most sandwich crimes are crimes of opportunity. People who aren't carrying sandwiches don't tend to commit sandwich crimes. They do other types of crime. We took that statistic to the chief and said, “You're sure you want us to go all in on eliminating sandwich crime? Not regular crime? Consider all the murders we could prevent if we just handed sandwiches to people who were about to do other crimes.” And they said, “No, solve sandwich crime.”

Detective F: Lunchables are a gateway.

Officer Javert: Teaching little kids to assemble their own sandwiches, as though it were play! We tackled all of that. We started from the bread up, tackling the root causes, and then the additional causes that were layered on top, and then any sauce that was on top of that.

Officer K: I remember when Mark Warner made what he claimed was a tuna melt. And everyone said, “Call the sandwich-crimes unit!”

Trainee: That was what started me down this path, sir. I saw it, and I knew it was an abomination, and I wanted to stop it.

Officer Javert: The point is, people trust us. We aren't just police officers. We know the community we serve. We know how to de-escalate. We look for non-carceral solutions. We ask: Why would someone want to throw a sandwich? How can we fix that? We know who has beef and if that beef is corned.

Detective F: That didn't happen overnight. We learned what to do: control the mayonnaise supply. And what to avoid: goofy, authoritarian displays of force.

Trainee: Most people don't even know there's such a thing as sandwich crime.

Officer K: Because no one has the urge.

Trainee: And that's because of all your tireless work.

Officer Javert: You can't just come in, on a whim—

Detective F: Or a caprese.

Officer Javert: —with troops! It's not right! (Stares at the TV and sighs.) And they just—they ruined it all! They're not stopping crime, regular or sandwich! They're just making good people anxious to walk through their own neighborhoods. I'm so angry I could throw a good-size flatbread!

Detective F: (Gasps in horror.) NO! You've been a mentor!

Officer Javert: With soft bread! A limp one, with the tomato already falling off! Just up into the air, not at any one in particular.

Officer K: Listen to yourself!

Officer Javert: No, you're right. I take it ba—

Six heavily armed federal law-enforcement officers knock down the door, handcuff Javert, and start to haul him off.

Officer K: Please! He's not carrying! And sandwiches aren't weapons!

Federal enforcement: Sandwich crime is a federal crime.

They drag him away, sirens blaring.

Officer K: That's way too many officers for a sandwich crime!

Trainee: I'm beginning to wonder if these people really care about solving sandwich crime at all.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

There are legitimate business rationales. But could corporate fear of Trump retaliation also play a role?

Goodbye MSBNC, and hello “MS NOW.”

In an announcement that has triggered widespread befuddlement and mockery, the progressive cable news network is getting rebranded.

The new name isn't meant to call to mind Microsoft or the honorific “Ms.” Instead, in the style of congressional bill-naming, MS NOW is purportedly an acronym for the following mouthful: “My Source for News, Opinion, and the World.”

Underneath this seemingly silly story, though, are currents of major change — and fear — in the mainstream media.

Understand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.

Because both MSNBC and its fellow political news network CNN are meeting the same fate; they're being jettisoned by the big corporate bethemoths that currently own them.

Those corporate behemoths — Comcast owns MSNBC, while Warner Bros. owns CNN — have legitimate business reasons for making this change. Each is offloading these political news channels, as well as various other cable networks, to a new separate company, called by some a “SpinCo” (spin-off company) and by others a “ShitCo” (no explanation needed). This is because cable news is viewed as a declining business.

Yet there's another clear implication. President Donald Trump loathes both MSNBC and CNN, and his administration has been willing and eager to wage personal and political vendettas against their corporate owners.

Take, for instance, how Paramount had to grovel before Trump because he was annoyed at Paramount-owned CBS. The Federal Communications Commission held up Paramount's merger deal until the company agreed to pay a $16 million settlement in a bogus lawsuit Trump had brought against 60 Minutes.

So now, with these spinoffs, Comcast and Warner Bros. will no longer have to worry about being punished by the federal government for MSNBC and CNN's coverage.

To be clear: Comcast's spin-off of MSNBC and other cable properties was already in the works before Trump won his second term. And there's obviously no political motivation behind Comcast ditching its other cable properties, like the USA Network, SYFY, Oxygen, the Golf Channel, CNBC, and E! (Comcast is keeping NBC News and Universal Studios.)

But since Trump began his second term, the company's thinking has apparently evolved on one point: whether MSNBC can keep its name.

Back in January, the new CEO of MSNBC's SpinCo, Mark Lazarus, said that MSNBC would keep its name after the spin-off. So the announcement Monday of the new MS NOW name was a change of plan.

This would, of course, create more obvious distance between whatever “MS NOW” is up to and the existing NBC media empire.

CNBC, in contrast, will get to keep its name despite being spun off. We don't know whether that's because they're less likely to displease Trump, less likely to cause problems for NBC's brand, or some other reason.

What we do know is that, this year, Trump has normalized the weaponization of the government against corporations who have displeased him with shocking speed. For now, at least, this has to be part of companies' strategic calculations. Placating the president is the new cost of doing business in the United States of America.

Janel Strachan, a 31-year-old New Yorker, loved her Midea air conditioner. Strachan's techie boyfriend recommended the model, and she soon became a devotee. She liked its convenient, apartment-oriented features. She could easily use an app to turn it on, and its sleek design made it easier for her to see outside. The unit, which first hit the market in 2020, was acclaimed by Wirecutter, the reviews arm of The New York Times, and developed a cult following among a certain type of consumers: Younger adults who like design and quality and have enough disposable income to throw a few hundred dollars at an AC, and aren't in a situation where they can afford or finesse a home or apartment with central air. When her parents came to visit her apartment, they were blown away.

In other words, Midea is a very millennial brand. It came with a particular air of being in the know, through both word of mouth and the more rarified reader and viewership of high-profile recommenders, and modernizing a not-so-sexy but very necessary appliance. It's an aesthetic that has come to define the generation: Appealing packaging, digital word of mouth in all of the right places, and vaguely purpose-driven (the Midea is also known for its energy efficiency). But a few months ago, Midea owners got majorly in their feels amid a big yikes. Around 1.7 million Midea units were recalled due to the risk of potential mold exposure. For Midea devotees, it was a recall heard around TikTok, X, and, yes, even The New York Times. The bad news even managed to reach my friend, who was traveling on a generally unplugged camping expedition in the Sahara Desert.

""To see that it got recalled, it was a big letdown,"" Strachan says. ""Everyone hates when tech doesn't work right.""

Of course, an air conditioner filled with mold is an extreme example, but the demographic it's tailored toward is having its own consumer reckoning. Glossier is at Sephora; Mideas are having holes drilled in them; their dentists can no longer be replaced with flashy online products. Millennials are waking up to the fact that their beloved, cutting-edge, never-done-before brands are just that — brands. The heady days of pastel-toned websites with quirky ad copy are long gone. What once seemed like a permanent move toward a direct, values-centered relationship with consumers has been exposed as a marketing ploy. The era of the trendy millennial brand is over, and the brands that have settled into just boring old retailers have emerged on top — another signpost that millennials have, just maybe, become old and boring.

The turnover of generationally-associated trends and brands is nothing new. Throughout the decades, companies that become associated with one age group face struggles as they grow. Dhananjay Nayakankuppam, a marketing professor at the University of Iowa who studies branding, gave the example of whiskey: In the 1950s and 1960s, whiskey was the drink of choice, but within 20 to 25 years, a generational shift led to whiskey falling out of favor. Whiskey supplier Brindiamo said that, from 1970 to 1990, bourbon lost almost 50% of its market share. The younger generation started pivoting toward wine and lighter alcohols as a healthier alternative. When it comes to a specific company, he pointed to the car company Buick, which had struggled to shake its stuffy, older reputation — younger consumers saw it as a grandparent car, and eventually the older generations started to question if the brand was even for them anymore.

Those are the moments when brands can end up stuck between a rock and a hard place, Nayakankuppam said. If they market themselves as still young and cool, that younger and cooler cohort might look around and see that it's only their grandparents or parents consuming those goods. At the same time, the older audience might worry that the brand is, in fact, not for them anymore.

""If you have brands which get too tightly tied to a particular cohort or a generation as that cohort and generation ages, it can leave the brand high and dry,"" Nayakankuppam said.

There are a few things that make a brand quintessentially ""millennial."" One of the hallmarks of the era was the direct-to-consumer model. Casper made the mattress shopping process into a seamless box at your doorstep. Warby Parker made it so that you could try on trendy tortoise-shell frames at home. SmileDirectClub would fix your smile with invisible aligners — until it abruptly shut down, leaving some customers high and dry but on the hook for bills.

When these brands decided to move into brick-and-mortar, they tried to make the shopping experience more interactive or immersive. At clothing brand Reformation's stores, for instance, customers can pick out an outfit ""Clueless""-style on a screen, and have items in different sizes and styles magically transport into a dressing room wardrobe. Millennial corridors — trendy downtown areas where shoppers could peruse goods straight from their Instagram ads — began to appear in urban neighborhoods and offered a sleek, fun shopping experience. This wasn't your childhood mall; stores were showrooms, and the products were the art. Beyond remaking the shelves, millennial brands made you feel good about consuming: You weren't just buying cloth slippers or hipster glasses; you were also saving the world. They were packaged in pastel fonts and winky innuendos, showing that you were with the times, or at least in on the ironic joke. In a world where the economic odds were stacked against millennials, these brands reasoned, why not make the essentials have a little bit of fun?.

Much like the generation they cater to, these brands have gone through some growing pains. Some were gobbled up by more established companies, others tried to push the limits of their business models and branch out, with varying degrees of success. The least lucky millennial brands shuttered completely or declared bankruptcy, unable to grow beyond their youthful origins and pandemic-fueled booms. Casualties included SmileDirectClub, trendy wine club Winc, cheap consumer staples maker Brandless, and online retailer Jet.com.

Now, though, run-of-the-mill big box retail stores are already shuttering thousands of locations, and it seems like the DTC brands in trendy locations are doing the same — no one is immune from the retail headwinds or the perils of the rapid-fire growth that grew out of the zero interest rate era. Part of that might also be chalked up to millennials' own life shifts: After all, many fled their urban lives in the thick of the pandemic and headed to the cheaper and more spacious suburbs. They brought some of their favorite urban brands with them, as suburban retail began to boom.

One big marker that has separated the successful millennial brands from the flops has been the use of ""integrity"" as a brand differentiator. Some companies sold an undistinguished product and relied on cause or purpose as their main distinction. By contrast, others had a ""greater good"" mentality, but didn't solely rely on that to make them stand out, Kevin McTigue, a marketing professor at Northwestern's Kellogg School of Business, said. McTigue said that the brands that succeed offer more than just that appealing concept of purpose — they actually have a product that people want. He gave the example of wunderkind Warby Parker, where consumers valued the quality of products first, and then the purpose-based mission as a nice differentiator. For all of the millennial posturing around different values and a different world, they're remarkably similar to consumers throughout time: They just want something good.

Then, there's the best-case scenario for millennial brands: shedding the higher aspirations (or hokey claims, depending on who you ask) and doubling down on making a good product. Take Glossier, arguably one of the epitomes of the millennial branding era. The makeup company started in 2014 as an outgrowth of founder Emily Weiss's Into The Gloss blog. The brand thrived, even launching a gasp physical location in Manhattan in 2018. But this was the millennial cool version of retail. Going to the store was more than just going out to buy makeup: It was a full experience. In its heyday, I would even drag out-of-town visitors there. Glossier's perfectly pink, just laidback-enough marketing worked its wonders on me, and lots of other devotees: Everyone wanted to be a cool Glossier girl. The store was multiple stories tall and built to be Instagrammed. Instead of just grabbing something off the shelf, the actual product for sale was tucked away and disbursed via workers holding iPads.

Over the past seven years, Glossier has had its own ups and downs, but it's settled into a familiar rhythm — one that isn't as sexy as a multi-story, wonderland flagship. Instead, it's a good makeup brand sold at a national, visible retailer, and at its own stores. Now, I get my Glossier at Sephora, and the brand successfully capitalized on newer trends: Its ""You"" perfume, as Business Insider's Katie Notopoulos writes, saved Glossier from the proverbial millennial dustbin of irrelevance. That original Glossier store quietly closed in 2020, although another flagship rose back up in downtown Manhattan in 2023.

""What this is suggesting is that you have a small time window of maybe 10, 15 years where you have to somehow get beyond just being a brand of that generation in some sense,"" Nayakankuppam said. ""You have to become mainstream enough that your appeal goes beyond just that generation.""

While brands like Midea may have followed the branding rules — clearly, it succeeded at marketing to a specific market segment and sold a lot of air conditioners — the recall of its trendy ACs also points to the larger fact that millennials' sway has shifted in the larger consumer market. No longer is the once trend-setting generation making headlines about the new shoes, glasses, or apparel company it's minted as a cool new darling. Instead, it's now relegated to coronating the next sensible home appliance.

Hamas has agreed to a 60-day ceasefire proposal with Israel that includes the return of half the hostages held in Gaza and Israel's release of some Palestinian prisoners, an Egyptian official source said on Monday.

Senior Hamas official Basem Naim confirmed the group's approval on Facebook. Hamas said other Palestinian factions informed mediators of their approval also.

There was no Israeli response to the Hamas proposal itself but an Israeli official confirmed it was received. Egypt and Qatar have been mediating between the sides with U.S. support.

Israel's plans to seize control of Gaza City in the heart of the Palestinian enclave have stirred alarm abroad and at home, where tens of thousands of Israelis on Sunday held some of the largest protests since the war began, urging a deal to end the fighting and free the remaining 50 hostages held in Gaza since the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023. Israeli officials believe 20 are alive.

Thousands of Palestinians fearing an imminent Israeli ground offensive have left their homes in eastern areas of Gaza City, now under constant Israeli bombardment, for points to the west and south in the shattered territory.

In an apparent show of force on Monday, Israeli tanks advanced into the Sabra suburb of Gaza City, according to witnesses who counted the presence of at least nine tanks and bulldozers.

Israel's Army Chief of Staff, Lieutenant-General Eyal Zamir, said his country was at a turning point in the Gaza war, ""with its focus on enhancing the strikes against Hamas in Gaza City,"" the military spokesman said in a statement.

In a video issued by his office, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: ""I, like you, hear the reports in the media, and from them you can get one impression - Hamas is under immense pressure.""

The Egyptian official source stated that the proposal accepted by Hamas included a suspension of Israeli military operations for 60 days and outlined a framework for a comprehensive deal to end the nearly two-year-old conflict.

A source familiar with the negotiations said the proposal closely mirrored an earlier plan put forward by U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, which Israel had accepted.

⁠The mediators met Hamas representatives in Cairo on Sunday. Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, the Qatari prime minister, joined the discussions on Monday and met both Egyptian President el-Sisi and Hamas representatives, said an official briefed on the meetings.

Israel approved the plan to take control of Gaza City earlier this month, but officials had said it could take weeks to start, leaving the door open for a ceasefire, even though Netanyahu had said it would get under way ""fairly quickly"" and end the war with Hamas' defeat.

An Israeli armored incursion into Gaza City could displace hundreds of thousands of people, many of whom have been uprooted multiple times during the war.

Netanyahu has described Gaza City as Hamas' last big urban bastion. But with Israel already holding 75% of Gaza, the military has warned that expanding the offensive could endanger hostages still alive and draw troops into protracted and deadly guerrilla warfare.

Dani Miran, whose son Omri was taken hostage on October 7, said he feared the consequences of an Israeli ground offensive in Gaza City. ""I'm scared that my son would be hurt,"" he told Reuters in Tel Aviv on Monday.

In Gaza City, many Palestinians have also been calling for protests to demand an end to a war that has demolished much of the territory and for Hamas to intensify talks to avert the Israeli ground offensive.

Ahmed Mheisen, Palestinian shelter manager in Beit Lahiya, a war-devastated suburb abutting eastern Gaza City, said 995 families had departed the area in recent days for the south.

""I am heading south because I need to ease my mental state,"" Mousa Obaid, a Gaza City resident, told Reuters. ""I do not want to keep moving left and right endlessly. There is no life left, and as you can see, living conditions are hard, prices are high, and we have been without work for over a year and a half.""

The last round of indirect ceasefire talks ended in deadlock in late July with the sides trading blame for its collapse.

Israel has said it will agree to cease hostilities if all the hostages are released and Hamas lays down its arms - the latter demand publicly rejected by the Islamist group until a Palestinian state is established.

A Hamas official told Reuters earlier on Monday the group rejected Israeli demands to disarm or expel its leaders from Gaza.

Sharp differences also appeared to remain over the extent of an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and how humanitarian aid will be delivered around the enclave, where malnutrition is rife and aid groups warn of unfolding famine.

U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on his social media platform on Monday: ""We will only see the return of the remaining hostages when Hamas is confronted and destroyed!!! The sooner this takes place, the better the chances of success will be.""

The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed across the border into southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.

More than 61,000 Palestinians have since been killed in Israel's ensuing air and ground war in Gaza, according to local health officials who do not distinguish between fighters and non-combatants.

Five more Palestinians have died of malnutrition and starvation in the past 24 hours, the Gaza health ministry said on Monday, raising the number of people who died of those causes to 263, including 112 children, since the war started.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman warned that the U.S. may be underestimating the complexity and seriousness of China's progress in artificial intelligence, and said export controls alone likely aren't a reliable solution.

""I'm worried about China,"" he said.

Over Mediterranean tapas in San Francisco's Presidio — just five miles north of OpenAI's original office in the Mission — Altman offered a rare on-the-record briefing to a small group of reporters, including CNBC. He warned that the U.S.–China AI race is deeply entangled — and more consequential than a simple who's-ahead scoreboard. 

""There's inference capacity, where China probably can build faster. There's research, there's product; a lot of layers to the whole thing,"" he said. ""I don't think it'll be as simple as: Is the U.S. or China ahead?""

Despite escalating U.S. export controls on semiconductors, Altman is unconvinced that the policy is keeping up with technical reality.

Asked whether it would be reassuring if fewer GPUs were reaching China, Altman was skeptical. ""My instinct is that doesn't work,"" he said.

""You can export-control one thing, but maybe not the right thing… maybe people build fabs or find other workarounds,"" he added, referring to semiconductor fabrication facilities, the specialized factories that produce the chips powering everything from smartphones to large-scale AI systems.

""I'd love an easy solution,"" added Altman. ""But my instinct is: That's hard.""

His comments come as Washington adjusts its policies designed to curb China's AI ambitions. The Biden administration initially tightened export controls, but in April, President Donald Trump went further — halting the supply of advanced chips altogether, including models previously designed to comply with Biden-era rules.

Last week, however, the U.S. carved out an exception for certain ""China-safe"" chips, allowing sales to resume under a controversial and unprecedented agreement requiring Nvidia and AMD to give the federal government 15% of their China chip revenue.

The result is a patchwork regime that may be easier to navigate than enforce. And while U.S. firms deepen their dependence on chips from Nvidia and AMD, Chinese companies are pushing ahead with alternatives from Huawei and other domestic suppliers — raising questions about whether cutting off supply is having the intended effect.

China's AI progress has also influenced how OpenAI thinks about releasing its own models. 

While the company has long resisted calls to make its technology fully open source, Altman said competition from Chinese models — particularly open-source systems like DeepSeek — was a factor in OpenAI's recent decision to release its own open-weight models.

""It was clear that if we didn't do it, the world was gonna head to be mostly built on Chinese open source models,"" Altman said. ""That was a factor in our decision, for sure. Wasn't the only one, but that loomed large.""

Earlier this month, OpenAI released two open-weight language models — its first since GPT-2 in 2019 — marking a significant shift in strategy for the company that has long kept its technology gated behind application programming interfaces, or APIs.

The new text-only models, called gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b, are designed as lower-cost options that developers, researchers, and companies can download, run locally, and customize.

An AI model is considered open weight if its parameters — the values learned during training that determine how the model generates responses — are publicly available. While that offers transparency and control, it's not the same as open source. OpenAI is still not releasing its training data or full source code.

With this release, OpenAI joins that wave and, for now, stands alone as the only major U.S. foundation model company actively leaning into a more open approach.

While Meta had embraced openness with its Llama models, CEO Mark Zuckerberg suggested on the company's second-quarter earnings call it may pull back on that strategy going forward.

OpenAI, meanwhile, is moving in the opposite direction, betting that broader accessibility will help grow its developer ecosystem and strengthen its position against Chinese rivals. Altman had previously acknowledged that OpenAI had been ""on the wrong side of history"" by locking up its models.

Ultimately, OpenAI's move shows it wants to keep developers engaged and within its ecosystem. That push comes as Meta reconsiders its open-source stance and Chinese labs flood the market with models designed to be flexible and widely adopted.

Still, the open-weight debut has drawn mixed reviews. 

Some developers have called the models underwhelming, noting that many of the capabilities that make OpenAI's commercial offerings so powerful were stripped out.

Altman didn't dispute that, saying the team intentionally optimized for one core use case: locally-run coding agents. 

""If the kind of demand shifts in the world,"" he said, ""you can push it to something else.""

This is CNBC's live coverage of President Donald Trump's meetings with European leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Aug. 18, 2025.

What you need to know

CNBC reporters are covering the summit live, on air and online from our bureaus in Washington; New York; London; Singapore; San Francisco; and Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.

Merz says that all of the leaders at the meeting would like to see a ceasefire in Ukraine — but Trump seems to quibble with the German chancellor's assertion.

""The way is open for complicated negotiations. And to be honest, we all would like to see a ceasefire,"" Merz says.

""The latest from the next meeting on, I can't imagine that the next meeting would [take] place without a ceasefire, so let's work on that, and let's try to put pressure on Russia,"" he says.

Trump responds by suggesting Zelenskyy and Putin will speak ""and we'll see how that works out.""

He then adds: ""In the six wars that I have settled, I haven't had a ceasefire ... So if we can do the ceasefire, great, and if we don't do a ceasefire, because many other points were given to us, many, many points were given to us, great points.""

Russia is opposed to a temporary ceasefire, and Trump took the same view after his recent summit with Putin in Alaska.

Trump says that in a ""very significant step,"" Putin agreed that Russia ""would accept security guarantees for Ukraine.""

Trump also says that the security guarantees will be a topic of discussion at the multilateral.

""I'm optimistic that collectively we can reach an agreement that would deter any future aggression against Ukraine,"" Trump says.

Zelenskyy also says that they will ""speak more about security guarantees."" 

— Erin Doherty 

Trump said, ""We also need to discuss the possible exchanges of territory, taking into consideration the current line of contact"" between Ukraine and Russia.

Trump has suggested in the past that Ukraine would have to formally cede territory to Russia, including the Crimea region.

- Dan Mangan

Trump's multilateral with Zelenskyy and leaders of Europe is now underway, a few minutes ahead of schedule.

Trump, who opens by saying that ""we've had a very successful day thus far,"" began the meeting introducing the European leaders.

""We're really honored that you guys came over,"" Trump says.

— Erin Doherty

Trump is poised to soon take a photo with the European leaders, according to the White House schedule, which this morning said it would take place around 2:30pm ET.

At roughly 3pm ET, Trump is set to participate in a multilateral meeting with the European leaders in the East Room of the White House.

Some of the European leaders have indicated that they will make a statement after their meeting with Trump.

— Erin Doherty

""Everything,"" Zelenskyy says when asked by a reporter in the Oval Office what security guarantees he's looking for from Trump to reach a deal.

""It includes two parts,"" he continues.

""It's a lot about weapon and people and training missions and intelligence,"" he says alongside Trump.

""And second, we will discuss with our partners. It depends on the big countries, on the United States, on a lot of our friends.""

— Erin Doherty

Vice President JD Vance stayed silent while Trump and Zelenskyy took questions from the press — a noticeable retreat from his aggressive posture the last time the three men were in the Oval Office.

— Kevin Breuninger

Trump says he will call Putin directly following his meetings with Zelenskyy and other European leaders.

""I just spoke to President Putin indirectly, and we're going to have a phone call right after these meetings today,"" Trump says in the Oval Office.

If that leads to a trilateral meeting between Russia, Ukraine and the U.S., then ""there's a good chance of maybe ending"" the war, Trump says.

If not, ""then the fighting continues.""

""But he's he's expecting my call when we're finished with this meeting,"" Trump says.

— Kevin Breuninger

Trump reiterates that he doesn't think there should be a ceasefire in the ongoing war.

""We can work a deal where we're working on a peace deal while they're fighting,"" Trump says from the Oval Office.

""They have to fight, I wish they could stop, I'd like them to stop, but strategically that would be a disadvantage for one side or the other,"" he continues.

Trump for weeks in the lead-up to his summit with Putin expressed the need for an urgent ceasefire.

But following his meeting with the Russian leader, he has increasingly signaled the need to ""go directly to a Peace Agreement,"" according to a social media post.

— Erin Doherty

Zelenskyy jabbed a reporter who had previously questioned his sartorial choices.

When the Ukraine leader eschewed a jacket and tie during his first visit to the White House in February, reporter Brian Glenn for the conservative network Real America's Voice asked, ""Why don't you wear a suit?""

This time around, Zelenskyy appeared in the Oval wearing an all-black suit, and Glenn, in a callback, said he looked ""fabulous.""

Zelenskyy shot back that Glenn was wearing the same suit again — prompting a big laugh from the room.

— Kevin Breuninger

Trump bemoaned how the media treats him during his meeting with Zelenskky after conservative journalist Brian Glenn asked if the press wanted him to fail.

""I used to get great publicity. Now I get the worst publicity,"" Trump said.

- Dan Mangan

Trump says that if ""everything works out well"" during his meeting with Zelenskyy, he would likely move towards a trilateral meeting with the Ukrainian leader and Putin.

""I think there will be a reasonable chance of ending the war when we do that,"" Trump says from the Oval Office.

Zelenskyy also says that he is ""ready for [a] trilateral.""

— Erin Doherty

Trump says in the Oval Office that he hopes a ""lasting peace"" between Ukraine and Russia can be reached ""immediately.""

""I hope it doesn't have to go on. And I think people of the whole world is going to be very happy when that's announced,"" Trump says.

— Kevin Breuninger

Kirill Dmitriev, the head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund and one of Putin's top negotiators, made clear that Moscow remains opposed to any short-term ceasefire deal with Ukraine.

Dmitriev on X posted an emoji of a dove with an olive branch in its beak after the words ""Lasting Peace,"" contrasting that goal with a ""Temporary Ceasefire.""

Trump echoed the same sentiment after his summit with Putin in Alaska.

— Kevin Breuninger

Meloni of Italy arrived at the White House a few minutes before 12:30pm ET.

The last time Meloni was at the White House was in April to discuss tariffs with the president.

— Erin Doherty

Just before arriving at the White House, Zelenskyy says European leaders are united in pursuit of a lasting peace.

""Together with the leaders of Finland, the United Kingdom, Italy, the European Commission, and the NATO Secretary General, we coordinated our positions ahead of the meeting with President Trump,"" he wrote on X.

""Our main goal is a reliable and lasting peace for Ukraine and for the whole of Europe,"" he said.

""We understand that we shouldn't expect Putin to voluntarily abandon aggression and new attempts at conquest. That is why pressure must work, and it must be joint pressure – from the United States and Europe, and from everyone in the world who respects the right to life and the international order.""

— Kevin Breuninger

Rutte arrived at the White House a few minutes after noon ahead of Zelenskyy's meeting with Trump.

He is the first of the European leaders to arrive at the White House.

— Erin Doherty

Vice President JD Vance, who previously chastised Zelenskyy in the Oval Office over his alleged ingratitude toward Trump, will attend the Ukraine leader's meeting with the U.S. president, a source familiar with the matter told NBC News.

Zelenskyy's first visit to the White House in late February devolved into a stunning on-camera argument, with Vance accusing him of disrespect and Trump claiming that he was ""gambling with World War III.""

Vance then asked Zelenskyy, ""Have you said thank you once?""

Zelenskyy left the White House soon after.

— Kevin Breuninger

The European leaders accompanying Zelenskyy to the White House are expected to participate in a lunch upon their arrival.

Zelenskyy, who is poised to meet with Trump at 1:15pm ET, is meeting at the Ukrainian embassy in Washington, D.C., ahead of the meeting.

Von der Leyen and Stubb attended the meeting at the embassy, and other European leaders are likely to also join.

After the European leaders' meeting with Trump, which is set to begin at 3pm ET, some are expected to make public remarks.

— Erin Doherty

The French president landed at Dulles Airport outside Washington, DC, at 11:26 a.m. ET.

He will head directly to the White House.

— Kevin Breuninger

Today's meetings come three days after Trump and Putin met in Anchorage, Alaska, for several hours, but ended that session without a ceasefire that the U.S. president had said he wanted.

""There's no deal until there's a deal,"" Trump said after that meeting on Friday.

On Saturday, Trump wrote on Truth Social: ""It was determined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a Peace Agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere Ceasefire Agreement, which often times do not hold up.""

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that a ceasefire was ""not off the table.""

- Dan Mangan

Starmer has landed at Joint Base Andrews outside of Washington, D.C., for the planned meetings. 

- Dan Mangan

European Council President Antonio Costa said he will convene a video conference of members of the council for Tuesday ""for a debriefing of today's meetings in Washington DC about Ukraine.""

""Together with the US, the EU will continue working towards a lasting peace that safeguards Ukraine's and Europe's vital security interests,"" Costa wrote in a tweet.

The European Council is comprised of the heads of state of European Union member nations.

- Dan Mangan

Michael O'Hanlon, foreign policy research director at the Brookings Institution, says that one question ahead of the talks is whether the U.S. can ""cajole President Zelenskyy into at least a de facto swap,"" giving up some land in exchange for a peace deal.

""It may not have to be something that could be legally blessed and Ukraine could still retain its claims to all the land ... but acknowledge that for now and forever it's not going to fight to get that land back,"" he tells CNBC.

He says that he believes European leaders are ""pragmatic enough to know that Ukraine's not going to win back all of its land.""

— Erin Doherty

Oil prices are barely budging ahead of Trump's talks with Zelenskyy and other European leaders, as investors look for developments on Russia's war in Ukraine that could affect global energy flows.

That lack of movement coincides with Trump appearing to back off his threats to impose additional sanctions on Russia, even though his Alaskan summit with Putin produced no ceasefire or peace agreements.

Russia has faced U.S. sanctions on parts of its oil industry over the war. But Trump recently hit a third country, India, with higher tariffs because, he said, it continues to buy Russian oil.

Peter Navarro, one of Trump's top trade advisors, slammed India earlier today for continuing to buy Russian crude oil, calling the Asian nation ""opportunistic"" in an op-ed for the Financial Times.

— Kevin Breuninger

UK Prime Minister Starmer posted a video on X from his plane explaining his reasons for flying to  Washington to meet with Trump and Zelensky.

""This war in Ukraine's been going on a really long time now, I mean, three-plus years. Hugely impacted the Ukrainians, who have suffered hugely, "" Starmer said.

""But it's also impacted Europe. It's impacted every single family and community in the United Kingdom, and so everybody wants it to end, not the least the Ukrainians,"" he said.

""But we've got to get this right,"" Starmer added. ""We've got to make sure there is peace, that it is lasting peace, and that is fair and that it is just, and that's why I'm traveling to Washington with other European leaders to discuss this face-to-face with President Trump and President Zelenskyy.""

""Because it's in everyone's interests, it's in the UK's interests, that we get this right,"" he said.

- Dan Mangan

Zelenskyy has finished his meeting with Trump's Special Representative for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, which took place in the last hour at the Hay-Adams Hotel across from the White House.

""​When peace is discussed for one country in Europe, it means peace for all of Europe. We are ready to continue working with maximum effort to end the war and to ensure reliable security. These are the key issues,"" Zelenskyy said afterwards.

— Christina Wilkie

European leaders plan to begin arriving at the White House around 12 p.m. ET

Trump is expected to greet Zelenskyy at the White House at 1 p.m. ET.

The two leaders are scheduled to begin bilateral talks there at 1:15 p.m.

- Dan Mangan

While it's unusual for so many European leaders to travel to the White House at once, each making the trip has already met with Trump during his second term.

Zelenskyy notoriously met with Trump in February, during a meeting that quickly devolved into a shouting match.

While this will be von der Leyen's first time at the White House this term, she has met with the president before, including last month in Turnberry, Scotland.

Rutte has traveled to the White House at least twice since Trump's return to office, once in March and the other time in July.

Starmer, Merz, Meloni and Macron have all previously met with Trump at the White House at least once, while Stubb is making his first trip this term.

Stubb played golf with Trump earlier this year, however.

— Erin Doherty

Trump continued to complain about the ongoing criticism of his summit with Putin in Alaska last Friday, which ended with no ceasefire or peace deal and was followed by an abridged ""press conference"" that allowed no questions from the press.

""I am totally convinced that if Russia raised their hands and said, 'We give up, we concede, we surrender, we will GIVE Ukraine and the great United States of America, the most revered, respected, and powerful of all countries, EVER, Moscow and St. Petersburg, and everything surrounding them for a thousand miles, the Fake News Media and their Democrat Partners would say that this was a bad and humiliating day for Donald J. Trump, one of the worst days in the history of our Country,'"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

""But that's why they are the FAKE NEWS, and the badly failing Radical Left Democrats. Thank you for your attention to this matter!!!""

— Kevin Breuninger

Hours before his meeting with Trump, Zelenskyy accused Russia of deliberately attacking civilian targets in Ukraine in order to undermine the upcoming peace talks at the White House and raise pressure on Kyiv and Europe.

""This was a demonstrative and cynical Russian strike,"" Zelenskyy wrote in an X post that included video footage of an apartment building on fire with massive holes in its roof.

He said at least 10 people have been killed and dozens more injured in Russian attacks in Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia and the Sumy region. He also said that Russia struck an Azerbaijani-owned energy facility in Odesa, calling it ""an attack not only on us but also on our relations and energy security.""

""Putin will commit demonstrative killings to maintain pressure on Ukraine and Europe, as well as to humiliate diplomatic efforts. That is precisely why we are seeking assistance to put an end to the killings,"" Zelenskyy said. ""That is why reliable security guarantees are required. That is why Russia should not be rewarded for its participation in this war. The war must be ended. And it is Moscow that must hear the word: 'Stop.'""

— Kevin Breuninger

Trump said it is ""a big day at the White House"" in a Truth Social post ahead of his meeting with Zelenskyy.

""We have never had so many European Leaders here at one time,"" he wrote, calling the convening of leaders across the European Union a ""great honor for America.""

""Lets see what the results will be???"" he continued.

The European leaders, which include French President Emmanuel Macron, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, are set to arrive at the White House at noon.

Satellite internet service Starlink, which is owned and operated by Elon Musk's SpaceX, appeared to suffer a brief network outage on Monday, with thousands of reports of service interruptions on Downdetector, a site that logs tech issues.

The outage marked the second in two weeks for Starlink. SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The network's July 24 outage lasted for several hours, with SpaceX Vice President of Starlink Engineering Michael Nicolls blaming the matter on ""failure of key internal software services that operate the core network"" behind Starlink.

That outage followed the launch of T-Mobile's Starlink-powered satellite service, a direct-to-cell-phone service created to keep smartphone users connected ""in places no carrier towers can reach,"" according to T-Mobile's website.

SpaceX provides Starlink internet service to more than six million users across 140 countries, according to the company's website, though churn and subscriber rates are not publicly reported by the company.

The SpaceX Starlink constellation is far larger than any competitor. It currently features over 7,000 operational broadband satellites, according to research by astronomer Jonathan McDowell.

On Monday, Musk's SpaceX successfully launched another group of satellites to add to its Starlink constellation from the Vandenberg Space Force Base in Southern California.

SpaceX is currently aiming to increase the number of launches and landings from Vandenberg from 50 to about 100 annually.

On Thursday last week, the California Coastal Commission voted unanimously to oppose the U.S. Space Force application to conduct that higher volume of SpaceX launches there.

The Commission has said that SpaceX and Space Force officials have failed to properly evaluate and report on potential impacts of increased launches on neighboring towns, and local wildlife, among other issues.

President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order seeking to ease environmental regulations seen by Musk, and others, as hampering commercial space operations.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","'Job hugging' has replaced job-hopping, consultants say, as workers cling to current roles","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/18/job-hugging-job-hopping.html","Mon, 18 Aug 2025 10:50:01 GMT","



The so-called great resignation has become the ""great stay."" But experts say workers aren't just staying — they're ""job hugging.""

Job hugging is the act of holding onto a job ""for dear life,"" consultants at Korn Ferry, an organizational consulting firm, wrote last week.

The rate at which workers are voluntarily leaving their jobs — known as the quits rate — has hovered around 2% since the start of the year, according to data from the U.S. Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. Outside of the initial days of the Covid-19 pandemic, levels haven't been that consistently low since early 2016.

The quits rate is a barometer of workers' perceptions of the broader labor market, said Laura Ullrich, director of economic research in North America at the Indeed Hiring Lab. In this case, they may be nervous about getting another job or aren't enthusiastic about their ability to find one, she said.

The current clinging is a stark contrast from the historic rate of job-hopping that workers exhibited in 2021 and 2022, but experts say it makes sense given current labor market trends.

The share of jobseekers who are ""not confident at all"" that there are ""plenty of jobs"" available has increased steadily, to 38% in the second quarter from about 26% three years earlier, according to a quarterly poll by ZipRecruiter.

""There is this stagnation in the labor market, where the hires, quits and layoff rates are low,"" said Ullrich. ""There's just not a lot of movement at all.""

""There's quite a bit of uncertainty in the world — economic, political, global — and I think uncertainty causes people to naturally"" remain in a holding pattern, said Matt Bohn, an executive search consultant at Korn Ferry.

He equated the dynamic to skittish investors who sometimes sit on the sidelines, waiting for an investment opportunity.

The job market has also gradually cooled amid a regime of higher interest rates, which makes it more costly for businesses to borrow money and expand their operations.

The hiring rate over the past year or so has plunged to its lowest pace in more than a decade (excluding the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic) — meaning those who want to look for a new job may have a relatively tough time finding one.

Job growth in recent months has also slowed sharply, which economists point to as evidence of a broader economic slowdown. The ratio of job openings per unemployed worker has fallen by about half since peaking at about 2:1 in March 2022; it was roughly 1:1 in June 2025, the latest month of available federal data.

More CEOs reported plans to shrink their workforce over the next 12 months than expand it — the first time that's occurred since 2020, according to a Conference Board quarterly poll published earlier this month. The shares were 34% to 27%, respectively.

While it's not inherently bad to stay in a job for a long time, job ""hugging"" can pose some risks for the unwary, experts said.

For one, they may be sacrificing some earnings growth, since job switchers generally command higher wage growth than those who remain in their current roles, Ullrich said.

For example, workers who get too comfortable in their current role may stagnate rather than take on additional responsibility or learn new skills, which may impact marketability and career growth when the labor market improves, Bohn said. Employers may also decide such workers are no longer meeting their performance standards, he added.

Additionally, a lack of movement in the job market may make it harder for new entrants like recent graduates to find work, Ullrich said.

Correction: This article has been updated to correct the timing of the Korn Ferry and Conference Board reports.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Bitcoin Price Slides Below $115,000 As Strategy And Metaplanet Buys Additional Bitcoin","https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoin-price-slides-below-115000-as-strategy-and-metaplanet-buys-additional-bitcoin","Mon, 18 Aug 2025 13:42:57 GMT","

Bitcoin price dropped below $115,000 as Metaplanet acquired 775 BTC for $93 million at $120,006 per coin, bringing its holdings to 18,888 BTC, while Strategy purchased 430 BTC for $51.4 million, increasing its total to 629,376 BTC.

Bitcoin's price retreated below $115,000 on Monday as two major corporate buyers, Strategy and Metaplanet, announced additions to their Bitcoin treasuries, highlighting the growing trend of institutional accumulation despite market volatility.

Metaplanet, the Tokyo-listed company, acquired 775 BTC for approximately $93 million at an average price of $120,006 per coin, bringing its total holdings to 18,888 BTC acquired for $1.94 billion. The purchase maintains the company's position as the seventh-largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with an average acquisition cost of $102,653 per Bitcoin across all purchases.

“Metaplanet now hold ~$2.18 billion in $BTC against just ~$0.12 billion of outstanding 0% ordinary bonds,” noted Dylan LeClair, director of bitcoin strategy. “Our 19th Series Ordinary Bonds are 18.67x over-collateralized by our BTC position (BTC Rating: 18.67x), and currently represent the sole liability within our capital structure.”

Simultaneously, Michael Saylor's Strategy reported purchasing 430 BTC for $51.4 million between August 11-17, at an average price of $119,666 per coin. The US-based company's total holdings now stand at 629,376 BTC, acquired at an average price of $73,320 per coin, with an aggregate purchase value of $46.15 billion.

The acquisitions come amid an unprecedented surge in corporate Bitcoin treasury adoption, with the number of public companies holding Bitcoin increasing to over 200 in the past quarter alone. This rapid expansion reflects growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a treasury asset, despite short-term price fluctuations.

We're witnessing a fundamental shift in corporate treasury management. Companies are increasingly viewing Bitcoin as a strategic asset class, with new entrants joining the market almost daily.

Metaplanet's systematic approach to Bitcoin acquisition has been particularly noteworthy, with the company executing over 20 separate purchases since July 2024, growing its holdings from under 200 BTC to its current position. The company reported a Bitcoin Yield of 29.3% for the latest period, though down from 129.4% in Q2, while maintaining a near-record low multiple to net asset value.

Strategy has also updated its equity issuance guidance, announcing it will tactically issue shares to fund debt obligations and preferred equity dividends when its modified Net Asset Value (mNAV) falls below 2.5x. The company will opportunistically issue equity to acquire Bitcoin between 2.5x and 4.0x mNAV, and actively pursue acquisitions above 4.0x.

The increasing sophistication of corporate Bitcoin strategies reflects a maturing market. We're seeing innovative financing structures and treasury management approaches specifically designed for Bitcoin acquisition.

The corporate buying activity comes as Bitcoin price trades near $116,000, down from its recent high of $124,000. Despite the pullback, institutional demand remains robust, with U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETFs recording significant inflows and corporate treasuries continuing to accumulate.

As more corporations embrace Bitcoin as a treasury asset, the market continues to develop new financial instruments and investment vehicles designed specifically for institutional Bitcoin exposure. This growing institutional adoption may signal a new phase in Bitcoin's evolution from a speculative asset to a mainstream treasury holding, even as prices experience short-term volatility.

抱歉，發生錯誤

(Bloomberg) -- In the grand banking hall of Cipriani 42nd Street in Manhattan last week, crypto advocates gathered beneath marble columns and chandeliers to declare the arrival of a new financial era — one that goes way beyond Bitcoin.

Just days earlier, Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world, had surged by about 75% since June to an almost all-time high. Now, inside the former Bowery Savings Bank building, digital-asset executives gathered for what felt like both a victory lap and a sales pitch. The campaign: to convince the financial community that Ether is not just another speculative coin, but the core of a future monetary system — and that corporate treasuries locking it away could accelerate that vision.

Chicago Schools Seeks $1 Billion of Short-Term Debt as Cash Gone

Tom Lee, the chairman of BitMine Immersion Technologies Inc., took the stage. His company — little known on Wall Street but now sitting on more than $6 billion in Ether — has made a simple bet: don't just own Ethereum, build an enterprise around it. Lee's pitch, homed in countless online videos to a retail following, is sweeping.

“Ethereum is where Wall Street and AI will converge,” he said.

It's a bold claim for a network that still sees most of its activity tied to trading tokens between crypto users. But to Lee, the underlying logic is clear: Ethereum, unlike Bitcoin, isn't just money. It's a programmable ledger where software programs called “smart contracts” can run automatically: processing trades, paying interest or managing loans without a bank in the middle.

People use it to swap cryptocurrencies, move stablecoins or take out crypto-backed loans — and each time, they pay a fee in Ether. The more businesses and projects that rely on its rails, the more demand there is for the token. If corporate treasuries quietly accumulating Ether are right, they'll not only profit from its price rising, but from having called the architecture of tomorrow's financial system before it was built.

While Ethereum remains the busiest blockchain by on-chain value, it faces two big headwinds: competition from faster, cheaper rivals like Solana — which hit record highs this year — and a persistent shortage of fresh, committed buyers. Lee and Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin see treasury programs as a structural fix to that demand problem, locking away supply and giving the market a sturdier floor.

“There's still a lot of Ether out there,” Lubin told Bloomberg in July. “It's a bit of a race right now. Because if we lock away lots of Ether and many other projects lock away lots of Ether, that's really good for the supply-demand dynamics.”

That vision meets resistance in another form: the biggest names in finance are building private versions of the same “blockchain rails.” Stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group Inc. is creating a network it will control — cutting fees, keeping customers in-house and bypassing the shared-infrastructure model Ethereum promotes. If that proprietary trend holds, Ethereum could find itself boxed out of the very systems it hopes to power. Stripe Inc. is reportedly doing the same.

The corporate-treasury playbook is borrowed directly from Bitcoin's most famous evangelist, Michael Saylor, who turned Strategy Inc. into a quasi-Bitcoin ETF in 2020 and over time amassed $72 billion worth of the token. BitMine's version is smaller — 1% of Ether's circulating supply — but the ambition is the same: lock up so much of the asset that scarcity itself becomes a moat. Lee notes that if Wall Street piles into Ethereum projects, the token's value could jump to $60,000 from around $4,300 currently. Whether Ether can replicate Bitcoin's corporate treasury success is less certain since Saylor's moves coincided with a historic crypto bull run.

“Michael Saylor at Strategy has proven over four years that owning the underlying is great, but through an ETH treasury strategy — through a liquid public company — you can have multiple of the value of the underlying for the benefit of the shareholders,” Joseph Chalom, co-CEO of Sharplink Gaming Inc. told Bloomberg Television. He is a former BlackRock Inc. executive, who during his time at the world's largest asset manager, helped launch its Ether ETF under the ticker ETHA. SharpLink has accumulated over $3 billion in Ether.

Proponents argue the math works in Ethereum's favor. Ether's issuance is low, and because a portion of every transaction fee is permanently destroyed, supply can even shrink over time. Long-term treasuries could amplify that scarcity. Skeptics point out the risk on the other side of the cycle: corporate holders can sell just as quickly as they buy, potentially magnifying downturns.

“People in crypto like treasury companies because they think that treasury companies will only ever buy and hold,” said Omid Malekan, adjunct professor at Columbia Business School. “But there is no such thing as a free lunch. And what most people misunderstand is that there are scenarios in the future, particularly in a crypto bear market, where the treasury company may start selling.”

One of Ethereum's biggest advantages over Bitcoin is staking — locking up Ether to help run the network in exchange for yield. It's pitched as a way to turn Ether into a yield-bearing asset — more like a dividend-paying stock than a static commodity. But for now, most mainstream exchange-traded-fund investors can't access that yield directly.

Alongside other issuers, BlackRock is seeking to add staking to ETHA, according to a regulatory filing in July, which could open the door for retail traders to capture both price gains and yield in the same product. The fund has amassed some $16 billion in just over a year.

For all the activity on Ethereum, most people still don't use it for everyday money tasks — sending payments, shopping or saving. Many Wall Street tokenization projects are still in testing. Lee says the shift is already underway, pointing to early moves by AI firms, payment companies and large financial institutions to build directly on Ethereum.

“I see many story arcs that are making Ethereum the biggest macro trade over the next 10 to 15 years,” he said. 

Ethereum's believer base now stretches from bank research desks to political operatives. World Liberty Financial Inc, a decentralized-finance venture linked to Donald Trump's circle, disclosed millions in Ether purchases this year. Eric Trump, co-founder of American Bitcoin Corp., has publicly cheered its rally. Standard Chartered Plc now pegs its year-end target at $7,500, up from $4,000. Ark Investment Management has also raised its long-term forecasts.

The price gains are real. The corporate holdings are real. The belief is sincere. But the test isn't whether Ethereum can go up. It's whether it can stick, whether these companies will hold through the next crash, whether the token becomes more than just a bet.

“Financial institutions see Ethereum as a natural choice,” said Tomasz Stańczak, executive director of the Ethereum Foundation. “They understand what products have to be built, what can be improved, and where the efficiency gains are.”

The altcoin buzz is back. With talk of another strong cycle ahead, traders are sizing up old rivals XRP and Cardano (ADA). Both have fresh catalysts, passionate communities, and very different strengths. The big question: which one has the better long-term shot?

Here's some information for you to make a decision.

XRP is holding close to $3 after a sharp market pullback, with analysts eyeing a possible push toward the $3.50–$4.00 range if altcoin momentum builds. Some even see a run toward $4.50 in a high-liquidity breakout.

Cardano, on the other hand, is making headlines with a sudden rally. ADA has seen a 15.86% jump over the last week to now $0.9116, thanks to speculation about a Grayscale Cardano Trust ETF. Technicals look strong, with a golden cross in play and bullish trend signals backing the move.

Ripple's big win against the SEC has given XRP something it has never had before – regulatory clarity. That's opening doors for wider adoption. RippleNet now handles billions in monthly transactions, with banks in Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America already using XRP for faster, cheaper cross-border payments.

Every transaction also burns a small amount of XRP, creating a deflationary effect that could tighten supply in the long run. Add growing institutional interest and potential ETF exposure, and the setup looks solid.

Still, XRP has its drawbacks. Ripple controls much of the network, raising centralization concerns. And with a large market cap already, some argue the upside may be more limited compared to smaller competitors.

Cardano has built its reputation on patience. Its Hydra scaling upgrade is expected to improve transaction speeds and cut costs, and is aiming at full implementation in 2025.

DeFi activity on Cardano is also picking up, with total value locked hitting new highs. Long-term projections are bold: analysts see ADA in the $3.10–$3.50 range during a strong altcoin season, and as high as $9–$10 by 2030.

But critics say progress is too slow. Hydra has been years in the making, yet adoption remains thin. Liquidity is limited, and Cardano still lacks a killer app to drive mainstream growth. One Reddit user put it bluntly: “People have been saying it's a bright future for years… but when is that actually going to come to fruition so we can say it's good in the present tense?”

XRP and ADA also reflect their leaders.

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has made regulation and institutions his main focus. This year alone he pushed Ripple deeper into stablecoin infrastructure with a $200 million acquisition. He's often described XRP's price potential with a simple metaphor: like “a basketball held underwater” waiting to surge.

Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has shifted gears in 2025. Once known for his academic, slow-moving approach, he's now leaning toward agile development, stronger governance, and more transparency.

The XRP community is famously loyal and remains confident that adoption and regulation will push the token higher.

Cardano's base is more split. Many holders see ADA's decentralization and governance model as the best bet for the future. But others are frustrated with delays, limited DeFi growth, and overhyped upgrades that haven't delivered.

If you want regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, and a proven payments use case, XRP may be the safer near-term option.

If you believe in decentralization, slow but steady innovation, and the potential for long-term growth, Cardano might hold more upside.

Either way, the XRP vs ADA debate is heating up again and both tokens are set to play a major role in the next altcoin season.

Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more.

XRP offers adoption and clarity, while Cardano promises decentralization and long-term upside.

XRP gains momentum from legal clarity, bank adoption, and deflationary token burns per transaction.

 Circle's new layer 1 blockchain will debut with Fireblocks support as the stablecoin sector expands, with Circle and Tether vying for market dominance. 

Circle's new layer-1 blockchain Arc will integrate with Fireblocks, a New York–based digital asset custody and tokenization platform serving more than 2,400 banks, asset managers and fintechs. Arc is not yet live, but Circle plans to roll out a public testnet this fall ahead of a full launch by year-end.

Fireblocks said it prepares custody and compliance support so clients can transact on Arc once the network launches. Its platform supports over 120 blockchains and facilitates settlement for institutions across global markets.

The unusually early integration drew some criticism on X. Solana, for example, launched in 2020, but wasn't added to Fireblocks until late 2021, after its ecosystem reached critical mass. Arc will instead debut with Fireblocks integration, giving banks and asset managers “day one” access.

While US regulators advanced clarity around stablecoins with the GENIUS Act signed on July 18, Circle has been expanding its footprint.

On June 5, Circle raised $1.05 billion in the first IPO by a stablecoin issuer. Shares opened at $69, climbed as high as $103.75, and closed at $83.23 — a gain of 168% from the IPO price. The stock reached as high as $298.99 on July 23, and is currently trading around $145.

The company's first earnings report since going public was released on Tuesday, reporting $658 million in Q2 revenue, a 53% increase year-over-year. It said circulation of USDC grew 90% over the same period, reaching $61.3 billion by June 30 and climbing above $65 billion in early August.

That same day, Circle moved to expand its payments infrastructure with the launch of the Circle Payments Network, and announced Arc — describing it as a layer 1 purpose-built chain for “stablecoin finance.”

While Circle was ahead of the curve with its IPO, the Arc announcement comes amid a broader wave of new blockchain launches, including Stripe developing Tempo with Paradigm and Robinhood rolling out a tokenization-focused L2 in June.

The stablecoin market cap now stands at roughly $277.16 billion, up from $253.87 billion on July 1, according to data from DefiLlama. While Circle's USDC accounts for about a quarter of the fiat-backed stablecoin market, Tether continues to dominate globally with around 60% market share.

Tether reported $4.9 billion in profit in Q2 2025, a 277% increase compared with the same period a year earlier. Most of that profit came from Treasury yields, with the company's $127 billion short-term US debt generating steady income. 

Tether has now become one of the largest non-sovereign holders of US Treasurys, surpassing countries such as South Korea and the UAE, an unprecedented position for a private company.

ByGary Weinstein,

 Contributor. 

A new class of infrastructure is emerging—one that operates above our cities, outside traditional institutions, and is owned by the people who help build it. At the intersection of AI, climate response, and real-time spatial data, blockchain-verified drone networks are beginning to challenge satellites as the dominant source of Earth imagery.

One startup, Spexi, is helping lead that shift.

When a wildfire tears through a hillside or a logistics firm needs post-storm damage data in hours, not days, satellites can't keep up. For decades, Earth observation has depended on slow, expensive, and carbon-intensive systems: orbiting satellites, manned aircraft, and static site surveys.

Spexi, a startup based in Vancouver, BC, is flipping that model. By enlisting thousands of microdrone pilots to operate within a standardized flight protocol, the company is building a real-time, blockchain-verified imaging network that's faster, cheaper, greener—and far more scalable.

Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks, or DePINs, are emerging as a new blueprint for how physical systems such as compute, connectivity, and environmental sensing can be deployed. Rather than relying on centralized entities to build and maintain infrastructure, DePINs distribute that responsibility—and the value that flows from it—to the individuals who help operate them.

In Spexi's case, that infrastructure layer is Earth imagery.

“Most infrastructure is built top-down—slow, opaque, and exclusive,” said Spexi CEO, Bill Lakeland, in my interview with him. “We're building it bottom-up. Aerial data is just the beginning.”

In this model, Spexi is more than a drone company. It becomes a spatial protocol serving carbon markets, AI models, insurance claims, smart city systems, and logistics providers that require verified, high-resolution, and frequently updated ground truth.

Before launching Spexi, Lakeland spent two decades in traditional aerial mapping, operating fixed-wing aircraft with high-resolution cameras to capture imagery for municipalities and insurers. But as demand grew for more frequent and localized imagery, he saw the economics of traditional mapping collapse—too slow, too costly, and too infrequent to meet the pace of climate-driven disasters.

“You can add more planes, more pilots—but it's never enough,” Lakeland said. “What we needed was ubiquity. And that meant changing who flies, and why.”

The answer was a fly-to-earn model. Spexi now coordinates a fleet of sub-250g drones—lightweight enough to avoid stricter aviation requirements in most jurisdictions—flown autonomously by distributed pilots via a mobile app. These drones capture 25-acre tiles known as Spexigons, creating a uniform spatial grid across diverse terrain.

Onboarding takes minutes. A pilot downloads the Spexi app, verifies their license (where required), links a crypto wallet, and is ready to fly. Once near a mission zone, they connect their drone, tap “fly,” and supervise a fully autonomous capture. Images are uploaded via the Spexi web app, and the pilot is rewarded once the flight is validated. The process is virtually seemless.

“Most people don't even hear the drone,” said Alec Wilson, Spexi's cofounder and COO. “It's just a quiet, nearly invisible layer in the sky.”

To date, over 4,000 pilots have flown nearly 100,000 missions, covering more than 2.3 million acres across 170 cities in North America and Europe.

Spexi's core innovation isn't in the drones—it's in the data integrity baked into each mission.

Each flight generates a Proof of Capture: a hashed packet of GPS telemetry, altitude, timestamp, and image metadata recorded on-chain in real time. These are cryptographically verifiable receipts of where, when, and how an image was captured.

Accuracy is paramount. “We're not just uploading images,” Lakeland explained. “We're minting [soulbound NFTs] that prove an image was captured by a compliant drone, at a specific time, place, and elevation.”

The system was originally deployed on Flow but has since migrated to Ethereum Layer 2 Base, enabling low-cost validation and compatibility with the broader EVM ecosystem.

According to the team, metadata is sourced directly from the capture app and includes geolocation, timestamp, and file size—key elements to ensure submitted images match the claimed mission and can't be spoofed. This architecture makes Spexi's data not just visually accurate, but cryptographically trusted—critical for downstream use in AI pipelines, insurance claims, or regulatory-grade climate models.

To avoid centralizing control over what may become a globally relevant data layer, Spexi established the LayerDrone Foundation—an independent nonprofit that oversees the smart contracts, economic logic, and access controls behind the LayerDrone Protocol.

According to Wilson, “[w]e're building this to be community-owned infrastructure. The Foundation manages the protocol. Spexi is just the first major contributor.”

Over time, the team expects tokens to govern protocol upgrades, incentive structures, and access policies, drawing inspiration from prior DePIN networks like Helium and Render, but tuned for the unique demands of drone-based capture.

Today, pilots are paid in fiat and accrue non-transferable reputation scores based on mission performance. These scores—tied to verified flight data—will eventually unlock access to higher-tier missions and token-based rewards.

“You can't fake your way into high rep,” Wilson said. “Every point is based on verified capture. That gives us integrity—and pilots a stake.”

The system is being designed to avoid the pitfalls that plagued early DePIN networks, such as Sybil attacks and speculative gaming. Geographic diversity and flight quality matter. Eventually, reputation may become a requirement for accessing sensitive zones or validating other contributors' data.

Spexi's ambitions go beyond image resolution. The platform aims to be a trusted data layer for real-world systems where verifiability matters. While the imagery supports insurance claims, city planning, and AI model training, it is not a substitute for licensed land surveys. The platform does not produce court-admissible boundary maps or official land maps.

During Canada's 2023 wildfire season, Spexi imagery was used to assess damage in Kelowna and Shuswap, enabling faster, more informed, and safer decision-making by emergency responders. In another case, aerial imagery helped stakeholders monitor a rising river in British Columbia that posed severe flood risks. And after devastating fires in the Palisades region of Los Angeles, Spexi imagery allowed residents and officials to verify house-by-house damage—sometimes identifying the only home left standing on a block.

“Due to the massive ability of speed and scale that this network enables, it is well-suited to be used during times when the aerial perspective is priceless,” the team noted.

Cities are also tapping Spexi for urban tree canopy tracking and infrastructure assessments. Insurance firms use it to benchmark post-disaster scenes against standardized Spexigon archives. And in San Francisco, Spexi is capturing dense imaging missions using Gaussian Splatting, supporting spatial computing models that reconstruct photorealistic environments for AI agents and simulation.

The platform is also preparing to serve carbon markets. With validation underway by Greenlines Technology, Spexi is quantifying a 99.7% emissions reduction versus fixed-wing flights and developing MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, Verification) tools to support reforestation and permanence tracking.

“Our data gives real-time ground truth,” Lakeland said. “Especially in carbon, where permanence matters—if a forest burns, that offset should be void.”

Because Spexi's drones fall below 250 grams and operate under strict protocols, missions comply with aviation regulations in most jurisdictions without requiring pilot licenses. The company also adheres to strict privacy standards, redacting faces, license plates, and private property details.

“We hold ourselves to street view standards,” Wilson said. “No facial recognition, no personally identifiable data, no rogue flying.”

Users currently access Spexi imagery via the World Viewer web app, which can render panoramic drone captures within 15 minutes of upload. APIs and developer portals are now rolling out, with orthomosaic products coming soon—enabling Spexi's data to plug directly into third-party tools, dashboards, or AI pipelines.

In a world increasingly shaped by climate risk, AI automation, and decentralized coordination, infrastructure must evolve beyond centralized planning and institutional control. It must be fast, composable, and verifiable—owned by the people who build and use it.

Spexi's vision is to make high-resolution Earth imagery not just more accessible, but more trustworthy.

“We're building the most accessible ultra-high resolution Earth imagery network in history,” the company said, “powered by drones, owned by users, and designed for a future where geospatial data is open, decentralized, and fuels the next generation of real-world intelligence.”

Satellites see from afar. Planes scan by schedule. Spexi completes the picture—turning everyday drones into a living, trusted layer of the Earth.

A suburban man worried about an email warning he must pay a ticket for missing jury duty sends more than $15,000 to someone posing as a sheriff's official.

A Chicago woman lured into romantic conversations with an online pen pal sends her life savings to her fictional lover.

These tragic, real-life examples, in which people have used cryptocurrency kiosks to send large payments to scammers, drove Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker to sign legislation Tuesday allowing the state to regulate the booming crypto industry.

Two measures — which have been wending their way through the General Assembly in the face of past industry opposition — reached the governor's desk for approval.

One law gives the state broad regulatory power over the crypto industry, and the other provides specific consumer protections surrounding kiosks that handle digital currency transactions.

A Chicago Sun-Times story earlier this year reported that more than 1,000 of the kiosks operate in the city at convenience stores, gas stations and currency exchanges. They can convert cash into crypto and vice versa.

They're crime magnets for drug dealers who launder their illegal proceeds through the machines and for scammers who steal untraceable money from their victims, officials say.

The Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, which has been given the power to regulate digital asset exchanges and businesses, will require the crypto industry to comply with protections now in place for consumers of traditional financial services, such as banks.

Crypto businesses will have to keep enough money on hand to operate effectively and have plans to target fraud and money laundering.

To prevent fraud, the state will cap daily transaction amounts at kiosks at $2,500 for new customers, limit transaction fees at kiosks to 18%, and provide full refunds to new customers who get defrauded.

“While the Trump administration is letting crypto ‘bros' write federal policy, Illinois is implementing common sense protections for investors and consumers,” Pritzker said in a statement.

One sponsor of the legislation, Sen. Laura Ellman, said basic consumer protections in the cryptocurrency world are lacking.

“This measure addresses areas in the virtual currency market vulnerable to fraud and empowers Illinois consumers to make informed investments,” said Ellman, a Democrat from Naperville.

Crypto innovation is accelerating across finance and technology, driving initial public offering booms, reshaping artificial intelligence infrastructure and forcing policymakers to confront the future of manufacturing and global competition.

Momentum is no longer confined to speculation — it's shifting markets, fueling regulatory debates and creating new avenues for investment. TheCUBE + NYSE Wired: Crypto Trailblazers event last week highlighted how blockchain leaders are mainstreaming digital assets, while the Bullish IPO showed how far crypto has come in gaining credibility on Wall Street.

On the latest episode of theCUBE Pod, theCUBE Research Executive Analyst John Furrier (pictured, left) and Chief Analyst Dave Vellante (right) discussed these developments in detail. They explored the surge of IPO demand led by Bullish, the possibility of U.S. intervention to secure semiconductor leadership and the longer-term payoff of enterprise AI, where today's bets could yield a decade of transformation.

“The success of AI … is really digging into the hardware, the [semiconductors], tying the software as close to the hardware as possible,” Furrier said. “Again, back like we always say, in the '90s, always had that memory management processor and storage relationship to the network. The same thing is true here.”

The past year has underscored the momentum of digital assets, with IPOs now serving as a key marker of crypto's entry into mainstream finance. The Bullish IPO in particular drew intense attention, jumping to a valuation of more than $10 billion and trading well above its initial pricing, according to Vellante.

“I think on the IPO front with Bullish, I think it's a confluence of three factors,” he said. “One is obviously the regulatory climate has gone from Gary Gensler, ‘No crypto for you,' to David Sacks and the Trump Administration of, ‘Come on in. We want to be the world's leading destination for crypto innovation.'”

This momentum reflects not just investor interest, but also a maturing ecosystem. The 2017 initial coin offering boom may have sparked early enthusiasm, but today's offerings are driven by infrastructure and ventures with staying power. The concentration of activity at the New York Stock Exchange signals how seriously Wall Street is taking these shifts, Vellante added.

“There's just such a pent-up demand for IPOs,” he said. “The New York Stock Exchange has become the place for crypto action, and there's a lot of momentum right now.”

Alongside crypto innovation, the conversation increasingly turns to the role of AI and government strategy in shaping global competition. From Perplexity AI Inc.'s bold $34 billion overture to buy Chrome to concerns about Intel Corp.'s future in advanced semiconductor manufacturing, the theme is clear: Disruption is accelerating and national policy is never far behind, Furrier explained.

“This is the thesis that the U.S. is saying: ‘Let's save Intel.' This is a bailout like they did with GM in the auto industry. That's what some speculate,” he said. “I'm saying, maybe there's a little bit more here, a little more upside potential.”

These pressures tie directly into how innovation unfolds. The AI arms race requires custom silicon, deeper software-hardware integration and government backing for secure supply chains. As companies such as Nvidia Corp., Amazon Web Services Inc. and Anthropic PBC align hardware and AI models more closely, the question is no longer whether disruption will happen, but how fast, Vellante emphasized.

“The only way you can catch up is if you have unlimited capacity or unlimited cash and unlimited time and patience to bomb pricing, lose money for a long, long time so you can gain market share, get on the learning curve — which is essentially what Wright's Law is — and then compete for volume so that you can at least become a viable second source to TSM,” he said.

Looking back at recent milestones, the momentum of digital assets and related technologies is evident. TheCUBE + NYSE Wired: Crypto Trailblazers event showcased how leading voices in blockchain and finance are driving mainstream adoption and crypto innovation, while the Bullish IPO illustrated how fast crypto is gaining credibility in traditional markets.

“My reading in between the lines from all the interviews … was one, it's definitely mainstreaming crypto. It's happening. It's happening fast,” Furrier said. “You mentioned money. The people who have the money now are the people who are doing these deals.”

The conversations at the event also revealed how regulatory and financial systems are evolving in real time. Veteran innovators and investors who were present from the beginning are now deploying capital with a longer-term view, shaping not just markets but also future infrastructure, according to Furrier.

“They're not just funding ICOs, they're funding ventures,” he added. “This is entrepreneurial. It's not just arbitrage, make some token economics, get a token, liquidate it. There's a longer game view happening.”

The Trump administration is escalating its campaign to make the United States the “crypto capital of the world,” placing digital identity at the center of its digital assets strategy.

A request for comment from the Department of Treasury that was mandated by the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act) underscores how central identity verification has become to Washington's vision of a blockchain-driven financial future.

The notice, published Monday in the Federal Register, calls on financial institutions, technology companies, and the public to weigh in on “innovative or novel methods, techniques, or strategies to detect and mitigate illicit finance risks involving digital assets.”

Specifically, Treasury is seeking ideas on four technological pillars: application programming interfaces (APIs), AI, blockchain monitoring, and digital identity verification.

“Innovative tools are critical to advancing efforts to address illicit finance risks but can also present new resource burdens for financial institutions,” Treasury said. “As required by the GENIUS Act, Treasury will use public comments to inform research on the effectiveness, costs, privacy and cybersecurity risks, and other considerations related to these tools.”

The request for comment fulfills a requirement of the GENIUS Act, which was signed into law by President Trump in July, and aligns with his broader executive order on Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology.

Together, these moves reflect a sharp pivot from regulatory hesitancy to an assertive embrace of cryptocurrency infrastructure. In the administration's framing, digital identities are not merely compliance tools, but rather they are a foundational enabler for both security and innovation.

The Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, established by Trump's January executive order, went further in a July report that explicitly named “digital identity providers” as among the “key infrastructure providers and tools” necessary for the cryptocurrency ecosystem to flourish. The report suggested that widespread adoption of digital ID could accelerate mainstream use of digital assets and bolster trust in blockchain-based financial systems.

The report also highlighted privacy-preserving technologies such as zero-knowledge proofs and selective disclosure as mechanisms that can balance identity verification with civil liberties. These cryptographic techniques allow users to prove aspects of their identity without revealing unnecessary personal information, a nod to concerns about surveillance and privacy.

Industry voices are echoing that call. Socure's Jordan Burris, a former federal digital identity official, has argued that the U.S. urgently needs a national digital identity strategy.

While mobile driver's licenses (mDLs) are emerging as one solution, with more than five million already issued nationwide, they are only “part of the equation.” A June executive order rolled back federal support for state-based mDL pilots.

David Kelts, chair of the Secure Technology Alliance's mDL committee, pointed out that mDLs are still the only tangible credential most Americans possess in digital form. For the administration, folding these credentials into a broader crypto strategy signals an attempt to converge identity, finance, and national security priorities.

The GENIUS Act establishes a regulatory framework for dollar-backed stablecoins and requires issuers to maintain strict reserves, sets redemption requirements, and classifies them as financial institutions under the Bank Secrecy Act.

The goal, according to the White House, is to bolster the dollar's dominance in global markets while creating a consumer-protection framework to ensure confidence in payment stablecoins.

The act also mandated that the Treasury Department solicit public comment on new tools to counter illicit finance risks. In its notice, Treasury outlined the potential of AI, APIs, and blockchain analytics to spot money-laundering typologies and trace flows across pseudonymous ledgers.

But digital identity received particular emphasis, with officials noting that portable credentials could be used not only in traditional financial onboarding but also within decentralized finance smart contracts to verify users before transactions execute.

One striking element of the White House's July report is its attempt to reframe the threat of crypto-based illicit finance. Citing blockchain analytics firms, the report claimed that only 0.61 to 0.86 percent of crypto transaction volumes in 2023 -roughly $46 to $58 billion – were linked to illicit activity.

While significant in absolute terms, the figures are a fraction of global financial crime flows, which the United Nations estimates to be in the trillions.

That framing diverges sharply from Europe's new Anti-Money Laundering Authority launched in July which describes crypto service providers as “exposed to significant money laundering and terrorist financing risks.”

The U.S. Financial Action Task Force has also warned about inconsistent anti-money laundering rules across jurisdictions, cautioning that uneven enforcement leaves open channels for abuse.

Nonetheless, the Trump administration appears determined to shift away from what it has called Operation Choke Point 2.0, a Biden-era policy that allegedly pressured banks to cut ties with crypto firms. Instead, the current approach emphasizes public-private collaboration.

The Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network has withdrawn earlier proposals that targeted unhosted wallets and has disbanded its dedicated cryptocurrency enforcement unit. In its place, the administration is elevating private sector-led investigations and systems like the Illicit Virtual Asset Notification platform.

Beyond identity and illicit finance, the White House report recommended that Congress expand the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) authority to oversee digital asset markets and urged both the CFTC and Securities and Exchange Commission to create regulatory “sandboxes.”

These experimental zones would allow companies to test financial products under looser rules, while safe harbor provisions would shield innovators from liability as they scale.

The philosophy is clear: unleash innovation first, manage risks later. It is a posture consistent with Trump's campaign rhetoric about dismantling “anti-crypto” bureaucracies and positioning the U.S. as a magnet for digital finance.

The Treasury's request for comment illustrates the tension between that deregulatory spirit and the need for credible safeguards. The department outlined seven factors it will use to evaluate new tools, including costs to financial institutions, privacy risks, cybersecurity, and operational challenges.

For APIs, Treasury wants to know whether they can reliably facilitate data-sharing while enforcing strict access controls. For AI, it is interested in how machine learning can map complex illicit finance networks across blockchains.

For blockchain monitoring, it asked how analytics firms are integrating on-chain data with off-chain intelligence, and how they are overcoming obfuscation tools that complicate attribution.

But it is digital identity that looms largest. Treasury acknowledged industry efforts to create portable, privacy-preserving credentials, but also flagged the resource burdens institutions face in adopting untested tools. It specifically asked stakeholders to detail obstacles – whether legislative, regulatory, or operational – that impede widespread deployment of digital identity verification in crypto markets.

The cumulative effect of these moves is to elevate digital identity to the top tier of U.S. digital assets policy. While no national framework yet exists, the momentum is unmistakable. The GENIUS Act requires Treasury to issue further guidance and potentially new regulations once it has collected feedback.

The administration has also linked digital identity to its broader AI strategy, noting that identity verification will be critical to securing both finance and information systems.

The coming months will reveal how far the White House intends to push. Industry players are expected to respond vigorously to the Treasury's request, given that the outcome could shape everything from compliance costs to consumer trust.

 ASICKey executive Samuel Li said that solo Bitcoin miners have a one in 650,000 chance of solving a block every 10 minutes with one petahash of hashpower. 

A solo miner successfully mined a Bitcoin block on Sunday, collecting a 3.137 BTC payout, worth about $371,000 at the time.

The miner operated through the Solo CK pool, a service for solo miners. They mined block 910,440 and collected the standard 3.125 BTC and about 0.012 BTC in transaction fees. The block included 4,913 transactions, and the fees totalled $1,455. 

With Bitcoin's hashrate being dominated by massive industrial-scale mining operations, the chances of a solo miner hitting a block are slim. Yet, with efficient hardware, even smaller players can claim the same block rewards in rare instances. 

This year, several solo miners with smaller setups have claimed block rewards on their own. One successfully mined a block in February, while another netted $350,000 on July 4. On July 27, another solo miner was able to score a block alone, bagging $373,000 in rewards. 

Samuel Li, the chief technology officer of mining equipment company ASICKey, previously told Cointelegraph that solo Bitcoin miners are winning not because of luck but because of “powerful, efficient hardware.” 

Li said modern mining equipment is built to deliver serious hashrates without the power draw of traditional miners. However, this doesn't mean the odds of solo miners winning have changed. 

“Solo mining is still mostly a lottery, unless you control tens of PH/s, which is realistically the bare minimum for having a measurable statistical shot at success within a reasonable time frame,” Li told Cointelegraph.

Li said that a miner with one petahash (PH/s) of hashpower has a 1 in 650,000 chance of solving a block every 10 minutes.

Even established Bitcoin mining companies have felt the increasing network difficulty and hashrate, along with a reduced block subsidy due to Bitcoin halving. 

CryptoQuant data shows that at the time of writing, the difficulty of the Bitcoin network was at 129 trillion and was floating near all-time highs. The data also showed that network difficulty has only trended upward over time. 

Large mining companies have diversified into artificial intelligence and high-performance computing (HPC) to make up for the increased competition and shortfalls in the mining business.

I Gave My Personality to an AI agent. Here's What Happened Next

A large language model interviewed me about my life and gave the information to an AI agent built to portray my personality. Could it convince me it was me?

By Webb Wright edited by Mark Fischetti

On a gray Sunday morning in March, I told an AI chatbot my life story.

Introducing herself as Isabella, she spoke with a friendly female voice that would have been well-suited to a human therapist, were it not for its distinctly mechanical cadence. Aside from that, there wasn't anything humanlike about her; she appeared on my computer screen as a small virtual avatar, like a character from a 1990s video game. For nearly two hours Isabella collected my thoughts on everything from vaccines to emotional coping strategies to policing in the U.S. When the interview was over, a large language model (LLM) processed my responses to create a new artificial intelligence system designed to mimic my behaviors and beliefs—a kind of digital clone of my personality.

A team of computer scientists from Stanford University, Google DeepMind and other institutions developed Isabella and the interview process in an effort to build more lifelike AI systems. Dubbed “generative agents,” these systems can simulate the decision-making behavior of individual humans with impressive accuracy. Late last year Isabella interviewed more than 1,000 people. Then the volunteers and their generative agents took the General Social Survey, a biennial questionnaire that has cataloged American public opinion since 1972. Their results were, on average, 85 percent identical, suggesting that the agents can closely predict the attitudes and opinions of their human counterparts. Although the technology is in its infancy, it offers a glimmer of a future in which predictive algorithms can potentially act as online surrogates for each of us.

When I first learned about generative agents the humanist in me rebelled, silently insisting that there was something about me that isn't reducible to the 1's and 0's of computer code. Then again, maybe I was naive. The rapid evolution of AI has brought many humbling surprises. Time and again, machines have outperformed us in skills we once believed to be unique to human intelligence—from playing chess to writing computer code to diagnosing cancer. Clearly AI can replicate the narrow, problem-solving part of our intellect. But how much of your personality—a mercurial phenomenon—is deterministic, a set of probabilities that are no more inscrutable to algorithms than the arrangement of pieces on a chessboard?

The question is hotly debated. An encounter with my own generative agent, it seemed to me, could help me to get some answers.

The LLMs behind generative agents and chatbots such as ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini are certainly expert imitators. People have fed texts from deceased loved ones to ChatGPT, which could then conduct text conversations that closely approximated the departed's voices.

Today developers are positioning agents as a more advanced form of chatbot, capable of autonomously making decisions and completing routine tasks, such as navigating a Web browser or debugging computer code. They're also marketing agents as productivity boosters, onto which businesses can offload time-intensive human drudgery. Amazon, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Salesforce, Microsoft, Perplexity and virtually every major tech player has jumped onboard the agent bandwagon.

Joon Sung Park, a leader of Stanford's generative agent work, had always been drawn to what early Disney animators called “the illusion of life.” He began his doctoral work at Stanford in late 2020, after the COVID pandemic was forcing much of the world into lockdown, and as generative AI was starting to boom. Three years earlier, Google researchers introduced the transformer, a type of neural network that can analyze and reproduce mathematical patterns in text. (The “GPT” in ChatGPT stands for “generative pretrained transformer.”) Park knew that video game designers had long struggled to create lifelike characters that could do more than move mechanically and read from a script. He wondered: Could generative AI create authentically humanlike behavior in virtual characters?

He unveiled generative agents in a 2023 conference paper in which he described them as “interactive simulacra of human behavior.” They were built atop ChatGPT and integrated with an “agent architecture,” a layer of code allowing them to remember information and formulate plans. The design simulates some key aspects of human perception and behavior, says Daniel Cervone, a professor of psychology specializing in personality theory at the University of Illinois Chicago. Generative agents are doing “a big slice of what a real person does, which is to reflect on their experiences, abstract out beliefs about themselves, store those beliefs and use them as cognitive tools to interpret the world,” Cervone told me. “That's what we do all the time.”

Park dropped 25 generative agents inside Smallville, a virtual space modeled on Swarthmore College, where he had studied as an undergraduate. He included basic affordances such as a café and a bar where the agents could mingle; picture The Sims without a human player calling the shots. Smallville was a petri dish for virtual sociality; rather than watching cells multiply, Park observed the agents gradually coalescing from individual nodes into a unified network. At one point, Isabella (the same agent that would later interview me), assigned with the role of café owner, spontaneously began handing out invitations to her fellow agents for a Valentine's Day party. “That starts to spark some real signals that this could actually work,” Park told me. Yet as encouraging as those early results were, the residents of Smallville had been programmed with particular personality traits. The real test, Park believed, would lie in building generative agents that could simulate the personalities of living humans.

It was a tall order. Personality is a notoriously nebulous concept, fraught with hidden layers. The word itself is rooted in uncertainty, vagary, deception: it's derived from the Latin persona, which originally referred to a mask worn by a stage actor. Park and his team don't claim to have built perfect simulations of individuals' personalities. “A two-hour interview doesn't [capture] you in anything near your entirety,” says Michael Bernstein, an associate professor of computer science at Stanford and one of Park's collaborators. “It does seem to be enough to gather a sense of your attitudes.”And they don't think generative agents are close to artificial general intelligence, or AGI—an as-yet-theoretical system that can match humans on any cognitive task.

In their latest paper, Park and his colleagues argue that their agents could help researchers understand complex, real-world social phenomena, such as the spread of online misinformation and the outcome of national elections. If they can accurately simulate individuals, then they can theoretically set the simulations loose to interact with one another and see what kind of social behaviors emerge. Think Smallville on a much bigger scale.

Yet, as I would soon discover, generative agents may only be able to imitate a very narrow and simplified slice of the human personality.

Meeting my generative agent a week after my interview with Isabella felt like looking at myself in a funhouse mirror: I knew I was seeing my own reflection, but the image was warped and twisted.

The first thing I noticed was that the agent—let's say “he”—didn't speak like me. I was on a video call with Park, and the two of us were taking turns asking him questions. Unlike Isabella, he didn't come with his own avatar; he just appeared as faceless lines of green text spilling across my screen. We were testing his ability to make informed guesses about my life, filling in information I hadn't directly provided to Isabella. The results were somewhat disappointing. At one point, I asked him to tell me a secret about himself that no one else knows, hoping he would surface some kind of moderately deep insight. He said he loved astronomy. True enough but hardly revelatory.

His real talent seemed to be inferring some of the more mundane details of my life. When asked if his family had dogs growing up, he correctly answered yes, even though I had only told Isabella that my sister and parents have dogs today. I had, however, described my childhood in Colorado, which was full of family camping trips in the mountains, and the agent had apparently correctly deduced that there was a high probability that somebody who grew up in such an environment also grew up with dogs. “Those are the basic boundaries of this technology,” Park told me. “In the absence of the ground-truth information, it will try to make its best guess.”

At times those guesses were comically off the mark. When asked to recount an embarrassing moment from his past, he fabricated a story about a party in college in which he'd lost his balance while dancing and fell onto a table full of snacks. Thankfully, that never happened to the real me. Here, too, the system was connecting disparate bits of my personal data and doing its best to concoct something plausible.

Toward the end of the Q&A, I ventured into the deep end by asking whether he believed in God. The answer wasn't far from how I might respond. “I wasn't raised in a specific religious framework, but I've always felt a connection with something greater than myself, especially when I'm in nature,” my agent wrote. “It's like there's a kind of transcendent energy or consciousness that we can tap into.”

Most memorably, there were moments that felt like genuine insight. I had had a long, stressful few months. I had started working as a full-time freelance writer last October, ushering in a period of professional freedom but also chronic uncertainty. I'd spent much of the winter hunkered down, reading and writing, in my small New York City apartment, and I was feeling the psychological effects of prolonged isolation. Embracing the spirit of spring, I had resolved to make what I believed would be some healthy changes, starting with a greater effort to maintain a better work-life balance. I asked my generative agent, “What's some advice you'd want to offer to your past self?”

“Embrace uncertainty a bit more,” he began. I had to pause. Already the response so closely echoed the themes I'd been articulating to myself in my journal the previous day, it was almost as if I were writing the agents' words myself. “I think I spent a lot of time worrying about the future and trying to control every aspect of my life, and that often led to unnecessary stress,” he continued. “I would advise myself to trust the process and be more open to the unexpected paths that life can take…. It's easy to get caught up in career ambitions, but nurturing relationships and taking time for oneself is equally important.”

Despite those moments of pleasant surprise, my conversation with my generative agent left me feeling hollow. I felt I had met a two-dimensional version of myself—all artifice, no depth. It had captured a veneer of my personality, but it was just that: a virtual actor playing a role, wearing my data as a mask.

At no point did I get the feeling that I was interacting with a system that truly captured my voice and my thoughts. But that isn't the point. Generative agents don't need to sound like you or understand you in your entirety to be useful, just as psychologists don't need to understand every quirk of your behavior to make broad-stroke diagnoses of your personality type.

Adam Green, a neuroscientist at Georgetown University, who studies the impacts of AI on human creativity, believes that that lack of specificity and our growing reliance on a handful of powerful algorithms could filter out much of the color and quirks that make each of us unique. Even the most advanced algorithm will revert to the mean of the dataset on which it's been trained. “That matters,” Green says, “because ultimately what you'll have is homogenization.” In his view, the expanding ubiquity of predictive AI models is squeezing our culture into a kind of groupthink, in which all our idiosyncrasies slowly but surely become discounted as irrelevant outliers in the data of humanity.

After meeting my generative agent, I remembered the feeling I had back when I spoke with Isabella—my inner voice that had rejected the idea that my personality could be re-created in silicon or, as Meghan O'Gieblyn put it in her book God, Human, Animal, Machine, “that the soul is little more than a data set.” I still felt that way. If anything, my conviction had been strengthened. I was also aware that I might be falling prey to the same kind of hubris that once kept early critics of AI from believing that computers could ever compose decent poetry or outmatch humans in chess. But I was willing to take that risk.

These Lab-Controlled Microbes Can Make Any Chocolate Taste Gourmet

From hints of citrus to caramel, premium chocolate's complex flavors derive from fermenting microbes on cocoa bean farms—and a new study suggests they can be grown on demand in the lab

The unique flavor profiles of premium chocolate—which can include hints of citrus, wafts of wine and subtle notes of spice—have often been attributed to the cocoa bean's origin. Farmers in tropical equatorial regions of the “cacao belt” have harnessed centuries-old harvesting techniques to coax cocoa beans that deliver the best taste—with the surprising help of tiny natural fermenters: microbes.

Now researchers have found that the fermentation fundamental to chocolate production can be reproduced with lab-controlled microbial communities to successfully re-create complex flavors of the beloved morsels.

“We have been able to change the flavors to kind of resemble different regions just by changing the microbes,” says David Gopaulchan, an international research fellow at the University of Nottingham in England and lead author of the new study describing the results in Nature Microbiology. “It's like hacking an ancient process because we've been fermenting cocoa beans since we've had chocolate. That's hundreds of years ago.”

Farmers grow cacao trees and harvest the pods, which are opened to collect the seeds and white, creamy pulp. This is left out to “cure” for several days in wooden boxes, baskets, Styrofoam coolers or large piles atop leaves on the ground—creating the perfect environment for microorganisms to ferment the beans.

“If you skip that that process, your beans don't taste much like anything; it tastes more like plants. So the fermentation is super important in the development of flavor precursors,” Gopaulchan says. Other fermented foods such as wine, cheese and beer are often intentionally inoculated by the manufacturer, usually with the same strains of microorganisms. For chocolate fermentation, “it's totally spontaneous and uncontrolled. It's whatever microbes that exist at the farm,” he says.

This contributes to the enormous variety in fine chocolate flavors—and millions of farmers across the cacao belt each ferment beans with varying microbial communities, he says. The majority of cocoa beans produced globally go into bulk chocolate—that usually has a basic, bittersweet chocolate taste. But a smaller percentage go into fine flavor chocolate, which has a baseline chocolate flavor laced with a complex range of other notes.

For example, “my home country, Trinidad, is known for chocolates that taste like wine, but other regions like Venezuela are known for having very nutty flavor profiles in their beans,” Gopaulchan says.

Several other factors throughout the growing, harvesting and manufacturing process may influence the taste—including the soil, climate and bean genetics. “Plant genetics definitely play a huge role, but you can make bad chocolate out of good genetics with a bad fermentation,” says Caitlin Clark, senior food scientist at Colorado State University's Spur Food Innovation Center, who was not involved in the new research.

Gopaulchan had previously investigated the role of diversity in cacao genes at the International Cocoa Genebank at the University of the West Indies, St. Augustine's Cocoa Research Center. Along with farming locations, “it's been the long-held belief that the flavor of chocolate largely depends on the genetics of the plant,” he says. “But what we show is that these microbes and this fermentation process have a huge impact. I would even argue it's probably the largest impact on the final flavor profile.”

In the new study, Gopaulchan and his colleagues collaborated with three cocoa farms in distinct environments in Colombia: the mountainous area of Santander, the dry valley of Huila and the Pacific zone of Antioquia. Using beans naturally fermented on-site, the team used DNA sequencing and metabolic modeling to identify the network of interactions between various bacteria and yeasts that drove fermentation.

Of the many microbes that were genetically identified, the team identified a core group that could reproduce the metabolic signatures—such as sensory volatile organic compounds—of fine chocolate flavor. The researchers isolated and tested these strains on unfermented beans in sterile wooden boxes under controlled conditions. Their analysis revealed that, chemically, the lab-fermented beans matched the flavor profiles of premium cocoa. But how did the beans taste?

The researchers had a trained sensory panel at the Cocoa Research Center taste cocoa “liquors”—semisolid pastes of ground roasted beans—from the three farms and the lab without knowing which was which. They scored the lab liquors—along with those from the Santander and Huila farms—as having attributes similar to the fine flavors of reference beans from Madagascar, while the Antioquia liquor was more similar to bulk cocoa.

“We found a lot of fruity, a bit spicy, floral-type flavors coming up with this community of microbes,” Gopaulchan says.

The findings support what farmers and the chocolate-making industry have seen in practice, Clark says. “Cacao fermentation is notoriously hard to study because it is so variable and you can't really replicate it in a lab, so I thought they did a good job of knowing which factors to isolate and highlight,” she says.

Gopaulchan hopes that the proof-of-concept design could eventually lead to microbial “starters” to give farmers more control over the fermentation process and resulting flavors. Farmers, particularly small-scale ones, might be able to preserve the quality of their cocoa beans, Gopaulchan says, especially when fermentations fail from an unexpected rainy season or undesirable microbes.

Clark, however, sees such a platform mostly giving a leg up to large mainstream chocolate providers that try to closely control for consistency, batch after batch. “Variation in chocolate flavor is a real negative if you're trying to make every Hershey's chocolate bar across the world taste exactly the same every time,” Clark says. “Research like this benefits people trying to make chocolate taste the same a lot more than it benefits people trying to make chocolate taste interesting and different.”

Some companies have expressed interest in using this type of technology to create chocolate flavor without any cocoa beans at all, Gopaulchan says. But that could be “disruptive for the industry,” he adds.

Ultimately, he hopes that the research could aid fine flavor chocolate makers, too—maybe even by helping them design entirely new flavors. “We've identified microbes that make the cocoa beans taste more like cheese or wine. Others, you can get a strong meat flavor,” Gopaulchan says. “It's wild that you could get a range of totally different flavors by just changing the microbe combinations. Now, we don't want to eat cheesy chocolates, but I think, for other types of foods, there are possibilities.”

Gear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?

The official end of summer doesn't have to be a bummer. Labor Day weekend marks the end of the season with a long weekend and, our favorite, a slew of sales. However, you don't have to wait until Labor Day to take advantage of the seasonal savings. We've started seeing early Labor Day deals on Amazon for a variety of home security essentials, lawn care tools, and power stations.

You can't put a price on peace of mind, but if you could, it'd be heavily discounted. Currently, several savings are available on home security systems, outdoor cameras, and smart doorbells.

For those who like to be prepared, we're also seeing sales on portable power stations. These power stations serve dual purposes, acting as a reliable backup for disaster situations, as well as for those who enjoy long car camping and overlanding trips. There are sales on small electric power stations—ideal for the cross-country road trip—from our favorite brands.  

Of course, we're also scoping out deals on everything you need for lawn maintenance. There are electric mowers and trimmers to keep your yard pristine, and even a garden hose that won one of our coveted Lawn and Garden Awards. 

Top brands like Arlo, Ring, and Blink are on sale for up to 50% off, allowing you to kit out your home with the latest security technology. The Arlo Essentials XL is an outdoor camera that doubles as a motion-sensor spotlight. It features a two-way speaker for you to communicate with delivery people or alert suspicious prowlers that you are watching.

It also offers two-way talk and has a wide-angle camera, allowing you to see people from head to toe. My parents have had a Ring camera at their house for years and love it. They already had a reliable alarm system and wanted a bit of extra security without fussy installation, and one that was easy to operate. 

In testing power banks, Jackery and Bluetti, in particular, have proven reliable for both power outages and outdoor excursions. The Jackery Explorer was our pick for the best value power station, and it's further discounted for Labor Day. It has a built-in emergency flashlight and both AC and DC outputs onboard. It's designed to be lightweight and easy to carry, plus you get the bonus of an included carrying case.

The Worx 40V Push Mower was a long-running pick for the best electric mower for small yards. That is, until we tested the Greenwork 40V Mower—no need to pick sides though, they're both on sale right now. The Greenworks mower is part of a bundle which includes a string trimmer and leaf blower to keep your lawn in check. 

Another tested item that blew us away in testing (pun intended) is the 80V Backpack Leaf Blower. It had a comfortable, ergonomic design and packed a lot of power for such a compact machine. The handheld version is also currently on sale if you prefer not to strap up with a backpack each time.

Cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) bean fermentation is a spontaneous process involving interactions between abiotic and biotic factors that contribute to the final flavours of chocolate. Understanding these underlying interactions could enable desired flavour profiles to be reproduced under controlled conditions. Here, using bean fermentation samples from Colombian farms, we established that pH, temperature and microbiota composition, including both bacteria and fungi, influence key flavour attributes of premium chocolate. Genome-resolved metagenomics revealed that metabolic traits necessary for the development of the flavour profile of chocolate are redundantly present in the fermentation microbial community. Using a defined and metabolically competent microbial consortium, the feasibility of replicating fine flavour attributes of chocolate under controlled conditions was confirmed via omics, metabolic networks and a trained tasting panel. Our results provide the basis for the design of fermentation starters to robustly reproduce fine chocolate characteristics.

The production of fermented foods, such as chocolate, relies on the metabolic activities of microbial communities. Members of these communities transform the raw substrate, cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) beans, into the precursor for chocolate production1,2. Although after harvest, cocoa beans undergo several processing steps to produce the final chocolate, the fermentation step, however, is a spontaneous process, involving a dynamic interplay between abiotic and biotic factors, resulting in the production of metabolites that define the chocolate flavour3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Unfermented cocoa beans develop little flavour potential when roasted and tend to be bitter and astringent4,5. In contrast, well-fermented beans can exhibit complex flavour notes with reduced bitterness and astringency. Consequently, the fermentation process is crucial for enhancing the aroma and flavour of the chocolate.

Typically, cocoa bean fermentation takes place on cocoa farms, within wooden boxes, baskets or heaps covered with various materials to regulate environmental temperatures1,2. In contrast to other fermented foods such as wine10,11, cheese12 or beer13, where microbes are often intentionally introduced or controlled, the microbial communities in cocoa bean fermentation assemble spontaneously from the environment with minimal human intervention. Therefore, variations in the assembly of microbial communities for fermentation across different locations are expected14,15,16, and this can influence the chocolate quality and flavour from different cocoa origins.

Although various approaches have been used to analyse microbial communities in fermenting cocoa beans17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25, our understanding of microbial community assembly during cocoa bean fermentation remains limited. Particularly, there is a knowledge gap regarding how abiotic and biotic factors influence fermentation outcomes and impact chocolate flavour26. This lack of knowledge limits the optimization of cocoa bean fermentation as an industrial process similar to other fermented food industries. Therefore, further studies are imperative to delve deeper into this system to unlock its full potential.

We monitored abiotic factors, such as temperature and pH, during bean fermentations in Colombia over two growing seasons. We selected a farm in the Santander district, the country's leading cocoa-producing region (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Temperature changes in fermenting beans were measured daily at two depths over 7 days (Extended Data Fig. 1b). We found that the temperature of fermenting beans increased after 24 h, exhibiting a sigmoidal pattern that resembled typical microbial growth curves (Fig. 1a). Therefore, we hypothesized that this temperature increase was associated with exothermic metabolic reactions in the bean pulp, probably driven by microbial activity.

a, Temperature and pH changes of the fermenting beans during fermentation. Shaded areas represent 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Temperature recordings were taken at two depths: below the surface (top) and midway through the fermenting mass (mid-box). The red dashed lines indicate the times when the beans were turned. b, Pearson correlation analysis (two-sided) between the bean temperature and testa/pulp pH. Shading represents 95% CIs. The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and the associated P value are shown. c,d, Alpha and beta diversity estimates of the bacterial (c) and fungal (d) communities in the fermentation at different time points. Microbial samples were collected from two independent fermentations. A total of 21 bacterial and 20 fungal community profiles were used. Alpha diversity was assessed using the Shannon diversity index. The horizontal line within each box represents the median; box edges represent the interquartile range from the 25th to the 75th percentiles; whiskers extend to the smallest and largest values within 1.5× the interquartile range from the lower and upper quartiles; individual data points, including outliers, are overlaid as dots. One-way ANOVA was used to discern significant differences among groups (bacteria: P = 4.2759 × 10−4; fungi: P = 1.9382 × 10−7) and means were separated using Tukey's post hoc test. Shared letters denote no significant difference (P > 0.05), whereas different letters indicate statistically significant (P < 0.05) variation between groups. Beta diversity was visualized using canonical analysis of principal coordinates (CAP). Group differences were assessed using PERMANOVA with 9,999 permutations. PERMANOVA R2 and P value are displayed. e,f, Phylogram showing the relative abundance profiles of the main bacterial (e) and fungal (f) families at different fermentation time points. The proportions in the bars represent the average relative abundances of each taxon, calculated across multiple replicate samples for the bacterial (ntotal = 21) and fungal (ntotal = 20) communities. g, Mantel correlation between bacterial and fungal Bray–Curtis dissimilarity matrices. The correlation was assessed using a two-sided Mantel test with the Pearson method and 10,000 permutations. Shading indicates the 95% CI of the fitted regression line. The Mantel correlation coefficient (r) and corresponding P value are displayed.

To reinforce this hypothesis, we measured changes in pH in the beans' testa associated with the pulp (Extended Data Fig. 1b). The bean pulp is rich in primary and secondary substrates that can be used as carbon sources by the microbiota present3,5,19,27. We observed that in the first 48 h of fermentation, the pH of the testa/pulp was low (pH < 4) (Fig. 1a). Subsequently, the pH increased linearly probably due to chemical transformations of substrates in the testa/pulp5. In addition, we found a positive correlation between pH changes measured in the testa/pulp and temperature changes recorded in the fermenting cocoa mass (Fig. 1b). Both parameters exhibited similar magnitudes of variation during fermentation, indicating a link between changes in pulp pH and temperature shifts (Extended Data Fig. 1c). This is consistent with chemical transformations occurring within the pulp during fermentation28,29.

We next investigated pH changes in bean cotyledons, a measure more directly associated with bean fermentation (Fig. 1a). Contrary to the pH increase in the pulp, we found that the pH in the cotyledons decreases sigmoidally with time (Fig. 1a). A plausible explanation for this negative correlation between the pH in the testa/pulp and cotyledons (Extended Data Fig. 1d) could be that cocoa fermentation is a compartmentalized process that progresses simultaneously in the pulp and cotyledon. This compartmentalization could be facilitated by the physical barrier provided by the testa30 and the different chemical compositions of the pulp and cotyledon3,27,31. Supporting this hypothesis, we found that pH changes in the testa/pulp do not explain the pH shifts detected in the cotyledon (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Nevertheless, Pearson's correlation analysis revealed a strong negative correlation (r = −0.91307, P = 5.4793 × 10−16) between bean temperature and pH changes in the cotyledon (Extended Data Fig. 1d). These results strongly support the idea that changes in temperature and pH during cocoa bean fermentation are the result of chemical reactions probably driven by the microbes present8,19,32. Overall, we conclude that bean temperature and cotyledon pH could serve as markers for bean fermentation progression. In fact, these parameters significantly correlated with colour changes in beans, which are traditionally used to assess the fermentation end point5,33,34 (Extended Data Fig. 1e–g).

To determine whether changes in microbial composition are associated with the progression of bean fermentation, we analysed microbial community dynamics using whole-metagenome shotgun Oxford Nanopore sequencing (Extended Data Fig. 1b,h and Supplementary Result 1). We found significant changes in alpha diversity (within-sample diversity) among microbial populations across different fermentation time points (Fig. 1c,d). Consistent with previous studies14,35, bacterial alpha diversity generally declined as fermentation progressed (Fig. 1c). Similarly, the alpha diversity of the fungal population followed a comparable declining trend across the fermentation time points (Fig. 1d). This decline in microbial diversity could be driven by metabolic changes in the pulp and bean composition because of microbial action19,32,35. These microbial activities may underlie the observed changes in temperature and pH during bean fermentation.

Analysis of beta diversity (between-sample variation) revealed that both bacterial and fungal communities separate along the first axis of a canonical analysis of principal coordinates (CAP) according to fermentation time (Fig. 1c,d), indicating clear shifts in community composition between early and late fermentation time points. In general, during the first 24 h of fermentation, the bacterial community was enriched in Erwiniaceae and depleted in Enterobacteriaceae and Pectobacteriaceae (Fig. 1e). Consistent with previous studies1,2, the bacterial community composition shifted after 48 h towards enrichment in Acetobacteraceae, which remained dominant for the rest of fermentation (Fig. 1e). In the case of fungi, we detected an initial enrichment in Saccharomycetaceae, aligning with previous reports7,21,36,37,38, and a concurrent depletion in Nectriaceae and Debaryomycetaceae within the first 24 h (Fig. 1f). The relative abundance of Saccharomycetaceae increased further at later time points during fermentation (Fig. 1f). We also analysed species-level enrichment of bacterial and fungal taxa across all fermentation time points relative to time zero (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Result 2). Overall, these results underscore coordination between bacteria and fungi during bean fermentation (Fig. 1g) that may be influenced by changes in pH and temperature, spatial distribution and substrate availability. This proposed model of interkingdom microbial coordination could explain observed shifts in fermentation temperature and progressive acidification of the bean cotyledon, probably driven by the metabolic activities of Lactobacillaceae and Acetobacteraceae.

To begin assessing the impact of the abiotic and biotic parameters on chocolate flavour, we selected two additional farms in Colombia in the regions of Huila and Antioquia (Extended Data Fig. 1a). First, we confirmed that the cocoa varieties from all three farms had comparable genetic backgrounds (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 2a,b, Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, and Supplementary Result 3). This analysis allowed us to exclude genotype as a relevant factor influencing bean fermentation and chocolate flavour in our study.

a, Ancestry analysis of cultivated cacao plant samples from Santander (n = 12), Huila (n = 5) and Antioquia (n = 7). Population structure was determined on the basis of 84 high-quality SNP markers. The reference SNP profiles were primarily generated from cacao accessions at the International Cocoa Genebank Trinidad and were selected across the 10 cacao genetic clusters identified in ref. 71. In addition, Amelonado-Criollo reference hybrid accessions were included in the analysis. Each vertical line represents an individual. b, Temperature and pH changes of the fermenting beans in Huila and Antioquia farms. Shading indicates the 95% CI. Daily temperature recordings were taken at two depths within the fermentation box: 7 cm below the top surface (top) and midway through the fermenting mass (mid-box). Bean samples from these positions were collected and separated into testa with pulp and cotyledons, and the pH of both tissues was measured. Red dashed lines signify the time points when the beans underwent turning. c,d, Canonical analysis of principal coordinates (CAP) showing the bacteria (c) and fungi (d) community compositions in the fermenting beans across the three cocoa farms analysed in this study. Differences in beta diversity estimates are shown across fermentation time points (left), farm locations (middle) and bean harvesting periods (right). Group differences were assessed using PERMANOVA with 9,999 permutations. e,f, Phylogram displaying the relative abundance profiles of the main bacterial (e) and fungal (f) families at different fermentation time points. The proportions in the bar plots represent the average relative abundances of each taxon, calculated across multiple replicate samples for the bacterial (ntotal = 24) and fungal (ntotal = 23) communities.

Next, we analysed the temperature and pH kinetics during bean fermentation at these two farms, across two consecutive harvests. Our findings showed that in general, the changes in these abiotic fermentation indicators in Huila, but not in Antioquia, resembled those observed previously at the Santander farm (Figs. 1a and 2b, Supplementary Fig. 2c and Supplementary Result 4). This suggests that the fermenting beans from Antioquia underwent chemical transformations distinct from those of the other two farms, probably due to the presence of different microbial communities.

To test this hypothesis, we characterized bacterial and fungal compositional changes in Huila and Antioquia fermentations (Extended Data Fig. 1h). Generally, the Huila and Antioquia fermentations showed microbiota characteristics similar to those in Santander (Figs. 1c,d and 2c,d, and Supplementary Fig. 2d). Supporting our hypothesis however, we found very different dynamics in the community in Antioquia (Figs. 1e,f and 2e,f, and Supplementary Result 5). These differences in microbial composition dynamics in Antioquia may explain the distinct temperature and pH patterns observed. Moreover, consistent with previous studies14,15,16, distinct differences in microbiota composition were detected across geographical locations, with a stronger signal in fungal populations (Fig. 2c,d, Supplementary Fig. 2d and Supplementary Result 5), suggesting that local environment or microbial source origin may influence fermentation characteristics. Consequently, we explored the influence of environmental microbial sources to the fermentation process (Supplementary Fig. 2e–i and Supplementary Result 6). Overall, the results suggest that bacteria harboured within fermentation box surfaces might function as a ‘memory', serving as a stable inoculation source over time, whereas initial sources of fungi for fermentation probably originate from diverse environmental sources, explaining the stronger geographic signal. These divergent contributions from environmental sources among farms, coupled with temporal disparities, may enrich flavour diversity across locations.

We analysed whether changes in the identified fermentation signatures (temperature, pH and microbial composition) could offer insights into the quality of the fermented beans. We evaluated nine quality parameters39,40,41 commonly used in the chocolate industry to rapidly assess the commercial quality of fermented cocoa beans (Supplementary Fig. 2j and Supplementary Result 7). We found no differences in the fermentation degree quality parameters across locations, despite Antioquia fermentation signatures being very atypical (Supplementary Fig. 2j). These results suggest that the fermentation markers identified here are not predictive of the overall degree of bean fermentation. Therefore, we postulated that variations in these fermentation signatures, which are associated with chemical processes occurring within the beans, could offer insights into chocolate flavour characteristics.

To validate this hypothesis, we prepared cocoa liquors from the fermented beans from the three farms and evaluated their flavours using a trained tasting panel. Cocoa beans are classified as ‘bulk' or ‘fine flavour'39,41. Fine flavour beans offer complex, desirable notes with less bitterness and are prized in premium chocolate, whereas bulk beans have a simpler cocoa flavour and are typically more bitter. Consistent with the abiotic and biotic fermentation signature changes (Figs. 1 and 2), liquors from Santander and Huila shared flavour attributes that contrasted with those from Antioquia (Fig. 3a,b and Supplementary Result 8). We observed similar organoleptic qualities between the Santander and Huila liquors and a fine flavour reference liquor from Madagascar (Fig. 3b). In contrast, the Antioquia liquor clustered with bulk references from Ivory Coast and Ghana, showing a narrower flavour range (Fig. 3b). These results underscore the pivotal role of bean fermentation, especially the dynamics of its abiotic and biotic markers defined here, as critical factors driving the development of fine flavour in chocolate.

The heat map is clustered hierarchically on the basis of sensory attributes, and selected temperature and pH features, and is coloured on the basis of feature importance determined using the random forest model. The bars at the top denote the sensory groups defined by the Cocoa of Excellence guidelines and highlight attributes typically present in bulk cocoa, fine cocoa and undesirable flavours. d, Heat maps showing extracted features from pivotal bacteria and fungi growth curves in fermenting beans and their importance to sensory attributes. Important bacteria and fungi taxa driving differences in beta diversity in cocoa fermentation were selected on the basis of PERMANOVA coefficients. The heat map is coloured on the basis of feature importance, which represents the percentage increase in mean squared error (%IncMSE) for each feature, determined using the random forest model. The heat map is clustered on the basis of hierarchical clustering of the sensory attributes as well as the selected taxa feature. Bacteria are indicated in black text and fungi are illustrated in red text. The bars at the top denote the sensory groups defined by the Cocoa of Excellence guidelines for cocoa liquors and chocolate, and highlight attributes typically present in bulk cocoa, fine or flavour cocoa and undesirable flavours.

To assess the predictive value of temperature and cotyledon pH, in predicting chocolate flavour attributes, we fitted their kinetic curves using a 5-parameter model across locations and identified 13 fermentation kinetic features (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). To reduce redundancy, we clustered pairwise correlations and retained the most variable feature from each cluster for predicting chocolate flavour attributes (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b and Supplementary Result 9). Using these selected features, we identified two main clusters linking abiotic features to flavour notes common to both bulk and fine chocolate (Fig. 3c). Consistent with our previous results (Fig. 3a,b), we observed a strong association between fine chocolate notes, such as light wood, flowers, caramel/panela, brown and dark wood, and abiotic features, such as time to pH maximum kinetic energy, temperature inflection point and time to temperature inflection point (Fig. 3c). This indicates that highly variable features related to temperature and pH strongly predict chocolate flavour characteristics.

We investigated whether microbiota composition changes during fermentation were associated with chocolate flavour attributes. We identified microbial groups driving compositional differences across fermentation time points and locations (Extended Data Fig. 2c,d). CAP analysis using these biotic markers recapitulated both temporal and spatial microbiota variations (Extended Data Fig. 2e,f). Seven growth features, capturing shifts in the microbial marker abundances, were then extracted, and redundancy was reduced using the same clustering approach applied to the abiotic traits (Extended Data Fig. 2g). We observed that changes in the features identified for certain microbes predicted distinct flavour characteristics (Fig. 3d). Notably, changes in the features identified in two fungi genera, Torulaspora and Saccharomyces, strongly associated with flavour attributes often found in fine chocolate (Fig. 3d).

To further validate the predictive power of the identified markers, we analysed abiotic and microbial feature associations with flavour attributes across 19 and 11 independent natural fermentations, respectively, conducted over multiple years in diverse agroecological regions of Trinidad, a country known for fine flavour cocoa. Despite this broad panel in sensory attributes, strong and consistent associations between several identified markers and key flavour attributes emerged, many matching or exceeding those from Colombian fermentations (Supplementary Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Result 10). These findings indicate that, alongside temperature and pH dynamics, manipulating microbial community composition and dynamics during fermentation can shape chocolate flavour, enabling the development of reproducible starter cultures for consistent, high-quality chocolate production.

To guide the design of fermentation starters, we investigated whether a reduced microbial consortium, defined by key taxonomic and metabolic traits, could reproduce the essential characteristics of the cocoa fermentation process. We first constructed metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) from the shotgun sequencing data of bacteria and fungi associated with fermentation. After removing duplicate MAGs and those that did not meet our genome completeness and contamination thresholds, 55 MAGs remained for further analysis (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 4a,b, Supplementary Table 4 and Supplementary Result 11). We confirmed that the constructed MAGs reliably captured the microbial community dynamics during fermentation (Supplementary Fig. 4c,d). To assess microbial functional dynamics, we identified enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms in contigs assembled from the microbial communities that served as the source for MAG reconstruction. Consistent with microbial composition patterns (Supplementary Fig. 4d), functional analysis confirmed similar enrichment dynamics in Santander and Huila fermentations, contrasting sharply with Antioquia. Key enriched GO categories included microbial division, growth and processes typical of food fermentation, such as pH response, alcohol biosynthesis and metabolism, and responses to heat, starvation, osmotic and oxidative stresses42,43,44 (Supplementary Fig. 5, Supplementary Table 5 and Supplementary Result 11). Again, pathway and protein enrichment analyses further highlighted key enzymatic groups enriched during fermentation that probably contribute to cocoa bean flavour development, including aminotransferases (linked to aroma precursors such as pyrazines45,46), l-aspartate 4-carboxy-lyase (producing sweet and savoury flavour precursors47,48) and ethanolamine ammonia-lyase (generating fruity volatiles such as acetaldehyde3,9,49) (Supplementary Fig. 6, and Supplementary Tables 6 and 7). Taken together, these findings suggest that the sequenced microbial communities from the fermentations and the corresponding assembled MAGs potentially capture essential metabolic pathways for cocoa bean fermentation and the development of diverse chocolate flavour attributes. However, due to the incomplete nature of some MAGs, certain metabolic pathways may still be underrepresented.

a, Neighbour-joining tree showing the 55 MAGs derived from the fermenting cocoa beans metagenomic dataset. The MAGs were constructed using both single-sample assembly and co-assembly approaches, employing different binning tools. The dendrogram was constructed utilizing marker gene sequences identified across the genomes, with colours indicating the main bacterial and fungal phyla detected. b, PCoA showing the projected metabolic potential of the full microbial community (left), defined community identified using our metabolic approach (middle) and the synthetic community (SYNCOM) (right) designed to recapitulate the defined community. Genome-scale metabolic networks were reconstructed from the MAGs and from the genome sequences that were generated from the cultured microbes. Metabolites reachable are based on cocoa pulp as the precursor. The colours depict different bacteria and fungi families. Notice that the defined and the synthetic community cover the main taxonomic units and metabolic groups of the full microbial community. c, Venn diagram depicting the number of metabolites attainable by the full, defined and synthetic microbial communities when seeded with cocoa pulp. The total number of metabolites produced by a community (n) reflects the cumulative metabolic capabilities of the individual microbes and the added value to produce new metabolites as a result of cooperation among individual microbes in the community. Each circle in the diagram represents the total number of metabolites (n) within the community. Overlapping sections denote metabolites shared by multiple communities, while non-overlapping areas signify metabolites exclusive to each community. d, Venn diagram illustrating the taxonomic overlap at the family level between the defined community identified in our metabolic network analysis and our synthetic community (SYNCOM). Each circle represents the total number of taxonomic families within a community. The overlapping regions highlight families shared by both communities, while the non-overlapping sections represent families unique to each. The percentages within each region denote the proportion of taxonomic families in that section relative to the total number across both communities.

To evaluate the metabolic capabilities of the MAGs, we reconstructed in silico, genome-scale metabolic networks for 44 MAGs specifically recovered from fermenting beans. Using cocoa pulp substrates19,27,32,50,51 to seed the network, we predicted metabolite production for individual MAGs to assess the cumulative metabolic capacities of the MAG set, a representative proxy of the fermentation microbiota (Supplementary Fig. 7). We observed strong taxonomic clustering, with closely related microbes producing similar metabolites (Supplementary Fig. 7). As expected, microbes with similar metabolic capacities followed comparable abundance trajectories in the Santander and Huila fermentations but diverged markedly in the Antioquia fermentation (Extended Data Fig. 3a). These findings indicate that taxonomic and metabolic features essential for cocoa fermentation are redundantly present within the microbial community. Indeed, our metabolic network analysis pinpointed 10 MAGs with metabolic capacities equivalent to the microbial community in cocoa fermentations (Fig. 4b,c and Supplementary Result 12).

To evaluate this reduced consortium, we established a collection of bacterial and fungal strains isolated from fermenting cocoa beans (Supplementary Result 13). This representative collection captured the dominant microbial families involved in Colombian cocoa fermentations (Extended Data Fig. 3b–d and Supplementary Table 8). We selected a subset of 9 strains (5 bacteria, 4 fungi; Supplementary Table 8) that approximated the taxonomy (55.6%) and metabolic potential (94.9%) of the 10 identified MAGs (Fig. 4b–d and Supplementary Result 14). We then tested the consortium in controlled cocoa fermentations using microboxes. We inoculated beans with the full consortium, individual strain dropouts (where individual strains were removed from the consortium), a randomly selected consortium, and included uninoculated controls (Extended Data Fig. 4a).

Inoculated beans with the synthetic microbial communities (full, dropouts and random) generally recapitulated the pH kinetics in the testa/pulp and cotyledons observed during fermentations at Santander and Huila farms, both associated with fine flavour chocolates (Figs. 1a and 2b, Extended Data Figs. 4b and 5a, and Supplementary Result 14). In contrast, these pH shifts were absent in uninoculated beans (Extended Data Figs. 4b and 5a). Further analyses revealed that elevated temperatures and acidic conditions, typical in natural fermentations, significantly impaired the growth of consortium member strains (Extended Data Fig. 5b). These findings suggest that dynamic pH and temperature shifts may drive microbial succession and interkingdom coordination during fermentation.

We reproduced key microbiota features of the Santander and Huila fermentations (Figs. 1c–f, 2c–f and 5a–f, and Supplementary Result 14). Microbial cell density increased progressively during the process (Extended Data Fig. 5c). Inoculation with the full synthetic community led to a decline in bacterial and fungal alpha diversity during fermentation, mirroring farm observations (Fig. 5a,b). In dropout experiments, this diversity decline was lost in five bacterial and one fungal dropout combinations (Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). Analysis of community structure revealed that the microbial composition was primarily shaped by the initial starter formulation and fermentation time (Fig. 5c–f, Extended Data Fig. 7 and Supplementary Fig. 8), highlighting the critical role of specific strains for maintaining microbial community structure. Together, these findings demonstrate that defined synthetic starters, under controlled conditions, can replicate the key abiotic and biotic features of spontaneous farm cocoa fermentations.

a,b, Bacterial (a) and fungal (b) alpha diversity estimate of in vitro fermented beans inoculated (SYNCOM) or not (No SYNCOM) with a synthetic microbial consortium. Three independent fermentations were conducted and 32 bacterial and 22 fungal community profiles were generated. Alpha diversity was estimated using the Shannon diversity index. The horizontal line within each box indicates the median; box edges represent the interquartile range from the 25th to 75th percentiles; whiskers extend to the smallest and largest values within 1.5× the interquartile range of the lower and upper quartiles; and individual data points, including outliers, are overlaid as dots. ANOVA was used to identify significant differences among groups, and means were separated using Tukey's post hoc test.

Volatiles are clustered according to their log2 fold change values. i, Heat map illustrating the sensory characteristics of liquors made from beans fermented in vitro in comparison to liquors from the three farms. The bar at the top denotes the sensory groups defined by the Cocoa of Excellence guidelines.

We tested whether the reproducibility of general fermentation characteristics under controlled conditions with synthetic starters extended to metabolic transformations linked to chocolate flavour. We prepared cocoa liquors from beans fermented under controlled conditions and analysed volatile organic compounds (VOCs) associated with chocolate flavour3,9,46,52,53,54,55,56,57. We compared these to cocoa liquors from the on-farm fermentations in Santander, Huila and Antioquia. Principal component analysis revealed a clear separation between the metabolic profiles of inoculated and farm fermentations versus non-inoculated controls (Fig. 5g). VOC enrichment patterns were similar between the controlled and on-farm fermentations, but distinct from non-inoculated controls (Fig. 5h). We confirmed that changes in VOC metabolic profiles were linked to initial starter composition and evolved throughout fermentation (Extended Data Fig. 8a,b and Supplementary Fig. 9a). Kinetic analyses across the full, dropout and random synthetic starters revealed significant differences in VOC concentrations, while VOCs in non-inoculated fermentations remained largely unchanged compared to time zero (Extended Data Fig. 8a–d, Supplementary Fig. 9a and Supplementary Result 15). Non-volatile metabolite profiles also differed across the synthetic communities and diverged further over time (Extended Data Fig. 8e,f and Supplementary Fig. 9b). At later stages, non-inoculated and random-inoculated fermentations were metabolically distinct from others (Extended Data Fig. 8e,f, Supplementary Fig. 9b and Supplementary Result 15). Hundreds to thousands of metabolites showed distinct accumulation kinetics (Extended Data Fig. 9a–c), confirming limited redundancy in the metabolic capacities of the reduced starter (Extended Data Fig. 9b,c). These results highlight the reproducibility and tunability of flavour-associated metabolic profiles using defined synthetic communities.

A trained tasting panel confirmed that liquors from beans fermented with the full synthetic community exhibited flavour notes characteristic of fine chocolates from Santander, Huila and Madagascar, clearly distinguishing them from bulk chocolate references (Fig. 5i). In contrast, dropouts, the random community and non-inoculated fermentations produced liquors with altered or diminished flavour complexity (Extended Data Fig. 9d). These results demonstrate that defined microbial starters can reliably reproduce and modulate fine chocolate traits under controlled conditions.

We establish the previously suggested role of pH and temperature changes1,58 as robust predictors of chocolate flavour characteristics. In addition, we characterize microbial dynamics during bean fermentation to reveal interkingdom microbial interactions that promote flavour profile development in cocoa beans. Our study demonstrates that both abiotic and biotic fermentation markers influence the flavour characteristics of chocolate liquors, supporting previous hypotheses6,58. We expose the origins of spontaneous microbial assembly driving fermentations on farms, shedding light on flavour attributes of cocoa beans linked to specific geographic locations. Furthermore, by defining the relationship between abiotic and biotic fermentation signatures and flavour notes, our findings provide a foundation for manipulating flavour profiles of cocoa beans. These conclusions have been validated across diverse agroecological cocoa-growing regions, spanning two countries and multiple harvest seasons.

We demonstrate using synthetic community dropout experiments that the metabolic capabilities required to ferment cocoa are redundantly represented within the fermentation microbial community and therefore can be encapsulated in a reduced microbial consortium under controlled conditions. While the dropout experiments, removing only one microbial strain at a time, strongly support a reduced functional redundancy present in the fermentation starter designed in this work, these dropout experiments may not be sufficient to capture higher-order metabolic interactions within the microbial community. Therefore, a fully combinatorial design in the dropout experiments may be required to convincingly demonstrate that the metabolic capabilities contributed by each starter member are unique. Similarly, due to the incomplete nature of some eukaryotic MAGs, certain metabolic pathways may be underrepresented or absent in our analysis. Therefore, we speculate that increasing the quality of eukaryotic MAGs could lead to the design of new starters with specific metabolic capabilities. These new starters are expected to generate novel chocolate flavour profiles through mechanisms similar to those described here.

The results of this work expand our understanding of how the microbial community composition present in fermentation is a key determinant of chocolate flavour characteristics. We developed a robust pipeline enabling the design of fermentation starters that will contribute to the domestication of spontaneous and unpredictable microbial fermentation of cocoa occurring on farms. This sets the stage for the emergence of a modern chocolate industry akin to the beer or cheese industry, based on controlled cocoa fermentations, driven by synthetic microbial starters capable of robustly reproducing unique flavour attributes in cocoa beans and chocolate.

Cocoa plantations used in this work were distributed throughout Colombia and were separated into three agroecological zones on the basis of climatic conditions, topography and soil composition. The selected agroecological zones were: (1) Santander, a mountainous region with the largest production rates of cocoa in the country, (2) Huila, an inter-Andean dry valley region and (3) Antioquia, a Pacific region. For each zone, one farm was selected for sampling: Santander (3,888 ft above sea level), Huila (3,640 ft above sea level) and Antioquia (3,993 ft above sea level) (Extended Data Fig. 1a). The Huila and Antioquia farms were located ~430 km apart, and ~550 km and 198 km away from the analysed farm in Santander, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 1a). For the farms selection, we also considered best agricultural practices, a well-established infrastructure and characteristics of cocoa fermentation. All regions had a tropical and humid climate, and the monthly average temperature during sample collection was from 22.8 °C to 28.7 °C.

All cocoa bean fermentations were performed on the farms using the farmers' traditional practices and were analysed during the mid (May) and main harvests (October–November) on the three farms except for Antioquia, where only the main harvest period was characterized. Briefly, mature ripe cacao pods were harvested and opened manually in the fields. Cocoa beans and surrounding pulp were scooped out by hand and placed into pre-washed wooden fermentation boxes. The beans (200–400 kg) were then covered with banana leaves and/or jute bags to control the environmental temperature in the boxes. Natural cocoa bean fermentation proceeded at ambient temperatures ranging from an average minimum temperature of 22 °C (night-time) to a maximum of 33 °C (daytime). In all cases, the beans were turned at 48 h and 96 h after fermentation began. Fermented beans were removed from the fermentation box 144 h or 168 h after the start of the fermentation on the basis of the temperature, pH and cut test results.

To ensure the reproducibility of our observations, we only evaluated fermentation events that followed the traditional practices of local farmers who use wooden boxes to ferment cocoa beans. By maintaining these traditional protocols, we minimized the risk of introducing experimental bias (other types of practices such as sacks, bamboo baskets, plastic baskets, styrofoam and others) that could have altered the natural fermentation trajectory and influenced the final flavour profiles. This approach allowed us to preserve the authenticity of the fermentation process, ensuring that our results reflected the typical outcomes of the region's traditional methods. Consequently, this consistency helped in achieving reproducibility of the fermentation process and flavour profiles under the experimental conditions. The temperature of the fermentation mass within the boxes was recorded daily using a Brannan digital thermometer (Extended Data Fig. 1b). Measurements were taken at three different zones in the box (bottom left corner, middle and top right corner) at two depths: (1) 7 cm below the top surface of the beans and (2) midway through the fermenting mass. For pH measurement, three beans were collected from the boxes, 7 cm below the top surface in each of the three selected fermentation zones. Testa (seed coats) covered with pulp were separated from the cotyledons of the beans and both tissues (testa/pulp and cotyledons) were macerated in 10 ml distilled water using a mortar and pestle. Then, the pH of the suspensions was determined using a Hanna Checker H198103 pH tester. The colour changes of the beans were determined using images taken daily with a Samsung SM-G9600 camera in automatic mode. RGB values were extracted from the bean images using ImageJ v.1.54d. A minimum of eight points on each bean image were selected for each analysed time point. Greyscale and luminance values were derived using the formulas (R + G + B)/3 and 0.299 R + 0.587 G + 0.114B, respectively. Results from the temperature and pH measurements, along with the colour changes of the beans, were collectively used to determine the end of the fermentation.

Samples for the microbial community analyses were collected from the fermenting beans daily using a Zymo Collection Swab (R1104) (Extended Data Fig. 1b). For the collection, we removed the top 7 cm of beans from the fermenting mass, at the centre of the fermentation box to create a small cavity, and samples were collected in duplicate by swabbing the surfaces of the beans at the bottom of the cavity. The swab buds were then placed in Zymo DNA/RNA Shield Lysis and Collection tubes (R1104), and the tube contents were mixed by vigorous shaking for 10 s. A total of n = 66 fermentation samples were collected across the three farms. Using the same protocol, swab samples were also collected from various environmental sources on the farms, including the surface of cacao leaves and pods, the inner surface of the fermentation box, the hands of farm workers involved in scooping beans and transferring them to the fermentation box, and their pod cracking tools. Soil samples were collected by discarding the top 7 cm of soil and transferring 150–250 mg of soil into Zymo DNA/RNA Shield Lysis and Collection tubes using a clean spatula. To analyse the microbiota on fruit flies around the fermentation, fruit flies were caught and incubated in 0.5 ml Zymo DNA/RNA Shield Lysis solution with agitation for 5 min. The flies were then removed, and the solution was transferred into a Zymo DNA/RNA Shield Lysis and Collection tube with an additional 0.5 ml of lysis solution. In total, n = 70 farm environment samples were collected for metagenomic analysis across the three farms. Clean swabs were used as control samples without DNA.

Samples for microbial community analysis were homogenized using the SuperFastPrep-2 cell lysis homogeniser (MP Biomedicals) at maximum speed for 10 s and were subsequently centrifuged for 1 min and 30 s at 9,800 × g. DNA was extracted using the ZymoBIOMICS DNA Miniprep kit (Zymo, D4300) following manufacturer instructions, and the resulting DNA concentration was determined using a Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher). DNA sequencing libraries were prepared using the Rapid PCR Barcoding kit (SQK-RPB004) from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). In brief, 1 µl fragmentation mix was added to 3 µl DNA (2–10 ng µl−1), and the reaction was mixed by gentle finger-flicking. The tube was placed in a miniPCR mini16 thermal cycler (Amplyus) and the DNA was fragmented using the following conditions: 30 °C for 1 min, then 80 °C for 1 min. The fragmented DNA was cooled and amplified in a PCR reaction containing 20 µl nuclease-free water, 25 µl LongAmp Taq 2× master mix (New England Biolabs (NEB), M0287L), 4 µl fragmented DNA and 1 µl barcode adaptor. The reaction was gently mixed and amplified using the following conditions: 95 °C for 3 min, 20 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing at 56 °C for 15 s and extension at 65 °C for 6 min, and a final extension of 65 °C for 6 min. The resulting DNA library was purified using 0.6× Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, A63881) and eluted in 10 µl 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 50 mM NaCl. The library concentration was determined using a Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher). Equimolar quantities of individual barcoded sample libraries were pooled and the volume adjusted to 10 µl using 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 50 mM NaCl. Subsequently, 1 µl of Rapid Adapter solution was added to the pooled library and the tube was incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Then, 34 µl sequencing buffer, 25.5 µl loading beads and 4.5 µl nuclease-free water were added to the tube, and the contents were mixed gently. The prepared pooled library was added to a verified and primed FLO-MIN106 R9.4.1 flow cell (ONT, FLO-MIN106D) in a MinION DNA sequencer (ONT) following manufacturer instructions. DNA sequencing was conducted with default parameters using MinIT (ONT) with MinKNOW v.2.1.12 (ONT). Fast5 files were base called with Guppy v.4.0.15 using the ‘template_r9.4.1_450bps_hac.jsn' high-accuracy model (ONT).

Temperature and pH distributions were compared using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test with the ks.test() function from the stats v.4.3.0 package in R and plotted with ggplot2 v.3.4.2. To explore the correlations between temperature and pH in the testa/pulp and cotyledons, scatterplots with correlation coefficients and P values were generated using the stat_cor() function from the ggpubr v.0.6.0 package. To assess dissimilarities in bean colour at the different time points during fermentation, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed with the prcomp() function in R, and the first two principal components were plotted using ggplot2 v.3.4.2. In addition, scatterplots with correlation coefficients and P values were employed to explore correlations between bean colour values, temperature and pH.

We obtained a total of 29,714,777 base-called reads (97.7 Gbp) from the whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing across the three farms. The initial dataset underwent demultiplexing, and primer and barcode sequences were trimmed using qcat v.1.1.0 (ONT). Reads with ambiguous barcode assignments were excluded from further analysis. The reads were filtered with NanoFilt (v.2.8.0)59 to discard low quality sequences (Q-score < 9) and sequences <100 bp. Reads were mapped to the Theobroma cacao Criollo v.2.0 reference genome60 as well as the Homo sapiens reference genome GRCh38.p14 (RefSeq GCF_000001405.40) using minimap2 (v.2.17)61 to identify and remove potential contaminating DNA in samples. Reads that mapped were removed using SAMtools (v.1.9)62 and Seqtk v.1.3 scripts. Following these processing steps, we retained 24,300,820 reads (80.8 Gbp) with an average read length of 3,326.4 bp (Extended Data Fig. 1h) and a mean read quality of Q13.2.

We used the Kraken v.2.1.2 pipeline63 for classifying the whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing reads. The reads were classified using the Kraken 2 archaea, bacteria, viral, plasmid, human, UniVec_Core, protozoa and fungi reference databases (k2_pluspf_20220607). To estimate relative abundances, the Bracken v.2.7 pipeline64 was applied to the classification results. Subsequently, Pavian v.1.0 facilitated the extraction of abundance and taxonomic tables. Functions in phyloseq v.1.44.0 with microbiome v.1.22.0 and microbiomeutilities v.1.0.17 were used to filter the dataset and remove samples with low read depth, remove unidentified taxa and singletons, transform abundance values using rarefaction, subset and merge sample and taxonomic groups, and perform other dataframe manipulations. To assess alpha diversity across the samples, we calculated the Shannon diversity index using phyloseq v.1.44.0. We used analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test for significant differences in Shannon diversity indices between groups, and means were separated using Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) test from the agricolae v.1.3.5 R package. For beta diversity, Bray–Curtis dissimilarity matrices were calculated using the phyloseq v.1.44.0 ‘bray' method, and the variances explained by fermentation time, farm location and harvest season were estimated by performing permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) using the adonis2() function in the vegan v.2.6.4 R package. Unconstrained and constrained ordination of beta diversity was plotted using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and canonical analysis of principal coordinates (CAP), respectively, on the basis of Bray–Curtis dissimilarity matrices calculated with vegan v.2.6.4. We visualized differences in fermentation time, farm location and harvest season with the CAP analysis, using the following models:

The relative abundance of taxa was plotted as a stacked bar representation using phyloseq v.1.44.0. The tax_glom() function in phyloseq v.1.44.0 was used to agglomerate taxa, and the aggregate_rare() function in microbiome v.1.22.0 was used to aggregate rare groups. Mantel correlations between bacterial and fungal Bray–Curtis dissimilarity matrices were performed using the mantel() function of vegan v.2.6.4, with the Pearson method and 10,000 permutations. We used DESeq2 (v.1.40.0)65 to calculate the enrichment profiles at Santander by fitting a generalized linear model (GLM) with the following design:

We extracted the following comparisons from the fitted model: 24 h vs 0 h, 48 h vs 0 h, 72 h vs 0 h and 96 h vs 0 h. Taxa at the family, genus and species levels were considered significant if they had a false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted P value (q value) < 0.05. The results of the GLM analysis were rendered in heat maps coloured on the basis of the log2 fold change output by the GLM. Significant differences between comparisons with a q value < 0.05 with log2 fold change > ±2 were highlighted with black squares.

To elucidate the genetic backgrounds of the cacao varieties cultivated across the three cocoa farms, we first conducted a survey focusing on diverse fruit morphologies to gauge the diversity present. The parameters assessed encompassed fruit characteristics such as form, basal constriction, apex, rugosity, ridging, length, diameter, wall thickness and the colour of the mature unripe fruit. Following this morphological survey, young and healthy leaf samples were collected from each distinct morphotype identified (ntotal = 24; Santander n = 12, Huila n = 5 and Antioquia n = 7). The leaf samples were washed and dried, and DNA isolation was carried out using a ZR Plant/Seed DNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo, D6020) with modifications detailed in ref. 66. The samples were genotyped at 96 SNP sites (Supplementary Table 1) on a Fluidigm Juno System using a Juno 96.96 Genotyping IFC (Standard BioTools) in accordance with manufacturer instructions. The SNP sites analysed were selected from the Theobroma cacao global reference SNP panel67,68. Briefly, genotyping assays were prepared using the Juno SNP Type Genotyping Reagent kit (Standard BioTools, 100-8364) and specific SNP type genotyping assays manufactured by Standard BioTools. The Juno 96.96 thermal cycling protocol included a multiplex specific target amplification (STA) step before the SNP genotyping to enrich the template molecules. STA thermal cycling conditions comprised 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 14 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 4 min. For SNP genotyping, reactions were initiated at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 4 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s, 64–61 °C (1 °C decrease with each cycle) for 45 s, and 72 °C for 15 s. This was followed by 39 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 15 s. Fluorescence intensity was quantified using the Fluidigm EP1 software (Standard BioTools), and genotypic calls were automatically made using Fluidigm SNP Genotyping Analysis software v.4.1.3 (Standard BioTools). SNP data generated are available in Supplementary Table 2.

The fermented beans were spread on a wooden surface in a 3–4-cm layer for sun drying. The drying mass was mixed every 1.5 h for the first 3 days of drying and every 3 h from the fourth day onward. Drying was carried out carefully to ensure that off-flavours did not develop. The beans were covered overnight and during rainy conditions. All batches underwent drying until reaching a final moisture content of 7%, taking ~7–8 days, after which they were stored in jute bags. Quality assessments were conducted on 100-g samples from each bean lot using cut tests following the procedure outlined in ref. 41. The evaluation included identifying characteristics such as underfermented (purple/violet), overfermented (grey/slaty), insect-damaged, chopped/broken, germinated, mouldy, double, or flat bean defects. Beans categorized as fully fermented with no defects and those that were partially purple were considered desirable/high quality. For the roasting process, the beans were placed on shallow perforated trays and roasted at 140 °C for 25 min a convection oven (Sheldon Manufacturing). Subsequently, the beans were cooled to ambient temperature, broken and winnowed to produce cocoa nibs. The nibs were transformed into cocoa liquor on a granite-wheeled melangeur (CocoaTown), reducing the particle size to 16–18 μm. Liquor samples (60 °C) were evaluated through coded, randomized tastings by 3–6 trained sensory panelists in duplicate or triplicate. The panelists consisted of members of the Food Technology, Quality and Sensory Evaluation team at the Cocoa Research Centre, Trinidad. The panel members were trained in accordance with the Cocoa of Excellence Programme guidelines69 under the supervision of the panel leader, and are experienced in cocoa sensory evaluation. Flavour descriptors assessed by the panel members were based on the cocoa liquor sensory evaluation template of E.S. Seguine and D.A. Sukha70 and expressed as numerical values between 0 and 10. Reference liquors from Madagascar (fine or flavour cocoa) and Ivory Coast and Ghana (bulk cocoa) were included in the sensory analysis. To neutralize palates between tastings, soda crackers and mouth rinsing with still water were employed.

SNP genotypic data were generated at 96 SNP sites for each morphotype in the study (ntotal = 24; Santander n = 12, Huila n = 5 and Antioquia n = 7). This dataset was then combined with the SNP profiles from 228 cacao reference accessions sourced from the Cocoa Research Centre, Trinidad, SNP database. The reference SNP profiles were primarily generated from cacao accessions at the International Cocoa Genebank Trinidad and were selected across the 10 cacao genetic clusters identified in ref. 71 (ntotal = 228; Amelonado n = 28, Contamana n = 15, Criollo n = 15, Curaray n = 22, Guiana n = 24, Iquitos n = 22, Marañon n = 27, Nacional n = 17, Nanay n = 23 and Purús n = 5). In addition, 30 Amelonado-Criollo hybrid accessions were included. The combined dataset was filtered by removing SNPs with >10% missing data and monomorphic SNPs. The result was a final dataset of 84 high-quality SNP markers, with a missing data range between 0 and 3.57% and a mean of 0.52% across all accessions. For phylogenetic analysis, SNP profiles were converted into DNA strings, aligned using DECIPHER v.2.24.0 and transformed into a distance matrix with seqinr v.4.2.16. A neighbour-joining tree was constructed with ape v.5.6.2, and the resulting tree was visualized using ggtree v.3.8.0 with ggtreeExtra v.1.10.0. The genetic distances were further analysed through a PCoA for visualization. The PCoA involved converting genetic distances to 2 dimensions using classical multidimensional scaling with the stats v.4.3.0 package, and plotting with ggplot2 v.3.4.2. Ancestry was inferred using STRUCTURE (v.2.3.4)72, employing structure-threader (v.1.3.10)73 for parallelized runs across multiple CPU cores. To facilitate the analysis, reference accessions were replicated to ensure a minimum representation of 60 individuals for each of the 10 cacao genetic groups. Simulations were calculated using the admixture model with alpha inferred and independent allele frequency with 200,000 burn-ins and 500,000 Monte Carlo Markov Chain repetitions without any previous genetic or geographic origin information. The number of clusters (K) was set from 8 to 12 with 30 iterations for each K value. CLUMPAK (Cluster Markov Packager Across K) (v.1.1)74 was utilized to assess the congruence among independent STRUCTURE runs for each K value, and the optimum K value was determined according to ref. 75.

To explore how the surrounding microbial environmental sources in the cocoa plantations may be contributing to cocoa fermentation communities, we used FEAST v.0.1.0 to perform community-wide microbial source tracking analysis. The results were plotted with ggplot2 v.3.4.2.

Bean quality assessments were analysed using Fisher's exact test with the fisher.test() function of the stats v.4.3.0 package. For the analysis of sensory attributes in the cocoa liquors, we estimated the variances explained by farm location, harvesting period and sensory panelists by performing PERMANOVA using distance matrices with the adonis2() function in the vegan v.2.6.4 R package. This analysis allowed us to examine how location, harvest and panelist, and their interactions, contributed to the variation in the sensory data (Fig. 3a). A constrained ordination of the sensory attributes was plotted using CAP with vegan v.2.6.4 using the following model:

To illustrate the sensory characteristics of individual cocoa liquors, the mean scores for each sensory attribute were calculated across panelists for each liquor sample. These scores were then transformed to a scale between 0 and 6 using the rescale() function of the scales v.1.2.1 R package. The transformed scores were visualized on a heat map generated with ggplot2 v.3.4.2. Hierarchical clustering of sensory attributes was applied using the ward.D2 or single method within the hclust() function in R. The clustering was based on Euclidean distances calculated using the dist() function on the transformed scores.

To identify abiotic features associated with the sensory attributes of the cocoa liquors, we utilized the Practical Program for Forces Modeling (PPFM 2020)76 tool to model the kinetics of the temperature changes during bean fermentation across the three locations. This involved randomly selecting a minimum of 15 temperature versus time data points and fitting the temperature curve using a 5-parameter general model equation. From the model, we derived several key features including: (1) maximum growth rate (peak rate at which the system grows during a specified period); (2) time to maximum kinetic energy (duration for the system to reach its maximum kinetic energy level); (3) temperature at maximum kinetic energy (the specific temperature value at the point of maximum kinetic energy); (4) exponential phase duration (period of rapid increase in numbers or activity); (5) linear phase duration (phase where the kinetics rate becomes relatively constant); (6) exponential decay phase duration (timeframe when the system starts to decline after reaching its maximum kinetics); (7) temperature change during exponential phase (change in temperature during rapid exponential kinetics); (8) temperature change during linear phase (alterations in temperature during stable kinetics); (9) temperature change during exponential decay (variations in temperature during the decline following exponential kinetics); (10) rate of temperature change during the exponential phase (speed at which temperature changes during rapid exponential kinetics); (11) rate of temperature change during the linear phase (speed at which temperature changes during stable kinetics); (12) time to inflection point (duration for the system to reach the inflection point, indicating a shift in kinetics pattern); and (13) inflection point (point on the kinetics curve where the curvature changes, signifying a transition in kinetics rate or pattern). The entire process was repeated at least three times for each farm's fermentation. In addition, we extended our analysis to model the kinetics of the inverse cotyledon pH, extracting similar curve features. The feature values were normalized using the rescale() function in the scales v.1.2.1 R package. The mean normalized feature values were then visually represented on a heat map using ggplot2 v.3.4.2. Subsequently, Pearson correlation coefficients and corresponding P values between these features were computed using the rcorr() function in the Hmisc v.5.0.1 package. The results of the correlation analysis were graphically presented using ggplot2 v.3.4.2, where the colour of the plots reflected the correlation coefficient values. Significant correlations (P < 0.05) were emphasized with black squares on the plots. Furthermore, the coefficient of variation for the feature values was calculated and depicted using ggplot2 v.3.4.2. The 3 plots were integrated on the basis of the hierarchical clustering of the Pearson correlation coefficients of the features. The clustering employed the ward.D2 method within the hclust() function in R, utilizing Euclidean distances calculated using the dist() function. For each cluster identified, we selected the feature with the highest coefficient of variation as a representative for the cluster. Following this, for each sensory attribute, we employed the randomForest v.4.7.1.1 R package to construct a random forest model. This was done to pinpoint the most significant features associated with each sensory attribute. Subsequently, we visualized the percentage increase in mean squared error (%IncMSE) for each feature by generating a heat map using ggplot2 v.3.4.2. Hierarchical clustering of the feature importance was applied using the ward.D2 method within the hclust() function in R. The clustering was based on Euclidean distances calculated using the dist() function.

To identify taxonomic markers associated with the sensory attributes of the cocoa liquors, we began by pinpointing the pivotal bacteria and fungi responsible for the notable variances in beta diversity, specifically focusing on those exerting the most influence on beta diversity disparities observed among fermentation time points and across the three farm locations. To identify the top bacteria and fungi driving the differences in beta diversity across fermentation time and farm location, we calculated PERMANOVA coefficients of the taxa using the adonis() function in the vegan v.2.6.4 R package at the genus level, and assessed their prevalence with microbiome v.1.22.0. The results were visualized using ggplot2 v.3.4.2. Bacteria with coefficients ≥10 and fungi with coefficients ≥5 were selected for further analysis. We verified that the selected bacteria and fungi could recapitulate the differences in the beta diversity of the entire community by performing a PERMANOVA with the selected taxa, as well as a CAP, on the basis of Bray–Curtis dissimilarity matrices calculated with vegan v.2.6.4 using the following models:

Subsequently, the relative abundances of the selected bacteria and fungi were extracted from the metagenomic dataset for each fermentation across the three farms and different fermentation time points. Following this, we utilized the gcplyr v.1.5.2 R package to extract growth features of the selected taxa. The extracted features encompassed: (1) first local maxima (the initial peak density achieved during growth before a subsequent decline); (2) initial density (starting density of taxa, corresponding to the first local minima in taxa density); (3) area under the curve (overall taxa growth); (4) maximum density (peak taxa density, offering insights into the taxa carrying capacity within a specific environment, or alternatively, measures of taxa growth yield or efficiency); (5) time to maximum density (duration taken to reach the maximum taxa density in the environment); (6) midpoint (the moment when the density initially reaches half of the maximum density); and (7) inflection point (the instance when the derivative of the growth curve attains its maximum value). The feature values were normalized using the rescale() function in the scales v.1.2.1 R package. The mean normalized feature values were then visually represented on a heat map using ggplot2 v.3.4.2. Hierarchical clustering of the taxa was performed using the hclust() function with the ward.D2 method, on the basis of Euclidean distances calculated with the dist() function. Subsequently, Pearson correlation coefficients and corresponding P values between these features were computed using the rcorr() function in the Hmisc v.5.0.1 package. The results of the correlation analysis were graphically presented using ggplot2 v.3.4.2, where the colour of the plots reflected the correlation coefficient values. Significant correlations (P < 0.05) were emphasized with black squares on the plots. Furthermore, the coefficients of variation for the feature values were calculated and depicted using ggplot2 v.3.4.2. The 3 plots were integrated on the basis of the hierarchical clustering of the Pearson correlation coefficients of the features. The clustering employed the ward.D2 method within the hclust() function in R, utilizing Euclidean distances calculated using the dist() function. For each cluster identified, we selected the feature with the highest coefficient of variation as a representative for the cluster. Following this, for each sensory attribute, we employed the randomForest v.4.7.1.1 R package to construct a random forest model. This was done to pinpoint the most significant features associated with each sensory attribute. Subsequently, we visualized the percentage increase in mean squared error (%IncMSE) for each feature by generating a heat map using ggplot2 v.3.4.2. Hierarchical clustering of the feature importance was applied using the ward.D2 method based on Euclidean distances.

To assess the robustness of the association between abiotic and taxonomic markers and sensory attributes in cocoa liquors, we modelled the kinetics of temperature and pH changes during bean fermentation across 19 independent fermentations, conducted on cocoa farms in diverse agroecological regions of Trinidad between 2018 and 2022. The raw data, including bean temperature, pH and corresponding bean flavour profiles from fermentations, was obtained from the internal database of the Cocoa Research Centre, The University of the West Indies. Farms and fermentation events were selected to capture the full spectrum of cocoa flavour profiles found in Trinidad, a country renowned for producing high-quality fine or flavour cocoa beans. From the kinetic curves, we extracted the following features: temperature inflection point, time to temperature inflection point, duration of the temperature exponential phase, duration of the temperature exponential decay phase, rate of temperature change during the exponential phase, pH exponential decay phase duration, and pH change rate during the exponential phase. In addition, the relative abundances of the selected bacterial and fungal taxa were extracted from metagenomic data of 11 fermentations. Subsequently, growth curves were plotted as described earlier, and the following growth features were extracted: area under the curve, inflection point, initial density and midpoint. As before, we constructed random forest models to identify the most important abiotic and taxonomic features associated with each sensory attribute. Feature importance was visualized using heat maps, displaying the percentage increase in mean squared error (%IncMSE).

Various strategies were utilized to construct the MAGs. Initially, a single-sample assembly and binning approach was adopted, where reads from individual samples were assembled into contigs using metaFlye77 in the Flye v.2.9 package with default mode. Reads from each sample were subsequently mapped to the respective assembly using minimap2 (v.2.17)61, and the corresponding abundance files were generated using SAMtools (v.1.12)62. The abundance files were used for metagenomic binning of the contigs using two different binning tools: MaxBin (v.2.2.4)78 with default parameters and MetaBAT (v.2.15)79 with specific parameters (percentIdentity=85, minContigLength=1000, minContigDepth=1). To help capture low-abundance microbes, a co-assembly and binning approach was implemented. This involved pooling reads from fermentation samples within each region (Santander, Huila, Antioquia), assembling contigs and generating metagenomic bins. In addition, a concatenation of reads from fermentation samples across all three farms was performed, followed by contig assembly and binning. These diverse strategies resulted in the construction of 1,591 MAGs. Subsequently, MAGs underwent dereplication using dRep (v.3.4.0)80, with genome filtering options set at 10,000 bp minimum length, 10% minimum completeness, 10% maximum contamination and 95% average nucleotide identity (ANI) threshold for species-level dereplication (see ref. 81 for species-level definition). The dereplicated MAGs were evaluated using CheckM (v.1.1.6)82 to determine their genome completeness and contamination levels. MAGs were assigned to be either low, medium or high quality based on the completeness and contamination levels recommended by ref. 83 (low-quality: completeness 0–50%, contamination <10%; medium-quality: completeness 50–90%, contamination <10%; high-quality: completeness >90%, contamination <5%). After excluding MAGs with contamination levels >10% and those with completeness <50% for bacteria or 30% for fungi, 55 MAGs were retained for further analysis. The completeness and contamination statistics for the final MAG set were visualized using ggplot2 v.3.4.2 (Supplementary Fig. 4a,b), and additional quality and genome statistics can be found in Supplementary Table 4. To assess how well the MAGs represented the fermentation and farm environment communities, sequence reads were mapped to the MAGs using minimap2 (v.2.17)61, and mapped reads were identified with SAMtools (v.1.9)62 and Seqtk v.1.3 (Supplementary Fig. 4c).

The taxonomic classification of the MAGs was performed using the CAT v.8.22 taxonomic classification pipeline84. This process entailed identifying open reading frames (ORFs) within each contig, followed by mapping the predicted ORFs against the NCBI NR protein database. The taxonomic assignment of the MAGs was determined on the basis of the consensus classification of individual ORFs. Taxonomic classification of the MAGs can be found in Supplementary Table 4. To visualize the relationships among the MAGs, a dendrogram was constructed using the neighbour-joining approach, utilizing marker gene sequences identified across the genomes of the 55 MAGs from the CheckM (v.1.1.6)82 tool. The marker gene sequences for each MAG were initially merged into a string and aligned using Clustal W in the msa v.1.32.0 package. The alignment was trimmed with microseq v.2.1.6, transformed into a distance matrix with seqinr v.4.2.16, and a neighbour-joining tree was constructed with ape v.5.6.2. The resulting tree was visualized using ggtree v.3.8.0 with ggtreeExtra v.1.10.0 (Fig. 4a). The ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes in the MAGs were identified using Barrnap v.0.9 (https://github.com/tseemann/barrnap). Open reading frames from each MAG were predicted using FragGeneScanRs (v.1.1.0)85 with default settings. Functional annotation of predicted proteins was performed using eggNOG-mapper (v.2.1.9)86 with the eggNOG v.5.0.2 database87 with Diamond (v.2.0.11)88 and MMseqs2 release 12-113e3 (ref. 89). To assess the relative abundance of the MAGs during fermentations, reads from each fermentation sample across the three regions were mapped to the MAGs using minimap2 (v.2.17)61, and CoverM (v.0.6.1)90 was used to extract the relative abundance counts with the ‘genome' mode and transcripts per million coverage method. Subsequently, DESeq2 (v.1.40.0)65 was used to determine the enrichment profiles of the MAGs in the three farms by fitting a GLM with the design:

We extracted the following comparisons from the fitted model: 48 h vs 0 h, 72 h vs 0 h and 96 h vs 0 h. Significance was determined with an FDR-adjusted P value (q value) < 0.05. The results of the GLM analysis were rendered in a heat map coloured on the basis of the log2 fold change. Significant differences between comparisons (q value < 0.05) with log2 fold change > ±2 were highlighted with black squares (Supplementary Fig. 4d).

To identify metabolic processes that were enriched within the microbial communities during the fermentation, we selected the contigs assembled from individual samples (380,365 contigs) and subsequently subjected them to deduplication using the dedupe.sh tool in BBTools v.38.76 to eliminate redundancies. Next, we determined the relative abundance of the contigs during fermentations by mapping the reads from the samples to the contigs using minimap2 (v.2.17)61, and extracting the relative abundance counts using CoverM (v.0.6.1)90 in the ‘contig' mode and reads_per_base coverage method. Taxonomic classification of the contigs was performed using the CAT v.8.22 taxonomic classification pipeline84. Subsequently, the contigs were filtered to retain only bacterial and fungal sequences. DESeq2 (v.1.40.0)65 was utilized to determine the contig enrichment profiles in the three farms by fitting a GLM with the following design:

We extracted the following comparisons from the fitted model: 48 h vs 0 h, 72 h vs 0 h and 96 h vs 0 h. Contigs meeting the criteria of an FDR-adjusted P value (q value) < 0.05 and a log2(fold change) > ±2 were selected for further analysis. Open reading frames encoded within the contigs were predicted using FragGeneScanRs (v.1.1.0)85 with default settings. This was followed by functional annotation of the predicted proteins using the eggNOG-mapper (v.2.1.9)86 pipeline with the eggNOG v.5.0.2 database87 with Diamond (v.2.0.11)88 and MMseqs2 release 12-113e3 (ref. 89). Enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) biochemical reactions, along with associated enzymes and proteins, were identified on the basis of an adjusted P-value threshold of <0.01 and visualized using a heat map generated with ggplot2 v.3.4.2. The genes annotated with Gene Ontology (GO) classifications were subsequently extracted, and a GO enrichment analysis focusing on biological processes was conducted. This involved employing adaptive GO clustering in conjunction with Mann–Whitney U testing, utilizing the GO_MWU tool as previously described91. In this analytical approach, genes were ranked on the basis of signed log2 fold change values. Significantly enriched and depleted GO categories were determined by an adjusted P value < 0.05 (Supplementary Table 5). The most prominent enriched and depleted GO categories shared across comparisons were visualized in ggplot2 v.3.4.2 and coloured on the basis of the square root transformed delta rank values (enrichment score) of the GO categories (Supplementary Fig. 5). Similarly, enriched biochemical reactions annotated in the KEGG database, and proteins, were identified using a generalized linear model with an adjusted P-value threshold of <0.05 (Supplementary Tables 6 and 7). Prominently enriched and depleted categories shared across comparisons were visualized as heat maps (Supplementary Fig. 6).

For each MAG, we combined the predicted coding DNA sequence and corresponding translated amino acid sequences identified with FragGeneScanRs (v.1.1.0)85 with the functional annotations predicted by eggNOG-mapper (v.2.1.9)86, into genbank-formatted files using emapper2gbk (v.0.3.0)92 in ‘genes mode'. Subsequently, these files were utilized to generate the metabolic network of the fermentation community using the Metage2Metabo (v.1.5.3)92,93 graph-based metabolic analysis pipeline. Briefly, genome-scale metabolic networks (GSMNs) were reconstructed for the 44 MAGs detected in the fermenting bean using the Metage2Metabo (v.1.5.3)92,93 pipeline with Pathway Tools (v.26.0)94. The networks were then analysed to determine individual metabolic capabilities and, subsequently, the collective metabolic capabilities of the community. Metabolites known to be present in cocoa pulp (artificial pulp components: 0.14% (w/v) high-viscosity carboxymethyl cellulose, 0.77% (w/v) low-viscosity carboxymethyl cellulose, 1.09% (w/v) pectin, 2.5% (w/v) sucrose, 4% (w/v) glucose, 5% (w/v) fructose, 1% (w/v) citric acid, 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract, 0.5% (w/v) peptone, 0.1% (w/v) calcium lactate pentahydrate, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 80, 0.05% (w/v) magnesium sulfate heptahydrate and 0.02% (w/v) manganese sulfate monohydrate) (see refs. 27,50) were used as metabolic precursors to seed the network. The cooperation potential between GSMNs was assessed by calculating the added value of metabolic cooperation within the community. The added value of cooperation was used as the metabolic target to compute the key species and a defined community. Defined microbial communities were then identified by simplifying the complexity of the full community into a defined community with equivalent metabolic capabilities. The metabolites reachable by each MAG, identified on the basis of the cocoa pulp metabolic precursors seeded in the network, were compiled into a data matrix. This matrix was visualized using ComplexHeatmap v.2.12.1 with circlize v.0.4.15 (Supplementary Fig. 7). To visualize changes in the abundance of microbes with different metabolic potential over time, the data were transformed into a distance matrix using the dist() function in R95 with the ‘euclidean' method and converted to two dimensions using classical multidimensional scaling of the dissimilarities with the stats v.4.3.0 package. Results were plotted with ggplot2 v.3.4.2 and coloured on the basis of the relative abundance of each MAG during the fermentation at each time point for each region (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Finally, our metabolic network analysis identified 10 MAGs possessing metabolic capabilities equivalent to the full community. The metabolites reachable by the 10 MAGs, based on the cocoa pulp as the precursor, were compiled and transformed into a distance matrix, then converted to two dimensions and plotted with ggplot2 v.3.4.2 as described above. We used ggvenn v.0.1.10 to visually represent the count of metabolites generated by the microbial communities, as well as to demonstrate the overlap of metabolites shared among them.

We isolated bacterial and fungal strains from fermenting cocoa beans from the Cocoa Research Centre's fermentation facility at the University of the West Indies in Trinidad. For this, mature ripe cacao pods were harvested from the International Cocoa Genebank, Trinidad (ICGT), and opened manually in the field by trained staff. The beans and surrounding pulp were scooped out by hand, placed into clean plastic bags and transported to the Cocoa Research Centre fermentation facility. The beans were placed into a pre-washed wooden fermentation box, covered with jute bags to minimize heat loss, and allowed to undergo natural fermentation at ambient temperatures ranging from a minimum of 22 °C (night-time) to a maximum of 34 °C (daytime). The beans were turned at 48 h and 96 h after fermentation initiation. Using sterile surgical gloves, two beans were collected daily from the fermentation mass at a depth of 7 cm at the centre of the fermentation box. These beans were cut into small pieces with a sterile scalpel blade. A few pieces of each bean were placed into tubes containing 80% glycerol, and the tubes were stored at −80 °C until further used. To culture the isolates, the bean–glycerol mixture was homogenized using a sterile scalpel. Samples (1 ml) of the homogenate were serially diluted (1/100, 1/1,000, 1/10,000, 1/100,000) with 10 mM MgCl2, from which 100-µl aliquots of the dilutions were plated on different selective agar media. The selective media included: (1) acetic acid medium (AAM): 1% (w/v) d-glucose (Sigma-Aldrich, G7021-5KG), 0.5% (v/v) ethanol, 0.3% (v/v) acetic acid, 1.5% (w/v) bacteriological peptone (Millipore) (Sigma-Aldrich, 91249-500 G), 0.8% (w/v) yeast extract (Millipore) (Sigma-Aldrich, 70161-500 G), 2% (w/v) agar (Sigma-Aldrich, A6686-500G), pH 4.5 with nystatin (30 mg l−1) (Sigma-Aldrich, N3503-25MU) and penicillin (50 mg l−1) (Sigma-Aldrich, 13752-5G-F); (2) De Man Rogosa Sharpe agar (MRS) (Millipore)96 (Sigma-Aldrich, 69964-500 G) with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 80 (Sigma-Aldrich, P4780-100ML) and nystatin (30 mg l−1); (3) yeast peptone glucose agar (YPG): 1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, 2% (w/v) glucose, 2% (w/v) agar, pH 5.6 with chloramphenicol (100 mg l−1) (Sigma-Aldrich, C1919-25G); and (4) nutrient agar (NA) (Millipore) (Sigma-Aldrich, 70148-500G). These media were optimized for the culture of the main taxonomic groups present in fermenting cocoa beans. The plates were incubated at various temperatures (25 °C, 30 °C, 37 °C and 42 °C) for 1–3 weeks. Colonies with distinct morphologies based on colony appearance, colour, optimal growth temperature and growth rate were selected and purified through successive subculturing until no visible signs of contamination were observed. The purified isolates were grown in liquid culture, mixed at a ratio of 1:1 with 80% (v/v) glycerol and stored at −80 °C for future use.

To identify the isolates, we conducted amplification and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene for bacteria and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region for fungi that were cultured. A single colony of each isolate was inoculated into LB media (500 µl) and incubated overnight at 28 °C with agitation at 200 r.p.m. Subsequently, 10 µl of the culture was heated at 95 °C for 5 min and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 min. The supernatant (1 µl) was used in the following PCR reaction mix: 5.4 µl Milli-Q water, 2 µl 5× Phusion HF buffer, 0.6 µl 25 mM MgCl2, 0.2 µl 10 mM dNTP, 0.2 µl DMSO, 0.25 µl of each primer (20 pmol µl−1), 0.05 µl Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB, M0530L) and 1 µl DNA. The reactions were initially heated to 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at the optimized primer temperature (16S rRNA: 58 °C, ITS: 64 °C) for 30 s, extension at 72 °C for 1 min and 30 s, and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The V1–V9 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified with the 8F forward primer (5′-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′) and fD1 reverse primer (5′-ACGGCTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′), while the ITS region was amplified using the ITS1 forward primer (5′-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG-3′) and ITS4 reverse primer (5′-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3′). To confirm the specific amplification of target DNA regions, half of the PCR volume was visualized on an agarose gel via electrophoresis. The resulting amplicons were prepared for sequencing by combining 14 µl of Milli-Q water, 1 µl of the PCR reaction and 2 µl of sequencing primer (10 pmol µl−1). Sanger sequencing of the PCR products was conducted using the 8F and ITS1 primers for bacteria and fungi, respectively, and amplicons were sequenced at Eurofins Genomics.

To characterize the metabolic potential of the defined community employed in the in vitro fermentation experiment, we sequenced the full genomes of the selected isolates. This allowed us to characterize the individual metabolic capabilities of each isolate and, in turn, understand their collective metabolic capabilities. First, we extracted the total DNA from the isolates. To accomplish this, each isolate was cultivated in its respective medium. This involved inoculating 3 ml of the medium with a single colony and incubating under optimal conditions until saturation. The cells were collected through centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The collected cells were resuspended in 3 ml 10 mM MgCl2, subjected to centrifugation as before and finally resuspended in 1 ml 10 mM MgCl2. The suspension was transferred to a 2-ml tube with glass beads (150–212 μm and 425–600 μm in size) and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 2 min. The supernatant was discarded and 1 ml of DNA extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 350 mM sorbitol, 1% N-lauryl sarcosine, 71 mM NaCl, 0.1% CTAB) with 1 µl of Monarch RNase A (NEB, T3018L) was added. The cells were lysed in a Qiagen TissueLyser II Bead Mill (QIAGEN), which involved shaking at 30 Hz for 10 min. Subsequently, the sample was incubated at 60 °C for 20 min; then an equal volume of chloroform (Scientific Laboratory Supplies, CHE1574) was added. The sample was mixed by inverting several times and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min. The aqueous layer (top layer) was transferred to a new tube and an equal volume of ice-cold isopropanol was added. The tube was inverted several times and incubated at −20 °C overnight. Afterwards, the tube was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was discarded, and the tube was inverted on tissue paper to allow the DNA pellet to air dry for 10 min. Following this, the DNA was resuspended in 50 µl of Milli-Q water. The suspension was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant containing the DNA was transferred to a 1.5-ml tube and quantified using a Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher). For the preparation of DNA libraries, the DNA was digested with NEBNext dsDNA fragmentase (NEB, M0348L) in the following reaction mix: 200 ng of DNA in 16 µl Milli-Q water, 2 µl 10× fragmentase reaction buffer v.2 and 2 µl NEBNext dsDNA fragmentase. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, and the process was halted by adding 5 µl 0.5 M EDTA pH 8. The volume was adjusted to 50 µl with Milli-Q water, and DNA fragments between 300 and 500 bp were selectively isolated using double-sided DNA selection with Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, A63881). Subsequently, the fragments were end repaired using a mixture comprising 30 µl DNA, 2.5 µl 3 U µl−1 T4 DNA polymerase, 0.5 µl 5 U µl−1 Klenow DNA polymerase, 2.5 µl 10 U µl−1 T4 PNK, 5 µl 10× T4 DNA ligase buffer with 10 mM ATP, 0.8 µl 25 mM dNTP mix and 8.7 µl Milli-Q water. After incubation at 20 °C for 30 min, the fragments were purified again using Agencourt AMPure XP beads. Following this, the DNA fragments were adenylated in a mix containing 34 µl of the end-repaired DNA, 3 µl 5 U µl−1 Klenow exo-, 5 µl 10× Enzymatics Blue buffer, 1 µl 10 mM dATP and 9 µl Milli-Q water. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by 70 °C for 5 min, and then purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads. Individual samples were indexed through ligation using a mix comprising 10.25 µl DNA, 1 µl 600 U µl−1 T4 DNA ligase, 12.5 µl of 2× Rapid Ligation buffer and 1.25 µl 2.5 µM indexing adapter from the KAPA Dual-Indexed Adapter kit (Kapa Biosystems, KK8722). Samples were incubated at 25 °C for 15 min; then 5 µl 0.5 M EDTA pH 8 was added. The fragments were purified twice with Agencourt AMPure XP beads and then enriched in the following reaction: 20 µl DNA, 25 µl of 2× KAPA HiFi HS Mix (Kapa Biosystems, KK2602), 2.5 µl 5 μM I5 primer (5′-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACAC-3′) and 2.5 µl 5 μM I7 primer (5′-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGAT-3′). The reactions were initially heated to 98 °C for 45 s, followed by 14 cycles of 98 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, with a final extension at 72 °C for 1 min. The resulting DNA libraries were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads, quantified on a Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher), and equimolar quantities of individual barcoded DNA libraries were pooled and sequenced (PE150 bp) on an MGI Tech MGISEQ-2000 sequencing platform at Beijing Genomics Institute.

A glycerol stock sample of each isolate was plated on the respective selective agar media and incubated at 30 °C for 72–96 h. Subsequently, a 15-ml tube containing 3 ml of selective medium was inoculated with a single colony from the agar plate. The tube underwent incubation at 30 °C with agitation at 80 r.p.m. for fungi, or 200 r.p.m. for bacteria, in a shaking incubator for 72–120 h. Following this incubation period, cells were collected by centrifugation at 4,000 × g at 4 °C for 8 min and subjected to three washes with 10 mM MgCl2 to remove residual media and cellular debris. The cells were then resuspended in 10 mM MgCl2, and the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) was measured to estimate cell concentrations. A pooled inoculum containing all isolates of the defined community was prepared, with the final concentration of each isolate in the pool set at 109 colony-forming units per millilitre (c.f.u.s ml−1) assuming that 1 OD600 unit is equal to 109 c.f.u.s ml−1. In addition, individual strains were systematically removed (single-strain dropout) from the 9-member microbial community to evaluate how the absence of each strain impacts overall community structure and function.

Mature, ripe, healthy and undamaged cacao pods were harvested from the ICGT. The pods were thoroughly washed with water to dislodge any debris and surface sterilized using 20% hypochlorite solution containing 0.05% Triton X-100 for 10 min in a sterile hood. Afterwards, the pods were rinsed with sterile water and swabbed with 70% alcohol. The pods were carefully opened and the beans with pulp were extracted, maintaining sterile conditions. All beans from all the pods were pooled, mixed to homogeneity and divided into six sterile microboxes (Sac O2, TP1600 + TPD1600), each containing ~1 kg of beans. Three of the microboxes received inoculation with 100 µl of the defined synthetic community inoculum (SYNCOM), while the remaining three microboxes were inoculated with only 100 µl 10 mM MgCl2, serving as the No SYNCOM control. The beans were incubated for 96 h in a temperature-controlled incubator: 0–48 h at 30 °C, 48–72 h at 35 °C, and 72–96 h at 45 °C. Daily pH measurements were taken by collecting three beans from each fermentation. The testa/pulp were separated from the cotyledons, macerated in 10 ml distilled water using a mortar and pestle, and the pH of the suspensions was determined. For monitoring the microbial community during fermentation, swab samples of the beans were collected at 0, 48 and 96 h using a Zymo Collection Swab (R1104). Samples were collected in duplicate for each fermentation box and placed in Zymo DNA/RNA Shield Lysis and Collection tubes (Zymo, R1104). The tube contents were vigorously shaken for 10 s and the tubes were stored at −20 °C until used. Following the fermentation, the beans were spread on foil trays and placed in an oven at 35 °C for 5 days to reduce the moisture content to <7%. The beans were stirred on drying days 1, 2 and 3 to prevent bean clumping.

For the single-strain dropout experiments, 125 g of dried unfermented cocoa beans was sterilized with a 70% ethanol solution containing 1% Tween 20 and then rehydrated with sterile water. Excess water was discarded and the beans were transferred to a sterile microbox (Sac O2, TP1600 + TPD1600) containing 200 ml of sterile artificial pulp. The artificial pulp contained the following components: 0.14% (w/v) high-viscosity carboxymethyl cellulose (Sigma-Aldrich, C5678-1KG), 0.77% (w/v) low-viscosity carboxymethyl cellulose (Sigma-Aldrich, C5013-1KG), 1.09% (w/v) pectin (Sigma-Aldrich, P9135-500G), 2.5% (w/v) sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich, S0389-1KG), 4% (w/v) glucose (Sigma-Aldrich, G7021-5KG), 5% (w/v) fructose (Sigma-Aldrich, F0127-1KG), 1% (w/v) citric acid (Sigma-Aldrich, C0759-1KG), 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract (Millipore) (Sigma-Aldrich, 70161-500G), 0.5% (w/v) peptone (Millipore) (Sigma-Aldrich, 91249-500G), 0.1% (w/v) calcium lactate pentahydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, C8356-250G), 0.1% (v/v) Tween 80 (Sigma-Aldrich, P4780-100ML), 0.05% (w/v) magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, M2773-1KG) and 0.02% (w/v) manganese sulfate monohydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, M7899-500G), adjusted to pH 3.6. The experimental design included a full synthetic microbial consortium (T1, 9-member SYNCOM) and modified versions where individual strains were removed (T2–T10). Control groups consisted of non-inoculated beans (T11 and T12) and beans inoculated with a randomly selected 9-member microbial consortium (T13). For each treatment, four independent fermentations were performed. The beans were incubated for 120 h in a temperature-controlled incubator under the following conditions: 0–48 h at 30 °C, 48–72 h at 35 °C, and 72–120 h at 45 °C. However, for T12, the beans were maintained at a constant temperature of 30 °C for the entire 120-h incubation period. pH measurements of the testa/pulp and cotyledons were recorded daily from a single bean of each fermentation. Swab samples for microbial community analysis were collected at 0, 24 and 48 h (n = 156), while 5 beans from each treatment replicate were sampled at 0, 48 and 120 h for metabolomic analysis (n = 156). After fermentation, beans from each treatment replicate (n = 52) were oven dried at 35 °C, as previously described, to produce cocoa liquors. In addition, total cell counts in the 9-member SYNCOM were measured using a BlauBrand Thoma counting chamber (Brand). To assess potential growth limitations, whether due to nutrient deficiencies in the pulp or environmental stresses from temperature and/or pH, each isolate was cultured in artificial pulp at pH values of 3.6, 4.6, 5.6 and 6.6. Cultures were incubated under three fermentation temperature conditions (30 °C, 35 °C and 45 °C) for 70 h with 200 r.p.m. agitation. Growth was monitored across all conditions by measuring OD600.

The DNA samples were placed in a Qiagen TissueLyser II Bead Mill (QIAGEN) and homogenized at 30 Hz for 10 min. Following this, DNA was extracted using the ZymoBIOMICS DNA Miniprep kit (Zymo, D4300) following manufacturer instructions, and the resulting DNA concentration was determined using a Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher).

We amplified the V3–V4 highly variable region (~480 bp) of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene using the 338F (5′-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCA-3′) and 806R (5′-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3′) universal primer sequences. Unique frameshifting tags were added to the 5′ end of both primers following the method outlined in ref. 97 to enhance library diversity and enable efficient multiplexing of samples for sequencing. Each sample was amplified in triplicate, and for each 96-well PCR plate of reactions, three unique sets of frameshifting tag combinations were employed with both the forward and reverse primers. This approach facilitated the effective multiplexing of samples for sequencing across multiple plates. The reaction mix for each sample included 1 µl DNA, 5 µl 2× KAPA HiFi HS Mix (Kapa Biosystems, KK2602), 0.25 µl of 338F forward primer frameshift mix (10 pmol µl−1), 0.25 µl of 806R reverse primer frameshift mix (10 pmol µl−1) and 3.5 µl Milli-Q water. The amplification protocol involved an initial heating step at 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 24 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products from the triplicate reactions were combined and purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, A63881). Subsequently, the PCR products were indexed using 96 unique reverse indexing primers. The indexing mix for each sample included 4.5 µl PCR product DNA, 5 µl 2× KAPA HiFi HS Mix (Kapa Biosystems, KK2602), 0.25 µl forward enrichment primer (10 pmol µl−1) and 0.25 µl reverse enrichment-indexing primer (10 pmol µl−1). The forward enrichment primer used was (5′-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACGCCTCCCTCGCGCCATCAGAGATGTG-3′), and the reverse enrichment-indexing primer was the TruSeq Read 2-annealing reverse Illumina adapter compatible with the Illumina MiSeq platform. The indexing procedure involved an initial heating step at 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 9 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The DNA libraries were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, A63881) and quantified with a Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher). Subsequently, the libraries were pooled in equal amounts and diluted to 10 pM for sequencing. The sequencing process (PE300) was conducted on an Illumina MiSeq instrument using the Reagent Kit V3 600-cycle (Illumina) at the DeepSeq Sequencing Facility at the University of Nottingham.

For fungal profiling, the ITS2 region was amplified and sequenced using the ITS3-F (5′-GCATCGATGAAGAACGCAGC-3′) and ITS4-R (5′-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3′) universal primer sequences described in ref. 98. To enhance library diversity and facilitate sample multiplexing for sequencing, unique frameshifting tags were incorporated at the 5′ end of both primers using the methodology outlined in ref. 97. Every sample was subjected to triplicate amplification. In addition, for each 96-well PCR plate of reactions, three distinct sets of unique frameshifting tag combinations of the forward and reverse primers were used to enable the multiplexing of samples for sequencing from multiple plates. The reaction mix for each sample comprised 1 µl DNA, 5 µl 2× KAPA HiFi HS Mix (Kapa Biosystems, KK2602), 0.25 µl ITS3-F forward primer frameshift mix (10 pmol µl−1), 0.25 µl ITS4-R reverse primer frameshift mix (10 pmol µl−1) and 3.5 µl Milli-Q water. The amplification protocol began with an initial heating step at 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 24 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, concluding with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Amplicons from the triplicate reactions were consolidated and purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, A63881). Subsequently, the samples were indexed using the TruSeq Read 2-annealing reverse Illumina adapter, pooled as previously described (see ‘Bacteria 16S rRNA library preparation and sequencing') and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform using the 600-cycle V3 Reagent kit (Illumina) at the University of Nottingham's DeepSeq Sequencing Facility.

For the validation of the defined community experiment, dried beans from the three 9-member SYNCOM inoculated fermentations were combined into a single pool, while the three No SYNCOM control batches were pooled separately. The pooled beans were then processed into cocoa liquors and subjected to sensory evaluation as described previously (see ‘Drying, roasting and sensory evaluation of liquor samples'), and well as to gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis. For the single-strain dropout experiment, cocoa beans collected at 0, 48 and 120 h of fermentation were freeze dried for 72 h and ground into a fine powder for liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) and GC–MS analysis. In addition, the dried fermented beans were processed into cocoa liquors and analysed using sensory evaluation and GC–MS.

The aroma and other volatile compounds in the cocoa bean and liquor samples were analysed at the International Flavour Research Centre (IFRC) at the University of Nottingham. Milled powder (1 g) of the cocoa samples was mixed with 10 µl 3-heptanone (0.01 μg µl−1) internal standard in hermetically sealed 20-ml vials and incubated for 5 min at 50 °C in a thermostatic agitator. A 50/30 μm DVB/CAR/PDMS SPME Fibre (Supelco) was used to extract volatile compounds from the headspace of each sample. The SPME fibre extracted for 15 min at 50 °C and desorbed for 0.5 min at 240 °C. The volatiles were analysed by GC–MS using splitless injection into a TRACE 1300 series gas chromatograph coupled with a single quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher). A ZB-WAX-plus column of 30 m length, 0.25 mm internal diameter and 0.250 μm film thickness (Phenomenex) was used with the following time–temperature programme: 40 °C for 2 min, followed by a temperature increase from 40–240 °C at a rate of 6 °C min−1, and then held at 240 °C for 5 min. A minimum of 3 replicates per liquor sample were analysed with randomized sample injections for the validation of the defined community experiment, including 9-member SYNCOM-inoculated samples, No SYNCOM samples, Santander, Huila, Antioquia and reference liquors. For the single-strain dropout experiment, individual biological replicates were utilized. The SPME fibre was conditioned for 3 min at 240 °C between samples. The quality of the headspace GC–MS runs was assessed by running the internal standard after 5–20 consecutive sample runs and estimating the variations in retention time and peak areas. Volatile compounds were identified by comparing each mass spectrum with either the spectra from standard compounds or with spectra in reference libraries (NIST/EPA/NIH Mass Spectral Library). The relative abundance of volatiles was calculated from GC peak areas by comparison with the peak area of the internal standard.

A 100-mg portion of the powdered sample was weighed and placed into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. The sample was defatted by adding 800 µl ice-cold hexane, vortexing and incubating in a sonic water bath. The mixture was centrifuged and the supernatant was discarded. This defatting process was repeated twice more, and the defatted pellet was dried using nitrogen gas with a sample concentrator (Techne). To extract metabolites, 460 µl 80% methanol was added to the dried pellet, and the mixture was vortexed, sonicated and centrifuged. The supernatant containing the metabolites was saved and the extraction was repeated twice more. The combined supernatant was centrifuged again and the final supernatant was transferred to a new tube. The extract was dried using a Savant SpeedVac SPD140DDA vacuum concentrator (Thermo Scientific) and then stored at −20 °C. Before analysis, the dried pellet was reconstituted with 50% aqueous ethanol, followed by sonication. The sample was centrifuged and the supernatant was transferred to a new 1.5-ml tube. For each time point (0, 48 and 120 h), aliquots from biological replicates of each treatment were pooled separately, transferred to LC–MS vials, capped and stored for further analysis. The generation of the untargeted metabolic profiles was performed using an Agilent 1260 Infinity II Ultra High-Performance Liquid Chromatography system coupled to an Agilent 6546 tandem quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies). Chromatographic separation was performed with an Acuity UPLC HSS T3 column (2.1 × 100 mm, 1.8 μm; Waters) fitted with a KrudCatcher pre-filter (Phenomenex). The flow rate of the mobile phase (A: 5% acetonitrile, versus B: 95% acetonitrile, both with 0.1% formic acid v/v) was at 0.3 ml min−1, with the analytical gradient starting at 5% solvent B, increasing to 15%, 25%, 35%, 45% and 65% at 2, 4, 8, 10 and 12 min, respectively, followed by column washing and re-equilibration (total run time 22 min). Quality control (QC) samples were made by pooling samples from all treatments. After injection of ×10 QC samples to condition the system, each sample was randomized to ×5 injections across the batch. QC samples were injected after every 10 consecutive runs to assess system performance across the batch. Data were collected in MS1 mode scanning 50–1,700 m/z. Reference masses were continuously injected for mass correction.

To identify the bacterial and fungal isolates cultured, we sequenced the 16S rRNA gene from the bacteria and the ITS region from the fungal isolates. Initially, low-quality bases were trimmed from the sequences, and the results were searched on the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nucleotide database using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST v.2.12.0)99 to determine the taxonomy of the species. We performed multiple sequence alignments with the 16S rRNA and ITS sequences for the bacteria and fungi, respectively, using DECIPHER v.2.24.0. The alignments were trimmed with microseq v.2.1.6, transformed into distance matrices with seqinr v.4.2.16, and neighbour-joining trees were constructed with ape v.5.6.2. The resulting trees, based on the bacterial 16S rRNA sequences (Extended Data Fig. 3b) and fungi ITS sequences (Extended Data Fig. 3c), were visualized using ggtree v.3.8.0 with ggtreeExtra v.1.10.0. To assess the overall relative abundance of our collection representing the cocoa fermentation microbiome, we used the tax_glom() function within phyloseq v.1.44.0 to aggregate taxa from the microbiome dataset of the three Colombian fermentations to the family level. Subsequently, we computed the mean relative abundance of each family at each fermentation time point and plotted the results using ggplot2 v.3.4.2.

We used Cutadapt (v.4.6)100 to eliminate primer and barcode sequences, as well as low-quality sequences, from the paired-end reads of the sequenced genomes of the isolates. Subsequently, the high-quality filtered reads were de novo assembled into a draft genome for each isolate using SPAdes (v.3.15.5)101 with default parameters. The assembled genomes were evaluated for contiguity and completeness using BUSCO (v.5.6.1)102. Open reading frames in the genomes were predicted with FragGeneScanRs (v.1.1.0)85 with default settings. Functional annotation of the predicted proteins was carried out using the eggNOG-mapper (v.2.1.9)86 pipeline, utilizing the eggNOG v.5.0.2 database87 with Diamond (v.2.0.11)88 and MMseqs2 release 12-113e3 (ref. 89). The predicted coding DNA and translated amino acid sequences, along with the predicted functional annotations, were combined into genbank-formatted files using emapper2gbk (v.0.3.0)92 in ‘genes mode'. Subsequently, the Metage2Metabo (v.1.5.3)92,93 pipeline was used to generate the metabolic network of the isolates used in the defined community. Metabolites reachable by each of the isolates in the network, based on the cocoa pulp metabolites as the precursor, were compiled into a data matrix and visualized as described previously (see ‘Metabolic network analysis and identification of a defined microbial community').

Raw reads were demultiplexed and trimmed with Cutadapt (v.4.6)100. Subsequently, the processed sequences were denoised and collapsed into amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) using the DADA2 v.1.24.0 pipeline. In brief, paired reads were filtered by removing sequences with uncalled bases, eliminating reads with >2 expected errors, and truncating reads when the average quality score dropped to <2. Error rates for forward and reverse reads were determined separately through the learnErrors() function. These error rates were then utilized to infer ASVs individually for both the forward and reverse reads, and the forward and reverse sequences were subsequently merged. The merged ASVs were used to construct an ASV sequencing table, and chimaeras were removed. Bacteria ASVs were classified using the SILVA 138 database103, while the fungi ASVs were classified using the UNITE v.9 database104. Functions in phyloseq v.1.44.0 with microbiome v.1.22.0 and microbiomeutilities v.1.0.17 were used to filter the dataset and remove samples with low read depth, remove unidentified taxa and singletons, transform abundance values using rarefaction, subset and merge sample and taxonomic groups, and perform other dataframe manipulations. To assess alpha diversity across the samples, we calculated the Shannon diversity index using phyloseq v.1.44.0. We used ANOVA to test for significant differences in Shannon diversity indices between groups, and means were separated using Tukey's HSD test in the agricolae v.1.3.5 R package. For beta diversity, Bray–Curtis dissimilarity matrices were calculated using the phyloseq v.1.44.0 ‘bray' method, and the variances explained by treatment and fermentation time were estimated by performing PERMANOVA using the adonis2() function in the vegan v.2.6.4 R package. Constrained ordination of beta-diversity was plotted using CAP on the basis of Bray–Curtis dissimilarity matrices calculated with vegan v.2.6.4. We visualized differences in treatment and time with the CAP analysis, using the following models:

PCoA based on Bray–Curtis dissimilarities was used to visualize shifts in microbial community composition across fermentation treatments (T1–T13). Bar plots showed the Euclidean distance between each treatment centroid and T1 (the full synthetic community), reflecting the degree of dissimilarity from the baseline. The relative abundance of taxa was plotted as a stacked bar representation using phyloseq v.1.44.0. The tax_glom() function in phyloseq v.1.44.0 was used to agglomerate taxa, and the aggregate_rare() function in microbiome v.1.22.0 was used to aggregate rare groups.

The data were first pre-processed, followed by analysis in R. PCA was performed using Euclidean distances with the prcomp() function, while PCoA was conducted using a dissimilarity matrix computed with the Manhattan distance in the dist() function. Classical multidimensional scaling was then applied using the cmdscale() function. The results were visualized using ggplot2 v.3.4.2. A bar plot of Manhattan distances between each treatment centroid and T1 (the full synthetic community) was generated to quantify dissimilarity from the baseline. To identify enriched volatile compounds among samples, we employed DESeq2 (v.1.40.0)65, fitting a GLM with the following design:

From the fitted model, we extracted key comparisons. A volatile compound was deemed significant if it exhibited an FDR-adjusted P value (q value) < 0.05. The GLM analysis results were visualized in a heat map, with the colours representing the log2 fold change generated by the GLM. Black squares were used to highlight significant differences (q value < 0.05) with log2 fold change > ±2 between the aforementioned comparisons.

For data analysis, the total ion chromatograms of repeat QC injections were visually assessed to check comparability of runs throughout the dataset. Initially, global MS1 features (peak height >20,000) were first extracted using Mass Profiler software (MP; v.10 Agilent Technologies) and exported to a common .CEF file for each polarity. Thereafter, files for each replicate group were time aligned to the central QC sample in Profinder software (v.10, Agilent); then features were extracted (peak height >5,000) in ‘batch targeted' mode using the global MS1 features .CEF file as a reference library. Following this pre-processing, PCoA was conducted using Euclidean distances in vegan v.2.6.4. The dissimilarity matrix was computed with the vegdist() function and then used to perform PCoA. The results were visualized using ggplot2 v.3.4.2. A bar plot depicting the Euclidean distances between each treatment centroid and T1 (the full synthetic community) was created to measure dissimilarity from the baseline. We employed DESeq2 (v.1.40.0)65 to discern enriched compounds among samples. This was achieved by fitting a GLM with the design:

From the fitted model, we identified key comparisons between treatments and fermentation times, highlighting significant differences where q values were <0.05 and log2 fold changes exceeded ±2. The results of the GLM analysis were visualized in a heat map, with colours representing the log2 fold change values generated by the model.

a. The map shows the cocoa plantations from three cocoa-growing regions in Colombia (Santander, Huila, and Antioquia) evaluated in this study. b. Schematic diagram of field bean fermentation analysis performed in this work. Cocoa varieties grown on farms were genotyped using SNP analysis. Temperature, pH, and colour changes in the fermenting beans were recorded daily. Microbial communities were characterised using Oxford Nanopore metagenomic shotgun sequencing. After fermentation and drying, beans were processed into cocoa liquors and analysed through sensory evaluation and metabolomics. The diagram was created in BioRender. Gopaulchan, D. (2025) https://BioRender.com/t56v367c. Line graphs depict the magnitude of distribution of bean temperature and pH recorded during the fermentation. The difference between distributions was assessed using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, with corresponding p-values indicated within the plots. d. Pearson correlation analysis between the temperature and pH of the bean cotyledon and between the pH of the bean cotyledon and the pH of the testa/pulp compartment. A linear regression line illustrates the relationship, with a shaded band representing the 95% confidence interval. The scatter plots display correlation coefficients (r) and associated p-values. e. The images show the daily appearance of the cocoa bean, from the beginning (0 h) to the end (168 h) of the fermentation. f. Principal component analysis (PCA) of bean colour changes during fermentation. PCA is based on extracted RGB values from images of the beans taken daily. A minimum of eight points on each bean image were analysed for each time point. g. Pearson correlation analysis between bean colour parameters (blue, green, red, grayscale, and luminance) and fermentation temperature, between the bean colour parameters and the pH of the bean's cotyledon, and between the bean colour parameters and the pH of the testa/pulp pH. The relationship is illustrated by a linear regression line, with the shaded region indicating the 95% confidence interval. Correlation coefficients (r) and associated p-values are shown within each panel. h. Read length distribution of Nanopore sequencing reads. The dashed red line indicates the average read length of 3,326.4 bp.

a. Features extracted from the temperature kinetic curves and b. pH kinetic curves of fermenting beans. The heatmap on the left displays key features extracted from the kinetic curves and is coloured according to mean normalised values. Pearson correlation coefficients for these features are in the centre heatmaps. Relationships were assessed using two-sided Pearson correlation tests. The plot is coloured to reflect the correlation coefficient (r) values and significant correlations (p < 0.05) are highlighted with black squares. The bar plot on the right indicates the coefficient of variation of the feature extracted, with selected features highlighted in purple. All plots are clustered based on r values. c. Scatter plots illustrate PERMANOVA coefficients and prevalence of individual bacterial and d. fungi taxa across fermentation time points and farm locations in Santander, Huila, and Antioquia. Bacteria and fungi with coefficients ≥ 10 and ≥ 5, respectively, are highlighted in red. e. Canonical analysis of principal coordinate of microbiome composition showing the projected bacterial and f. fungal community assembly across fermentations. Group differences were assessed using a PERMANOVA with 9999 permutations. PERMANOVA R2 and p-values explained by fermentation time points and farm location are indicated within the plots. g. Features extracted from the growth curves of selected bacteria and fungi in fermenting beans. Bacteria and fungi growth curves were plotted based on their relative abundance in fermenting beans from Santander, Huila and Antioquia, and growth features of the selected taxa were extracted. The heatmap on the left depicts key features extracted from the growth curves, coloured based on mean normalised values. Pearson correlation coefficients (r) for these features are presented in the centre heatmap, with significant correlations (p < 0.05) highlighted by black squares. Relationships were assessed using two-sided Pearson correlation tests. The right bar plot indicates the coefficient of variation of the feature values, with selected features highlighted in purple. The three plots are clustered based on r values. The left heatmap is also clustered according to taxa abundance.

a. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) showing the projected metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) abundance, with varying metabolic potentials, throughout the fermentation process in Santander, Huila, and Antioquia. The metabolic potential of each MAG, derived from cocoa pulp as the precursor, was transformed into a distance matrix and then converted into two dimensions using classical multidimensional scaling. MAGs are coloured based on their relative abundance during fermentation at each time point for each region. b. Neighbour-joining trees displaying bacteria and c. fungi isolates cultured in this study. The tips of the trees are coloured according to Phylum. d. The bar graph illustrates the total relative abundance of the microbial communities, in fermenting cocoa beans (from Santander, Huila, and Antioquia), our isolates represent at the family level, at different time points during the process.

a. Schematic representation of the experimental design showing the combinations of microbes used in cocoa beans fermentations performed using a full synthetic microbial consortium (T1, 9-member SYNCOM) and modified versions where individual strains were removed (T2–T10). Controls included non-inoculated beans (T11 and T12) and beans inoculated with a randomly selected 9-member microbial consortium (T13). b. The graphs illustrate the kinetics of pH changes in the cotyledons (red) and testa/pulp (purple) of cocoa beans fermented in vitro using the microbial combinations described in panel a. Smoothed lines indicate fitted trends based on raw data, with shaded areas representing 95% confidence intervals. The red dashed lines indicate the time at which the beans were turned during the fermentation.

a. The graphs depict the kinetics of pH changes in the cotyledons (red) and testa/pulp (purple) measured in cocoa beans fermented in vitro fermentations inoculated (SYNCOM; top)) or not (No SYNCOM; bottom) with a synthetic microbial consortium at different time points. Smoothed lines indicate fitted trends based on raw data, with shaded areas representing 95% confidence intervals. The red dashed lines indicate the time at which the beans were turned during the fermentation. b. The heatmap depicts the growth of individual isolates from the defined synthetic community (SYNCOM). Isolates were cultured in artificial cocoa pulp media under varying pH conditions and temperatures for 72 h. Growth is represented by the area under the growth curve, with the heatmap colour-coded to reflect these values. Additionally, isolate Acetobacter ID918 was also cultured in acetic acid medium, as indicated by an asterisk (*). c. Total cell counts were determined in in vitro fermentations inoculated with the defined synthetic community and measured at different time points throughout the fermentation process. Smoothed lines indicate fitted trends, with shaded areas representing 95% confidence intervals.

a. Graphs showing the alpha diversity estimates of bacterial and b. fungal communities in fermenting cocoa beans inoculated with the full microbial synthetic community (T1, 9-member SYNCOM) and modified versions where individual strains were removed (T2–T10). Controls included non-inoculated beans (T11 and T12) and beans inoculated with a randomly selected 9-member microbial consortium (T13). For each treatment, four independent fermentations were conducted, with a single microbial DNA sample collected from the fermenting mass at 0, 24, and 48 h in each fermentation. After quality filtering, 155 bacterial (n = 155) and 154 fungal (n = 154) community profiles were retained for downstream analysis. The alpha diversity was estimated using the Shannon Diversity Index. Boxplots depict the distribution of Shannon Diversity Index values at different sample time points. The horizontal line inside each box marks the median, and the box edges correspond to the interquartile range (from the 25th to the 75th percentile). Whiskers extend to the minimum and maximum values within 1.5 times the interquartile range from the lower and upper quartiles. Individual data points, including outliers, are displayed as overlaid dots. One-way ANOVA was used to identify significant differences among groups and means were separated using Tukey's post hoc test. Letters indicate similarities and differences between groups (p < 0.05).

a Canonical analysis of principal coordinate (CAP) of microbiome composition showing the projected bacterial community assembly across the different in vitro fermentations inoculated with the full microbial synthetic community (T1, full 9-member SYNCOM) and modified versions where individual strains were removed (T2–T10). Controls included non-inoculated beans (T11 and T12) and beans inoculated with a randomly selected 9-member microbial consortium (T13). Group differences were assessed using a PERMANOVA with 9999 permutations. CAP ordination illustrates sample clustering by synthetic community treatment, with the PERMANOVA R² and p-value displayed within the panel. The bar on the left describes the variance explained by the different experimental variables. b. CAPs analysis showing the projected bacterial community assembly in the individual fermentations inoculated with the different microbial combinations described in panel a at distinct time points. c. CAP analysis of microbiome composition showing the projected fungal community assembly across the different in vitro fermentations inoculated with the different microbial combinations described in panel a. Group differences were assessed using a PERMANOVA with 9999 permutations. CAP ordination illustrates sample clustering by synthetic community treatment. The PERMANOVA R² and p-value are shown. The bar on the left describes the variance explained by the different experimental variables. d. CAPs analysis showing the projected fungal community assembly in the individual fermentations inoculated with the different microbial combinations described in panel a at distinct time points. e. Phylogram illustrating the relative abundance of key bacterial and f. fungal families across in vitro fermentations inoculated or not with the different microbial combinations described above at distinct time points. The 0 h time point represents samples collected after the initial synthetic microbial consortium was applied. The proportions in the bar plots represent the average relative abundances of each taxon, calculated across multiple replicate samples for the bacterial (ntotal = 155) and fungal (ntotal = 154) communities.

a. Principal coordinate analyses (PCoA) showing the volatile compound profile projections of cocoa beans fermentations driven by different synthetic microbial consortium and b. fermentation time. Fermentations were carried out using a full synthetic microbial consortium (T1, 9-member SYNCOM) and modified versions where individual strains were removed (T2–T10). Controls included non-inoculated beans (T11 and T12) and beans inoculated with a randomly selected 9-member microbial consortium (T13). c. Heatmaps displaying the enrichment profiles of individual volatile compounds detected in beans fermentations from a. Squares outlined in black indicate volatile compounds that were significantly enriched (red) or depleted (blue) relative to the start of fermentation (0 h) (q < 0.05 and log2 fold change > ±2). Both volatile compounds and bean samples are clustered based on their log2 fold change values. d. Bar plot showing the number of enriched and depleted volatile compounds detected in each synthetic microbial consortium treatment compared to T1 at 120 h. e. Principal coordinate analyses (PCoA) showing the non-volatile compound profile projections in cocoa beans during fermentation with the different starters (left) described in panel a, and across fermentation time (right). f. Principal coordinate analyses (PCoA) showing the non-volatile compound profile projections in cocoa beans during fermentation driven by the starters described in panel a at different fermentation times (0, 48, 120 h). Points are coloured according to the microbial starter treatments.

a. Heatmaps showing individual non-volatile compounds enriched or depleted at 48 h and 120 h compared to 0 h for each microbial treatment used. Cocoa bean fermentations were conducted using the full synthetic microbial consortium (T1, 9-member SYNCOM) and modified versions where individual strains were systematically removed (T2–T10). Control conditions included non-inoculated beans (T11, T12) and beans inoculated with an alternative, randomly selected 9-member consortium (T13). b. Heatmaps showing individual non-volatile compounds enriched or depleted in the different fermentations (T2-T13) described above relative to the fermentation with the full synthetic community (T1; 9-member SYNCOM) at 0 h, 48 h, and 120 h. A generalised linear model was used to assess enrichment, with significant changes determined by an adjusted p-value < 0.05 and log₂ fold change > ±2. Heatmaps are colour-coded, with red indicating enriched compounds and blue indicating depleted compounds. Hierarchical clustering highlights trends in compound variation across different time points and fermentation treatments. c. Bar plot showing the number of enriched and depleted non-volatile compounds detected in each synthetic microbial consortium treatment compared to T1 at 0 h, 48 h, and 120 h. d. Heatmap representing sensory attributes of cocoa liquors produced from beans fermented with the microbial consortia described in panel a. Mean sensory scores from panel evaluations were normalised between 0 and 6. The coloured bar at the top categorises sensory profiles based on the Cocoa of Excellence classification. Clustering was applied to identify similarities in sensory characteristics among different cocoa liquors.

In this Resource, we present an extensive dataset of chemical-induced gene signatures (CIGS), encompassing expression patterns of 3,407 genes regulating key biological processes in 2 human cell lines exposed to 13,221 compounds across 93,664 perturbations. This dataset encompasses 319,045,108 gene expression events, generated through 2 high-throughput technologies: the previously documented high-throughput sequencing-based high-throughput screening (HTS2) and the newly developed highly multiplexed and parallel sequencing (HiMAP-seq). Our results show that HiMAP-seq is comparable to RNA sequencing, but can profile the expression of thousands of genes across thousands of samples in one single test by utilizing a pooled-sample strategy. We further illustrate CIGS's utility in elucidating the mechanism of action of unannotated small molecules, like ligustroflavone and 2,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde, and to identify perturbation-induced cell states, such as those resistant to ferroptosis. The full dataset is publicly accessible at https://cigs.iomicscloud.com/.

Machine learning has become ubiquitous in materials modelling and now routinely enables large-scale atomistic simulations with quantum-mechanical accuracy. However, developing machine-learned interatomic potentials requires high-quality training data, and the manual generation and curation of such data can be a major bottleneck. Here, we introduce an automated framework for the exploration and fitting of potential-energy surfaces, implemented in an openly available software package that we call autoplex (‘automatic potential-landscape explorer'). We discuss design choices, particularly the interoperability with existing software architectures, and the ability for the end user to easily use the computational workflows provided. We show wide-ranging capability demonstrations: for the titanium–oxygen system, SiO2, crystalline and liquid water, as well as phase-change memory materials. More generally, our study illustrates how automation can speed up atomistic machine learning in computational materials science.

Machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are now established as the method of choice for large-scale, quantum-mechanically accurate atomistic simulations1,2,3,4,5, with applications ranging from high-pressure research6,7,8 to the discovery of molecular reaction mechanisms9,10 and even to the realistic modelling of proteins11. MLIPs are trained on quantum-mechanical reference data—typically derived from density-functional theory (DFT)—using a variety of methods from linear fits12,13,14 and Gaussian process regression15 to neural-network architectures16,17,18,19,20,21,22. Traditionally, MLIPs have been largely hand-crafted models, built using configurations manually tailored for domain-specific tasks23,24,25,26, such as the fracture of silicon24 or the crystallisation of Ge–Sb–Te memory materials26. More recently, a trend has emerged towards pre-trained or ‘foundational' MLIPs27,28: these models are fitted to large datasets including many chemical elements, and can be fine-tuned for downstream tasks27,29.

With sophisticated MLIP fitting frameworks available and continuously improving, we argue that the next area of innovation lies in the data used to train the models30,31. The aforementioned fine-tuning is one example of the more general challenges in this field: constructing high-quality datasets still remains a non-trivial, time- and labour-intensive aspect of MLIP model development, and (more) efficient methods for data generation are needed. Commonly, active-learning strategies are now used to iteratively optimise datasets by identifying rare events and selecting the most relevant configurations via suitable error estimates32,33,34. Active learning has been widely used to explore phase transitions35,36,37 and chemical reactions38,39,40. And yet, such methods often still rely on costly ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) computations to expand and refine the training datasets.

Currently available ‘foundational' MLIPs are typically fitted to a dataset comprising relaxation trajectories of diverse crystalline materials sourced from the Materials Project initiative41,42. The present work is concerned with the—somewhat orthogonal—question of how one can build an MLIP model from scratch: exploring local minima but also highly unfavourable regions of a given potential-energy surface, which need to be taught to a robust potential. Previous work showed that random structure searching (RSS) provides a particularly promising approach for the exploration and iterative fitting of configurational space (Fig. 1a–c)43,44,45,46,47,48,49. The principle of the original RSS approach, known as Ab Initio Random Structure Searching (AIRSS)50,51, is illustrated by panels a–b in Fig. 1, and the approach proposed in ref. 43 unifies it with MLIP fitting: using gradually improved potential models to drive the searches, without relying on any first-principles relaxations (only requiring DFT single-point evaluations) or pre-existing force fields. We note that AIRSS has been used as part of the approach for developing the recently described ‘graph networks for materials exploration' (GNoME)52 and MatterSim53 models to create structurally diverse training data.

From left to right, the process involves: (a) the random sampling of structures, using suitable constraints (in this simple cartoon, we assume that we are searching for crystal structures of a binary compound, containing one atom of each type under periodic boundary conditions, with xi denoting the atomic coordinate vector of the i-th structure in configuration space); (b) the relaxation of those structures into local minima which correspond to relevant crystal structures; and (c) the fitting of machine-learned (ML) potentials. Panel (d) provides a high-level overview of the workflow structure: the left-hand side is a cartoon of a 'flow' consisting of two arbitrary 'jobs' to be carried out in sequence, and the schematic in the main part of the figure summarises our approach taken in autoplex. We colour-code the different key steps in white (random structure generation, here using the buildcell code of Ab Initio Random Structure Searching, AIRSS50,51), red (iterative exploration), yellow (sampling and single-point computations, the latter using density functional theory, DFT), and blue (fitting of a machine-learned interatomic potential, MLIP).

To date, these RSS-related approaches still depend heavily on the user's expertise and time and are by no means trivial to implement. This challenge is particularly apparent for very large training datasets, where manually executing and monitoring tens of thousands of individual tasks is practically impossible. A similar challenge was previously observed in DFT-driven materials discovery, and automation approaches have been developed in response54: numerous workflow systems can now be used to streamline first-principles materials exploration55,56,57,58,59. Owing to such efforts, together with high-performance computing facilities, DFT-driven high-throughput simulations have become commonplace today and have played an important role in the computational discovery of new materials60,61,62. However, the same level of maturity has not yet been achieved for the full development pipeline of MLIPs (exploration, sampling, fitting, refinement): although important steps have recently been made63,64,65,66,67,68,69, the development of fully automated workflows for MLIPs remains in high demand.

Here, we describe an automated implementation of iterative exploration and MLIP fitting through data-driven random structure searching, focusing on both the automation infrastructure and its implications for materials modelling applications. We show that, within the open-source autoplex code we have developed, MLIP fitting can be carried out in a largely automated way on high-performance computing systems and in a high-throughput manner—and we show how the resulting potentials are robust and useful, especially given the ease with which they can be created from scratch. Note that our benchmarks here are restricted to bulk systems, whereas surfaces, interfaces, and reaction pathways remain important and challenging frontiers for future extension. We expect that this work will contribute to the mainstream uptake of ML-driven atomistic modelling in the wider community in the years ahead.

The autoplex framework is a modular set of software that is interfaced to widely-used computational and automation infrastructure where applicable. In particular, our code follows the core principles of (and reuses some functionalities implemented in) the atomate270 framework, which in turn underpins the Materials Project initiative41,42. The code is available openly via GitHub, distributed under a permissive licence, and accompanied by documentation to facilitate its uptake. In the present work, we mainly use the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP)15 framework to drive exploration and potential fitting, leveraging the data efficiency of GAP and building on previous successful applications for this purpose43,47. We do note that autoplex is designed to accommodate other MLIP architectures as well.

We demonstrate the validity of the method using key examples, moving up in difficulty from elemental silicon to the polymorphs of TiO2, and onwards to the full binary titanium–oxygen system. Figure 2 shows the evolution of energy prediction errors for relevant crystalline modifications with an increasing number of DFT single-point evaluations used to create GAP-RSS models. Each panel in Fig. 2 corresponds to a separate round of iterative, automated training using autoplex (details are provided in Supplementary Note 1). Each step encompasses 100 single-point DFT evaluations whose results are added to the training dataset. The root mean square error (RMSE) between the predicted and reference energies is used as a performance metric to evaluate models.

We show the results of autoplex runs, characterised by the energy prediction error of the models, for gradually more complex scenarios: (a) the diamond-type and β-tin-type form of elemental silicon, as well as the open-framework oS24 allotrope described in ref. 71; (b) the common rutile and anatase forms of TiO2, as well as the less common 'B' polymorph; and (c) three phases from the full binary Ti–O system. Note that the exploration for panel (b) included only stoichiometrically precise TiO2 structures, whereas that in panel (c) used a variable composition range. The data are shown in a style similar to ref. 47. The grey-shaded area indicates errors below 0.001 eV at.−1, which we take to roughly correspond to the accuracy limit achievable using density functional theory (DFT)47. The dashed line marks an error of 0.01 eV at.−1. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

Silicon (Fig. 2a)—perhaps the classic test case for any materials simulation method—has a main allotrope with the diamond-type structure, and multiple higher-pressure forms, prominently the β-tin type structure. We also include the open-framework oS24 allotrope of silicon71 as an example of a metastable phase that has been experimentally characterised and includes lower-symmetric atomic environments, as a more challenging test case for autoplex. The tests in Fig. 2a are similar to earlier work in ref. 47 and, for consistency, use the same DFT parameters as in that previous work (e.g., the same exchange–correlation functional). All three allotropes are well described to within an accuracy on the order of 0.01 eV at.−1: the highly symmetric diamond- and β-tin-type structures with  ≈ 500 DFT single-point evaluations, the oS24 structure within a few thousand (Fig. 2a). We take 0.01 eV at.−1 to be a ‘sensible' accuracy target for random exploration, and indicate this value by dashed horizontal lines in Fig. 2. The higher numerical error for β-tin-type compared to diamond-type silicon (green vs. purple in Fig. 2a) is consistent with previous work on a general-purpose GAP model for the element24 as well as an earlier GAP-RSS study47.

The binary oxide, TiO2, is structurally highly diverse, therefore forming a suitable next target for testing a crystal-structure searching method. The compound mainly exists in two common forms—rutile and anatase—which contain distorted octahedrally coordinated [TiO6] units and differ in the connectivity of the coordination polyhedra. We also include the bronze-type (‘B-') polymorph of TiO2, which is less abundant, but has been of interest for battery research72,73. Figure 2b shows that while the two main polymorphs are again correctly recovered, and the prediction error for TiO2-B reduces to a few tens of meV at.−1 as well, the latter polymorph appears to be distinctly more difficult to ‘learn' than the two simpler ones.

We finally study the exploration of a full binary system containing multiple phases with varied stoichiometric compositions. In Fig. 2c, we present the results of testing our approach on compounds with different stoichiometric compositions (and electronic structure), viz. Ti2O3, TiO, and Ti2O. While we truncate the plot at 0.001 eV at.−1, we emphasise that we already consider achieving an accuracy of  ≈ 0.01 eV at.−1 to be sufficient in this test of random exploration. It is fair to observe that compared to simpler phases such as rutile and anatase, achieving the target accuracy in this case requires a greater number of iterations, as the search space is more complex. We explore the behaviour for RSS runs up to 5000 structures in Supplementary Fig. 1.

Table 1 shows results for relevant main Ti–O polymorphs, evaluated with the TiO2 potential characterised in Fig. 2b, and with the Ti–O potential from Fig. 2c. This is a particularly instructive case because it allows us to probe the limits of the method: if only trained on TiO2, a GAP-RSS model will faithfully capture the polymorphs with this specific stoichiometric composition, but produces unacceptable errors when applied to compositions that deviate largely from the stoichiometry ( > 100 meV at.−1 for one of the Ti3O5 polymorphs, and  > 1 eV at.−1 for rocksalt-type TiO, for example). In contrast, by training the model for the full Ti–O system (cf. Fig. 2c), we are able to obtain an accurate description for several different phases. This example highlights the flexibility of autoplex in handling varying stoichiometric compositions, requiring no substantially greater effort from the user than that for a single stoichiometrically precise compound—all that is required is a change in input parameters for RSS, and probably a moderately increased amount of computational resources. We note that likely, the overall accuracy of those models can be improved further—for the time being, we report them as obtained with standard DFT and GAP fitting settings. An examination of potential data leakage is provided in Supplementary Note 1.

A distinct advantage of the RSS approach for potential fitting is that it requires only single-point computations to generate the reference data43. We therefore posit that we are able to use autoplex to easily build high-quality potentials beyond the ‘standard' GGA functionals that are commonly used. We show here an example where higher-level data are crucial.

The seemingly simple silicon dioxide, SiO2, has long posed challenges for atomistic modelling (see ref. 25 and references therein). We start by running our workflow using the economic Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional74. We then re-run the workflow with the same RSS parameter settings (Supplementary Note 1), this time using the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (SCAN) functional75. Figure 3a shows that for α-quartz, achieving high prediction accuracy (1 meV at.−1) with both PBE and SCAN functionals requires less than 10,000 CPU core hours, corresponding to nominal costs on the order of $100. For the structurally more complex α-cristobalite polymorph, SCAN incurs higher computational costs compared to PBE but still remains at the scale of 10,000s of core hours.

a Energy prediction errors for α-quartz and α-cristobalite, plotted as a function of computational cost for autoplex runs using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) and Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (SCAN) functionals, respectively. The grey-shaded region corresponds to errors below 0.001 eV at.−1. b DFT-computed energies of key SiO2 polymorphs, relative to α-quartz which is set as energy zero. Note that PBE erroneously predicts α-cristobalite as being more stable than α-quartz; this incorrect prediction is highlighted by the orange shading. c Energy difference between α-quartz and α-cristobalite as a function of the number of training structures for Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) models trained with PBE (GAP@PBE) and SCAN (GAP@SCAN). The symbol E denotes the energy. The dashed line represents the benchmark energy difference between α-quartz and α-cristobalite obtained from DFT calculations. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

Why SCAN? The importance of using this higher-rung functional in this case becomes apparent when inspecting the absolute energy predictions of the different MLIPs. PBE fails to correctly reproduce the stability ordering of SiO2 polymorphs, incorrectly predicting that α-cristobalite is more stable than α-quartz (identified by a negative value in Fig. 3b, highlighted in orange). This is an issue that is well known for some DFT methods (see, e.g., an early study in ref. 76). By contrast, SCAN does identify α-quartz as stable—and indeed this DFT level has been used to train an MLIP for SiO2 before25, as well as a more comprehensive one for the binary Si–O system77. Further work could now include a direct benchmarking of our candidate RSS-derived MLIPs, as well as other data-generation workflows65,66,67,68, against the models of refs. 25 and 77.

Figure 3c illustrates the energy difference between α-cristobalite and α-quartz as a function of the number of training structures for GAP models trained with PBE and SCAN. The results indicate that the stability predictions from both GAP-RSS runs align well with the respective DFT results—but because of the underlying training data, the GAP@SCAN model is qualitatively correct (ΔE > 0), whereas the GAP@PBE model is not (ΔE < 0).

Table 2 shows the results for additional SiO2 polymorphs: aside from α-cristobalite, the stability order of moganite and tridymite with respect to α-quartz is also inaccurately predicted by DFT@PBE and GAP@PBE. In contrast, DFT@SCAN and GAP@SCAN successfully capture the stability of different crystal structures with overall accuracy. However, in terms of numerical precision, there is no significant difference between the performance of the GAP@PBE and GAP@SCAN models. Even polymorphs with more complex unit cells are still predicted within our primary accuracy target of 10 meV at.−1. An energy–volume analysis demonstrates that the structures generated through RSS iterations tend to approach the ground-state phases of SiO2 polymorphs (Supplementary Fig. 2).

Apart from crystalline inorganic solids, we assess the ability of our approach to describe condensed-phase molecular systems. Among them, water is particularly challenging, where, in addition to coexisting covalent bonds and hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces also play non-negligible roles. Such interatomic complexity makes the modelling of water highly sensitive to the choice of DFT functionals (a systematic investigation can be found in ref. 78). Here, we train a GAP-RSS potential at the level of revPBE-D3 with zero-damping79, which has been shown to reproduce the experimental radial distribution functions (RDFs) of liquid water with accuracy comparable to hybrid functionals80,81, but at much lower computational cost. Beyond GAP, we explore the use of a different MLIP fitting architecture, focusing on graph-neural-network potentials, aiming to better capture the aforementioned interactions in different condensed phases of water.

Figure 4 characterises results for liquid water and ice polymorphs. We run GAP-RSS iterations as before, during which the model progressively identifies an increasing variety of hydrogen-bonded environments (Supplementary Fig. 3). The resulting potentials provide an overall correct description of the structure of liquid water in MD simulations (Fig. 4a), although the intensity of the first peak in the O–O RDF is more pronounced in the simulation than in experiment. We do not present the H ⋯ H interactions here, as our MD simulations do not account for nuclear quantum effects, which significantly influence the first peak of the RDF—see, e.g., ref. 82 for a discussion of these effects.

For this test, structures were taken from ref. 89, and re-evaluated with DFT using the revPBE-D3(zero) functional79. This plot highlights the improved extrapolation capability of the NequIP model, compared to the initial GAP-RSS one, in capturing energy trends across different phases. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

With an initial GAP-RSS-based dataset available, we carried out fits using the NequIP architecture19, and used the resulting models to drive MD simulations in LAMMPS83. We used the implementations of the NequIP architecture, the training loop, and the relevant pair style from the graph-pes package84 to do this (hyperparameters are provided in Supplementary Note 1). We find that both GAP and NequIP models fitted to the same GAP-RSS dataset can accurately describe key structural features of liquid water (Fig. 4a–b), with the NequIP model showing some improvements for the second peak in the H–O RDF and the first peak in the O–O RDF (Fig. 4b). We emphasise that both fits could most likely be improved by using hand-crafted datasets: the aim of Fig. 4 is not to benchmark specific architectures, but to test what type of practical use can be gained from an MLIP model fitted purely to automatically generated RSS data.

The unique properties of liquid water are usually attributed to its strong hydrogen-bond network85,86. Figure 4c shows that both our GAP and NequIP models, fitted to the same autoplex-generated GAP-RSS dataset, can appropriately describe the number of hydrogen bonds per molecule in liquid water in MD simulations, which matches the previously reported range of 3.48 to 3.84 based on different density functionals87. The NequIP model predicts a slightly higher average than the original GAP-RSS one, around 3.5, which is closer to the upper end of the range. We note in passing that MD simulations using random-search-based ‘ephemeral data-derived potentials' (EDDPs) have been presented recently88, in that case for hydrogen diffusion in ScH12.

Beyond liquid water, we also tested our models by predicting the energies of 54 ice crystal structures (structures taken from ref. 89; Fig. 4d). Here, the results from the GAP-RSS model are highly scattered, whereas the NequIP model shows much improved predictive accuracy. The poor performance of the GAP model could be due to the sparsity of low-density phases in the dataset—which, in turn, would underscore the extrapolation capability of the NequIP model, allowing it to better handle structures that are substantially different from the training data.

The above discussion suggests that the GAP-RSS dataset is not only effective for training a GAP model itself, but is also beneficial for use with other, more complex fitting frameworks. Future work could explore the suitability of autoplex-generated (GAP-) RSS datasets as a pre-training task for subsequent fine-tuning of MLIP models, building on our previous study which showed that pre-training NequIP models can enhance not only numerical quality in the low-data regime, but also stability in MD simulations90.

We finally demonstrate the applicability of autoplex to an inorganic material system of ‘real-world' interest. For this purpose, we focus on two ternary chalcogenides, viz. Ge1Sb2Te4 and In3Sb1Te2, which are relevant for applications in phase-change memory devices91,92,93. We have recently hand-built a GAP model for compositions along the pseudo-binary line between GeTe and Sb2Te3 (referred to as ‘GST' alloys)26, enabling an accurate description of the amorphous structure (digital ‘zero bits') and its crystallisation (‘0 → 1'). One of the challenges in modelling amorphous GST is the formation of tetrahedral structural motifs (Fig. 5a), which are relevant for ageing phenomena: the amount of those tetrahedra has been argued to change over time, affecting the stability of the zero bits94. However, this hand-crafted GAP model (denoted ‘GST-GAP-22') took months to complete, involving multiple runs of domain-specific iterations to cover the structural complexity of the Ge–Sb–Te system26. This makes Ge1Sb2Te4 an excellent candidate for testing our automated, RSS-based workflows in computational practice.

Atoms are colour-coded as follows: Ge in green, Sb in purple, Te in grey, and In in yellow. (c) Radial distribution function (RDF) and (d) distribution of shortest-path rings in a-Ge1Sb2Te4. e, f Same but for a-In3Sb1Te2. The symbol r represents the radial distance from a reference particle. All ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) data for a-Ge1Sb2Te4 are sourced from the literature26. For a-In3Sb1Te2, the AIMD-derived RDF data for a density of 6.448 g cm−3 are sourced from ref. 97, while the AIMD data at 6.120 g cm−3 for the RDF in panel (e) and the ring distribution in panel (f) are obtained from our own simulations with CP2K123,124 (Supplementary Note 1). The label 'GAP' in these panels refers to Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) models obtained via random structure searching (RSS). The boxplots in panels (d) and (f) represent the distribution of values across trajectories (see Supplementary Note 1 for statistics). The central line in each box indicates the median, the box spans the inter-quartile range (IQR), and the whiskers extend to 1.5 × IQR. Outliers are shown as individual points. g A crystallisation simulation of Ge1Sb2Te4 using our GAP-RSS-derived potential, showing the progressive crystallisation over a simulation period of 350 ps.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

Compared to GST, In3Sb1Te2 (‘IST' in the following) is a rather unconventional phase-change material, with structural building blocks slightly different from those of GST. The latter alloys structurally resemble their constituent binary phases (viz. GeTe and Sb2Te3), and they can take disordered and defective rocksalt-like metastable structures (see ref. 95 and references therein). The relevant ternary In–Sb–Te compound, viz. In3Sb1Te2, crystallises in a disordered rocksalt-type structure with no substantial amount of cation vacancies96. Unlike GST, which does contain such vacancies, IST has all cation sites fully occupied by In atoms (Fig. 5b), with no notable cation disorder. Instead, its structural complexity arises from anion disorder, as Sb and Te share the same substructure. A previous ab initio MD study revealed that amorphous IST exhibits a large number of four-, five-, and six-membered rings97 (Fig. 5b, right), indicating that its medium-range order is more complex than that of amorphous GST (where four-membered rings are predominant).

In the context of MLIP development, IST is an example of a less widely explored material: there are not as many ab initio MD studies as for GST, nor is there an existing potential model to our knowledge. We argue that instead of manually constructing a training dataset, the user can now use automated approaches, such as the one in autoplex, to study less-common functional materials, at least as a starting point.

Figure 5c–g characterises the performance of GAP-RSS models for both phase-change materials. We first quantified the local structural properties by computing RDFs (Fig. 5c, e), and then calculated ring statistics which allow us to assess the medium-range order in those structures (Fig. 5d, f). The performance of the GAP-RSS models is encouraging, given how fast and inexpensive it has been to fit compared to an existing MLIP for Ge–Sb–Te compounds. Methodologically, the RSS approach in autoplex provides structural diversity by sampling from small cells, a strategy supported by previous literature48,98. We obtain a robust potential using 46% fewer atomic environments for Ge1Sb2Te4 compared to the training dataset in ref. 26, which comprises 49,056 atomic environments for this specific composition (and more for chemically related compounds). More importantly, however, the approach of ref. 26 was based on the expert-guided construction of training datasets, requiring substantial human effort and domain knowledge. In contrast, the RSS methodology enables broad exploration of the potential-energy landscape, requiring much less prior knowledge. In terms of implementation, the autoplex framework largely automates the iterative ML-driven RSS process, thereby enhancing the efficiency and ease of applying this methodology. The results for both phase-change materials show that our approach not only works well for materials with established domain knowledge (GST) but also performs effectively for materials for which so far there is limited domain knowledge (IST).

We finally ran a GAP-driven MD simulation of the crystallisation process in Ge1Sb2Te4 (Fig. 5g), corresponding to the SET operation in memory devices (‘0 → 1'). We used a kernel similarity metric99 to quantify the gradual structural ordering process, as in our previous work (ref. 100). The simulation shows a rapid growth proceeding at the amorphous–crystalline interface, leading to the formation of a largely ordered, defective rocksalt-like structure. We note that this crystallisation simulation using GAP was essentially completed after 350 ps, more quickly than what was seen in ab initio (DFT-based) MD simulations100 and using the hand-crafted GST-GAP-22 potential26. However, the former approach is computationally highly demanding100, and the latter is a specialised MLIP that has been deliberately trained on ‘domain-specific' configurations that correspond to the intermediate steps between fully amorphous and fully recrystallised Ge–Sb–Te materials. Our GAP-RSS based model, used to drive the simulations characterised in Fig. 5g, is trained in a much simpler way, and using only relatively small-scale configurations—perhaps it could serve as a starting point for constructing subsequent, more complex MLIP training datasets. Further tests for other phase-change memory materials are planned for the future.

Automation is one of the major open challenges in ML potentials for materials and poised to accelerate their development into general mainstream simulation models. We have here shown how iterative exploration and MLIP fitting, initially proposed within the GAP-RSS framework43, can be automated substantially and at scale by integration with existing software ecosystems. The resulting autoplex code is openly available and free to use, and we expect that in the long run, it will develop into a computational ecosystem of its own for the next generation of ML-driven materials modelling.

Although the present study has focused on bulk materials, the ML-driven RSS method is, in principle, well-suited for exploring a broader range of configurations (e.g., clusters, surfaces, and interfaces), as supported by previous applications of the established AIRSS method101. Accurately sampling complex dynamical processes, such as reaction pathways and adsorption sites in surface catalysis, remains a common challenge for various structural exploration methods, including RSS and MD, as these processes involve overcoming substantial energy barriers. In this context, the MLIPs produced by our RSS method can provide starting points for further refinement via active learning—an approach that has already proven effective in tackling similar dynamical challenges40. Such functionalities could be integrated into autoplex in the future.

Our work also contributes to addressing the wider-ranging open question about how MLIPs are best developed and used going forward. Random structure searching provides a core approach to generating robust potentials, and our present results suggest a remarkable amount of stability that can be gained from RSS using small cells alone: therefore, ML-driven iterative RSS appears to emerge as a standard technique for at least providing a starting point for potential fitting102. We have previously pointed out that RSS datasets can constitute useful benchmark tasks for evaluating MLIP models103,104, and we expect the growing usefulness of this aspect as systematic benchmarking becomes more important in the community.

In the years ahead, we expect that automated approaches to dataset construction—including the one in autoplex we have presented here—will play an increasingly important role in the field. With these efforts, and together with the demonstrated capabilities of advanced MLIP fitting architectures27,28,52,53, universal ML models for atomistic simulations could become widely established—which could make ML-driven modelling the genuine default in the field, just like direct quantum-mechanical modelling has been the default for many years.

MLIPs represent a given quantum-mechanical potential-energy surface. The models used herein are based on a local (atom-wise) decomposition of the total energy15,16,

where the atomic energies, \(\varepsilon\), are learned as a function of the atom's local environment, expressed through a general structural descriptor, qi, and the ML-predicted total energy, \({E}\), is obtained by summing over the per-atom contributions.

For most of the present study, we used the GAP framework15, together with the SOAP descriptor99 to featurise atomic environments. However, our approach is more general, and we have also implemented interfaces to other architectures and codes, including ACEpotentials.jl105, NequIP19, M3GNet21, and MACE20, in the current public version of autoplex. We refer to the original literature for details of these methods.

Random structure searching is an established approach to exploring configurational spaces and has seen large success in the context of the AIRSS framework by Pickard and Needs50,51. In ref. 43, it was proposed to combine RSS exploration with the fitting of potential-energy surfaces, gradually improving the models through iterative training (which had already been in itself a standard approach using iterative MD23) and not requiring any DFT-based relaxation but only single-point DFT evaluations, running all relaxations with GAP models instead. Note that the combination of structural searches and iterative MLIP fitting is not at all restricted to GAP or (AI)RSS—it has been demonstrated for other frameworks as well44,46.

The approach was extended in ref. 47 by including appropriate selection steps (both structurally and energetically based). Subsequent work introduced the wfl software65. The latter work is different from ours in that it runs workflows through a custom implementation, whereas autoplex interfaces to atomate2 and its diverse set of DFT-based workflows where possible.

Within autoplex, we have incorporated several methodological features. Our framework now supports multiple sets of buildcell input parameters, which define the scope of the RSS search and directly impact the diversity of the generated structures. We have also implemented a Hookean repulsion force to prevent atoms from approaching each other too closely, which can help to produce more physically plausible configurations.

Furthermore, if a pre-existing MLIP along with its training dataset is available, our RSS framework can be readily used to generate supplementary data and further refine the potential. One common approach is to combine an existing dataset with configurations generated during the initial RSS stage and use the merged data to train a new MLIP that subsequently drives iterative RSS exploration. Alternatively, a trained MLIP can be used to initiate the first round of RSS iterations, after which the newly generated data may be merged with the original training dataset to improve the model, which is then used in subsequent RSS iterations. Finally, users may opt to generate an RSS dataset from scratch without relying on any prior data or potentials; once the structure searching is complete, this RSS dataset can be merged with pre-existing data for training a new MLIP. More details on the procedures and parameters of the RSS workflows are provided in Supplementary Note 1. The scripts and input parameters for running the workflows are provided in ref. 106.

In the present work, we focus on automating RSS and RSS-driven iterative potential fitting. We describe a software implementation that is connected to the atomate2 ecosystem. atomate2 is a library of computational materials science workflows that have mostly been developed in the context of the Materials Project41. As in atomate2, we rely on jobflow107 for writing workflows and jobflow-remote or fireworks108 for executing workflows and scheduling computing tasks. For handling DFT inputs and outputs and interfaces with ML potentials, we use pymatgen109 and the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE)110.

Specifically, we use existing atomate2 workflows for automatic DFT computations. For the MLIP fitting part, we provide direct interfaces to relevant software. We further automate the intermediate stage between data generation (typically via DFT) and MLIP fitting.

Reference data were obtained using projector augmented-wave (PAW) potentials111,112 as implemented in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP)112,113, version 6.3.2. To describe the effects of exchange and correlation, we used the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional74, its revised parameterisation for solids (PBEsol)114, revPBE115 with the D3 dispersion correction79, as well as the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (SCAN) functional75, depending on the specific material system to be studied. The DFT settings were similar to previous work for silicon47, Ti–O116, SiO2 (ref. 25), water29, and phase-change materials26 (here using the same settings for GST and IST), and adapted where appropriate. Structures were visualised using OVITO117.

Ferroptosis is a nonapoptotic form of cell death characterized by lethal membrane lipid peroxidation. This mechanism was first characterized in cancer cells well over a decade ago, and there is much enthusiasm for the concept that certain cancers may be treated by inducing ferroptosis. However, therapies that engage ferroptosis have yet to enter clinical testing. In this Review, we highlight the gap between our rapidly expanding knowledge of the ferroptosis mechanism and its translation into cancer therapies. We discuss the known challenges that may be slowing ferroptosis therapies from reaching the clinic.

Are you an outdoor adventurer looking to turn your boring campsite into a well-lit glamping ground? The Jackery Explorer 1000 V2 is marked down to $449, almost $350 off its list price, a supercharged price reduction for a product that's otherwise a little spendy.

Jackery portable power stations have found their way onto multiple WIRED lists, including our roundup of the best power banks, as well as our favorite portable power stations, thanks to their consistent, relatively quiet operation. They're a great pick for adventurer who don't want to go too far from their devices, and they can hide in a closet to act as a backup power source during an outage or other emergency. They come loaded with a variety of connections, in this case three AC outlets, two USB-C and one USB-A, plus a DC 12V car outlet just in case.

Amazon

The Home Depot

The Jackery Explorer 1000 V2 that's discounted doesn't have quite the same feature set as the Plus version that WIRED writer Simon Hill reviewed. Most notably, the Plus version is expandable with additional battery packs, while the discounted V2 is stuck at 1000Wh. The Plus also has a slightly higher output power, 3,000W compared to the V2's 2,200W, so make sure to take that into account if you intend on really putting this battery through its paces.

There are some advantages over the more expensive model, however. Apart from a lower price for the same capacity, the Explorer 1000 V2 is lighter and more portable than its Plus counterpart, making it easier to chuck into your truck for a weekend away. It also charges slightly faster from a wall or car, but probably not by enough to make a huge difference in your life. Both models support Jackery's app, which lets you track capacity and charging, as well as manage battery and energy settings while in use.

While I don't have capacity tests for the 1,000Wh version, the larger 2,000Wh Plus model was able to power a portable air conditioner for almost seven hours, so you should be looking at about half that for this smaller model. It's also compatible with Jackery's solar panels if you want to keep it topped up while on a trip.

While you can buy the base unit on its own for $449, there are also discounts on bundles with the battery, like a $749 bundle that includes a pair of 100W solar panels, or a $499 bundle with a convenient carrying case. Both are solid deals, and while there are regular discounts on Jackery devices, this one may not last long.

As anticipation builds for the Made by Google 2025 event, there's a buzz around the Pixel 10 series, arriving notably before the iPhone 17. Apple's hardware event is expected to take place in September. 

The tech giant has made its intentions clear to grow the Pixel line, likely incorporating more generative AI capabilities with Gemini. Made by Google starts at 10 a.m. PT on Wednesday.

Google already dropped several AI-related updates at its developer conference in May, but the company will likely demonstrate more Gemini features during the Pixel 10 event. In a recent YouTube video promoting the new devices, Google even seemed to poke fun at Apple's failed promises with Apple Intelligence advancements on the iPhone. 

Rumors are buzzing about a feature called “Camera Coach,” which would let Gemini give you real-time tips for taking better photos. The AI is supposedly able to see what's going on and suggest the best angles and lighting for your shot. 

There's also talk of a conversational photo editing tool, where you tell Gemini what you want to tweak in a photo, such as increasing the brightness, removing objects, or changing the background.

The standard Pixel 10 phone is expected to undergo significant changes, particularly with the addition of a dedicated telephoto lens, a feature that was previously exclusive to the Pro models. Following the leak of renders showcasing the third rear lens, Google released a teaser for the Pixel 10, confirming the substantial camera upgrade.

Additionally, all phones in the lineup are expected to be powered by a new Tensor G5 processor, ushering in the Gemini era and enhancing performance and power efficiency compared to the Tensor G4 chip.

Aside from these updates, not many obvious changes appear to be on the table. The basic design of the phones will likely remain similar to that of the Pixel 9 series. The displays are also expected to stay the same, with the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro featuring a 6.3-inch display, and the Pixel 10 Pro XL with a larger 6.8-inch display.

Some areas where the Pro models may see improvement are camera and video quality, along with battery size, which could allow for faster charging and could address the longevity gap between Pixel and flagship phones from Apple and Samsung.

Plus, there is talk that the Pixel 10 series could support Qi2 wireless charging. If true, this means it would be one of the few Android phones to work with magnetic accessories, such as chargers, wallets, and mounts. Google is also reportedly launching a “Pixelsnap” phone case with a magnetic ring in the center.

As for Google's upcoming foldable, there are rumors suggesting it'll have a larger cover display, measuring at around 6.4 inches, alongside an 8-inch main screen. Additionally, Google is reportedly enhancing the strength of the hinge, and the bezels are expected to be thinner for a sleek appearance.

Another exciting rumor is the possibility of an IP68 rating, a first for the device. (And according to leaked specs, this may in fact be coming.) This means it can stand up to both dust and water, whereas the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has zero dust protection.

Like the other Pixel 10 phones, the Pro Fold will likely be powered by the new G5 chip and include the latest Gemini AI features. The camera system might also receive improvements, potentially featuring a 48-megapixel ultra-wide lens and a telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom. The phone should also likely get a bump in battery life.

The Pixel 10 may come in Moonstone and Jade colors.  

Wearables will also get their time to shine at Google's event, with the Pixel Watch 4 rumored to get a thicker design, a longer battery life, and smaller bezels.

There's also a strong likelihood that the smartwatch will introduce new health and fitness-tracking capabilities, possibly including an upgraded blood oxygen (SpO2) monitoring function.

Leaks of the Pixel Buds 2a indicate that the earbuds will come in new colors (Fog Light, Hazel, Iris, and Strawberry) along with features like active noise cancellation. The Pixel Buds Pro 2 will also reportedly come in a new Sterling color.

This story has been updated to include additional rumors.

Anna Monaco has been building AI agents since before the term “AI agents” was even a thing. After building numerous chatbots, she started looking for other types of interfaces that made sense for AI agents and landed on spreadsheets.

“I had this personal pattern, and I noticed that a lot of other people had this pattern, of putting very important CRM data in spreadsheets just because it was the most flexible thing,” Monaco told TechCrunch. “But it was actually a pain to maintain. There's so much manual work involved. So [I] just went down this rabbit hole of building a product for myself and wanted to reimagine what a spreadsheet could look like with the full power of LLMs.”

The result was Paradigm, an AI-powered spreadsheet equipped with more than 5,000 AI agents. Users can assign different prompts to individual columns and cells, and individual AI agents will crawl the internet to find and fill out the needed information.

Paradigm works with AI models from Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google's Gemini, Monaco said, and supports model switching.

“We want to support every single model because we want our users to be able to have the highest reasoning outputs when they need it, but also the cheapest outputs,” Monaco said. “It's just a constant cycle of evaluating different models, working closely with model providers to make sure our limits are high enough, and then giving some of that power to our users.”

The company launched a small closed beta preview in late 2024 and has been iterating on the product using customer feedback. Paradigm attracts users ranging from consultants to sales professionals and finance folks and operates on a subscription model with tiers based on usage. Paradigm counts the consulting firm EY, AI chip startup Etched, and AI coding company Cognition as early customers.

Paradigm is now releasing its product to the public and announcing that it raised a $5 million seed round led by General Catalyst. The company has raised $7 million to date. Monaco said the funding will go toward executing on the company's “extremely aggressive product roadmap.”

“The interesting thing that happened when we fundraised is some people we pitched just kept on using and paying for the product,” Monaco said. “I think that was a cool part of it. We found a lot of value from it internally and our investors, not even just our investors — other investors that we talked to — are still using it.”

Paradigm isn't the only company looking to give spreadsheets an AI upgrade. Quadratic, which has raised more than $6 million in venture funding, is a 3-year-old startup with a similar goal. Legacy companies like Google and Microsoft are also adding AI tools to their spreadsheet applications.

Monaco said that she doesn't really consider the competition because Paradigm doesn't think of itself as an AI-powered spreadsheet. She said she thinks of it as a new AI-powered workflow that happens to be in the familiar form of a spreadsheet but won't necessarily stay that way forever.

“What I'm seeing in the most popular AI products now is this fine balance between present and future,” Monaco said. “How do you build something that is really powerful and generates a lot of value now but also sets you up really well for the future? That's the question that I asked myself a year ago when I was starting the company.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:ycombinator.com","Show HN: We started building an AI dev tool but it turned into a Sims-style game","https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44943986","Mon, 18 Aug 2025 19:01:14 GMT","

We started out building an AI agent dev tool, but somewhere along the way it turned into Sims for AI agents.Demo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRPnX_f2V_c.The original idea was simple: make it easy to create AI agents. We started with Jupyter Notebooks, where each cell could be callable by MCP—so agents could turn them into tools for themselves. It worked well enough that the system became self-improving, churning out content, and acting like a co-pilot that helped you build new agents.But when we stepped back, what we had was these endless walls of text. And even though it worked, honestly, it was just boring. We were also convinced that it would be swallowed up by the next model's capabilities. We wanted to build something else—something that made AI less of a black box and more engaging. Why type into a chat box all day if you could look your agents in the face, see their confusion, and watch when and how they interact?Both of us grew up on simulation games—RollerCoaster Tycoon 3, Age of Empires, SimCity—so we started experimenting with running LLM agents inside a 3D world. At first it was pure curiosity, but right away, watching agents interact in real time was much more interesting than anything we'd done before.The very first version was small: a single Unity room, an MCP server, and a chat box. Even getting two agents to take turns took weeks. Every run surfaced quirks—agents refusing to talk at all, or only “speaking” by dancing or pulling facial expressions to show emotion. That unpredictability kept us building.Now it's a desktop app (Tauri + Unity via WebGL) where humans and agents share 3D tile-based rooms. Agents receive structured observations every tick and can take actions that change the world. You can edit the rules between runs—prompts, decision logic, even how they see chat history—without rebuilding.On the technical side, we built a Unity bridge with MCP and multi-provider routing via LiteLLM, with local model support via Mistral.rs coming next. All system prompts are editable, so you can directly experiment with coordination strategies—tuning how “chatty” agents are versus how much they move or manipulate the environment.We then added a tilemap editor so you can design custom rooms, set tile-based events with conditions and actions, and turn them into puzzles or hazards. There's community sharing built in, so you can post rooms you make.Watching agents collude or negotiate through falling tiles, teleports, landmines, fire, “win” and “lose” tiles, and tool calls for things like lethal fires or disco floors is a much more fun way to spend our days.Under the hood, Unity's ECS drives a whole state machine and event system. And because humans and AI share the same space in real time, every negotiation, success, or failure also becomes useful multi-agent, multimodal data for post-training or world models.Our early users are already using it for prompt-injection testing, social engineering scenarios, cooperative games, and model comparisons.
The bigger vision is to build an open-ended, AI-native sim-game where you can build and interact with anything or anyone. You can design puzzles, levels, and environments, have agents compete or collaborate, set up games, or even replay your favorite TV shows.The fun part is that no two interactions are ever the same. Everything is emergent, not hard-coded, so the same level played six times will play out differently each time.The plan is to keep expanding—bigger rooms, more in-world tools for agents, and then multiplayer hosting. It's live now, no waitlist. Free to play. You can bring your own API keys, or start with $10 in credits and run agents right away: www.TheInterface.com.We'd love feedback on scenarios worth testing and what to build next. Tell us the weird stuff you'd throw at this—we'll be in the comments.

LLMs with some decent harnesses could build up unpredictable - but internally consistent - strategies per each new game you play.This is close to a proof of concept for those improvements.

It is useless for job searching, because the search tools aren't very good.It is useless for employers since your job gets shown to thousands of people without the right qualifications and thus massively increases the signal to noise ratio of applications, especially if Easy Apply gets turned on.

That process means they may require a hundred or more training iterations on a single image. I haven't digested the paper, but it sounds like they are proposing something conceptually similar to skip layers (but significantly more involved).

Plus: Anthropic's AI models will start to cut off harmful conversations

This is today's edition of The Download, our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what's going on in the world of technology.

Why we should thank pigeons for our AI breakthroughs

People looking for precursors to artificial intelligence often point to science fiction by authors like Isaac Asimov or thought experiments like the Turing test. But an equally important, if surprising and less appreciated, forerunner is American psychologist B.F. Skinner's research with pigeons in the middle of the 20th century.Skinner believed that association—learning, through trial and error, to link an action with a punishment or reward—was the building block of every behavior, not just in pigeons but in all living organisms, including human beings.His “behaviorist” theories fell out of favor with psychologists and animal researchers in the 1960s but were taken up by computer scientists who eventually provided the foundation for many of the artificial-intelligence tools from leading firms like Google and OpenAI.

Indigenous knowledge meets artificial intelligence

There is no word for art in most Native American languages. Instead, the closest terms speak not to objecthood but to action and intention. Art is not separate from life; it is ceremony, instruction, design.A new vanguard of Native artists are building on this principle. They are united not by stereotypical weaving and carving or revanchist critique of Silicon Valley, but through their rejection of extractive data models in favor of relationship-based systems.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","HR Giant Workday Got Hacked","https://gizmodo.com/hr-giant-workday-got-hacked-2000644474","Mon, 18 Aug 2025 19:25:40 GMT","

Workday, a company that provides human resources technology to over 11,000 corporations and 70 million users worldwide, announced in a classic Friday news dump that it suffered a data breach. The company did not disclose how much information was stolen by the hackers, but did reveal that information—including the names, email addresses, and phone numbers—of some users was compromised.

The company said the breach hit some of its third-party customer relationship databases. If any other data was stolen, Workday didn't say for sure. The company only said there was “no indication of access to customer tenants or the data” within those databases. But now Workday is worried that, while its breach may be limited, it could give rise to other breaches via social engineering attacks.

“The type of information the actor obtained was primarily commonly available business contact information, like names, email addresses, and phone numbers, potentially to further their social engineering scams,” Workday wrote.

It's interesting to note how little specific information regarding the breach Workday has provided. The company didn't exactly hide that the breach happened, but it also took a little time before disclosing it. Per Bleeping Computer, the breach occurred on August 6. Then there's this spicy little detail from TechCrunch: the company's blog post announcing the breach has a “noindex tag” in the source code, which signals to search engine crawlers not to index the page so it won't come up in search results.

Maybe that's all a vaguely understandable decision from a reputation protection standpoint, but it doesn't exactly scream “We're doing the best we can to keep our customers informed and safe.”

According to Bleeping Computer, it seems the Workday hack is part of a bigger breach of Salesforce databases, which has caught a string of companies in the crossfire. Companies including Adidas, Google, Qantas Airways, and Cisco have all been hit as part of the attacks on Salesforce Customer Relationship Management systems.

Those attacks have primarily been linked to a hacking group that goes by ShinyHunters, which has reportedly done most of its damage via social engineering and voice phishing attacks. So, it makes sense that Workday is warning its customers about exactly that.

ShinyHunters has become something of a prolific threat in recent years. The extortion group has hit AT&T, stealing 73 million customer records from the telecom giant, and PowerSchool, which compromised the information of millions of students and teachers in the United States and Canada.

As a seabird researcher, Leo Uesaka spends most of his time reviewing hours of bird footage. That can get quite tedious and demanding at times, but every second is worth paying attention to—after all, that's how you notice things like the penchant for seabirds to poop only while airborne.

In a first-of-its-kind study published today in Current Biology, Uesaka and his team report that streaked shearwaters—large, unassuming seabirds common in East Asian waters—engage in a very specific type of bathroom ritual. In addition to always pooping midair, shearwaters release their droppings at regular intervals, every 4 to 10 minutes, according to the researchers. And even when the birds are in the water, they'll take the extra step and fly into the air if they need to “drop feces,” Uesaka, the study's lead author, explained to Gizmodo.

The initial purpose of the project was to study how shearwaters use their legs during direct takeoffs from the sea surface, said Uesaka, a research fellow at the Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute at the University of Tokyo in Japan. But the birds were pooping so much and so often that it seemed like a waste of data not to additionally investigate the birds' bathroom habits, he said.

“Since I was not aiming to record droppings in the original plan, I was surprised by the feces footage itself and how frequently they appeared in the footage [and] the regular timing pattern,” Uesaka said.

Researchers have studied bird droppings before but mostly conducted their investigations on land, Uesaka said. The new study is more or less the first time scientists have been able to observe seabird excretion behavior at sea. What made this possible was a “slightly unusual—and perhaps amusing—method,” Uesaka explained. Specifically, his team tracked individual shearwaters living on Funakoshi Ohshima, an uninhabited island in Japan. Each bird was equipped with a small, rear-facing video camera on its belly, a position initially chosen to observe leg motion but that ended up providing a fantastic view of the birds' digestive dynamics.

It's unclear why the birds behave this way, but Uesaka suspects that other seabirds with similar flight styles, such as the albatross, may share this same tendency. In any case, seabird droppings are unusually rich in nitrogen and phosphorus, suggesting they may be unintentionally fertilizing coastal waters. At the same time, avian influenza is often transmitted through feces, and the researchers hope further investigations into this ritual could shed light on how the disease spreads among wild seabirds.

“Bird droppings may seem unpleasant,” Uesaka said. “But as this study shows, they can reveal surprisingly interesting aspects of animal life.”

Indeed, pooping, in all seriousness, plays a vital role in supporting the various parts of our natural ecosystem. It's also a funny (to borrow from Uesaka's words) yet valuable way to engage with science. So the next time a seabird poops on you at the beach, don't take it personally—it's just science doing its thing.

Benjamin Jensen, Professor of Strategic Studies at the Marine Corps University School of Advanced Warfighting; Scholar-in-Residence, American University School of International Service

This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license. Read the original article.

Despite two centuries of evolution, the structure of a modern military staff would be recognizable to Napoleon. At the same time, military organizations have struggled to incorporate new technologies as they adapt to new domains – air, space and information – in modern war.

The sizes of military headquarters have grown to accommodate the expanded information flows and decision points of these new facets of warfare. The result is diminishing marginal returns and a coordination nightmare – too many cooks in the kitchen – that risks jeopardizing mission command.

AI agents – autonomous, goal-oriented software powered by large language models – can automate routine staff tasks, compress decision timelines and enable smaller, more resilient command posts. They can shrink the staff while also making it more effective.

As an international relations scholar and reserve officer in the U.S. Army who studies military strategy, I see both the opportunity afforded by the technology and the acute need for change.

That need stems from the reality that today's command structures still mirror Napoleon's field headquarters in both form and function – industrial-age architectures built for massed armies. Over time, these staffs have ballooned in size, making coordination cumbersome. They also result in sprawling command posts that modern precision artillery, missiles and drones can target effectively and electronic warfare can readily disrupt.

Russia's so-called “Graveyard of Command Posts” in Ukraine vividly illustrates how static headquarters where opponents can mass precision artillery, missiles and drones become liabilities on a modern battlefield.

Military planners now see a world in which AI agents – autonomous, goal-oriented software that can perceive, decide and act on their own initiative – are mature enough to deploy in command systems. These agents promise to automate the fusion of multiple sources of intelligence, threat-modeling, and even limited decision cycles in support of a commander's goals. There is still a human in the loop, but the humans will be able to issue commands faster and receive more timely and contextual updates from the battlefield.

These AI agents can parse doctrinal manuals, draft operational plans and generate courses of action, which helps accelerate the tempo of military operations. Experiments – including efforts I ran at Marine Corps University – have demonstrated how even basic large language models can accelerate staff estimates and inject creative, data-driven options into the planning process. These efforts point to the end of traditional staff roles.

There will still be people – war is a human endeavor – and ethics will still factor into streams of algorithms making decisions. But the people who remain deployed are likely to gain the ability to navigate mass volumes of information with the help of AI agents.

These teams are likely to be smaller than modern staffs. AI agents will allow teams to manage multiple planning groups simultaneously.

For example, they will be able to use more dynamic red teaming techniques – role-playing the opposition – and vary key assumptions to create a wider menu of options than traditional plans. The time saved not having to build PowerPoint slides and updating staff estimates will be shifted to contingency analysis – asking “what if” questions – and building operational assessment frameworks – conceptual maps of how a plan is likely to play out in a particular situation – that provide more flexibility to commanders.

To explore the optimal design of this AI agent-augmented staff, I led a team of researchers at the bipartisan think tank Center for Strategic & International Studies' Futures Lab to explore alternatives. The team developed three baseline scenarios reflecting what most military analysts are seeing as the key operational problems in modern great power competition: joint blockades, firepower strikes and joint island campaigns. Joint refers to an action coordinated among multiple branches of a military.

In the example of China and Taiwan, joint blockades describe how China could isolate the island nation and either starve it or set conditions for an invasion. Firepower strikes describe how Beijing could fire salvos of missiles – similar to what Russia is doing in Ukraine – to destroy key military centers and even critical infrastructure. Last, in Chinese doctrine, a Joint Island Landing Campaign describes the cross-strait invasion their military has spent decades refining.

Any AI agent-augmented staff should be able to manage warfighting functions across these three operational scenarios.

The research team found that the best model kept humans in the loop and focused on feedback loops. This approach – called the Adaptive Staff Model and based on pioneering work by sociologist Andrew Abbott – embeds AI agents within continuous human-machine feedback loops, drawing on doctrine, history and real-time data to evolve plans on the fly.

In this model, military planning is ongoing and never complete, and focused more on generating a menu of options for the commander to consider, refine and enact. The research team tested the approach with multiple AI models and found that it outperformed alternatives in each case.

AI agents are not without risk. First, they can be overly generalized, if not biased. Foundation models – AI models trained on extremely large datasets and adaptable to a wide range of tasks – know more about pop culture than war and require refinement. This makes it important to benchmark agents to understand their strengths and limitations.

Second, absent training in AI fundamentals and advanced analytical reasoning, many users tend to use models as a substitute for critical thinking. No smart model can make up for a dumb, or worse, lazy user.

To take advantage of AI agents, the U.S. military will need to institutionalize building and adapting agents, include adaptive agents in war games, and overhaul doctrine and training to account for human-machine teams. This will require a number of changes.

First, the military will need to invest in additional computational power to build the infrastructure required to run AI agents across military formations. Second, they will need to develop additional cybersecurity measures and conduct stress tests to ensure the agent-augmented staff isn't vulnerable when attacked across multiple domains, including cyberspace and the electromagnetic spectrum.

Third, and most important, the military will need to dramatically change how it educates its officers. Officers will have to learn how AI agents work, including how to build them, and start using the classroom as a lab to develop new approaches to the age-old art of military command and decision-making. This could include revamping some military schools to focus on AI, a concept floated in the White House's AI Action Plan released on July 23, 2025.

Absent these reforms, the military is likely to remain stuck in the Napoleonic staff trap: adding more people to solve ever more complex problems.

Using Logitech's MX Master mouse can feel like you're slipping your hand into a cradle form-fitted to your palm. Even if the MX Master lineup has been consistently good, the MX Master 3 proved such a staple that some users continue to flit around on their 8-year-old mouse even as it disintegrates between their aging fingers. Logitech may finally have the update we've been waiting for with an MX Master 4. Logitech doesn't have to change much for it to be one of the best productivity mice once again, though it'll have to think of something novel to entice current users to upgrade.

The regularly reliable leaker Evan Blass shared on X a picture of what he suggested was the Logitech MX Master 4. It already looks very, very similar to the MX Master 3 from 2017 and the MX Master 3S redux from 2022. He even suggested that the calming mint green outline around the thumb groove is “illustrative” and won't be on the final design. That's a shame, as the extra accent could have been one of the few features that truly set the design apart from previous years.

MX Master 4 pic.twitter.com/zblU34F2C7

— Evan Blass (@evleaks) August 17, 2025



The upcoming mouse release is an open secret. Logitech already spoiled the surprise in recent back-to-school promos. Back in May, the Brazilian-language site Tecnoblog (via 9to5Mac) first reported on the Bluetooth certification documents for the MX Master 4. Reddit users have also shared images of early teasers that Logitech posted to Instagram, confirming the leaked design. The wireless mouse still seems to use the seven-button design with the metallic top and side scroll wheels.

Fans of the MX Master 3 who haven't already destroyed their mice in the eight intervening years may be scratching their heads as to why they should upgrade. There are very subtle changes only regular users would notice, like moving the side-to-side scroll wheel up on the mouse, perched like a crow's beak between the slightly larger click buttons. The thumb rest now seems to have a new texture, though we're keen to know if it's sporting any new material that could prove more durable for longtime use. So long as it maintains the metal scroll wheel and quiet clickiness that made the original so popular, then it will still be one of the best mice for working at a row of computers in today's white-collar digital assembly line.

The MX Master 3S's main upgrade from the 2017 mouse was the move from a max of 4,000 to 8,000 DPI, or dots per inch. This measures the sensitivity of a mouse, which determines how precise it is in hand. The MX series is a productivity-first design, though that doesn't stop some silly users from taking it into their favorite games. What it's lacking is a polling rate that goes beyond 125Hz. Polling rate is how often the mouse refreshes and transmits its position to the PC. The snappiest, high-end gaming mice, like the recent $170 Razer Deathadder V4 Pro, can hit a max 8,000Hz polling rate. That's such a high refresh rate, even the most hardcore gamer wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Other high-end productivity mice like Razer's $120 Pro Click V2 have a polling rate up to 1,000Hz, and if Logitech can match that number, the MX Master 4 could give users a few more options for where and how they can use their mouse.

The leaks have had less to share about the expected launch date or price, but we don't expect the MX Master 4 will be any cheaper than the current $100 MX Master 3S, not with Trump tariffs still causing supply chain chaos across the PC landscape. I can only expect that the one, perfect mouse for any and all your needs will cost even more going forward.

Megan  Brooks

 August 18, 2025  

The FDA has approved cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride sublingual tablets (Tonmya, Tonix Pharmaceuticals), a first-in-class, nonopioid treatment for adults with fibromyalgia, a chronic pain syndrome that affects more than 10 million Americans, roughly 80% of whom are women.

The medication, taken once-daily at bedtime, targets nonrestorative sleep, a root cause of pain, fatigue, and brain fog in fibromyalgia. It's the first new FDA-approved therapy for the treatment of fibromyalgia in over 15 years. Tonmya (formerly TNX-102 SL) is expected to be available in the fourth quarter of this year. 

In two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials (RELIEF and RESILIENT) of nearly 1000 patients with fibromyalgia, sublingual cyclobenzaprine significantly reduced daily pain scores compared to placebo at 14 weeks (the primary endpoint). 

In addition, a greater percentage of patients using the medication daily at bedtime experienced a clinically meaningful (≥ 30%) improvement in their pain after 3 months, compared to placebo.

Results of the RESILIENT trial were published online on July 8 in Pain Medicine. 

A third phase 3 trial (RALLY) of more than 500 patients with fibromyalgia demonstrated greater but nonsignificant treatment effect with sublingual cyclobenzaprine compared to placebo. 

Across all three trials, the medication was generally well tolerated with no serious side effects. The most common adverse events were local administration-site reactions including oral discomfort, dry mouth, and canker sores, as well as fatigue and drowsiness.

Innovative intervention delivered by trained community health workers – meaning nonclinical personnel with deep knowledge of the community – increased treatment utilization among participating families with children who have ADHD, according to a pilot study published in the Journal of Attention Disorders. This intervention for parents and caregivers, covering topics that range from education about ADHD to discussions of stigma and barriers to care, intends to reduce inequities in access to evidence-based treatment and boost family engagement in ADHD care.

""We know from previous studies that compared to White youth, Black, Hispanic, and Asian children with ADHD receive less treatment, including fewer visits with a healthcare provider and lower medication use,"" said lead author Andrea Spencer, MD, Vice Chair for Research, Pritzker Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago and Associate Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.

""We are excited to make a tangible difference for children and their families by using a community-based approach to ADHD that has proved to be so successful for other pediatric conditions, like asthma,"" she said. ""When so many children have an illness and access to care is inadequate, we need to think beyond individual patient interactions and develop public health solutions. This is the first study to use an intervention for ADHD delivered by community health workers.""

ADHD, a neurobiological condition that affects about 6-8 percent of children, can have lifelong consequences, including educational and occupational underachievement, family and peer conflict, and justice involvement. Treatment, which includes a combination of FDA-approved medication, behavioral therapy and school accommodations, is effective at reducing symptoms and can improve ADHD outcomes.

Dr. Spencer explained that barriers to ADHD care include logistical difficulties, such as finances, insurance, transportation and lack of childcare. Also stigma, discrimination and implicit bias affect families' experiences with engaging in ADHD care for their children.

In developing content for the intervention, Dr. Spencer and colleagues sought guidance from a Community Advisory Board consisting of racial and ethnic minoritized caregivers of children with ADHD, public school staff, pediatric clinical providers and leaders, child mental health clinicians and child mental health equity researchers.

The intervention included an average of six, hour-long sessions during which community health workers discussed with families evidence-based treatment for ADHD, myths vs. facts, how to respond to stigma and discrimination, how to talk about ADHD in a way that is empowering to kids, how to navigate care, communicate with clinicians and advocate for their child. Participants completed research questionnaires before and after the intervention, as well as exit interviews. Content was refined based on participant feedback.

The pilot study initially included 18 caregivers of children with recently diagnosed ADHD aged 6-12 years. Fifteen caregivers completed the intervention, 16 completed all study questionnaires and 13 completed the exit interview.

We received overwhelmingly positive feedback about the content and strategy addressing stigma in particular. Caregivers reported that the intervention helped them confront their own stigma about ADHD, as well as stigma from others. A community-based approach really can change the stigma associated with ADHD and hopefully get more kids into treatment.""

Dr. Andrea Spencer, MD, Vice Chair for Research, Pritzker Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago

Almost all caregivers (88 percent) agreed or strongly agreed that the intervention was helpful. Ninety-four percent of caregivers reported that the intervention made them feel more confident in seeking treatment for ADHD, and many caregivers reported that the program made them more likely to consider medications (69 percent), therapy (75 percent), and school services (88 percent) for their child's ADHD.

The percent of children receiving outpatient treatment services increased from pre- to post-intervention, including an increase in medication use (from 38 percent to 50 percent), therapy use (from 31 percent to 69 percent), and a statistically significant increase in receipt of school accommodations (from 38 percent to 88 percent).

""Based on our promising results, we are planning a larger study, a randomized clinical trial, to evaluate the effectiveness of our intervention,"" said Dr. Spencer. ""Ultimately, we hope to improve outcomes for children with ADHD, especially for kids from minoritized racial and ethnic backgrounds.""

Study activities were done at Boston Medical Center/Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Off-label ketamine use for chronic pain lacks scientific basis","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250818/Off-label-ketamine-use-for-chronic-pain-lacks-scientific-basis.aspx","Mon, 18 Aug 2025 05:49:00 GMT","

The off-label use of ketamine to treat chronic pain is not supported by scientific evidence, a new Cochrane review has found.

Ketamine is an anaesthetic commonly used for procedural sedation and short-term pain relief. Ketamine is also frequently prescribed off-label to manage chronic pain conditions such as nerve pain, fibromyalgia and complex regional pain syndrome. It is one of several NMDA receptor antagonists - a group of drugs thought to reduce pain by blocking certain brain receptors involved in pain signalling.

The review, conducted by researchers from UNSW Sydney, Neuroscience Research Australia (NeuRA), and Brunel University of London, examined 67 trials involving over 2,300 adult participants. It assessed five NMDA receptor antagonists: ketamine, memantine, dextromethorphan, amantadine, and magnesium.

Results show no clear evidence of benefit for ketamine in chronic pain and identified an increased risk of adverse effects such as delusions, delirium, paranoia, nausea, and vomiting. Evidence was rated low to very low certainty, due to small study sizes and poor methodological quality.

We want to be clear – we're not saying ketamine is ineffective, but there's a lot of uncertainty. The data could point to a benefit or no effect at all. Right now, we just don't know.""

Michael Ferraro, Study First Author and Doctoral Candidate, University of New South Wales 

Researchers looked at the effects across various chronic pain conditions and dosing strategies but found no clear evidence of benefit in any specific condition or dose. Side effects were a major concern, particularly with intravenous use.

""The most common adverse events we saw were psychotomimetic effects such as delusions, delirium, and paranoia, as well as nausea and vomiting,"" said Ferraro. ""These effects are distressing for many patients. Clinicians often try to balance the dose for pain relief without triggering those symptoms, but this isn't always achieved.""

The review also found no studies that reported on two key outcomes: whether ketamine reduced depressive symptoms or opioid use. This is notable, as ketamine is often proposed for patients with depressive symptoms or opioid tolerance.

""This group of drugs, and ketamine in particular, is in relatively common use for chronic pain around the world. Yet we have no convincing evidence that they are delivering meaningful benefits for people with pain, even in the short term,"" said Neil O'Connell, Professor at Brunel University of London, co-senior author of the review. ""That seems a good reason to be cautious in the clinic and clearly indicates an urgent need to undertake high-quality trials.""

The authors hope the review will help inform patients and clinicians weighing up potential benefits and harms, and guide future research. While more evidence is needed, this review highlights the importance of high-quality trials to understand whether ketamine has a role in chronic pain care.

""We've seen the harm that can come from taking medicines developed for acute pain and applying them to chronic pain, opioids are a prime example. Now we're seeing a similar pattern with ketamine,"" said co-senior author James McAuley, Professor at UNSW and senior researcher at NeuRA . ""As opioid prescribing is slowly reduced, there's a growing demand for alternatives, but we need to be careful not to rush into widespread use without strong evidence.""

With a $1 million Impact Award from the U.S. Department of Defense, Tianfu Wu, a University of Houston biomedical engineer, is developing a method to send medication directly to the spleen where certain immune cells cause the disease known as lupus, or Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. 

Lupus is a debilitating autoimmune disease characterized by uncontrolled disease activity, frequent flares, long-term immunosuppression, increasing infection rates, cumulative organ damage and decreased quality of life. 

The spleen has often been called the security guard of the bloodstream, filtering out old or damaged blood cells while housing millions of white blood cells, or lymphocytes, that carry out immune system functions. It is because the spleen harbors these cells it plays a critical role in how lupus develops.

The current therapeutic landscape for lupus is often marred by systemic side effects and relatively limited efficacy. To address these challenges, we are proposing a spleen-specific selective organ targeting lipid nanoparticle drug delivery system to modulate immune responses and mitigate symptoms with minimal side effects.""

Tianfu Wu, associate professor of biomedical engineering, University of Houston

Wu's system will use tiny fat-based particles, or lipid nanoparticles, modified with mannose, a simple sugar, to carry medicine directly to the spleen and to target B cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells and macrophages, which are critical immune cells thought to drive the disease. The use of mannose facilitates the binding to mannose receptors, ensuring precise delivery to these splenic immune cells. 

""New drug delivery systems are urgently needed to provide more effective treatment options that fine-tune or modulate the immune system rather than employing systemic immunosuppression or B-cell depletion,"" said Wu. ""Systemic immunosuppression can lead to severe side effects and increase the risk of infections, while systemic B-cell depletion may wipe out beneficial B cells, leading to unfavorable complications."" 

This work may mark the first instance of a spleen-specific targeting system being designed, developed and applied in lupus models.

""The primary aim is not only to advance treatment strategies for lupus but also to deepen our understanding of lupus pathogenesis. Significantly, this innovation will pave the way for treating lupus by targeting organ-specific molecular pathways, recognizing that the same drug target may have opposing roles in different organs, such as the spleen versus end-organs like the kidney, heart, or central nervous system,"" said Wu.

Fucosylation, a crucial post-translational modification, has emerged as a significant factor influencing digestive inflammatory diseases and cancers. This biochemical process, which involves the attachment of fucose to glycoproteins and glycolipids, plays a fundamental role in cell adhesion, signal transduction, and immune response modulation. Understanding the mechanisms of aberrant fucosylation offers a new perspective on the development and progression of conditions affecting the intestine, stomach, liver, and pancreas.

The latest insights reveal how genetic mutations in fucosyltransferases (FUTs) contribute to disease susceptibility. Variations in these genes can alter the fucosylation process, leading to inflammatory responses, barrier dysfunction, and increased cancer risk. In the context of inflammatory bowel disease, fucosylation influences the host-microbe interaction, impacting the balance between beneficial and pathogenic bacteria in the gut. Similarly, changes in fucosylated glycans affect the adhesion and invasion of Helicobacter pylori, a key factor in gastric cancer.

In liver disease, aberrant fucosylation is linked to conditions such as liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Elevated levels of fucosylated biomarkers in the bloodstream provide valuable diagnostic indicators, enhancing the ability to differentiate between benign and malignant conditions. The disruption of fucosylation pathways also contributes to pancreatic cancer progression, where specific fucosylation patterns are associated with tumor aggressiveness and chemotherapy resistance.

The growing body of research highlights the potential of therapeutic strategies targeting fucosylation. The use of fucose-based treatments and fucosylation inhibitors demonstrates promising effects in modulating immune responses and tumor growth. These targeted approaches aim to restore normal fucosylation patterns, offering new avenues for personalized medicine and disease management.

The role of fucosylation in digestive diseases and cancers is increasingly recognized as a critical element in biomedical research and clinical applications. Advancements in diagnostic biomarker identification and the development of fucosylation-targeted therapies pave the way for innovative treatment options. By further exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying fucosylation-related disorders, the medical community moves closer to more effective interventions and improved patient outcomes.

Christian Pulisic put AC Milan on top over Bari, scoring the second goal in the 2-0 victory to open the 2025-26 Coppa Italia.

In the 48th minute, Pulisic slammed home a turnaround shot off a give-and-go with Santiago Giménez in the box. It was the USMNT forward's first goal in the knockout competition between Italy's top divisions — Serie A, Serie B, and Serie C. Bari is a Serie B club.

Pulisic was subbed off in the 66th minute, replaced by fellow National Team player Yunus Musah.

The first round victory pushes Milan into the second round of the tournament, where it'll face Serie A opponent U.S. Lecce Sept. 24.

AC Milan's Serie A schedule commences this coming weekend with a match against US Cremonese on Aug. 23. Last season, Pulisic led the club with 11 goals in league play.

EPL

No doubt, Fulham will feel a bit up against it heading into the club's Premier League opener, away at Brighton.

The 2024-25 season saw Antonee Robinson cement his place as one of Marco Silva's most vital charges, arguably the best pure left back in the Premier League. Nicknamed “Jedi,” he's proven capable of containing Bukayo Saka and Mohamed Salah on one end before dependably squaring crosses right into his striker's stride. He gutted out an injury to his right knee until season's end, finishing third in the fan-voted Player of the Season pageant after a 10-assist campaign.

On Thursday, 48 hours before a trip to the AmEx, Silva confirmed that Robinson would not be available for selection as he works back from an offseason surgery on that vital plant-leg knee. So, too, would Ryan Sessegnon, leaving the Portuguese manager without his two top options at left back.

Mauricio Pochettino may still be envying Silva's situation. At least the Fulham boss has a viable alternative in the role to Robinson.

It's hardly a new phenomenon that the U.S. men's national team is dangerously thin at left back. In fact, the program went over a decade with makeshift solutions, forcing players like DaMarcus Beasley and Fabian Johnson to own the role despite spending their careers up until that point further afield. While U.S. Soccer can't take credit for Robinson's development, his commitment was a clear end to holding the left side of the back line together with duct tape and chewing gum.

While Robinson has amassed a tidy 50 caps to date, he's been absent for the last four camps under Pochettino, a 12-game sample from which the coach has learned plenty about his player pool. He's had his initial trust in Diego Luna validated by a star-making turn at the Gold Cup. That same tournament gave reason to think Matt Freese could be a shot-stopping alternative to Matt Turner in goal.

There have been frustrating realizations, too. Mexico is back on the ascent, although that's a bit more of a subplot than usual as both nations will abstain from World Cup qualifying this cycle. His faith in the core that helped qualify for the 2022 installment has potentially been rocked by Christian Pulisic and others opting out or missing out on the Gold Cup. And, more relevant to today's news via Silva: he doesn't have a clear alternative to Robinson at left back.

Unlike other USMNT mainstays like Gio Reyna, Pochettino and Robinson have already logged a bit of collaboration. The left back was on Pochettino's first squad last October, and started both legs of the Concacaf Nations Leg quarterfinal against Jamaica the following month. In the second, Robinson assisted on the second goal of a 4-2 win that sent the U.S. through to the final four.

Since then, however, Pochettino has had to play alternatives to Robinson. When an ailment kept Robinson out for the Nations League's business end in March, it became a calamity: Panama targeted out-of-position Max Arfsten and, later, Joe Scally, exploiting the latter's lack of awareness to score a last gasp winner in a 1-0 semifinal upset. Scally went on to start the third-place game, putting in such a poor shift that he got a halftime hook.

In the 12 games that have passed since Robinson's last U.S. appearance, four players have been called upon in his absence. Arfsten has been Pochettino's most relied-upon alternative, appearing in nine of that dozen, most often as starter. John Tolkin, of recently relegated Holstein Kiel in Germany, has made five appearances, while Scally and DeJuan Jones have each appeared twice in the role. None have made a terribly compelling case for further looks.

Throughout the Gold Cup, Arfsten and Tolkin — as indicated by their higher utilization — were the two options on Pochettino's squad.

Arfsten, a winger with the possession-dominant Columbus Crew, has fared about as you'd expect for a player who usually sees the game from a vastly different perspective. His attacking contributions were that of an ideal wingback, logging assists and chipping in goals as an auxiliary threat from wide. His defensive performances were riddled with the kinds of mistakes coaches have to drill out of defenders in the youth ranks, taking the bait and making needless fouls (like one just inside the box against Costa Rica that resulted in a penalty).

Tolkin, largely as a substitute, has at least spent his career in the role since debuting with his boyhood New York Red Bulls. His issues more closely mirror the struggles recently seen from young left backs George Bello, Kris Lund and Sam Vines: bona fide left backs, but unable to prove themselves at the international level.

Advertisement

There's a paucity of alternatives, too. Unlike other spots, there's no alternative who hasn't been tested and is flying under the radar. The closest to matching that mold is Caleb Wiley, the Chelsea prospect who earned three caps in 2023 and 2024 but hasn't been in a national team camp since Pochettino took charge. While it's impressive for a 20-year-old to have amassed 135 club appearances, mostly with Atlanta United before the club from London came calling, his first loan with Strasbourg was inconclusive. He's at Watford now, and could very easily work into the fold in the months to come.

The other options are, in the program's grand tradition, playing out of position. There's Arfsten, still tapping into his winger's instincts at the expense of his team's defending. There's Scally shifting over from right back (and Sergiño Dest before him, the first-choice option in that spot), who fancy themselves to put in a shift on the left. Even then, it weakens the right back contingent that is seemingly three players deep: Dest, Scally, Alex Freeman.

If Robinson's recovery timetable will keep him out of the next international camp spanning from Sept. 1-9 (the fifth-to-last camp before the 2026 World Cup), those speculative alternatives may get another chance to log starts and fortify their cases for inclusion. Pochettino and a fanbase starved for optimism will rightfully hope for a pleasant surprise.

As it stands right now, it's a bleak reality for the USMNT: against ideal operational standards, this is a Jedi without a worthy padawan.

DAZN selected Amagi to serve as the exclusive live playout partner for the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 soccer tournament, the companies confirmed this week.

The cloud-based, software-as-a-service (SaaS) technology provider supported DAZN's delivery of all 63 matches of the inaugural tournament, which was streamed to audiences in more than 200 markets. With exclusive global broadcast rights, DAZN relied on Amagi's scalable cloud infrastructure to maintain uninterrupted service and nearly 100 percent uptime throughout the event.

Amagi's CloudPort (stylized as CLOUDPORT) solution enabled low-latency delivery of live matches and allowed for regional customisation, including language feeds and sponsorship integration. The deployment supported as many as 108 concurrent live events and 27 feed variants per match.

Emma Whitmore, the Senior Vice President of Sales for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Amagi, said the collaboration underscored the growing shift toward cloud-native workflows in live sports broadcasting.

“A live sports tournament such as the FIFA Club World Cup requires a solution that is both resilient and scalable,” Whitmore said. “This collaboration with DAZN highlights how cloud-native orchestration can reduce operational costs, improve monetization and deliver high-impact outcomes for tier-1 sports platforms.”

James Pearce, DAZN's Senior Vice President of Broadcast and Streaming, said the company's global coverage required a technical partner that could ensure reliability at scale.

“The FIFA Club World Cup was a milestone event for DAZN, with hundreds of millions of football fans around the world expecting a flawless viewing experience,” Pearce said. “Amagi's CloudPort, deployed for DAZN using highly resilient architecture, was important in enabling us to deliver uninterrupted, high-quality coverage at scale for this tournament. Amagi's real-time support allowed us to meet the technical demands of the tournament with confidence and efficiency.”

Amagi and DAZN began working together in 2023. Since then, both companies have expanded their operational collaboration to address the evolving needs of large-scale live sports events.

The deployment reflects Amagi's broader strategy of supporting tier-1 broadcasters and sports streaming services with cloud-led infrastructure that blends flexibility, fault tolerance and operational efficiency.

Zlatko Dalić

Croatia head coach Zlatko Dalić has named a 23-man squad, along with four standby players, for September's continuation of the European qualifiers for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will be held in the USA, Mexico and Canada.

After a highly successful June in which Croatia collected maximum points against Gibraltar and the Czech Republic – scoring 12 goals and conceding just once – the “Vatreni” face fresh challenges in their qualifying campaign. 

On 5 September, Croatia will travel to the Faroe Islands, before returning to Zagreb to host Montenegro three days later.

“It was logical to keep faith with the players who performed so well throughout June, both in their preparations and in matches against Gibraltar and, especially, the Czech Republic. 

Sadly, Mateo Kovačić is still recovering from surgery and cannot join us, but the most important thing is that he returns fully fit. 

In agreement with the player and U-21 coach Ivica Olić, Luka Vušković will remain with the U-21s for this cycle, where he is a key player and will benefit from significant playing time,” said Dalić.

“We must not relax simply because we started well, as we know one bad day can jeopardise our ambitions. I expect the same level of motivation and determination at this gathering. 

Of course, we accept the role of favourites against the Faroe Islands and Montenegro, but our obligation is to approach both matches with maximum focus so that our quality can shine through. 

I am pleased that several players have taken steps forward at club level this summer, moving to stronger environments and more competitive leagues where they can continue to progress. I also hope that those still seeking a move before the end of the transfer window find the right solution. 

We are monitoring a wide pool of candidates, and it is up to each of them to prove themselves at club level and fight for a national team spot. 

Naturally, that motivation is even stronger in a World Cup year. After silver in Russia and bronze in Qatar, we all know what a privilege it is to represent Croatia at the World Cup, and I am sure that remains the main goal for every top Croatian footballer this season,” Dalić concluded.

The squad will assemble in Zagreb on 1 September, training there until their departure for the Faroe Islands on 4 September. After that match, the team will return to Zagreb, where they face Montenegro at Maksimir Stadium on 8 September.

Following the September fixtures, Croatia's qualifying campaign continues with matches in October (Czech Republic, Gibraltar) and November (Faroe Islands, Montenegro).

In Group L, the Czech Republic currently lead with nine points from four matches. Croatia, with a perfect record from two games, are level on points with Montenegro, who have played three. The Faroe Islands sit on three points from three matches, while Gibraltar remain bottom without a point from four games.

Squad list for matches against the Faroe Islands and Montenegro:

Goalkeepers: Dominik Livaković, Ivica Ivušić, Dominik Kotarski

Defenders: Joško Gvardiol, Josip Juranović, Duje Ćaleta-Car, Josip Šutalo, Josip Stanišić, Marin Pongračić, Martin Erlić

Midfielders: Luka Modrić, Mario Pašalić, Lovro Majer, Martin Baturina, Kristijan Jakić, Petar Sučić, Nikola Moro, Toni Fruk

Forwards: Ivan Perišić, Andrej Kramarić, Ante Budimir, Marco Pašalić, Franjo Ivanović

Standby: Bruno Petković, Mislav Oršić, Borna Sosa, Karlo Letica

MASON, OH − The stage was set for an epic Cincinnati Open men's singles final between the ATP's top 2 players in Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz.

Instead, fans saw just 23 minutes of play as top-ranked ATP phenom Jannik Sinner retired after just five games due to illness.

Sinner received medical attention after having his serve broken for the third time in the opening set. Shortly after, he retired.

""I'm super, super sorry to disappoint you,"" Sinner said in his on-court interview. Sinner was one of several players who exited the tournament early due to illness.

Alcaraz, 22, becomes the youngest man to win the Cincinnati Open title since Andy Murray in 2008.

Carlos Alcaraz won his sixth title of the season at the Cincinnati Open on Monday after fierce rival Jannik Sinner was forced to retire after just 23 minutes into their championship-match clash. 

Looking out of sorts in the sweltering heat, defending champion Sinner called for the doctor after surrendering a 0-5 lead in the opening set, but he was unable to continue. With his 22nd tour-level trophy, Alcaraz also strengthened push for Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF — an honour he last held in 2022. He leads Sinner by 1,890 points in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin.

“I'm super, super sorry to disappoint you,” Sinner said to the fans. “From yesterday I didn't feel great. I thought that I would improve during the night, but it came up worse. I tried to come out, tried to make it at least a small match, but I couldn't handle more, so I'm very sorry.”

With defeat, Sinner's 26-match winning streak on hard courts comes to an end, and he now faces a quick recovery ahead of his US Open title defence. The World No. 1's participation in the mixed doubles event, in which he is set to compete with Katerina Siniakova on Tuesday, may now be in question.

“This is not the way that I want to win trophies, I just have to say sorry, I can understand how you must feel now,” Alcaraz said to Sinner. “As I said many times, you are a true champion and I am sure from these situations, you are going to come back even stronger, as you always do. That's what true champions do. I'm sorry and come back stronger.”

Alcaraz let slip a championship point before falling to Novak Djokovic in the 2023 final, which is widely regarded as one of the most thrilling ATP Tour matches in history. But the 22-year-old Spaniard now has his hands on the trophy in Ohio, which is his eighth ATP Masters 1000 title, the most of any active player besides Novak Djokovic (40).

With a Tour-leading 54 wins and six titles in 2025, Alcaraz will head to the US Open, which could have huge ramifications in his battle with Sinner for the World No. 1 spot. As Sinner is defending champion at Flushing Meadows, Alcaraz will start with a 50-point lead in the PIF ATP Live Rankings once their points from the 2024 US Open are removed.

Carlos Alcaraz extended his Big Titles lead over rival Jannik Sinner on Monday when he lifted the Cincinnati Open trophy.

Sinner, the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, did not lose a set en route to the championship match. But after Alcaraz took a 5-0 lead on Monday, the ailing Italian retired to give the Spaniard a 9-5 lead in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

Alcaraz now owns 13 Big Titles — a combination of Grand Slam championships, trophies at the Nitto ATP Finals and ATP Masters 1000 tournaments, and Olympic singles gold medals — and has claimed eight ATP Masters 1000 trophies, more than any active player besides Novak Djokovic (40). 

Big Titles Won: Alcaraz & Sinner




NATPF

Alcaraz is 8-1 in Masters 1000 finals, with his only defeat coming in the 2023 Cincinnati final, in which he held championship point against Novak Djokovic before the Serbian rallied to victory in a thrilling final-set tie-break. The Spaniard is on a 17-match winning streak at Masters 1000 events.

The 22-year-old has won an ATP Tour-leading six titles this season, including four Big Titles. He has claimed three Masters 1000 crowns in 2025 — in Monte-Carlo, Rome and Cincinnati — as well as a major trophy at Roland Garros.

This is the first year in which Alcaraz has earned four Big Titles in a season after capturing three in each of 2022, 2023 and 2024. He will have four opportunities to add to that tally with the US Open, Shanghai, Paris and the Nitto ATP Finals still to come.

Alcaraz has won a Big Title for every four tournaments he has played in his career. Only Djokovic (3.3) and Rafael Nadal (3.5) have triumphed at a better rate than the Spaniard, with all-time greats like Roger Federer (4.4), Pete Sampras (4.9) and Andre Agassi (6.1) behind him.

...

Fresh off a four-set win over Carlos Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final, Jannik Sinner was clearly not himself on Monday in a rematch of the rivals and the top two players in the world.

Sinner retired with apparent illness in the first set of Monday's Cincinnati Open final against Alcaraz after digging a 5-0 deficit. Sinner remained on the court for the trophy ceremony and addressed his condition while speaking with the crowd. He didn't offer specifics, but said that he ""didn't feel great.""

""I'm super super sorry to disappoint you,"" Sinner said. ""From yesterday, I didn't feel great. I thought that I would improve during the night, but it came up worse.

""I tried to come out, tried to make it at least a small match. But I couldn't handle more.""

Sinner's retirement arrives days ahead of the start of the US Open. First-round matches are scheduled to start next Monday.

Sinner is the defending US Open champion and is in search of his third Grand Slam victory this year after winning Wimbledon and the Australian Open. His early retirement on Monday raises obvious concerns about his condition to defend his title.

Sinner looked out of sorts from the outset under the mid-afternoon sun during an 88-degree afternoon in Cincinnati. Sinner served first and spotted Alcaraz a 40-0 lead in the first game before Alcaraz took a 1-0 lead.

Sinner started his second serve with a double fault en route to another 40-0 deficit before Alacaraz broke him again for a 3-0 lead. Sinner then called for a bag of ice during the break between games. On his third service game, Sinner doubled faulted while trailing 40-30 as Alcaraz secured his third break and a 5-0 lead.

Sinner struggled with illness as Alcaraz was crowned champion in strange scenes in Cincinnati 

Jannik Sinner retired from his Cincinnati Open final against young rival Carlos Alcaraz after losing the first five games and struggling with illness. 

The World No 1 apologised and said sorry to the fans after pulling out from the final when he lost his third service game in a row to trail Alcaraz 5-0 in the first set. Alcaraz was crowned the champion in strange scenes as the final came to an end after just 20 minutes of action. 

“Usually I start with the opponent but today I have to start with you guys [the crowd],” Sinner said. “I'm super super sorry to disappoint you. From yesterday I didn't feel great. I thought I would improve during the night. It came up worse. 

“I tried to come out and make it at least a small match but I couldn't handle more. I'm very very sorry for all of you. I know some of you on Monday maybe had to work or do something else, so I'm very very sorry.”

The more immediate concern is whether Sinner will be ready to defend his US Open title, with the grand slam getting underway in New York on Sunday. The result also means Sinner's 26-match winning streak on hard courts has come to an end, with retirement also halting his 12-match winning run on all surfaces.

Jannik Sinner looked out of sorts from the start, struggling with his movement and the timing of his groundstrokes, and lost his serve three times before retiring. 

The 24-year-old later confirmed that he had been ill, but his fitness will be a concern ahead of the start of his US Open defence in New York on Sunday. 

It appears as if Sinner will be unable to partner Katerina Siniakova in the new-looked US Open mixed doubles tournament, which begins on Tuesday afternoon. 

Carlos Alcaraz also signed the court-side camera with “sorry Jannik”. 

Sad to see. But great sportsmanship on display from Carlos Alcaraz as he went over to comfort his rival. 

Carlos Alcaraz takes the trophy and turns to Jannik Sinner. “As you said Jannik this isn't the way I want to win matches, to win a trophy. I just gotta say sorry. I know and understand how you can feel right now. 

“All I can say… as I said many many times, you are truly a champion. I'm pretty sure from this situation you're gonna come back better, even stronger. You always do. That's what true champions do. You really are one. Sorry and come back stronger.”

Their 14th match will not be remembered for long but Sinner still congratulates Alcaraz and his team for adding another trophy to his collection. 

Jannik Sinner confirms he was ill yesterday and tried to play in the final but found he couldn't manage. He apologises to the fans. 

“Usually I start with the opponent but today I have to start with you guys [the crowd]. I'm super super sorry to disappoint you. From yesterday I didn't feel great. I thought I would improve during the night. It came up worse. 

“I tried to come out and make it at least a small match but I couldn't handle more. I'm very very sorry for all of you. I know some of you on Monday maybe had to work or do something else, so I'm very very sorry. 

“Of course Carlos congrats. Another title. Not the way you wanted to win but it's amazing what kind of season you're producing. You and your whole team are doing amazing. Keep it up. I wish you only all the best for the U.S. Open and the rest of the season.”

This is going to be weird. 

Quotes to come. 

Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz are hanging around for something. So maybe we do have a trophy ceremony to come. 

Alcaraz, technically, has now won six of his last seven matches against Sinner. This is his sixth title this year. But he's barely cracked a smile. 

We will here more soon. But interesting to hear the umpire announce that Sinner retired “due to illness”. 

But it might be an injury. More to come. 

Sinner looks on the verge of tears. Alcaraz goes over to commiserate his rival. 

An extraordinary finish. But Sinner is taking no chances ahead of the US Open. 

He looks gutted to be doing this, and said how sorry he was to the fans. 

I guess we do a trophy ceremony now?

The Italian was 0-5 down at that point in the first set.

But Alcaraz's first thought was to console his opponent.

Sinner looked devastated courtside as seen below.

He had his head in his hands after being forced to retire injured while 5-0 down.

The face of a man who is out of the US Open?

We now have an agonizing wait to find out what Jannik Sinner's US Open future holds.

He seemed to suggest he wouldn't be there with some of his comments in that interview.

The Italian wishing Alcaraz the best for the US Open was an indication he might not be there at all.

We're not far away from the start of what's sure to be another classic.

Two young men at the top of their game going head-to-head once again.

Tennis

Hard-Court

Season

Welcome back to the Monday Tennis Briefing, where The Athletic will explain the stories behind the stories from the past week on court.

This week, the Cincinnati Open blew the race to be the best in the world wide open, the tournament saw a string of retirements, and a 12-day event still couldn't keep scheduling out of the headlines.

If you'd like to follow our fantastic tennis coverage, click here.

The climax of the Cincinnati Open is set to shape, if not define, the race for world No. 1 on both the men's and women's tours.

Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz's fourth encounter in a final this season is up first in Mason, Ohio, at 3 p.m. ET. If Alcaraz wins, he will start the U.S. Open as the live world No. 1, as he is defending only 50 points after a Alcaraz's shock second-round exit to Botic van de Zandschulp last year. Even if Sinner wins, his defense of the U.S. Open title will mean that the ranking is on the line, but Alcaraz will need to make the semifinals to trouble him at the top. Sinner then defends 2,830 further points for the rest of the season, while Alcaraz defends 1,000.

Their final is followed by Iga Świątek vs. Jasmine Paolini, not before 6 p.m ET. Świątek would move to world No. 2 with the title, and despite that result leaving a near-3,300 point gap to world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in the rankings, the two players go into the final stretch of the year with very different records to protect. As the reigning champion, Sabalenka defends 2,000 points at the U.S. Open to Świątek's 430; for the rest of the season, Sabalenka defends 1,615 to Świątek's 400. A title for Świątek would take her just over 500 points behind Sabalenka in the “race” for world No. 1 — which counts points won in 2025.

Should Paolini win the title, Sabalenka's position will feel rather more secure.

Both matches have not just trophies, but trajectories for the rest of the year on the line. Not bad for a Monday afternoon in some ways — but for the visibility of the sport, the schedule does little.

With a Grand Slam on the horizon, tournaments such as the Cincinnati Open are always at risk of some players having one eye on their next event. It is an important event, because it is the last chance most players have to sharpen up ahead of the U.S. Open, but those same players also won't take any chances with their fitness.

This concern factors into the 11 retirements and walkovers across the men's and women's draws, with seven in the ATP draw and four in the WTA. The 86-degree temperatures and high humidity played a part: France's Arthur Rinderknech appeared to collapse against Felix Auger-Aliassime of Canada before retiring from their third-round match last Monday, and the conditions worsened any fatigue held over from previous tournaments.

Of the seven men's players who withdrew mid-match, five of them were seeds, all of whom should have a chance of going reasonably deep in New York. Frances Tiafoe, who lives for the U.S. Open, had to pull out against Holger Rune in the fourth round because of a back problem, taking no chances. Canadian Open finalist Karen Khachanov posted a statement referring to not taking risks after retiring against Alexander Zverev, while Washington D.C. runner-up Alejandro Davidovich Fokina said that “not taking time off or skipping weeks has caught up with me.”

The WTA draw saw no mid-match retirements, but there were four walkovers, with players pulling out before starting their match. Two were seeds: Marta Kostyuk withdrew from her match against Iga Świątek with a wrist injury, and Dayana Yastremska pulled out of hers against Coco Gauff due to illness.

One player who did not retire, despite being unable to compete properly, was Zverev. Zverev, who has type 1 diabetes, reported dizziness during his quarterfinal against Ben Shelton and then faded in the second set of his semifinal against Alcaraz. Still, he played on despite having no chance of moving to the ball, with Alcaraz completing a 6-4, 6-3 victory despite serving four double faults to concede a break early in the second set.

The retirements and player withdrawals at the Cincinnati Open created fertile ground for a surprise player to have a run. Step forward Térence Atmane.

The French 23-year-old went into the tournament ranked No. 136, but went all the way to the semifinals after coming through qualifying. In doing so, he took out world No. 9 Holger Rune, last year's U.S. Open finalist Taylor Fritz, rising phenom João Fonseca, and Flavio Cobolli, who last month reached the Wimbledon quarterfinals. Atmane was the seventh-lowest-ranked player to reach the semis of an ATP 1,000-level event, the rung below the Grand Slams, and the lowest-ranked man to record back-to-back top-10 wins anywhere for three years.

A sustained, astonishing top level defined Atmane's run, as he punished his opponents with pummeled inside-out forehands, pinpoint serves and a general policy of all-out attack. In a year when wild card Victoria Mboko has won the Canadian Open, another wild card, Loïs Boisson, has reached the French Open semifinals, and qualifier Learner Tien has made it to the Australian Open fourth round, this was different.

All of those players had staggering underlying records on the second and third rungs of the tennis circuit, while Atmane has produced an old-fashioned heater. His home crowd had booed him at the French Open for a perceived lack of effort against 38-year-old Richard Gasquet, who was playing his last event, and he lost in the first round of Wimbledon qualifying to then-world No. 733 Ollie Tarvet. He was 5-14 on the ATP Tour going into this tournament.

Now he is up to No. 69 in the rankings, after pushing Sinner harder than most top-20 and even top-10 opponents have done this year. He'll still have to go through qualifying if he wants to maintain this sudden and wholly surprising jolt of momentum at the U.S. Open, but if he makes it, he could be a nightmare first-round draw for just about anyone.

One of the advantages of the extended 12-day 1000-events is that there are more days to play with for rain delays and other unexpected disruptions. Scheduling matches should, barring complete disaster, not be controversial.

Not so in Mason, where world No. 31 Anna Kalinskaya posted on social media, bemoaning the scheduling for her quarterfinal against Świątek. A rain delay and a tight three-set match meant she beat Ekaterina Alexandrova in the early hours of Thursday morning, not getting to bed until 4 a.m. She was then scheduled for the 11 a.m. slot on Friday.

“How can the WTA and tournament expect athletes to perform their best when the scheduling is this unfair?” Kalinskaya wrote.

“How does the tournament and WTA expect me to recover and continuously adjust my sleep pattern, which is one of the most important aspects of recovery?”

The tournament and WTA did not offer statements in response when contacted by The Athletic. Kalinskaya still had a day off between matches, even though that is not enough to totally correct the body-clock issues that she described. Moreover, the scheduling complication did not come from the quarterfinal, but from the previous round, when the tournament put two matches in the same section of the draw — Kalinskaya vs. Alexandrova and Świątek vs. Sorana Cirstea — at opposite ends of the day's play.

Świątek played Cîrstea in the first match on Thursday, while Kalinskaya and Alexandrova played last. By the time the pair met on Friday, they had to have one of the two earlier slots because the two later ones had to go to the four quarterfinalists who had played on Thursday. 

When Kalinskaya and Świątek did meet in the slot the former wanted to avoid, she was well beaten, losing 6-3, 6-4.

A revamped competition with the top singles players and held the week before the main tournament has caught attention at Flushing Meadows

A few hours after Taylor Fritz's third-round match at the Cincinnati Open, the theme of his post-match press conference shifted from his tough victory against Lorenzo Sonego to the looming US Open mixed doubles tournament. The first question posed to him on this subject was carefully prefaced with the acknowledgment that mixed doubles was probably not his priority in the middle of one of the biggest tournaments in the world. As a grin spread across his face, Fritz quickly interjected: “It is a priority,” he said.

Fritz had been asked whether he had any sympathy for the frustrated doubles specialists who had been brushed aside to make room for the transformation of this event. From his perspective, the right players were in the draw: “I've seen a lot of people calling it like an exhibition, or it doesn't count. I personally think this is the strongest mixed doubles field you're going to see at a grand slam, in my opinion. If the mixed doubles teams that are in come in and win the event, then I'll eat my words and say I'm wrong, but I personally think the level is going to be really high,” he said.

After six months of anticipation, the revamped US Open mixed-doubles tournament is finally here. Usually the domain of doubles specialists with the exception of the very occasional superstar pairing, mixed doubles rarely generates much fanfare and at the grand slams it has come to represent more opportunities for trophies and prize money for doubles specialists.

While the event usually runs at the same time as the rest of the grand slam main draws, this year it will be held in the week leading up to the start of the singles main draw. Sixteen teams will compete in a knockout draw across Tuesday and Wednesday. The first three rounds will be decided in abbreviated four-game sets while the final will be determined in standard six-game sets. The winners will take home $1m between them, an $800k increase on last year. In an era where the top players have largely spurned doubles due to the increased physical demands of singles competition, the ultimate aim of the event is to attract the stars.

For that reason, officials at the USTA already feel like the glittering player field and the interest it has generated has justified the move. The partnership between Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu has created countless headlines for months, but other distinguished entrants include Novak Djokovic alongside his compatriot Olga Danilovic, Iga Swiatek with Casper Ruud and Fritz alongside Elena Rybakina. The only doubles specialist team is the Italian defending champions, Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori.

Some aspects of this tournament, however, have been completely unserious. Jannik Sinner, the men's No 1, said that he and his initial partner, Emma Navarro, had never spoken and their pairing had been orchestrated by the tournament itself. In a truly meaningful event, the players would be scrambling for the most advantageous pairings.

Since the initial entry list, numerous withdrawals have followed. Navarro's withdrawal actually led Sinner to possibly find an even better partner in Katerina Siniakova, an 11-time grand slam champion. Jack Draper, meanwhile, is now on his third partner, Jessica Pegula, after his previous partners, Zheng Qinwen and Paula Badosa, withdrew from the US Open.

Despite how much it has changed, the draw makes for surreal viewing with so many prominent singles players present. The first two lines are particularly noteworthy: Alcaraz and Raducanu have been drawn against the top seeds, Draper and Jessica Pegula, meaning the British No 1s are scheduled to do battle on Tuesday afternoon.

Over the past few months on the tour, mixed doubles at the US Open has been a popular subject in player lounges at tournaments. Madison Keys, who is paired with Frances Tiafoe, says she has randomly received FaceTime calls from Tiafoe with questions about their partnership, such as which side she would prefer to play on. She also recalls a conversation with Sinner at Wimbledon where the Italian joked that he would be scared at the net if Rybakina was standing on the opposite baseline: “I'm like: ‘You'd kill all of us! What are you talking about?'”

Even on the eve of the tournament, there is still serious doubt surrounding the participation of some of the most prominent players in the draw. Alcaraz, Sinner and Swiatek are all competing in Cincinnati less than 24 hours before their first round mixed doubles matches in New York, meaning they will have an extremely short turnaround after a gruelling two-week event. Alternates should be ready.

The excitement from many of the singles players is counterbalanced by disappointment from doubles specialists who feel they have been pushed out of the event. Before she paired up with Sinner, Siniakova had entered with Marcelo Arévalo, her fellow No 1. Singles rankings determine the entry list so they did not come close to making the cut: “When two world No 1s in doubles don't get into the tournament, there's probably nothing more to say about it,” Siniakova said on Canal+. Ben Shelton, who is paired with the No 1 doubles player Taylor Townsend, is empathetic towards the doubles players' frustrations.

Shelton says: “I totally understand the honour of playing mixed doubles and what a mixed doubles title means, especially to those guys and girls, and I feel for them that they're not able to play this year. At the same time, I understand the business mind of the US Open and what they're trying to do to generate more revenue, make their event more profitable and have more excitement around it. That's the craziest lineup that you've seen at mixed doubles in your life.”

The former British No 1 Kyle Edmund has announced his retirement from tennis at the age of 30.

Edmund won two ATP titles and became only the second British man after Sir Andy Murray to reach the semi-finals of the Australian Open in 2018. He was part of the Great Britain team that won the Davis Cup for the first time in 79 years, and also represented his country at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio.

Unfortunately, Edmund's ascent into the world's top 50 corresponded with a knee injury that required three operations and kept him off the tour for almost two years.

In a statement issued by the Lawn Tennis Association, Edmund said: “The last five years have taken a toll with three surgeries and other injuries [and] my body is telling me it's finally reached the end point. Looking back I can say I tried my absolute best in my career and my hardest to get back to where I was. There are no regrets whatsoever.”

Edmund, who defeated Novak Djokovic at the ATP Masters in 2018, made progress in his latest comeback attempt but decided the Nottingham Challenger final defeat against Jack Pinnington Jones last month would be his last match.

He said on social media: “Of course to beat Novak, probably the greatest player of all time, was a great feeling and probably the biggest scalp of my career. I spent four or five years trying to come back and was never fully able to reach my goal. But over the next few weeks and months it will be a nice time to reflect and spend more time with my family and appreciate the journey.” PA Media

A longtime member of the WTA player council, Pegula questions the US Open's decision to make such a significant change without properly consulting the players, a common complaint among players. Communication with players, she believes, could have actually addressed some of these problems: “I felt like that was a really good example where we were like: ‘OK, you guys just kind of went rogue and changed the whole entire format and didn't tell anybody, and you just kind of did it.' And it was kind of like: ‘Did you talk to the players? Did you get input, maybe on how it could have been better?'” she said.

In the same breath, though, Pegula expresses her excitement for the tournament ahead. This will not be the defining moment of any of these players' careers, but they are intensely competitive beings who step on to the tennis court every day with the intention of winning, regardless of the format. For at least 30 minutes of their lives, this event will be a priority for many. Keys concludes: “I mean, there's a grand slam trophy on the line and have you seen the prize money? I'm gonna try real hard.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","tennis"

Britons to meet in first round of 16-pair event

Raducanu and Alcaraz will play Draper and Pegula

Jack Draper and Emma Raducanu, will face each other in the first round of the revamped US Open mixed doubles. The event has been moved to before the main tournament, on 19 and 20 August, with $1m (£750,000) in prize money at stake for the winners of the 16-pair event.

Draper will play with the American Jessica Pegula after their original partners, Paula Badosa and Tommy Paul, withdrew. With both inside the top five in the singles rankings, the pair have been handed the top seeding and will kick off their campaign against the wildcard pair of Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz.

The winners will face the 24-time grand slam champion Novak Djokovic and Olga Danilovic if they overcome Mirra Andreeva and Daniil Medvedev. Venus Williams, at the age of 45, and compatriot Reilly Opelka face Karolina Muchova and Andrey Rublev .

Meanwhile, the six-time Wimbledon doubles champion Gordon Reid says wheelchair tennis must keep proving its value to tournaments to help close the gap in prize money. Reid and his partner, Alfie Hewett, are preparing for the US Open, which last week announced a large increase in winnings.

The former British No 1 Kyle Edmund has announced his retirement from tennis at the age of 30.

Edmund won two ATP titles and became only the second British man after Sir Andy Murray to reach the semi-finals of the Australian Open in 2018. He was part of the Great Britain team that won the Davis Cup for the first time in 79 years, and also represented his country at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio.

Unfortunately, Edmund's ascent into the world's top 50 corresponded with a knee injury that required three operations and kept him off the tour for almost two years.

In a statement issued by the Lawn Tennis Association, Edmund said: “The last five years have taken a toll with three surgeries and other injuries [and] my body is telling me it's finally reached the end point. Looking back I can say I tried my absolute best in my career and my hardest to get back to where I was. There are no regrets whatsoever.”

Edmund, who defeated Novak Djokovic at the ATP Masters in 2018, made progress in his latest comeback attempt but decided the Nottingham Challenger final defeat against Jack Pinnington Jones last month would be his last match.

He said on social media: “Of course to beat Novak, probably the greatest player of all time, was a great feeling and probably the biggest scalp of my career. I spent four or five years trying to come back and was never fully able to reach my goal. But over the next few weeks and months it will be a nice time to reflect and spend more time with my family and appreciate the journey.” PA Media

While the mixed doubles champions will now get $1m, the total pot for all wheelchair players is $1.69m. Reid and Hewett, who have won six titles at Flushing Meadows, with Hewett also winning four singles titles, have been a big driving force in the improvement in wheelchair tennis.

“It's been 20 years since we started, so in terms of the age of the slams themselves, we're very fresh, very new,” Reid said. “As much as we want to see an increase and the gap in the prize money closing, we also need to prove we're adding something, adding value to the tournament. Hopefully, those come hand in hand, the opportunities we get and the prize money.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","tennis"

FORMER British tennis No1 Kyle Edmund has announced his retirement at the age of 30.

Edmund, who was born in South Africa but raised in Yorkshire, England after moving at the age of three, made an emotional announcement on social media on Monday evening.

The former World No14 spoke candidly in a heartfelt video, which left him holding back tears.

He admitted that his body had ""reached the end point"" and was telling him to retire after struggling with a series of injuries. 

Edmund was just the second British tennis player since 1978, after Scotsman Andy Murray, to reach the Australian Open semi-finals when he did so in 2018.

But the end of his career was heavily hit by three knee surgeries.

In his retirement video, Edmund said: ""The last five years have taken a toll with three surgeries and other injuries such as wrist, ab, hip and foot in trying to get better, my body is telling me its finally reached the end point.

""Looking back I can say I tried my absolute best in my career and my hardest to get back to where I was. There are no regrets whatsoever.

""I have always been quite a determined person and I have no doubt I'll apply those principles that I learned in my tennis career to whatever I do next and something I'm very excited about.""

Replying in the comments, Murray said: ""Great stuff Kedders!""

Former British tennis star Laura Robson said: ""Happy retirement kedders!!! Just the beginning.""

British tennis doubles specialist Julian Cash said: ""Congrats mate! Amazing career and always had huge respect for how you dealt with the tough moments through injury. Wish you the best with the next chapter.""

Fellow Brit tennis star Marcus Willis said: ""Inspired by how you went about your tennis, how you battled through your injuries, will miss watching that forehand. All the best fella. YNWA.""

Edmund's Australian Open result was the best at a grand slam tournament, while his best at Wimbledon saw him reach the third round in 2018 before he ran into eventual title-winner Novak Djokovic.

However, Edmund was part of the Great Britain team which won the Davis Cup in 2015.

He also went on to represent the UK at the 2016 Olympics in Rio, Brazil and win two ATP Tour titles - the first in Antwerp in 2018 and then in New York in 2020.

After reaching the rank of British No1 in 2018, succeeding Murray, Edmund started to struggle with knee problems.

Edmund underwent the first of three procedures in 2020, sidelining him for the best part of two years.

It also unfortunately signalled the end of his time at the top, as Edmund never made it past the first round of a grand slam or ATP 1000 tournament again.

 For the fourth time in the space of three months, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz will face off with a big title on the line when they clash in the championship match at the Cincinnati Open. 

 The duo's red-hot Lexus ATP Head2Head series has already lit up Rome, Roland Garros and Wimbledon in 2025, and Monday's meeting at 3 p.m. EDT (9 p.m. CEST) in Ohio will once again have fans on tenterhooks waiting to see who can notch the latest success in one of sport's great ongoing rivalries. 

JANNIK SINNER. CARLOS ALCARAZ.

Ladies and gentlemen, we are in for a treat 🎭@CincyTennis | #CincyTennis pic.twitter.com/tbSSztiWps

 The No. 1 and No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings, respectively, both Sinner and Alcaraz have been ‘scintillating in Cincy' so far this year. Defending champion Sinner has not dropped a set in reaching his eighth ATP Masters 1000 final and enters the match on a 26-match winning streak on hard courts. 

 “It's going to be a very, very difficult match, but hopefully it's going to be, in any case, a good match,” said Sinner after he downed Terence Atmane in the semi-finals. “Hopefully it's a very high-level match. That's what for us players is important, but also for the people who are watching… We will see what kind of fun is going to [happen] on Monday.” 

 Alcaraz may have dropped two sets en route to the title match, but the Spaniard has faced a tougher path than Sinner judging by his opponents' PIF ATP Rankings. He held off ninth seed Andrey Rublev in the quarter-finals before downing third seed Alexander Zverev in the last four, and the seven-time Masters 1000 champion will be full of confidence as he chases his Tour-leading sixth title of 2025. 

 “I'm excited about it. It's going to be great,” said Alcaraz ahead of facing Sinner in what will be his seventh consecutive tour-level final. “He won the last one, I won the first two finals, so I think it's going to be really interesting. It's the first final [between us this year] on a hard court, so I'm excited about taking that challenge. 

 “I know that Jannik, without a doubt, is the best player in the world on hard courts and probably on every surface right now, so it's going to be a great match and I have to be ready for that.” 

 After he let slip three championship points at Roland Garros in July to fall to a fifth consecutive defeat against Alcaraz, Sinner halted the Spaniard's momentum in their rivalry in style at Wimbledon in early July. The Italian clinched a four-set victory to seal his maiden title at SW19 and reduce his Lexus ATP Head2Head deficit against Alcaraz to 5-8. 

 For many, Sinner and Alcaraz's rivalry is defined by the contrast between the former's consistent all-around elite displays, featuring precise serving and cleanly struck groundstrokes, and the latter's sublime shotmaking genius and ability to string together unstoppable hot streaks when the stakes are at their greatest. Fans will be eager to see what sort of drama that intriguing combination produces on Monday in Cincinnati. 

 “The ability of not having any weakness,” said Alcaraz on Saturday, when asked what makes Sinner such a tough opponent. “It is crazy, the way he always plays at his best. It seems like you have to earn every point every game. He makes you suffer since the first point of the match until the last ball. The capacity of being there mentally, point after point, not having up and downs on the match makes him really, really special.”

 Both Sinner and Alcaraz have already qualified for the season-ending Nitto ATP Finals, but the latter stands 1,540 points clear of his rival in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. Sinner has the opportunity to cut Alcaraz's lead with victory in Cincinnati as both players chase ATP Year-End No. 1 present by PIF honours. Should Sinner triumph and improve his record for the season to 27-3, he would trail Alcaraz by just 1,190 points heading into the US Open. 

 On the other hand Alcaraz, who is 53-6 for 2025, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, could extend his Live Race lead to 1,890 points by defeating Sinner to clinch his first Cincinnati crown. Victory in Ohio would also banish painful memories for Alcaraz at the Lindner Family Tennis Center, where he held a championship point in the 2023 final before losing to Novak Djokovic in a modern Masters 1000 classic.

Carlos Alcaraz extended his Big Titles lead over rival Jannik Sinner on Monday when he lifted the Cincinnati Open trophy.

Sinner, the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, did not lose a set en route to the championship match. But after Alcaraz took a 5-0 lead on Monday, the ailing Italian retired to give the Spaniard a 9-5 lead in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

Alcaraz now owns 13 Big Titles — a combination of Grand Slam championships, trophies at the Nitto ATP Finals and ATP Masters 1000 tournaments, and Olympic singles gold medals — and has claimed eight ATP Masters 1000 trophies, more than any active player besides Novak Djokovic (40). 

Big Titles Won: Alcaraz & Sinner




NATPF

Alcaraz is 8-1 in Masters 1000 finals, with his only defeat coming in the 2023 Cincinnati final, in which he held championship point against Novak Djokovic before the Serbian rallied to victory in a thrilling final-set tie-break. The Spaniard is on a 17-match winning streak at Masters 1000 events.

The 22-year-old has won an ATP Tour-leading six titles this season, including four Big Titles. He has claimed three Masters 1000 crowns in 2025 — in Monte-Carlo, Rome and Cincinnati — as well as a major trophy at Roland Garros.

This is the first year in which Alcaraz has earned four Big Titles in a season after capturing three in each of 2022, 2023 and 2024. He will have four opportunities to add to that tally with the US Open, Shanghai, Paris and the Nitto ATP Finals still to come.

Alcaraz has won a Big Title for every four tournaments he has played in his career. Only Djokovic (3.3) and Rafael Nadal (3.5) have triumphed at a better rate than the Spaniard, with all-time greats like Roger Federer (4.4), Pete Sampras (4.9) and Andre Agassi (6.1) behind him.

Some players are just better than most or all of their opponents. But Swiatek vs. Paolini is one case in which the cliché is correct.Swiatek is ranked No. 3 and Paolini is No. 9; they've met in a Grand Slam final; and for the past 15 months or so, they've both been consistent contenders at the important events. But their head-to-head has been entirely one-sided in Swiatek's favor. She's 5-0 against Paolini, and four of those matches—including the 2024 Roland Garros final—were blowouts.“I never played a player that has this intensity before in my life,” Paolini said after losing to Iga 6-2, 6-1 in Paris. “So it was my first time facing a player that is taking time as much as she does, but also hitting winners and [is standing close to the baseline].“I think she's an unbelievable player.”

Paolini's first problem is the obvious one. She's 5-foot-4, which is not an optimal height when you're facing the heavy, high-bouncing topspin that the 5-foot-9 Swiatek produces with her forehand, her serve, and even her two-handed backhand. Where Paolini's topspin strokes tend to end up in Swiatek's stroke zone, Iga's force Paolini to either reach high, take the ball early, or back up. Swiatek also has an easier time attacking Paolini's kick second serve, especially with her excellent backhand return.When they met earlier this year on grass in Bad Homburg, Paolini tried to flatten out her strokes, crash the net, and take more risks. She made the points competitive, but only managed four games.“Jasmine, well, she plays fast, but with a lot of spin, and she has a lot of variety in terms of going to the net as well,” Swiatek said after her semifinal win on Sunday.That victory, over Elena Rybakina, was an impressive one. Swiatek says that she likes the challenge of facing Rybakina, because she has to lift her level to stay with her first-strike capabilities, and especially her serve. That's what happened in their semifinal, as Iga erased a first-set deficit and improved game by game. This will be her first final in Cincinnati, a place where the courts have been too quick for her in the past.“I think the surface was pretty crazy, and now it's something that you can play tennis on,” Swiatek said of the Cincy courts. “So now it's a bit slower, and it makes more sense. And yeah, also this year, I feel like I'm just progressing match by match. Past years I feel like the matches have been tough, like from the the beginning. So I just feel a bit different.”

Swiatek says that she likes the challenge of facing Rybakina, because she has to lift her level to stay with her first-strike capabilities, and especially her serve. That's what happened in their semifinal, as Iga erased a first-set deficit and improved game by game. This will be her first final in Cincinnati, a place where the courts have been too quick for her in the past.“I think the surface was pretty crazy, and now it's something that you can play tennis on,” Swiatek said of the Cincy courts. “So now it's a bit slower, and it makes more sense. And yeah, also this year, I feel like I'm just progressing match by match. Past years I feel like the matches have been tough, like from the the beginning. So I just feel a bit different.”

If Paolini is going to hang her hat on anything coming into Sunday, it should probably be her one close defeat to Swiatek, last fall at the BJK Cup. The match was played on an indoor hard court, and Paolini won the first set 3-6, before falling 6-4, 6-4 in the last two. While Paolini couldn't close it out, she was able to impose her will from the ground and at net for significant stretches.The Italian was playing for her country in that match, and she would eventually lead the team to the title. Can she find that focus and motivation for herself? So far in this tournament, she has had it. Paolini edged Maria Sakkari in two tiebreakers in her opening round, came back from a set down to beat Coco Gauff in the quarters, and stopped Veronika Kudermetova's momentum in the third set in the semis.“That was the key: Forget, go back and fight, and stay in the present,” she says.She'll need all of her fighting, and possibly forgetting, skills against Swiatek. But with Paolini, who didn't break through on tour until she was past 25, hope springs eternal.“It's been really tough against her,” she admitted of her record against Swiatek. “She's defending well, serve is good.”“We are in the final, I like the conditions here. Let's fight, and hopefully it's gonna be a good match.”Winner: Swiatek

Tweaks and turnout will determine if this new approach is not merely an incidental cameo, but a full-fledged cast member.ByJoel DruckerPublished Aug 18, 2025 copy_link

Published Aug 18, 2025

Adding a new page to its history as an innovator in everything from introducing the tiebreaker at the majors to making night tennis a full-fledged part of its programming mix, the US Open this year has taken a completely new approach to the mixed doubles event.PREVIEW: US Open mixed doubles field becomes battle royale in Flushing MeadowsFarewell, 32-team draw, largely filled with players who mostly make their living playing men's and women's doubles. Hello, 16-team draw, the lion's share of entrants a familiar singles competitor. Bid adieu also to two-out-of-three set matches. Enter two sets played with no-ad scoring, first team to four games. In lieu of a third set, there will be a ten-point tiebreaker. The US Open mixed doubles tournament will also take place only over two days, on Tuesday, August 19 and Wednesday, August 20, during what's called “Fan Week.”Yes, the team who wins this event will earn a major title. Nearly 50 percent of my mind is disturbed by the notion that two people competing in this format will join a pantheon of past US Open mixed champions that includes such Hall of Famers as the Bryan brothers, Martina Hingis, Leander Paes, Martina Navratilova, Mark Woodforde, Billie Jean King, Rosie Casals, Margaret Court, Frew McMillan, Jana Novotna, Helena Sukova, Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, and Owen Davidson. Might the US Open organizers instead have staged this as an exhibition? If certainly less credible, would an exhibition have been any less engaging?

Then again, in what I'll call the post-Bryan Brothers Era, what are we to make of professional doubles? To watch doubles these days can be enjoyable, particularly when a duo's thundering groundstrokes are accompanied by nimbleness in the front part of the court.But to know doubles, or at least try to know doubles, is an exercise in frustration or even futility. Its excellent athletes are highly interchangeable, skilled specialists who at most tournaments play two sets with no-ad scoring and finish with a ten-point tiebreaker. That's less tennis than I've usually played in USTA league matches. From there, a contemporary doubles player vanishes into the electronic ether of point races and rankings.Given that workload, might the doubles players use that significant quantity of off-hours to partner with their handlers and tour staff to better promote themselves? What about names on their shirts? Compelling web content? On-site clinics and autograph sessions? Instead, alas, sadly, or perhaps even opportunistically, most contemporary doubles players are hardly visible to fans who might greatly appreciate these skilled athletes if they had the chance to know who they were.

Call this year's experiment an intriguing debut of theoretically engaging duo acts. Over the next two to three years, tweaks and turnouts will help determine if the US Open's new approach to mixed doubles is not merely an incidental cameo, but a full-fledged cast member.

More bluntly, today's doubles players have ushered themselves into near anonymity. So instead, here we are, with the US Open figuring it's worth trying something completely different in the mixed, which after all is scarcely an overplayed discipline. Hence, the other half of my mind says, why not give it a shot?Back to 1970, when the US Open was the first major to deploy the tiebreaker, the tournament has a long history of innovation. This year marks the golden anniversary of two such moments. First came the shift from grass to clay, an intriguing three-year intermission between old school grass and contemporary hardcourts that ended when the tournament relocated to Flushing Meadows in 1978.The second innovation of 1975 was the start of night play. Even though the US Open was then played at the cozy West Side Tennis Club, from the start, those early flickers of nocturnal activity —mostly then, a few lively clay court matches – gave hope that night tennis indeed could bring a special kind of New York City energy to the tournament.Once Flushing Meadows and Louis Armstrong Stadium entered the picture, the die was cast, night tennis soon enough becoming a specific plot element in the way only New York can deliver. To a great degree, night tennis has become the tournament's main attraction. Mixed doubles? Call this year's experiment an intriguing debut of theoretically engaging duo acts.

The best of Valtteri Bottas' iconic onboard cameras 

12 times title dreams ended

What are the durations of the driver contracts currently in place up and down the grid? Here, we present them all in one simple list…

One of the hottest topics during every Formula 1 season is that of drivers' futures, with some close to their contract expiry date, some signed up for the short-term and others boasting longer deals. So, who will be driving where in 2026 and beyond as things stand?

Oscar Piastri: ‘Multi-year' deal

Having impressed greatly since his F1 debut in 2023, Piastri has been locked down by McLaren until at least the end of the 2027 season, and possibly longer. As with any contract, there are likely to be various options and clauses on both sides.

Lando Norris: ‘Multi-year' deal

Norris is contesting his seventh season in F1, and at McLaren specifically, with both the driver and team staying loyal to each other. His deal runs until at least the end of 2026, but is also understood to be longer with potential break clauses.

Charles Leclerc: ‘Multi-year' deal

Signed in early 2024, just before seven-time World Champion Lewis Hamilton was announced as his team mate from the start of the 2025 season, Leclerc's current deal is another unspecified multi-year arrangement featuring options that give both sides flexibility.

Lewis Hamilton: ‘Multi-year' deal

Hamilton's blockbuster switch from Mercedes to Ferrari was also communicated under a multi-year headline. There have been suggestions that the deal is for three years, running through 2027, which is the length of contract he pursued at the Silver Arrows.

Max Verstappen: 2028

Much has been said and written about Verstappen's future throughout 2025, given Red Bull's dip in form and an apparent clause in his contract, which runs until 2028, but the reigning four-time World Champion recently confirmed that he will stay put next season.

Yuki Tsunoda: 2025

Tsunoda started his fifth F1 season with Red Bull sister team Racing Bulls before being called up by the senior outfit two races in amid Liam Lawson's struggles. Tsunoda is experiencing his own challenges alongside Verstappen and faces a battle to keep his spot beyond 2025.

George Russell: 2025

Russell was drawn into the talk around Verstappen's future amid Mercedes boss Toto Wolff's open interest in the Dutchman. Russell's current deal runs out at the end of 2025, but the multiple Grand Prix winner is now set to continue at a team he has raced for since 2022.

Kimi Antonelli: 2025

Russell's rookie team mate, Antonelli, has experienced an up-and-down first season in the sport, but the Italian teenager – who showed his potential with a maiden pole position and podium – is also on course for an extension into 2026 and the new era of regulations.

Fernando Alonso: 2026

At 44, Alonso is the oldest driver on the F1 grid, but the two-time World Champion – who won those titles with Renault in the mid-noughties – will continue as an Aston Martin driver for at least another season via the multi-year deal he committed to in early 2024.

Lance Stroll: 2026

Stroll has filled a seat at his father Lawrence's team for several years, stretching back to 2019 and Aston Martin's previous Racing Point guise. With the Canadian's latest contract extension confirmed midway through 2024, he is likely to stay put while his dad is at the reins.

Pierre Gasly: ‘Multi-year' deal

Alpine has been Gasly's home since 2023, when the Frenchman cut his ties with the Red Bull family and embarked on a new chapter. He agreed a new multi-year deal last summer – one that is due to run until at least the end of the 2026 campaign.

Franco Colapinto: 2025 (race-by-race)

It is a more open situation when it comes to the seat alongside Gasly, which was originally occupied by Jack Doohan in 2025 before 2024 Williams super-sup Colapinto got drafted in. “The team decide if it's race-by-race or the whole season,” explained Alpine Executive Advisor Flavio Briatore at the time, with plans for 2026 yet to be shared.

Esteban Ocon: ‘Multi-year' deal

Haas brought in an all-new driver line-up for 2025, having parted ways with Kick Sauber-bound Nico Hulkenberg and Kevin Magnussen, who headed to sportscars. Forming half of that pairing is experienced Grand Prix winner Ocon on a multi-year agreement.

Ollie Bearman: ‘Multi-year' deal

Bearman announced himself to the F1 paddock with a spectacular stand-in performance for Ferrari at the 2024 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, one that went a long way to him earning a full-time spot at Ayao Komatsu's squad – again on undisclosed multi-year terms.

Isack Hadjar: 2025

Hadjar has impressed over the course of his rookie F1 season so far, bouncing back from a formation lap crash on his debut in Australia to show plenty of potential. His future beyond 2025 is in Red Bull's hands, with some already linking him to a senior team promotion.

Liam Lawson: 2025

As touched on above, Lawson began 2025 with a “dream” chance at Red Bull, but he was sent straight back to Racing Bulls after two tough weekends. He has since been rebuilding his reputation, seemingly with the goal of earning another season at the sister operation.

Alex Albon: ‘Multi-year' deal

A former Red Bull racer himself, Albon returned to F1 with Williams in 2022 and has since made the Grove-based outfit his home. Following James Vowles' arrival as team boss, the Thai-British racer signed a new deal in 2024 that is believed to run until at least the end of 2027.

Carlos Sainz: ‘Multi-year' deal

As well as keeping hold of Albon, Williams pulled off a coup when they won the race to sign Ferrari's proven Grand Prix winner Sainz. Making the switch for the 2025 season, after Hamilton took his seat at the Scuderia, the Spaniard is tied to Williams through at least 2026.

Nico Hulkenberg: ‘Multi-year' deal

Hulkenberg was an early mover in last year's driver market, signing for Kick Sauber – who will become Audi's works team from 2026 – shortly after the season had begun. He arrived in 2025 on a multi-year deal, with options that are believed to give him the chance to race for German automotive giants Audi into his 40s if the partnership works as planned.

Gabriel Bortoleto: ‘Multi-year' deal

Hulkenberg has been partnered at Kick Sauber by Brazilian youngster Bortoleto, a back-to-back winner of the F3 and F2 championships who is also part of Alonso's management stable. He is signed up to Sauber – and later Audi – through at least the 2026 season.

Cadillac will become F1's 11th team in 2026, arriving as an American-led entry but with a European headquarters near the UK's Silverstone Circuit. Neither of their two drivers have been revealed, but race winners Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez are being heavily linked.

The best of Valtteri Bottas' iconic onboard cameras 

12 times title dreams ended

George Russell's F1 future came under the spotlight over the first half of the 2025 season.

George Russell has spoken of there being “no rush” for himself and Mercedes to agree on a new deal, with the Briton's future beyond 2025 yet to be settled.

Mercedes have not formally confirmed Russell and team mate Kimi Antonelli's places at the squad for the 2026 season, though Silver Arrows boss Toto Wolff recently commented that he intends to retain the pair “as it stands”.

It comes after Wolff openly expressed his interest in reigning four-time World Champion Max Verstappen, who has since confirmed that he will continue with Red Bull into next year and the new era of F1 regulations.

Speaking just before the summer break at the Hungarian Grand Prix, Russell stated that there were “no updates” regarding his contractual situation with Mercedes, but he did say things were moving “in the right direction”.

“To be honest, now, with the time of the year that we're in, there's no time pressure from my side,” said Russell. “There's no major time pressure from the team.

“The truth is, we've been in contact a lot this week, but nothing about contracts or the future, because we need to get the car back on track.

“Of course, we're having conversations about the future. Things are going in the right direction, but it's not like we need to get this done right here and right now.

“We'll get things done when the time is right and not rush it, because it's an important thing.”

Russell was then asked if signing his next contract is a more complicated process than previous deals, as he looks to go from a race winner to a title challenger.

“For sure,” the 27-year-old replied. “I'm seven years into F1 right now. I feel that I'm at my peak, and I still feel that I'm getting stronger as a driver.

“I was maybe more anxious about getting a deal done maybe 12 months ago, then six months ago ahead of 2026. But right now, I've waited so long that I want to make sure that it's right.

“It's got to be right for the team, it's got to be right for myself, it's got to all make sense – the duration has to be right both ways. So, it's not as simple as just saying, ‘Are you happy with what you're being paid?' That's a very small factor of it.

“You've got to have faith in the performance in the future as well, because I would pay to be a World Champion, I would pay to fight for a World Championship, and that's where I am right now. That is the priority for me.”

Netflix offers more of a glimpse into the next episodes of the political thriller, which has added Bradley Whitford as the husband of Allison Janney's Grace Penn.


							By 

	Hilary Lewis


Deputy Editor, East Coast


Netflix continues to tease out the third season of its hit political drama The Diplomat, offering yet another video preview of the next installment as well as sharing the release date: Oct. 16.


	The new teaser for the upcoming episodes, though light on dialogue and extended scenes, features Keri Russell‘s Kate Wyler saying, “a terribly flawed woman is now the president, and only we know just how flawed.”




	The warning reminds viewers that the series' former vice president, Grace Penn (Allison Janney), who was on the verge of being elevated to president in the closing moments of season two after President Rayburn (Michael McKean) died, is behind the British warship attack that launched the series, something Kate and husband Hal (Rufus Sewell) learned during season two, with Grace explaining her rationale to Kate in a tense exchange in the season finale.

Speaking with The Hollywood Reporter about the end of season two and beginning of season three, Russell and Sewell previously said that Grace's elevation means that they have just made a “very powerful enemy.”


	The preview shows Grace being sworn in as president and the teaser and first-look images (below) offer a look at new castmember Bradley Whitford, who joins the series in season three as Grace's husband Todd. Much like his wife, he had been spoken about but not yet seen as viewers learned early in season one that he'd misplaced part of an NIH grant, creating a scandal that Rayburn's handlers believed meant Grace would have to step down and that they would need to recruit a new vice president, sizing up Kate for the role.

	











	After a shorter, six-episode second season, The Diplomat‘s third season will feature eight episodes, which Netflix describes as follows: “In season three of The Diplomat, Ambassador Kate Wyler lives the particular nightmare that is getting what you want. She just accused Vice President Grace Penn of hatching a terrorist plot and admitted she's after the VP's job. But now the president is dead, Kate's husband Hal may have inadvertently killed him, and Grace Penn is leader of the free world. None of this slows Hal's campaign to land Kate the vice presidency. Kate steps into a role she never wanted, with a freedom she never expected, an increasingly complicated friendship with Foreign Secretary Austin Dennison (David Gyasi), and an unnerving bond with first gentleman Todd Penn.”


	The teaser features a number of brief clips of Kate and Hal walking with purpose and Kate posing for a photo with British Prime Minister Nicol Trowbridge (Rory Kinnear) before it ends with Hal suggesting a scenario in which Kate can keep a close eye on Grace.


	“You will be in the White House watching what she does all the time,” he says.


	Sewell previously teased that things soon get complicated in season three.


	“The end of season two is one thing but very quickly even more extraordinary things happen,” he told THR before the season two premiere, as season three was already in production, last fall. “Allison Janney coming in, the dynamics of the story after what happens at the end of season two really gives us some extraordinary things. Also it changes dynamics that might have been in danger of playing out. And it's getting really complex.”

	











The Diplomat has already been renewed for a fourth season at Netflix.


	Debora Cahn, who created the show, serves as showrunner and executive producer alongside Russell, Janice Williams, Alex Graves, Peter Noah and Eli Attie.


	The cast includes Ali Ahn, Ato Essandoh, Celia Imrie, Nana Mensah and Miguel Sandoval.

Alison Wonderland more than met her match in Shaquille O'Neal, the DJ and retired basketball great who recently spent some time with the Australian EDM star. 


	Wonderland and Shaq, with his Bass Allstars, were in the house and on the stage Saturday, August 16th for the Aftershock event in Chandler, AZ.

	Away from the decks, the 7'1” former NBA MVP and four-times champion posed with Wonderland, who is two-feet shorter, and effortlessly lifted her for the cameras.


	“Dj who plays basketball, DJ with basketball in her belly = dj holding other djs belly like a basketball. It's simple math,” Wonderland wrote on her socials. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	It's shaping as a particularly special year for Wonderland. That “belly like a basketball” that she speaks of is Wonderland's second child. She's also readying the release of Ghost World, her fourth solo studio album, due out October 3rd via EMI Music Australia.


	“Not only are you getting a new album, you're getting a new sibling,” she writes in an earlier post. “Being able to create in so many ways is my ultimate happiness.”


	Wonderland is a superstar in her field. In 2018, she made history as the highest-billed female DJ in Coachella history, and cites among her career highlights her seven sold-out shows at Red Rocks Amphitheater. She has also headlined Lollapalooza's Perry's Stage, and performed at Tomorrowland, Electric Daisy Carnival, Ultra, Bonnaroo, Austin City Limits, and Life Is Beautiful. Her second album, from 2018, Awake, cracked the Billboard 200 at No. 88.

	











	Career streams top 1.1 billion, and Wonderland has shifted more than 800,000 headline ticket sales across her U.S. tours alone.


	The new collection was co-written and co-produced by Alison and Dylan Ragland (Party Favor, SIDEPIECE) and mastered by Dale Becker (Billie Eilish, SZA, Omar Apollo, Doja Cat), and houses the previously-released singles “Get Started,” “Again? F—.”,  and “iwannaliveinadream.”

Executive Editor, Television


EXCLUSIVE: The Bachelor has a habit of bringing back talent across its franchise – a process that is now also happening on the production side.


Jason Ehrlich, who spent over 20 years on the hit reality franchise before leaving last year, is returning as a consulting producer.


	Deadline understands Ehrlich is working on the upcoming season of The Golden Bachelor, which is set to return to ABC on September 24.


	It marks a full circle for Ehrlich, who left the Warner Bros. Television-produced franchise after exec producing the first season of The Golden Bachelor, which culminated in Theresa Nist marrying Gerry Turner in January 2024 (albeit getting divorced three months later).

	











	But Ehrlich's departure was part of a much bigger story in Bachelor Nation.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Ehrlich, who started working on the show in 2004, was promoted to run the franchise, alongside Claire Freeland and Bennett Graebner in March 2023. However, this troika didn't last long with Ehrlich leaving less than a year later. 


	Deadline revealed earlier this year that a dozen current and former crew members claimed that Freeland and Graebner ran a “toxic” and “hostile” environment.


	Ehrlich was not accused of any of this behavior. Since he left The Bachelor franchise, he has been exec producing Alex Cooper's Hulu dating series Love Overboard.


	Three weeks after Deadline's reporting, we revealed that Freeland and Graebner exited the franchise.


	Subsequently, in May, Deadline revealed that Jessica Castro was named showrunner of season two of The Golden Bachelor, which stars NFL veteran-turned-lawyer Mel Owens (who has already caused some controversy before the show airs).

	











	It's been a busy period for those in charge of the show. Earlier this summer, Scott Teti, who was initially brought in as showrunner and executive producer of Bachelor in Paradise, was also named showrunner of flagship show The Bachelor after it was renewed for Season 30 by ABC.

	This is the second time Netflix has extended a successful original movie franchise into a TV series. It's To All the Boys I've Loved Before film trilogy spawned a hit comedy series, XO, Kitty, which was recently renewed for a third season. In the opposite direction, the streamer has a Peaky Blinders movie coming up based on the popular TV series.


	The 2020 action thriller Extraction, directed by Sam Hargrave, was based on the graphic novel Ciudad by Ande Parks, with art by Fernando León González, and co-written by Joe and Anthony Russo. Chris Hemsworth stars as an Australian black ops mercenary who takes on a mission to save an Indian drug lord's kidnapped son in Dhaka, Bangladesh, but the mission goes awry when he is double-crossed.


	A sequel, Extraction 2, was released in 2023, with the main cast returning. The movie brings back Hemsworth's Rake, who is tasked with a new mission — rescuing the battered family of a ruthless Georgian gangster from the prison where they are being held.


	AGBO produced both films.

	











	In addition to the Russo brothers and Mazzara, executive producers include Angela Russo-Otstot, Scott Nemes, and Chris Castaldi for AGBO, Sam Hargrave, Eric Gitter, and Peter Schwerin, Netflix & AGBO: A Proven Partnership. Ari Costa produces for AGBO.


	Dormer is repped by 111 Media, United Agents, UTA, and Jackoway Austen Tyerman.

					By Matt Grobar 

Senior Film Reporter


Kevin Costner and Jake Gyllenhaal have signed on to star in Honeymoon with Harry, a dramedy for Amazon MGM Studios based on the book by Bart Baker, the studio announced on Monday. 


	The film follows a man (Gyllenhaal) as he decides to go on a honeymoon with his would-be father-in-law (Costner) after his fiancée dies two days before their wedding. Glenn Ficarra and John Requa will direct the film from a script by Dan Fogelman, with whom they've worked on shows like Paradise and This Is Us, as well as the film Crazy, Stupid, Love.


	Producers include Fogelman, Mike Karz via Gulfstream Pictures, and Jennifer Salke via her newly launched Sullivan Street Productions banner. The project marks the latter's first project with Amazon MGM since stepping down as head of the studio earlier this year and her producing debut. Salke reunites with Fogelman here after championing his hit family drama This Is Us during her pre-Amazon MGM days as President of NBC Entertainment.

Awards Columnist/Chief Film Critic


	Apple TV+'s The Studio has already made history with its 23 Emmy nominations being the most ever for a debut season of a comedy series, and tied for the most ever in a single season of any comedy series. A lot of that credit should go directly to the actors, since fully 10 of those nominations are in the acting categories including no less that five out of six in the Guest Actor Comedy Series category.


	So, with that kind of support from their fellow actors, it is only natural that even on the eve of final Emmy voting beginning, six actors from The Studio gathered at the new Meryl Streep Theatre at SAG-AFTRA headquarters in L.A.'s Wilshire district to join me for a rollicking Apple TV+ x Deadline: ‘The Studio' Q&A  in front of a packed audience of about 100 SAG TV Nominating Committee members (the total overall that makes nominations are 2,500 randomly chosen SAG-AFTRA members).

					'The Studio's Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg And Cast Reveal An ""Explosive"" Season 2 Plan And The Truth Behind The Comedy		
			








	Watch out conversation here, and scroll down for photos from the event.


	The series debuted after eligibility for the 2025 SAG, Golden Globes and Critics Choice ceremonies, so come 2026 it will be the first time around for the series at those shows (post-Emmys), where Apple TV+ is hoping it sets more records.


	The event Saturday was presented by Apple TV+ in association with Deadline and featured star/co-creator/writer/director/and executive producer Seth Rogen, who plays studio head Matt Remick and who has personally received four nominations including Lead Actor in a Comedy Series; Kathryn Hahn, who plays marketing head Maya Mason and is nominated for Supporting Actress Comedy; Chase Sui Wonders as studio exec Quinn Hackett; Bryan Cranston up for Guest Actor as Chairman Griffin Mill and Remick's boss; Keyla Monterroso Mejia as assistant Petra; and Dewayne Perkins as another studio employee, Tyler. I pointed out it is a shame the Emmys don't have an ensemble category like SAG does because this entire cast is worthy of recognition.


	As for all the Emmy glory, Rogen said he was surprised. “It's great. I was not expecting it at all. I never expect any awards attention in any way, shape or form. But not shockingly, Hollywood's somewhat of an ego-driven industry. And so, you know, people with egos like when you talk about them. And maybe that's not lost on me,” he said. “But honestly, I was actually very worried that people within the industry would feel as though we weren't representing it properly or that our sentiments towards it would be vastly different than their sentiments. I was actually quite aware that a lot of people in the industry would watch the show, and or at least check it out.”

	











	As for the inspiration for the show and where they get their ideas, it was right in front of them, Rogen says. “I'd say it's entirely based on our experiences or on people we met with, pretty much all the heads of every studio, while we were writing the show, and we're continuing to meet with them as we write the second season on the show,” he admitted. “It's funny, now they just give us notes on the first season of the show, because they are studio heads, they're incapable of not giving notes. But yeah, we really tried to mine our resources as far as stories go. And a lot of it is stuff that me and Evan (Goldberg), my creative partner, have personally experienced.”

	Hahn, whose physical look for the show is hilarious and calls it her “armor” as a marketer, says there wasn't one person in Hollywood she has based her character on, though she gets plenty of people guessing who it is anyway. “So I wouldn't say anyone specific, but I certainly also have gotten phone calls or texts from people asking me if it was them,” she laughed.


	Wonders plays a young exec who drives a Mini Cooper and is battling another exec Sal Saperstein for a personal parking spot in one episode, something she says clearly hits close to home in the culture of a movie studio. “I mean, every lot has these named parking spaces that in this exclusive-like titular thing of ‘This is reserved for XYZ',” she said. “And it's funny, I went into a meeting the other day on a lot, and I met with a junior exec and she's like, ‘I drive a Mini Cooper. Is this based on me?' And I so I've kind of started to indulge everybody and just feel like, ‘Yeah, it is'.”


	Cranston, whose character in the two-part season-finale gets accidentally stoned out of his mind, found the wild comic situations refreshing to do. “It's so good. Seth and Evan create an environment where they say, ‘just go and play',” he said. “So there's like the 14th take of these scenes outside where I'm on the fountain in Vegas with Aphrodite or whoever it is. And I just wanted to make the writers laugh or watching. So I'm orally copulating the statue and I mean, I am just thinking this is never going to be in and they're going to choose something else.” (Spoiler alert: they put it in).


	“So every time we did a scene, collectively or individually, it was like, yeah, let's get these plot points in. We need to say this or do that. And then, you know, whatever you have, bring something, say something, do something, whatever you like. That kind of freedom then stimulates us because it is warranted and welcomed.”


	Cranston as studio kingpin Griffin Mill (he suggested they make him 82 years old) is one of five nominated for Guest Actor in a Comedy Series and is considered the frontrunner in the category for a character that really shows his go-for-broke comic chops. But consider the names competing against him from their cameos on the show: Martin Scorsese, Dave Franco, Anthony Mackie and Ron Howard — who are all playing themselves. In fact, though he has been nominated 14 times for Emmys as a producer or director and won three statuettes, this represents the first time that Howard has received an Emmy acting nomination in a career that started in front of the cameras as a child actor in the late '50s.


	“I saw something in the guy. You know, it was, ‘Give the kid a break',” Rogen laughs. “He's been acting since his credited name was Little Ronny Howard. Like he had the weird ‘little' in his name. Now you have to be a SoundCloud rapper to have that in your name. I think he was an embryo. So it took that big fight scene, to finally, unleash the rage.”

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


EXCLUSIVE: Here's another big deal that the new David Ellison-led Paramount is working on: Legendary is in talks for a new multi-picture global theatrical distribution deal (sans China) with the Melrose Ave lot.


	Terms are still being worked out on the pact, which has been in the works at many levels for a while since the spring. Paramount is expected to have a streaming window with a transactional window built in with Legendary. I hear that as far as the Legendary-Paramount slate goes, co-financing is up for discussion, contingent on projects at hand. What titles will be released is still TBD. Paramount Motion Picture heads Josh Greenstein and Dana Goldberg have a plan to increase the annual output of features to 15 a year. The plan is to eventually ultimately increase to 20 films a year.

	











	Legendary currently doesn't have an exclusive theatrical deal with any major studio per se, however, its Monsterverse and Dune franchises remain parked at Warner Bros, as well as the Ryan Reynolds-Jason Momoa live-action animation hybrid movie Animal Friends, which is set for release on May 1, 2026. Also, let's not forget that Warners and Legendary both lay claim to this year's massive success A Minecraft Movie, which made more than $955 million worldwide; that movie is the second highest-grossing MPA title YTD after Disney's $1 billion-grossing Lilo & Stitch. There's also the Alejandro G. Iñárritu-Tom Cruise movie at Warner Bros. Legendary's business with Warner Bros continues even with this new Paramount deal, and sources say there will be more features announced between the two.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Legendary had a theatrical output deal with Sony that ended in December. Its run at Warners was much better box office-wise than Sony, where they had The Book of Clarence ($6M gross off a $40M production cost) and The Machine ($11M off a $20M production cost). Legendary's deal was a global pact that had the Culver City, CA studio marketing and releasing its slate sans China, where Legendary East handled all marketing and distribution on its movies.


	It's no irony that Ellison's new chief of comms Melissa Zukerman has a long history with Legendary's Joshua Grode and production boss Mary Parent; Zukerman repped the production finance company when she was at Principal Communications.


	Paramount declined comment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Devo documentary whips the oddball band into shape","https://www.avclub.com/devo-review","Mon, 18 Aug 2025 15:00:00 GMT","

Sorta new wave, sorta post-punk, sorta art-rock, Devo is the sort of band one can relish in fits and starts. Best known for its 1980 hit “Whip It,” the group's only single to land on Billboard‘s Top 40, the Akron, Ohio collective never made an all-timer album, but check out any compilation of Devo's best-known songs and you'll be tickled all over again by the sleek hooks, arch lyrics, and endless sense of play. From the angular guitars and sci-fi vibes of early classic “Jocko Homo” to 1990's dance-y, ironic “Post Post-Modern Man,” Devo specializes in brainy, off-kilter tunes that make you feel cool for digging them. If not necessarily an essential band, they are certainly one of the defining groups of their era—in other words, the ideal candidate for an appealing, modestly-sized documentary that puts their mad experiments and subversive underpinnings in context.

That documentary is Chris Smith's Devo, a breezy overview that never overstates the group's greatness but may convince the skeptical that they've long underrated these proudly peculiar musicians. Built primarily around separate conversations with Devo leaders Mark Mothersbaugh and Gerald Casale, the documentary lacks the inventiveness of some of Smith's celebrity portraits. But the deceptively straightforward package actually benefits a band that enjoys coloring outside the lines. Devo allows Devo the space to be its idiosyncratic self, both in the present-day interviews and the wealth of archival footage. Devo's reign may have been relatively short, but Smith gives the band the fond memorializing it deserves. 

Befriending one another at Kent State in the late 1960s, and profoundly affected by the 1970 killing of four classmates by Ohio National Guardsmen during campus protests, Mothersbaugh and Casale bonded over a shared love of ideas and art, only gradually embracing the notion of starting a band. As Devo explains, they gravitated to the theory of de-evolution—the belief that human society would eventually fall apart, as opposed to constantly progressing forward—which jibed with the collapsing America they saw around them amidst the Vietnam War. 

After initially messing around with abrasive avant-garde approaches—dabbling in tuneless songs that went on forever, intentionally annoying their early crowds—Mothersbaugh and Casale hit upon a tighter, focused sound, releasing their first albums in the late 1970s, which mixed arresting originals like “Uncontrollable Urge” with postmodern remakes, such as “(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction,” turning the Stones' favorite into a hip, post-punk heater. If you didn't know better, you'd swear Devo, who flaunted consciously robotic movements on stage, was stripping “Satisfaction” down to its basic sonic components, as if a computer was trying to simulate Mick Jagger's swagger.

During their original run, Devo consisted of Mothersbaugh and Casale, the band's principal songwriters, alongside drummer Alan Myers, guitarist Bob Mothersbaugh, and guitarist/keyboardist Bob Casale—the younger brothers, respectively, of Mark and Gerald. Devo contains the types of stories usually told in rock docs—the label and the general population didn't get the band at first, but eventually something clicked—but Smith is refreshingly lowkey in his approach to a familiar music narrative. Undoubtedly, he takes his cue from Mothersbaugh and Casale, who are nonchalant about Devo's ambitions and achievements. 

Not that these guys didn't put a lot of thought into their work, often lambasting herd mentality and mindless masculinity in their lyrics. But Devo exudes a slyness appropriate for a group that seemed to enjoy perplexing the record-buying public. (One of the documentary's constant highlights is watching old clips in which journalists and television hosts are baffled by Devo's not-of-this-Earth responses to their inane questions.) Individually, Mothersbaugh and Casale possess a biting sense of humor during the present-day interviews that belies their unpretentious Midwestern demeanor. Devo regularly presented its members as aliens or androids, but one comes away from the documentary appreciating the sardonic flesh-and-blood humans behind the conceit.

Smith, probably still best known for his 1999 documentary American Movie, which chronicled woefully untalented independent filmmaker Mark Borchardt as he shot his horror opus Coven, has gone on to profile far more famous artists, but rarely from the perspective you might be expecting. His 2017 portrait of Jim Carrey, Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond, starts as a look at the making of Man On The Moon before it transforms into a meditation on art, stardom and self-indulgence. In 2023, he directed Wham!, which is really about Andrew Ridgeley's relationship with his old band and his late friend George Michael, who left him behind to pursue solo glory. 

There's no such deconstruction going on in Devo, but what connects it to Smith's earlier work is a continuing fascination with the convergence of creativity and mass entertainment. The tension Carrey felt pursuing his uncompromising vision in Man On The Moon—going to extremes to stay in character as Andy Kaufman, aggravating his costars and director in the process—isn't reflected as strongly in Devo's comments about producing challenging music that, occasionally, became popular. (Although, it's notable that these guys have mixed feelings about the success of “Whip It,” primarily because their interpretation of the song and its iconic video are not other people's.)

Still, from the beginning, Mothersbaugh and Casale sought to confront the complacency of modern life, detesting the bland homogeneity and uninquisitive contentment of American suburban culture. Devo's finest songs remain witty middle fingers, especially an angry anthem like 1980's “Freedom Of Choice,” whose barbed, consistently misheard chorus—”Freedom of choice / Is what you got / Freedom from choice / Is what you want”—still says everything about a nation too willing to cede its freedoms for a false sense of security. The band's battles with the suits and the squares are engaging, but what stands out in Devo is these guys' lifetime commitment to ideas and art, the same organizing principles that inspired Mothersbaugh and Casale back in their college days. 

Band members have left or died over the years, and the group's leaders are now more engaged in other creative pursuits. Like Devo itself, Devo won't change the world. But it will make you glad such brilliant weirdos decided to spend a few years screwing with the mainstream.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","MSNBC is getting a corny new name in NBC divorce","https://www.avclub.com/msnbc-name-change-ms-now","Mon, 18 Aug 2025 15:46:00 GMT","

As Comcast moves forward with the divorce of cable channels from the rest of its broadcast operations, MSNBC is reinventing itself. The prominent cable news network, which will continue on under the spun-off company “Versant,” is dropping “NBC” from its name in order to distance itself from its former parent corporation and from NBC News. Instead, the network will heretofore be known as “MS NOW.” 

Gosh, we haven't had a clunky name-change thrill like this since “HBO Max.” And it gets even better: The network's full, given name is “My Source News Opinion World,” MS NOW for short. MSNBC originally got its name from a joint venture between Microsoft—which operated MSN—and NBC, retaining the moniker even after NBC parted ways with Microsoft. Now that neither Microsoft nor NBC will be involved, NBCUniversal “decided that our brand requires a new, separate identity,” Rebecca Kutler, MSNBC's president, said in a memo to staff on Monday (via Deadline). “This decision now allows us to set our own course and assert our independence as we continue to build our own modern newsgathering operation.”

Somehow, the network's best attempt at retaining some brand recognition while also building a “new, separate identity” is “My Source News Opinion World.” MS NOW isn't so bad; it sounds like it could've been the name of an MSNBC spin-off app that became defunct after six months. CNBC is also moving over to Versant, but it will get to keep its name, which has always stood for “Consumer News and Business Channel.” But any of the Versant channels (like MSNBC and CNBC) that used the rainbow peacock branding will have to get new logos for the new era (per The New York Times).

Kutler said the decision to change MSNBC's name was not made “quickly or without significant debate.” She wrote, “The future of our success is not tied to remaining within the NBC family and using the peacock as part of our identity. While our name will be changing, who we are and what we do will not. Our commitment to our work and our audiences will not waiver from what the brand promise has been for three decades.”

Kate Wyler is back for another round of high-intensity diplomacy on Netflix's The Diplomat. Starring Keri Russell, the series sees a career U.S. diplomat thrust into the role of ambassador to the U.K., as Russell's Kate Wyler struggles to keep her frequently on-the-rocks marriage to Hal (Rufus Sewell) from interfering with her work. Returning after season two's finale, which saw “a terribly flawed woman” become president, the series continues to look like a product of another time, where politicians had shame and faced consequences for their actions. A flawed president in this economy? Yeah, Netflix is going there.

﻿

Though with Allison Janney's flawed woman ascendant, the show may build its political fantasy around our reality. Or, as our writer Saloni Gajjar said of season two, it'll be back for more pulpy thrills this time around. In season three, the new president has dire consequences for life on both sides of the aisle and both sides of the pond, splitting the difference between West Wing professionalism and Homeland-inspired plot machinations. Speaking of which, the series stars West Wing alumni Janney and Bradley Whitford and was created by West Wing and Homeland writer Debora Cahn.

Will Kate Wyler win the day and save democracy? Find out when The Diplomat returns on October 16.

Peaky Blinders fans, assemble: Steven Knight's next series is coming September 26 on Netflix. In between premiering his Hulu series and writing the new James Bond movie, Knight will launch House Of Guinness. It's another juicy period piece about another family business, this one at least slightly more legitimate than what the Shelbys had going on. 

According to a synopsis from the streamer, “House Of Guinness explores an epic story inspired by one of Europe's most famous and enduring dynasties— the Guinness Family. Set in 19th-century Dublin and New York, the story begins immediately after the death of Sir Benjamin Guinness, the man responsible for the extraordinary success of the Guinness brewery, and the far-reaching impact of his will on the fate of his four adult children, Arthur (Anthony Boyle), Edward (Louis Partridge), Anne (Emily Fairn), and Ben (Fionn O'Shea), as well as on a group of Dublin characters who work and interact with the phenomenon that is Guinness.”

The House Of Guinness cast also includes James Norton (Happy Valley) as play Sean Rafferty; Dervla Kirwan (True Detective: Night Country) as Aunt Agnes Guinness; Jack Gleeson (Game Of Thrones) as Byron Hedges; Niamh McCormack (Everything Now) as Ellen Cochrane; Danielle Galligan (Shadow And Bone) as Lady Olivia Hedges; Ann Skelly (The Sandman) as Adelaide Guinness; Seamus O'Hara (Blue Lights) as Patrick Cochrane; Michael McElhatton (Game Of Thrones) as John Potter; David Wilmot (Station Eleven) as Bonnie Champion; Michael Colgan (Say Nothing) as Rev. Henry Gratton; Jessica Reynolds (Kneecap) as Lady Christine O'Madden; Hilda Fay (The Woman In The Wall) as Sultan; and Elizabeth Daulau (Andor) as Lady Henrietta St Lawrence. 

In a statement (via TV Line) when the show was announced, Knight said, “The Guinness dynasty is known the world over—wealth, poverty, power, influence, and great tragedy are all intertwined to create a rich tapestry of material to draw from. I've always been fascinated by their stories and am excited to bring the characters to life for the world to see.” You can check out the first look photos below.

 For the past 25 years, the best political satire in America hasn't been found in newspapers, or in comedy clubs, or on movie screens or live theater stages. Its home has been Comedy Central‘s “The Daily Show,” which premiered in 1996 and, under the leadership of host Jon Stewart in the early 2000s, became an astonishingly perceptive, enlightening, and (most importantly) hilarious forum for processing the daily news.

The program has gone through several iterations over the years, including a nine-year period during which Stewart left the show and was replaced first by Trevor Noah and then a series of guest hosts. Stewart came back at the beginning of 2024 under the condition that he would only host Mondays, with the rest of the week anchored by a different host from a rotating bench of senior correspondents that includes Ronny Chieng, Jordan Klepper, Michael Kosta, and Desi Lydic (Josh Johnson was promoted to the lineup just a few weeks ago).

The result has been the most consistently smart and funny year-and-a-half in the history of “The Daily Show” as well as the most honored, with a dozen Emmy nominations this year. Stewart's guiding principles for the show remain in place, but the perspective has been broadened and deepened by the addition of new hosts. Without losing any of its wit, “The Daily Show” has sneakily become a source not only for comedy but catharsis, as the empathetic, razor-sharp ensemble finds ways every single night of making sense out of some of the most senseless, horrifying, and sometimes merely stupefying events most of us have encountered in our lifetimes.

 










IndieWire sat down for a roundtable discussion with Chieng, Klepper, Kosta, and Lydic to discuss their approach to blending comedy and information, how they respond to the speed of the Trump-era news cycle, and their feelings about the state of late night comedy in the wake of Stephen Colbert (a former “Daily Show” correspondent himself) getting cancelled by CBS. 

This following conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity and length.

IndieWire: One of the things that amazes me about “The Daily Show” is that every episode is a finely crafted jewel of satire — yet by its very nature you must come into the office every morning with no idea of what you're going to be covering that night. How do you create each episode on such a tight turnaround?

Jordan Klepper:  There is a rigorous system in place to get us moving and moving fast. We've had chaotic times in the last couple of years where Trevor stepped down, we had guest hosts, we had a pandemic, we had a strike, we had all sorts of things. There's been a lot of change, which meant the show had to figure out its structure and the ways in which it worked best so that you could have somebody come in and hit the ground running. And I feel like with the Trump news cycle and how everything changes so quickly, the structure has been solidified and evolved to a place that's really effective right now. 

 










Starting a day, I get up with some ideas. I'm watching the news and reading the news, and I have a general sense of what the world is talking about. But as soon as you arrive, there's a meeting with Justin Melkmann and a few of the other producers just to get a sense of the news they've collected, so there are the five or six stories you have in your head and you immediately get 30 other stories thrown at you. We have a quick conversation and pick a handful from that, then we watch clips and get a better sense of not only here's what's happening, but here's what's interesting, here's what's funny.

Ronny Chieng:  These are processes which have been developed over 25 years of making a show, and they've been refined constantly to the point where even lunchtime is optimized for comedy writing. “The Daily Show” developed its own language for joke writing. Everyone has shorthand for what we need to insert at any given time.

Desi Lydic:  The team is so incredible in terms of gathering all of the stories and the footage, so you're armed with everything that you could possibly want to talk about. We have a studio production team that's watching stuff throughout the weekend, leading up to the week. And then you have the digital expansion team that's also doing the same thing. If there's something that Trump continues to talk about, like water pressure or something, if studio production doesn't have it, the digital team has it. It's a testament to the machine and how everyone is so accustomed to collaborating and working with each other.

 










Michael Kosta: When I host,  I remind the audience every day that we showed up that morning with a blinking cursor on a blank computer screen. That's the magic of late night. It was written today. It happened today. We don't go to some writing retreat for seven months and come up with the show. The machine is so calibrated that when you are the host, if you step out for 10 minutes and take a call, it fucks up the machine. If I'm not on time to my morning meeting, we're rushing all day until 5:00 p.m. So you do have to be very aware of that machine. It's important that it's moving correctly.

Jordan alluded to the speed with which the Trump news cycle moves. How often do you have a show prepared and then have to pivot at the last minute because of some piece of late-breaking news?

Lydic:  I would say it happens at least once a week, and it happens often enough so that the machine has evolved to accommodate for it. We'll try to get down to rehearsal a little quicker knowing that there's a high likelihood that some story is going to drop right after rehearsal, and we're going to have to do a page one rewrite starting at 4:30 for a 6:00 taping. It happened the last time Trump was in office, but it's definitely happening a lot more often now.

 










Kosta:  You can't be as precious with the words when you're coming up with things a lot quicker, but I think it's really fun. When we do a quick change of the whole first act, it reminds me of when we do our live shows, which we do after presidential debates and midterms. Those live shows have a different energy and a different intensity. If a light falls and hits us in the head, that's going to be on the show that night.

Klepper:  The rotating host thing also allows us some freedom in our narrative structures. A lot of times Jon comes in on Monday and gives an overarching editorial take on what's happened over the last week or the last couple days, which opens up our Tuesday response and gives us more flexibility in responding to Trump news that breaks. It also gives you space to create something that is more of a narrative arc later in the week that allows you to take a break from that news and see something else that's going on. The news is constantly changing and you can never catch up to it, and I think everybody has to figure out a way in which they can adapt and improvise. But we have built into our structure variations that allow us to bring in that inspiration and play with something that maybe another host wouldn't. It gives you the freedom to find something new, and that's been really exciting in this past year.

 










What about the interview portion of the show? I'm guessing that for many of you the interview aspect was new, what was the learning curve like for that final section of each episode?

Lydic:  I did not have experience doing that before other than going out into the field and interviewing in character, which is a whole other thing. I think when you do that you're looking for tension, and you're provoking and you're living in the awkward silences. That can be really fun comedically, but when someone comes into the studio you generally want to be a little more welcoming and supportive. We all got advice from Jon on that, and his very simple advice was that you have to find something that you're interested in about your guest. You have to find something that you're curious about. I've found that the more research I can do, the more I can become a fan of something, then the better it'll go and the more comfortable they'll feel.

Kosta:  I would say the interview is the part that makes me feel the most nervous. I want to make sure our guest gets promoted and the audience really understands what it is that they've done. Some of these people that come on have done tremendous things like climbed Mount Everest or passed gun legislation, really difficult things that need to be promoted and shared. I want to make sure they're welcomed and celebrated.

 










Chieng: I feel like I'm still learning how to do it. Every wannabe amateur dumbass podcast out there is essentially doing an interview show, so what are you bringing that's different? We're doing a six- or seven-minute interview, so we have to summarize why we're talking to this person. We have to get jokes in there, but he have to showcase them so that if they're saying something important, people will read their book or watch their documentary. It's a difficult skill to be entertaining and get enough out of the guests for people to want to continue the conversation, because we can't possibly cover all their expertise in the segment.

What about the interviews you do out in the field for comedy bits? For example, Jordan, you go deep into MAGA country and strike a really interesting balance of poking fun at people's contradictions and absurdities without actually looking down at them. It's an unbelievably tricky thing to pull off.

Klepper:  I do find a lot of humor and hypocrisy out there, but I am genuinely curious and I have built up relationships with a lot of people I've seen on the road. I go back to Trump rallies and say hi to people I've talked to. I've been invited to officiate weddings of MAGA people I've interviewed. So I am a part of this world. Again, I go out there looking for hypocrisy, looking for humor, but the thing I get to do that traditional journalism doesn't is I get to wear my bias on my sleeve, and I also get to repeat my question over and over and over again. 

 










I come from improv, and the whole purpose of improv is start from nothing. Listen to somebody and build off of what they're saying. Create something, create a space where people want to share so you can build something more. And that's the same philosophy out in the field. The most interesting moments are not making a joke about something somebody says. The most interesting moments are where you give them the space to say that thing that is contradictory to the thing they said just a few minutes ago. And it also happens to be the thing that they tell their buddies at the bar, but they won't tell CNN. So our job is to go out there and create a space that feels different than CNN, that feels like they're not fighting and trying to win but that they're trying to communicate something to their buddy at the bar.

That leads to a broader question for all of you, which is how much you find your own beliefs and positions challenged or broadened by the work you do on the show.

Kosta:  Every time I come back from a field piece, I'm a different person. They convince me half the time. I remember I met with this water dowser, this old man who had these antennas and he walked around and he would find wells of water. And I'd say, “How are you finding the wells?” And he would say, “I'm feeling for the vibrations underneath the ground.” Then we met with a scientific geologist who finds water for a living. And I said, “How do you find it?” He goes, “We feel for vibrations in the ground.” I'm like, “That's the same shit as that guy!” Then that opened my mind like, is this dowser shit real? So all I can say is I am malleable. I'm open-minded, and lots of times I come home hardened and lots of times I come home and my mind's a little more open.

 










Lydic:  I think my perspective has definitely shifted in terms of what I think we can mine comedy from. I think that the news has become increasingly more frightening and overwhelming and anxiety inducing, and this show has forced me to find the humor in all of it. There are so many days when I read a story and head into a week of work and think, I don't know how we're going to make this funny. And somehow there is some hypocrisy exposed or some politician or legislator that does something that we can laugh about. Somehow there's a take that I find or the room finds and we figure out a way, because we have to, it's our job. So it's been really great for me in terms of trusting that we can find the humor and the joy and the catharsis somewhere along the way, even when it feels really hopeless.

Sorry, I just treated this like a therapy session.

Chieng:  When Jon Stewart came back, he told everybody, “Our allegiance is to the comedy. We're not trying to get anyone elected or not elected. We're just here to do comedy and make fun of the hypocrisy.” That was a very clarifying thing for me, and I think that's when the show is at its best — when it's making fun of institutions and hypocrisy on either side. I guess everyone assumes the show has a certain point of view, but I'm willing to bet money that whatever people think our point of view is is actually wrong. It's always fun when we are able to make jokes on both sides that people don't expect, because a lot of comedy comes from doing the unexpected.

 










Have my views shifted? I'm not sure if my political view has shifted, but my view towards comedy has definitely evolved to be more fearless and to have less of an allegiance to any one side. Which, by the way, makes it more impactful when we do go after people. Because they know that we're not doing this because we're biased. We're doing this because this is literally insane. Objectively, this is insane. You can have your political bias, but what is happening right here over my shoulder is objectively stupid and insane.

Klepper:  Times are dark. They're different than they were four years ago. They're different than they were two years ago. And we're constantly dealing with images of ICE deportations and what's happening in the Middle East, mixed with the chaos and the dumbfuckery of a Donald Trump press conference. So it is a fascinating conversation each morning: what do we think we can comment on and should comment on and where is it the right place for us to add humor? We're constantly in a conversation not only with ourselves, but also with the audience that we perform this in front of. They are scared, they are in need of laughter, they're in need of community, they're in need of being challenged. And so when we get these stories, we have to calibrate the things that we're showing, the ways in which we're talking them, and the amount of time, because we want to keep that trust with an audience.

 










Speaking of scary times, a few weeks ago the entire landscape of late night lost a major component when Stephen Colbert's show was canceled. How do you see the future of late night comedy? Are you optimistic? Pessimistic?

Klepper:  I grew up as such a big fan of Colbert. He's part of our family here at “The Daily Show,” and the idea of that show ending is heartbreaking. We're all super big fans of that show, we're all huge fans of late night, the genre. It's been such a part of my life being a fan of it and a purveyor of it as well. I will say this: I talk to people. “The Daily Show” has grown and expanded and we're getting more viewers than in the last decade. We're not just doing a late night show, we're also doing specials. We're also doing side series. We also do field pieces. In many ways, more people are engaging with “The Daily Show” than ever have before, and the show itself has figured out ways to connect with people beyond just the 30 minutes that it's on television. It connects in all these other ways, and frankly, I think it's more important to do that now in this chaotic time where people want to look to a source who can have a conversation with them in real time. I think “The Daily Show” has been doing that for 30 years.

Lydic:  Yeah, I think the thing that gives me hope is knowing that “The Daily Show” has been around for almost 30 years and has been through a number of historical changes, cultural changes, a pandemic, strikes, host changes, presidencies, elections, and so far we've been able to maintain our point of view and our service to comedy and I sure hope that we get to continue to do that. I'm hopeful that we will one way or another.

 










Chieng:  I think that it's a very American form, late night. Late night is woven into the American aesthetic. And so there are traditional reasons, there are cultural reasons, to keep it going. If America — where we have the craziest politics, the most money in entertainment, the most talented comedy writers — if America can't do political satire, no one can. This is the only country that has the most freedom of speech combined with the most insane politics and the best comedy talent. I have a lot of faith in the quality of American comedy right now.

“The Daily Show” airs weeknights on Comedy Central and streams on Paramount+.

7.6

Genre:

Rock

Label:

Epitaph

Reviewed:

August 18, 2025

On Pool Kids' self-titled 2022 album, the Tallahassee quartet juxtaposed its love of math rock, '00s pop-punk, and post-hardcore with genuinely funny musings about group chats and performative narcissists. The result was slick enough for an opening slot with indie-pop trio Beach Bunny but raw enough for a tour with post-hardcore group La Dispute. So where to next? The band naturally put pressure on itself to recreate the exuberant, hooky energy of its breakthrough, reuniting with producer Mike Vernon Davis and spending a grueling five weeks recording and re-arranging songs.

The result, Easier Said Than Done, offers clear evidence of this lengthy process: while not as pristine as the self-titled, their debut record for Epitaph is much denser, often overwhelming. For the album's 11 tracks, we are trapped inside Goodwyne's head as she navigates the grief of touring and the ghosts of old friendships. This is an album that fears a vacuum—one where every second is crammed with heavily processed vocal overdubs and synths. It's not the first time the band has experimented in the studio. But if Pool Kids was eager to please, its follow-up is knowingly desperate to hold listeners' attention—and that's exactly why it's more compelling. Easier Said Than Done is a weirder, proudly overworked record, made more interesting for its imperfections.

Pool Kids clearly put a lot of care into these songs, to the point where their sound mirrors the lyrics' neurosis: “Leona Street” doesn't need those spacey delay throws, nor does “Not Too Late” need reversed vocals, but that's part of the freedom that comes with five weeks in the studio. The title track sounds like it's building to a giant belt the way songs like Pool Kids highlight “Swallow” did, but here, the moment of catharsis is buried in a cascade of disembodied intrusive thoughts: “I'm not gonna change, I'm never gonna change,” “Don't tell me next time/It's the right time,” “Let me down easily,” “Hear! Me! Now!” The whole band joins in on the chaos throughout the record, as when drummer Caden Clinton and bassist Nicolette Alvarez carry on the band's early math-rock spirit by constantly shifting the groove every other section. Clinton in particular is more kinetic than ever, his restless rim clicks and cymbal washes elevating midtempo songs like “Last Word” that threaten to retread old territory.

These songs are noticeably darker, though not without some levity, like the way Goodwyne draws out the word “dead” (as in “over my dead body”) on the unusually 1975-like “Sorry Not Sorry.” But instead of songs about, say, subtweets, the band opts for thornier explorations of disintegrating relationships under the weight of tour life and general adulthood. Plenty of bands have sung about missing important events while on tour, but the way Goodwyne  spits lines like “For Christmas Eve, I'll make a big plan/Then I'll spend it in a black Dodge Caravan” on “Tinted Windows” makes those frustrations feel visceral. Just before recording, Goodwyne received an OCD diagnosis, and she's said the lyrics on this record draw from “fixations that my OCD latches on to.” You might hear it when she blows up mundane thoughts  into full-on crises, like the deceptively laid back “Not Too Late,” where an unusually breathy performance and Clinton's restrained groove capture the allure of an emotional affair.

“Dani” is the album's best track—Pool Kids' most explosive song to date, it verges on post-rock. Clinton's drumming is slower; Goodwyne and guitarist Andrew Anaya indulge in reverb pedals; and Alvarez's playing is more understated until the band finally lets loose halfway through the song. Even the requisite twinkling guitar lines are distorted. Goodwyne recalls an intense childhood friendship with another girl: “Under the covers, you whisper like there's somebody there/You'll only tell me if I pinky swear.” She then laments “I trusted you”; the lyric's lack of specificity suggests something too painful to bring up from someone whose lyrics so often overshare.

Even if Goodwyne didn't set out to write “an OCD record,” rumination seems to impact every facet of the album, with songs that capture what it's like to live with the disorder in both their form and content. Throughout, there's a sense of longing for a consistent connection, and a feeling of being at the mercy of a brain that's unwilling to let things go: “I wanna stay in my lane/Just don't know how to,” Goodwyne cries on “Bad Bruise” as she instigates something she knows is toxic, then begs for empathy on the chorus. Yet she delivers that chorus with a theatrical sneer—proof that underneath the grief, angst, and new sonic explorations, Pool Kids haven't lost sight of the power of irreverence.

	As Hollywood continues its incessant blood-sucking reliance on draining old intellectual property in lieu of supporting fresh ideas and stories, Sharon Stone is taking a righteous stand against the recently announced Basic Instinct reboot. 


	“I mean, go ahead, but good fucking luck,” Stone said with a laugh on Today when asked about the project, which Amazon MGM Studios announced earlier this summer. 


	The studio has put some serious backing behind the Basic Instinct reboot, enlisting original screenwriter Joe Eszterhas to pen the script for $2 million (against a possible $4 million if the film is made, per The Hollywood Reporter). 


	Like many reboots, there are, technically, good reasons to dip back into the Basic Instinct well: The original — directed by Paul Verhoeven and starring Stone and Michael Douglas — was a massive hit upon release and remains a milestone in the erotic thriller genre. But as Stone noted on Today, the last effort to revive the series in 2006 with Basic Instinct 2 did not go well. The film (in which Stone reprised her iconic role as Catherine Tramell) was a commercial and critical flop.

	“If [the reboot] goes the way the one that I was in went, I would just say, ‘I don't know why you'd do it,'” Stone said with a chuckle. 


	Asked about her willingness to speak with such candor, Stone said, “I'm at that stage of my life where I already retired once, and I already died a couple of times. I'm like, what are you gonna do? Kill me again? Go ahead.”

	There's no timeline yet for the Basic Instinct reboot, nor is it fully clear what the film will be about. After the project was announced in July, a source told The Wrap that the film will be “anti-woke,” with Eszterhas sharing a statement of his own: “To those who question what an 80-year-old man is doing writing a sexy, erotic thriller: the rumors of my cinematic impotence are exaggerated and ageist. I call my writing partner the TWISTED LITTLE MAN, and he lives somewhere deep inside me. He was born 29 and he will die 29 and he tells me he is ‘sky high up' to write this piece and provide viewers with a wild and orgasmic ride. That makes me very happy.”


	As for Stone, she currently has a supporting role in Nobody 2, Bob Odenkirk's action franchise. The actress is also set to appear in Season Three of Euphoria, which will arrive in 2026.

	Two things are for sure with every Taylor Swift album release: her friends are going to love it, and she's going to give fans multiple vinyl variants to choose from. On Sunday, Zoë Kravitz gave Swift's album her seal of approval, telling Extra she's already obsessed with it.


	During the interview, Kravitz revealed that she had “heard bits” of the album the singer announced last week. “It's fantastic, of course,” Kravitz told the interviewer of the Max Martin and Shellback-produced album. “No skips.”


	Then, on Monday, after placing a countdown on her website, Swift unveiled two new vinyl variants for the album, which feature imagery different than the one she shared last week as The Life of a Showgirl was announced.

	The new cover art sees Swift in a sparkly, dark leotard and matching gloves, leaning her hand against the wall with the name of the album written in sparkly font. The records with that cover artwork are being dubbed “The Shiny Bug Edition,” with fans being able to choose between a “wintergreen and onyx marbled” vinyl color and a “violet shimmer marbled” vinyl (both of which are already sold out).

	The records featuring that imagery are available exclusively on her website through Aug. 20, offered as a “limited run” and promised to be the “first and only pressing” of the variant.

	“This album is about what was going on behind the scenes in my inner life during this tour, which was so exuberant and electric and vibrant. It just comes from like the most infectiously joyful, wild, dramatic place I was in in my life,” she said. “And so that effervescence has come through on this record. And like, as you said, bangers.”

              A community for discussion related to Unidentified Flying Objects. Share your sightings, experiences, news, and investigations. We aim to elevate good research while maintaining healthy skepticism.
            


      A few weeks ago I posted about resurrecting the 100 foot Cold War radar at RAF and adapting AI tracking methods from self-driving research into a passive radar system for scanning the skies. The system is now complete.
    


      To test it properly, I invited a mix of people into the bunker: my investors, critics, retired MOD radar experts, and even a journalist from the Mail Online. We ran it live. The outputs were fed into two separate AIs trained to call out any anomalies or weak points. The consensus in the room was that it worked and that the scale and approach is genuinely disruptive.
    


      What impressed me most was the journalist. The Mail has a reputation as a tabloid, but in this case he came down to Norfolk, sat in a cold bunker with us, and really engaged with the technical details in front of a room of skeptical experts and stakeholders. Everyone there from military veterans to investors agreed they hadn't seen anything quite like it.
    


      Based on our testing, if there is anything in the sky within its range, it will be seen whether it has a transponder or not and the accuracy of the eclipse is around 30meters!! due to how we are doing it. That said, the experts strongly advised holding back immediate open release because of how quickly it could be misused.
    


      There is a website where you can request access and help beta test. I did have to put an access-request wall up today following advice from a 'third party', but the list is open if you want to join. For me this project was always about experimenting with AI and radar mathematics, building on the work we originally did for autonomous vehicles, and then handing it over for others to take further. My plan is to transition stewardship to a mix of experts, volunteers, and potentially a commercial arm overseen by my company board to ensure compliance with UK dual-use regulations.
    


      In the next few days there will be a “light” version available for download. You'll be able to run scans yourself, and if you network it with others running the same instance through our WebSockets, it becomes what I'm told is a surprisingly powerful civilian radar tool. Please use it responsibly avoid undue surveillance without cause or permission. The system is essentially invisible, which is part of both its strength and its risk.
    


      My primary focus remains on my company and day job, but I'll still be around on weekends to support the backbone and answer questions. I'll also provide access to one of my AIs trained extensively on radar systems, though I'm currently waiting for Defense Department confirmation that I can share it publicly in case any of the older documents it was trained that may fall under the Official Secrets Act.
    


      I hope you enjoy trying this out as much as we enjoyed building it. I'm truly grateful for the support so far, and I'll continue to post updates on the official website or here depending on what people prefer.
    


      Ps. I am told there are people who missed the online session to review the system, I'm doing one more expert review session on site at the end of the month and perhaps you can join that one online too.

President reverses ceasefire position but says US will give Ukraine security help and expresses hope for trilateral talks

Donald Trump has ruled out a ceasefire in Ukraine as Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his European allies visited the White House to push for US-backed security guarantees as part of any long-term peace deal.

The US president, who only last week warned Russia of “very severe consequences” if Vladimir Putin failed to agree to a halt the fighting, made clear on Monday he had reversed his position.

Welcoming Zelenskyy to the hastily assembled meeting at the Oval Office, Trump referred to other conflicts which he claimed to have ended, telling reporters: “I don't think you'd need a ceasefire. If you look at the six deals that I settled this year, they were all at war – I didn't do any ceasefires.”

He did, however, say the US would help guarantee Ukraine's safety – something Kyiv has long said would be essential for a lasting peace. Trump said: “When it comes to security, there's going to be a lot of help.” But the US president made it clear that European countries would be expected to carry the burden, saying: “They are a first line of defence because they're there. But we'll help them out.”

Trump also expressed hope that the talks with Zelenskyy could lead to a trilateral meeting with Putin. “I think if everything works out well today we'll have a trilat, and I think there will be a reasonable chance of ending the war when we do that.”

Trump added: “I just spoke to President Putin indirectly, and we're going to have a phone call right after these meetings today – and we may or may not have a trilat.”

Trump's meeting with Zelenskyy went more smoothly than their first encounter in the Oval Office six months ago, when the Ukrainian leader was ambushed and berated by Trump and Vice-President JD Vance.

This time, doubtless to the relief of European leaders who gathered for a second meeting at the White House, Zelenskyy gave Trump effusive thanks for the invitation and the pair even shared good-humoured banter while Vance remained silent.

Later, sitting with Keir Starmer and other European leaders in the east room, Trump acknowledged: “All of us would obviously prefer an immediate ceasefire while we work on a lasting peace. Maybe something like that could happen. As of this moment, it's not happening.”

But some of the European allies refused to accept defeat on the issue, mindful that the lack of ceasefire buys Putin more time to wage his war of aggression. On Monday, Ukraine said Russian attacks on major cities had killed at least 10 people, including a toddler and her 16-year-old brother in Kharkiv.

Friedrich Merz, the chancellor of Germany, insisted that “we would all like to see a ceasefire” and he could not imagine the next meeting taking place without one.

“Let's work on that and let's try to put pressure on Russia – because the credibility of these efforts we are undertaking today depend on at least a ceasefire from the beginning of the serious negotiations,” Merz said.

Unmoved, Trump suggested that would be left to Zelenskyy and Putin: “Well, we're going to let the president go over and talk to the president, and we'll see how that works out.” He added: “And again I say it, in the six wars that I've settled, I haven't had a ceasefire.”

Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, also backed the idea of a “truce” as a “necessity,” adding: “We all support this idea.”

Monday's meeting came after Trump met Putin in Anchorage and said that the onus would now be on Zelenskyy to agree to concessions that he said could end the war. Some commentators saw it as a damage limitation exercise after Trump was apparently swayed by Putin and began to echo his talking points.

The US president told his fellow leaders: “We also need to discuss the possible exchanges of territory, taking into consideration the current line of contact – that means the war zone.”

But he also said Putin had accepted there would be security guarantees for Ukraine as part of any peace deal.

Trump said: “In a very significant step, President Putin agreed that Russia would accept security guarantees for Ukraine and this is one of the key points that we need to consider and we're going to be considering that at the table, also who will do what essentially.”

Several of the leaders emphasised the importance of the security guarantees to deter Russia from attacking again. Macron said: “The first one is clearly a credible Ukrainian army for the years and decades to come.” Europe was also clear about carrying its “fair share” of the burden, he said, “so you can count on this as we can continue.”

Giorgia Meloni, the prime minister of Italy, said: ‘We will talk about many important topics. The first one is security guarantees, how to be sure that it won't happen again, which is the precondition of every kind of peace.”

Trump has made a habit of carrying out high-stakes diplomacy before the cameras with a series of leaders who arrive in the Oval Office to face reporters' questions. Monday was no different.

Asked by a journalist if it would be the “end of the road” for US support for Ukraine if no deal is struck, Trump said it was “never the end of the road. People are being killed and we want to stop that. So I would not say it's the end of the road … I know the president, I know myself, and I believe Vladimir Putin wants to see it end.”

Trump added: “We're going to make sure that if there's peace, that peace is going to stay long-term … We're not talking about a two-year peace and then we end up in this mess again.”

Zelenskyy outlined what he said his country needed to feel secure, which included a “strong Ukrainian army” through weapons sales and training. The second part, he said, would depend on the outcome of Monday's talks and any guarantees European Union countries, Nato and the US would be able to offer to the war-torn country.

Trump declined to rule out sending US troops to Ukraine, noting it would be a discussion point with European leaders. “We'll let you know that, maybe, later today. We're meeting with seven great leaders of great countries, also, and we'll be talking about that.”

He added: “They want to give protection and they feel very strongly about it and we'll help them out with that. I think its very important to get the deal done.”
  In stark contrast to the acrimony in February, there were also lighter moments. Brian Glenn, a pro-Trump TV reporter, told Zelenskyy that “you look fabulous in that suit”. Glenn had asked the Ukrainian leader about his clothing during his last visit to the Oval Office, implying that his casual dress was disrespectful.
  Trump jumped in, saying: “I said the same thing.” Turning to Zelenskyy, Trump said: “That's the one that attacked you last time.”
  “I remember that,” Zelenskyy said, before addressing Glenn: “But you are in the same suit ... I changed, you have not.”

The European leaders held a preparatory meeting with the Ukrainian president in Washington on Monday morning, while Zelenskyy also met Trump's Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg.

Zelenskyy described the talks at the White House as “very serious” and sought to flatter Trump by echoing his trademark “peace through strength” language.

But Trump had alarmed Kyiv and European capitals in recent days by repeating a number of Russian talking points.

Fiona Hill, a Russia expert former deputy assistant to the president, told Politico: “Trump has completely ceded narrative control to Putin. What Ukraine is just basically getting as a concession is for the Russians to stop fighting. And this is Putin's way all the way through the 25 years of his presidency, which is: ‘I'm going to beat you up and my concession is that I stopped beating you up.'”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

China announced a 75.8-per-cent duty on Canadian canola seed last week, escalating a costly trade war between the countries.Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press

Vina Nadjibulla is the vice-president of research and strategy at the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada. For more than two years, she publicly campaigned for the release of her ex-husband, Michael Kovrig, who was held in China.

China's provisional 75.8-per-cent anti-dumping tariff on Canadian canola seed imports is not just an agricultural trade dispute – it's an unmistakable act of economic coercion. Coming just days after Canadian and Chinese officials met to discuss trade issues, this move is timed to inflict maximum pressure, coming right before the canola harvest and squarely aimed at creating domestic political division.

Beijing has already slapped 100-per-cent tariffs on Canadian canola oil and meal in retaliation for Canada's 100-per-cent tariff on Chinese electric vehicles (EVs). By making the new canola tariff “provisional,” China leaves the door open to scaling it back – but only if Ottawa offers concessions. This is the playbook we've seen before, and it's a dangerous trap.

In 2019, China halted imports of Canadian canola seeds over Canada's detention of Huawei's CFO, Meng Wanzhou, causing billions in losses for Prairie farmers and exporters. Canada's not alone. Other democracies have all faced China's use of trade as a geopolitical weapon. When Beijing is displeased, it punishes – selectively and strategically – to maximize leverage.

That is why calls from some commentators and political leaders for Prime Minister Mark Carney to personally intervene to “resolve” this dispute risk missing the bigger point. Stability, predictability and rules-based trade are not possible with a partner that repeatedly uses market access as a bargaining chip. Any “return” to normal is temporary, lasting only until the next disagreement.

Canola industry asks Ottawa to curtail vegetable-oil imports after China imposes new trade barriers

The timing and target of these tariffs are not accidental. By hitting canola producers just before harvest, China is aiming at the economic lifeblood of the Prairies. At the same time, Beijing hopes to pit Western farmers against Ontario and Quebec's auto sector – the industry most invested in maintaining Canada's tariffs on Chinese EVs. It's a calculated attempt to fracture Canada's domestic unity and pressure Ottawa into an early retreat.

We cannot afford to take that bait. Concessions now will only embolden further demands. Giving in on EV tariffs would be just the first in a series of concessions Beijing would seek, undermining our ability to protect strategic industries in the future.

It's worth remembering why Canada imposed tariffs on Chinese EVs in the first place. This was not simply an act of solidarity with Washington. It was a measure to protect Canada's national interest, shielding our emerging EV manufacturing capacity from a flood of heavily subsidized Chinese imports that could undercut our economic security, cybersecurity, and industrial policy objectives. Protecting critical sectors like EV manufacturing is part of building long-term national resilience. 

Even if Ottawa and Beijing manage to reach a temporary resolution on canola, the underlying problem will remain. So long as Canada's economy is heavily dependent on a partner willing to weaponize trade (the U.S. or China), we will remain vulnerable to future coercion. The lesson from 2019 – and from Australia's experience with Chinese tariffs on wine, coal and barley – is clear: diversify or be held hostage.

Opinion: Ottawa can't let our canola industry – a true Canadian success story – fade away

What Canada needs to do instead is provide immediate support to canola farmers while pursuing a longer-term strategy to de-risk from both China and the U.S., reducing overdependence on any single partner. At the same time, Canada should develop alternative domestic uses for canola, such as biofuels and plant-based proteins, to lessen reliance on a narrow set of export channels. 

Strengthening rules-based trade through agreements like the CPTPP, CETA, and new free trade agreements with trusted partners in Asia and Europe must be a priority, as should investing in domestic processing capacity to capture more value at home. None of these steps will be quick or easy, but they are essential if Canada is to withstand future attempts at economic coercion, whether from China or any other country.

Diplomacy with China should continue, including at the highest levels. Dialogue is important to manage differences, keep communication channels open and address shared global challenges. But it must be grounded in a clear-eyed understanding of the nature of the Chinese Communist Party and its pressure tactics. Recognizing it as such allows us to respond strategically, with unity, resilience and a firm refusal to make concessions that would compromise our sovereignty or long-term economic security.

The stakes in this dispute go far beyond canola. China's message is clear: it will use economic muscle to get its way. Our message must be just as clear: Canada will not be divided, will not be coerced, and will chart its own course based on its national interest.

OLD ORCHARD BEACH, Maine (AP) — A Maine police officer arrested by immigration authorities has agreed to voluntarily leave the country, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Monday.

ICE arrested Old Orchard Beach Police Department reserve Officer Jon Luke Evans, of Jamaica, on July 25, as part of the agency's effort to step up immigration enforcement. Officials with the town and police department have said federal authorities previously told them Evans was legally authorized to work in the U.S.

An ICE representative reached by telephone told The Associated Press on Monday that a judge has granted voluntary departure for Evans and that he could leave as soon as that day. The representative did not provide other details about Evans' case.

Evans' arrest touched off a dispute between Old Orchard Beach officials and ICE. Police Chief Elise Chard has said the department was notified by federal officials that Evans was legally permitted to work in the country, and that the town submitted information via the Department of Homeland Security's E-Verify program prior to Evans' employment. Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin then accused the town of “reckless reliance” on the department's E-Verify program.

E-Verify is an online system that allows employers to check if potential employees can work legally in the U.S.

The town is aware of reports that Evans plans to leave the country voluntarily, Chard said Monday.

“The town reiterates its ongoing commitment to meeting all state and federal laws regarding employment,” Chard said in a statement. “We will continue to rely on the I-9 Employment Eligibility Verification form and the E-Verify database to confirm employment eligibility.”




ICE's detainee lookup website said Monday that Evans was being held at the Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, Rhode Island. However, a representative for Wyatt said Evans had been transferred to an ICE facility in Burlington, Massachusetts. ICE officials did not respond to requests for comment on the discrepancy. It was unclear if Evans was represented by an attorney, and a message left for him at the detention facility was not returned.

ICE officials said in July that Evans overstayed his visa and unlawfully attempted to purchase a firearm. WMTW-TV reported Monday that Evans' agreement to a voluntary departure means he will be allowed to leave the U.S. at his own expense to avoid being deported.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Joining forces from three other Republican-led states, the Mississippi National Guard will deploy 200 troops to Washington as part of the Trump administration's ongoing federal policing and immigration overhaul in the nation's capital. 

Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said in a statement Monday that he has approved the deployment of approximately 200 Mississippi National Guard Soldiers to Washington, D.C.

“Crime is out of control there, and it's clear something must be done to combat it,” Reeves said.

Mississippi joins three other states that have pledged to deploy hundreds of National Guard members to the nation's capital to bolster the Republican administration's operation aiming to transform policing in the Democratic-led city through a federal crackdown on crime and homelessness.

West Virginia said it was deploying 300 to 400 troops, South Carolina pledged 200 and Ohio said it will send 150 in the coming days, deployments that built on top of President Donald Trump's initial order that 800 National Guard troops deploy as part of the federal intervention.

Trump's executive order that launched the federal operation declared a “crime emergency” in the District of Columbia and initiated a takeover Washington's police department. The administration has ordered local police to cooperate with federal agents on immigration enforcement, orders that would contradict local laws prohibiting such collaboration.

“D.C. has been under siege from thugs and killers, but now, D.C. is back under Federal Control where it belongs,” Trump wrote on his social media website a day after issuing his order. “The White House is in charge. The Military and our Great Police will liberate this City, scrape away the filth, and make it safe, clean, habitable and beautiful once more!”




During a Monday news conference, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser pushed back on Trump's characterization of the city and voiced skepticism about the administration's intentions in flooding the capital with troops and federal agents. 

“We don't have any authority over the DC Guard or any other guards, but I think it makes the point that this is not about DC crime,” Bowser said of the administration and states deploying National Guard members onto the streets of the capital.

“The focus should be on violent crime,” Bowser continued. “Nobody is against focusing on driving down any level of violence. And so if this is really about immigration enforcement the administration should make that plain.”

National Guard members in the District of Columbia have been assisting law enforcement with tasks including crowd control and patrolling landmarks such as the National Mall and Union Station. Their role has been limited thus far, and it remains unclear why additional troops would be needed.

Federal agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Secret Service and other agencies have patrolled high traffic areas around the capital over the last week. ICE officers, who work under the Department of Homeland Security, have made arrests in neighborhoods across the city, dispersed some public gatherings and torn pro-immigrant signs, according to videos published by the administration.

The White House has touted various arrests that local police and federal agents have made across the city since Trump's executive order. Federal agents have made 380 arrests in the week since the start of the operation and in some cases issued charges to detained people. The White House has touted the surge of agents on social media and posted pictures of people arrested by local and federal officers.

“Washington, DC is getting safer every night thanks to our law enforcement partners,” Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on social media. “Just this weekend, 137 arrests were made and 21 illegal firearms were seized. In total, there have been nearly 400 arrests—and we are not slowing down.”

Amid the crackdown, the administration has received criticism for the conduct of some federal agents, who in several high-profile incidents have arrested people while wearing masks that hide their identity and declined to identify themselves to media or members of the public when questioned. 

Bowser said Monday that she had asked D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith to seek answers from the administration about the use of masked police.

“It's very important to us that agents be identified,” Bowser said. “There's no reason for a law enforcement official to be masked.”

Over the weekend in Washington, protesters pushed back on federal law enforcement and National Guard troops fanning out in the city. Scores of protesters gathered in the city's Dupont Circle on Saturday and marched to the White House.

Anthropic has told investors it is displeased by the prevalence of a popular kind of investment vehicle being marketed to those eager to get in on the AI boom, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter.

In its latest funding round, the AI startup is raising around $5 billion at a $170 billion valuation, Business Insider has confirmed. It told one of its largest investors, Menlo Ventures, that the venture capital firm must use its own capital and not resort to a special purpose vehicle, or SPV, as it did in a previous funding round, one of the people told BI.

The clampdown is a sign the AI startup has more leverage to dictate terms due to rampant demand for its private shares, according to the sources who asked not to be identified because they were discussing nonpublic information.

Spokespeople for Anthropic and Menlo declined to comment.

SPVs let investors pool their funds for a single, one-off deal. While they allow speed and can be marketed to a wider range of non-institutional investors, SPVs are generally seen as less desirable because most companies prefer to have a direct relationship with investors.

With so many people eager to invest in a limited number of AI companies, investors have been sharing stories on social media about being marketed SPVs with extremely high fees.

""Many friends including myself have been offered allocation into OpenAI or Anthropic SPVs this week,"" Michelle Lim, a founder and angel investor, posted last week on X. ""Minimum check sizes are $100k-$1M, with fees as high as 16%. From what I understand, folks are creating SPVs on top of SPVs and making management fees on top of them. It's like a pyramid.""

""The feeding frenzy for ownership in the AI labs has spawned a set of bottom feeding multi layered SPV brokers that have no relationship with the company, and straight up grifters,"" venture capitalist Sarah Guo wrote recently on X. ""Careful of that nonsense.""

Guo was tweeting generally, not about Anthropic's current fundraising efforts. Still, this shows how SPVs can be considered problematic, even though they're a common tool in the venture capital toolkit.

When Anthropic raised funding in late 2023, Menlo Ventures was the lead investor and stepped forward with a $500 million check.

There was a catch, though: Half a billion dollars was too rich a sum for Menlo to use all its own capital. So part of the money came from an SPV where a pool of cash from outside investors helped fund the investment.

The SPV, revealed in regulatory filings, was an effective way for Anthropic to quickly raise a lot of money to keep up with OpenAI and other competitors.

This time, Anthropic is being more choosy, probably because there's so much demand from investors. The startup has seen revenue soar lately, mostly thanks to its Claude models' ability to generate, fix, and deploy software code.

Anthropic has told potential investors it wants tier-one VCs who will be with the company for the long haul, according to one of the sources who spoke with Business Insider.

Anthropic's round is five times oversubscribed, this person added, so the company has more leverage than it did in previous funding rounds.

Menlo's commitment in this latest round is set to be smaller, around $120 million, according to one of the other sources.

Anthropic was last valued at $61.5 billion when it raised $3.5 billion in March. Since then, investor appetite for AI has only grown more voracious.

OpenAI is reportedly seeking a $500 billion valuation in an employee stock sale, making Anthropic, even valued at $170 billion, may look like a relative bargain to some investors, in comparison.

In this article

The first ""World Humanoid Robot Games"" is in the books.

The three-day competition hosted in Beijing wrapped on Sunday, attracting 280 teams from 16 countries, including the U.S. Teams used robots manufactured by Chinese companies such as Unitree and Booster.

During the games, humanoid athletes competed in dance battles, martial arts, track and field events such as the 400-meter and 1500-meter races and long jump, and a soccer tournament.

""Robots have stronger joints and core strength,"" said Guo Tong, who programmed one of the futuristic footballers for his team, Hephaestus.

Guo said he sees robots replacing his idol, soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo, by 2050.

""Robots are easier to coach,"" Chinese Olympic boxer Li Yang told CNBC while watching his robot slug it out with another. ""Humans are emotional.""

Hangzhou-based Unitree, seen as a competitor to Tesla's Optimus, won multiple medals. Beijing-based X-Humanoid and Hong Kong-listed Shenzhen firm UBTECH also impressed.

The Chinese government has targeted humanoid robots as a key future industry for the economy and Beijing has plans to build a world-class industry of humanoid robots by 2027.

The games are the latest in a series of events and programs aimed at promoting humanoid robot technology. China announced plans to hold its second Olympics-style event for humanoid robots next August.

Robots also put job skills to the test, showcasing their abilities as drug store clerks, factory workers, and hotel staff.

One challenge for a robot in housekeeping was to pick up all the garbage in a mock hotel room and take out the trash. Referees told CNBC the biggest obstacle for those robots was opening and closing the door.

Robot designer Wang Xidong says the competition is key to testing the robots' skills and improving them.

""We are refining our robots,"" Wang said. ""Everyone feels motivated to compete.""

Zoë Schiffer: Hey, this is Zoë. Before we start, I want to share some exciting news with you. We're doing a live show in San Francisco on September 9th, in partnership with KQED. Uncanny Valley cohosts, Lauren Good and Michael Calore will sit down with our editor in chief, Katie Drummond, and a special guest, for a conversation that you really won't want to miss. You can use the link in the show notes to grab your ticket and invite a friend. We can't wait to see you there. Welcome to WIRED's Uncanny Valley. I'm Zoë Schiffer, WIRED's director of business and industry. Today on the show, we're bringing you five stories that you absolutely need to know this week, including the less-than-warm reception that OpenAI's GPT-5 model got from users. I'm joined today by WIRED's senior politics writer, Jake Lahut.

Jake Lahut: Great to be back.

Zoë Schiffer: So our first story this week is about how the Trump administration has been posting memes to make fun of deportations. Have you seen these at all?

Jake Lahut: Yes, unfortunately I have. Yeah. Real fun, funny stuff.

Zoë Schiffer: Yeah, real dark. So WIRED contributor Tess Owen reported on this pattern of different official government accounts on social media using whatever is viral at the moment and tailoring it to promote and make fun of deportations. And this is especially popular in the accounts of the Department of Homeland Security and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, and the White House. So for example, there's this catchy jingle that belongs to Jet2, which is a low-budget British Airline that's been making the rounds lately on social media.

Archival audio: Nothing beats a Jet2 holiday, and right now—

Zoë Schiffer: Last month, DHS and the White House made a joint Instagram post incorporating the tune on top of footage of ICE detainees in handcuffs boarding a deportation plane, and the caption reads, “When ICE books you on one-way Jet2 holiday to deportation, nothing beats it.”

Jake Lahut: Oh my God.

Zoë Schiffer: I honestly have such a hard time thinking about who would find that funny, even if you really are anti-immigration, I don't know another way to say it, it just seems so mean.

Jake Lahut: Yeah, if you could have seen our faces when that was playing. Yeah, darling, hold my hand, I don't want to ever see anything like that ever again. Something I've picked up on ever since covering the Trump 2024 campaign, which is, there's obviously still a lot of really weird, cringy, messed up stuff going on here, but it's also an attempt, at least from their point of view in the weird bubble they're in to kind of mainstream this stuff.

Zoë Schiffer: Right. And this is actually the point, according to Tessa's reporting, she spoke to experts who said that the goal of this is really to normalize what's happening. The point isn't just to be crude or cruel, it's strategic. This sparked a bunch of backlash. It's not just you and me, but in response to WIRED's reporting, the White House gave a statement that basically just dismissed these concerns and said that it, “won't apologize for posting banger memes.” Moving on to the world of crypto. Our colleague Joel Kalili reported on a cryptocurrency business called World Liberty Financial, which I'm sure you're familiar with too, Jake.

Jake Lahut: Oh, yeah.

Zoë Schiffer: Which has come up with a clever workaround, I guess you could say, for the fact that crypto can't technically be traded on the stock exchange. So World Liberty is now allowing investors to speculate on the price of its coin by way of a little-known company that is legally listed on the NASDAQ, called Alt-Five Sigma Corporation. Are you familiar?

Jake Lahut: I am not as familiar with that word mash.

Zoë Schiffer: So this is where it gets kind of sticky because technically Alt-Five is marketed as a crypto payments company, but in practice, the deal will turn the stock into a sort of proxy for their crypto coin, basically allowing investors to bet on the asset without the hassle and risk that comes with holding a crypto coin themselves. It sounds very crypto. It's a scheme that has raised eyebrows, to say the least. One of Joel's Wall Street sources told us that what this move effectively does is build a holding company with the sole objective of creating a treasury for their crypto coin, about $1.5 billion worth, which could inflate the market capitalization of the coin.

Jake Lahut: And this is also controversial because this starts opening up a different can of worms where potential investors and politically motivated actors who are all in this orbit can have even more influence over the administration. We've already seen the way you can do that with the meme coin, now with World Liberty Financial they're obviously affiliated with Trump's adult sons, and the Trump family controls 22.5 percent of the WLFI coins and about a 40 percent equity stake in World Liberty Financial. So this is definitely the big game in town when it comes to buttering the Trump family's biscuit.

Zoë Schiffer: Right. I love how you said that. Yeah, basically, if you want to potentially try and curry favor with Trump, you buy into one of these schemes, and maybe you'll get invited to a fancy crypto dinner, which has happened before. Maybe you get something else. But even just the optics here are pretty suspect.

Jake Lahut: Yeah. And in a little side item we had in my Interloop Newsletter this week, we had some new data on the somewhat stunning lack of enforcement from the Trump administration across the tech sector, but crypto in particular had pretty much everyone who had been facing any kind of legal action from the Biden administration, having their enforcement actions either dropped completely or paused. And in one instance, we're looking at the maybe first ever pardoning of a company from one of these things. So you don't need to just pony up the money for these things and expect a legislative win, you can just get the heat pulled off of you on the regulatory front.

Zoë Schiffer: Right. So our third story, I'm really waiting for one that's not incredibly depressing, but right now we're going all the way to Arkansas where our colleague, David Gilbert, reported that a group of Americans are building a “whites-only community,” which they call Return to the Land. The group believes that white people and Western culture are facing extinction because of an influx of immigrants and minorities. And according to the group's founder, access to the community is open only to people of white European ancestry who share common views on things like segregation, abortion, and gender identity. Return to the Land's president shared their intellectual inspiration with David, the reporter, saying that they were partly inspired by venture capitalist and the son of immigrant parents, Balaji Srevenesin, and his book, The Network State, which promotes the idea of a digital-first community of people with shared values, with the aim of gaining a degree of sovereignty and autonomy.

Jake Lahut: And look, not just America, long history of a bunch of wacky well-intentioned or just downright weird utopias, but this one, a little different, because you're having the sovereignty to be racist. But in all seriousness, Zoë, how is any of this legal?

Zoë Schiffer: Yeah, I mean, that is the real question. So the whole premise goes back to the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which prevents housing discrimination based on race or religion, but Return to the Land claims that the structure of the community is more akin to a private member's association. And so far local authorities seem to agree. Arkansas' attorney general, Tim Griffin, told WIRED that his office has found nothing illegal about the community. Surprise, surprise.

Jake Lahut: Yeah, it's like Erlich Bachman's incubator from Silicon Valley, but for white supremacy and racism.

Zoë Schiffer: Exactly. Exactly. OK, one more before we take a break. This one is about how the US is racing to build a nuclear reactor on the moon. WIRED contributor Becky Ferreira recently reported that NASA is fast-tracking a plan to build a nuclear reactor on the moon by 2030 under a new directive from the agency's interim administrator, Sean Duffy.

Jake Lahut: Sean Duffy, only in America, can you go from the Fox and Friends weekend couch to being secretary of transportation, to also doing this. He's a busy, busy man, multitasking—

Zoë Schiffer: He's a busy, busy man.

Jake Lahut: To the moon.

Zoë Schiffer: So his stated motivation is that the US has to stay ahead in what he deems to be the “moon race” with China and Russia. Both countries have expressed their desire to place nuclear reactors on the moon, and it's an appealing idea because nuclear energy is a powerful continuous source of energy. We're hearing about it more and more with the AI race. And so the directive laid out by Duffy is to quickly design, launch, and deploy an operational 100 kilowatt reactor to the lunar south pole within five years that would be built with commercial partners, and experts say this would be difficult, but not completely impossible. If it actually gets accomplished, it would potentially change the space industry. They could start designing space systems around what we want to do and not what smaller, often limited power allows them to do.

Jake Lahut: With the added bonus of effectively using a nuclear flag to prevent other countries from landing in this area, so, all right. Sounds promising, question mark?

Zoë Schiffer: It is, and there's always a “but,” there's also a mountain of safety and regulatory concerns that this would bring obviously, because we're literally dealing with nuclear energy in outer space. So how do you contain the uranium for one, how do you make sure to stay in your sovereign zone so you don't accidentally start a space war? All these questions are coming up and the accelerated process could make it even trickier.

Jake Lahut: Yeah. I extremely do not want to be here for a space war, so catch me pulling a Yoda in the Degaba system. I'll hide out until the all-clear has been given.

Zoë Schiffer: I'll be there with you. OK. Coming up, we'll dive into why OpenAI's latest model release ended up being kind of a flop despite all of the hype. Stay with us.

[break]

Zoë Schiffer: Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. I'm Zoë Schiffer, and I'm joined today by Jake Lahut. We're discussing the user response to OpenAI's release of GPT-5. OpenAI's GPT-5 model was meant to be like a world-changing upgrade to the wildly popular ChatGPT. Sam Altman had tweeted out the Death Star, they said it was going to have kind of virtuosic skill and PhD-level intelligence, and I think a lot of people felt like it was going to bring us basically up to artificial general intelligence. Were you aware of the hype leading up to everything?

Jake Lahut: I was definitely taken aback by the term “PhD-level intelligence” in the hype for all of this stuff. And what I started to wonder about was like, what is that going to look like compared to the more sycophantic glaze-you-up version of GPT-4.0?

Zoë Schiffer: So yeah, it was too much hype. They'd actually tried … I talked to sources about this, internally they were testing various models that they wanted to call GPT-5, and none were meeting the mark. And so I think there was a fair amount of pressure internally. If you talk to people who work closely with Sam, they'll say he really likes to have a big splash every three to four months, once a quarter at least. And so I think the combination of the fact that they hadn't released a major model in a while, I mean the open source models notwithstanding, they had been hyping GPT-5 for so long. There was this push to be like, “We have to release a model, a big model, and we kind of have to call it GPT-5.” Then the day it launched, there was supposed to be this feature that could automatically route your query based on how complicated it was. Like if you were asking something very simple, it would route you to a cheaper model basically. And if you were asking something more complicated, you might get a reasoning model. That broke according to Sam Altman, the CEO. And so the model just seemed dumber all day than it otherwise would. So I don't know. There was a lot going on.

Jake Lahut: And at least from my more layman outside politics world perspective on this, it does seem like a … From the economics to be a rather smart, more efficient way to go about it. But the part that really stood out to me though was more of the “personality” of GPT-5 and the revolts that it started on Reddit and among ChatGPT super users, of which I am admittedly not one.

Zoë Schiffer: Right, yeah. So this was really fascinating. I think one thing that happened, and again I'm pulling this from conversations with a bunch of sources inside the company, is that they really wanted to optimize for coding ability this time, because that's really been Claude's edge, Anthropic's AI model, and obviously it's a huge revenue driver. It's kind of the first area where we've seen a big widespread commercial adoption in a way that could do the thing that AI companies have been saying all along will be done, which is it'll disrupt and augment jobs in a pretty serious way. Engineers really are using these tools and companies are really pushing the tools on their own workforce. But like you said, the reason that regular people like models isn't often because of their coding ability. It's because they genuinely like talking to them. It's a lot more about the personality, about the warmth, even about the sycophancy, although they've fixed a large part of that in the latest release. And so people completely flipped out. We were looking at Reddit and people were saying, “This is erasure, what have they done? Take me back to 4.0.”

Jake Lahut: “You took away my friend.”

Zoë Schiffer: Yeah, I mean it really, really impacted people. I think on the most extreme ends, you see people who have what looks like perhaps like a mental health crisis, they're so attached to the model, but then you just have complete power users who are like, “This is part of my minute by minute life. What have you done? You didn't warn me.”

Jake Lahut: And this is where the introspective aspect of these tools, the kind of desire for self-understanding, the people who are not advisably from any medical perspective, but they are trying to use these bots for something akin to therapy. And what it made me think of when I saw this rolling out was, is this maybe the beginning of something bigger where there's kind of a departure between the “regular consumer” experience and demand for AI versus the business application? We may not all have the same definition of intelligence when it comes to these models, and that some of us really just want a buddy, a companion, a way to know ourselves better. And then other people are like, “No, I just need a little team of bots here to manage, get my stuff done, I'm going to babysit and I'm going to tell them what to do and live my life.” And yeah, I don't know where that goes. It does seem like it's revealing something maybe genuinely new about the human condition in a way that I would not have expected.

Zoë Schiffer: Yeah, I mean, I think it's been a learning for OpenAI. They've been kind of baffled. I've seen these conversations internally where they're like, “I guess people don't care as much about intelligence as we thought.” The narrative around intelligence is critically important for fundraising, if nothing else, they really need to raise gobs of money and being like, “We're about to achieve artificial and general intelligence, AI will be able to do all of these things,” is really important for that. But for everyday users, it really makes me think of this story that is kind of famous inside OpenAI about the night before the ChatGPT release in November of '22, Ilya, he was testing out what was going to be ChatGPT and asked it 10 pretty hard questions. And he felt like five of them, he got pretty good responses, and five were unacceptably bad. And they had this moment where they were like, “Do we release this? I don't know if it's good enough.” And then they decided to move forward. And what we saw was the general public was like, “This is amazing.” Because they'd solved a product issue. It wasn't necessarily about the model, which had been out for a long time. It was like the interface to interact with the model was really the unlock. And I think OpenAI, that really is more and more the company's edge, even though it really sees itself as a research lab. It's a product lab in a lot of ways, and it'll be interesting to see how that changes the company moving forward.

Jake Lahut: Absolutely.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Bayern Munich's Karl-Heinz Rummenigge calls to not ‘overdramatize' player's risk of physical overload from Club World Cup, blames agents and players for ‘situation'","https://www.bavarianfootballworks.com/bayern-munich-finances-board/131605/bayern-munich-karl-heinz-rummenigge-calls-to-not-overdramatize-players-risk-of-physical-overload-from-club-world-cup-blames-agents-and-players-for-situation","Mon, 18 Aug 2025 17:30:00 GMT","

﻿So...is it a problem or is not? This is confusing messaging.

Bayern Munich supervisory board member Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has made his support of the new format of the FIFA Club World Cup very well known in the past. As with many supporters of this format change, however, he is confronted with one of the new format's biggest critiques: The added strain in puts on players by getting them to play more games.

Rummenigge's response to this critique, posed by German newspaper kicker is as follows:

“I wouldn't overdramatize it. As a player, I would have been happy to participate in such a tournament. Of course, this season brings more games thanks to the Club World Cup, but this tournament only takes place every four years,” the former Bayern CEO said, as captured by @iMiaSanMia. “And many players—together with their agents—have contributed to this situation and set the trap for themselves. They demand ever-increasing salaries, which forces clubs to seek additional revenue streams. That's why new formats are emerging. On the other hand, I see little willingness from them to forgo salary. That's a contradiction that should be clearly identified.”

One one hand, Rummenigge says he would have been happy to play in the new Club World Cup. On the other, he refers to all of this as a “trap”. That seems rather like another contradiction that should be clarified.

As for the salary issue, he has been rather vocal in these beliefs for years now. Of course it is easy to see how the revenue from the Club World Cup- reported to be nearly €50 million could help pay for these salaries. But this mad scramble to find new revenue sources cannot be the solution moving forward. Some sort of solution needs to be reached, however possible.

Jannik Sinner retired after just five games against Carlos Alcaraz in the men's singles final at the Cincinnati Open due to illness.

In the latest instalment of what was expected to be another classic match between male tennis' top two players, Sinner visibly struggled from the off and was broken three times by Alcaraz before retiring at 5-0 down in the first set.

The world No 1 told officials ""I feel really bad, I feel so sorry for the fans"" before embracing with Alcaraz to confirm his decision and now faces a race to recover in time for his US Open title defence in New York, with the tournament starting this Sunday live on Sky Sports.

""I'm super sorry to disappoint you. From yesterday, I didn't feel great. I thought I would get better during the night but it got worse,"" said Sinner, who held his stomach at times during the 23 minutes of play.

""I tried to come out and make it a small match but I couldn't handle more. I'm very sorry for all of you. I know some of you on Monday have to work or do something else, so I'm really sorry.""

The shock result means Sinner's run of 26 consecutive hard court wins is over and Alcaraz has now won eight ATP 1000 events.

Alcaraz, who already has six titles to his name in 2025, will travel to New York to play in the mixed doubles competition alongside Britain's Emma Raducanu on Tuesday, live on Sky Sports, with Sinner expected to withdraw from the two-day event.

""It's not the way I want to win matches or the trophy,"" said Alcaraz.

""I know and understand how you [Sinner] feel right now. I can't say anything you don't know.

""You are a true champion and I'm sure you will come back better, even stronger. You always do and that's what true champions do. Sorry, and come back stronger.""

Sinner is the defending US Open champion in the men's singles but should be ready for Flushing Meadows given he retired from illness, rather than an injury.

The intense heat in Cincinnati caused a lot of fatigue throughout the two-week tournament as several players pulled out and some were sick.

It is possible this also led to Sinner's issues but former Grand Slam doubles champion Ryan Harrison said on Sky Sports Tennis' coverage that the Italian should not be concerned about his US Open title defence.

""He will be straight to the doctors. It's not something I would be overly worried about, given that the US Open is two weeks off and you get a day off after each match,"" said Harrison.

""By the time he recovers this week, gets through the opening match, then in 10 days he will be fully recovered at the latter stages.""

The British actress spoke alongside her 'The Thursday Murder Club' co-star Pierce Brosnan — famed for his stint as 007 — who concurred: ""I wish them well. I'm excited for the next man to come on the stage.""

	Oscar-winning actress Helen Mirren is weighing in on the James Bond debate, and she's made her stance clear.


	“I'm such a feminist,” the legendary Brit told Saga Magazine in a new interview alongside her The Thursday Murder Club co-star Pierce Brosnan, famed for his stint as Ian Fleming's iconic spy. “But you can't have a woman. It just doesn't work. James Bond has to be James Bond, otherwise it becomes something else.”




	Brosnan concurred with Mirren, and added about the next actor to take on the role: “I wish them well. I'm so excited to see the next man come on the stage and to see a whole new exuberance and life for this character…. I adore the world of James Bond,” he said, “It's been very good to me. It's the gift that keeps giving. And I'm just a member of the audience now, sitting back, saying: ‘Show us what you're going to do.'”

	All eyes are on Amazon MGM Studios as it gears up for its first 007 movie after buying the rights off stepsiblings Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson for a reported $1 billion earlier this year. Denis Villeneuve is set to direct and Steven Knight, creator of Peaky Blinders, is penning the script.


	“I'm hoping that, being a Bond fan for so many years, it will be imbued into me and I will be able to produce something that's the same but different, and better, stronger and bolder,” Knight told BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast earlier this month.


	Speculation about who might succeed Daniel Craig as Bond is rife, with Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Jacob Elordi, Tom Holland and Harris Dickinson among the hottest names to be thrown around. Of course, the woman-wooing MI6 agent is a role some believe should not exclude female actresses, too.

	











	But Mirren isn't the only one who believes Bond is a man's job: Halle Berry, who starred in Die Another Day, told a Cannes Film Festival press conference in May: “In 2025, it's nice to say, ‘Oh, she should be a woman.' But,” she added, “I don't really know if I think that's the right thing to do.”

HUNTR/X and Saja Boys each boast two songs in the Global 200's top five.


													By
												

	Gary Trust



HUNTR/X and Saja Boys may do battle in Netflix's KPop Demon Hunters, but the acts team up to claim four of the top five on the Billboard Global 200 chart.


	HUNTR/X's “Golden” adds a fifth nonconsecutive week at No. 1 on both the Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. U.S. charts. In July, the song became the first leader on each list for the act, whose music is voiced by EJAE, Audrey Nuna and REI AMI.

	











	Meanwhile, HUNTR/X earns its second top five Global 200 hit, as “How It's Done” jumps 8-5.




			Trending on Billboard		







	In between the trio's two top five entries, Saja Boys rise 4-3 with “Soda Pop,” which returns to its best placement, and 5-4 with “Your Idol,” which has also reached No. 3. Both songs are performed by Andrew Choi, Neckwav, Danny Chung, Kevin Woo and samUIL Lee.


	Since the Global 200 began in September 2020, four elite albums — by two superstars — other than the KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack have generated as many as four concurrent top five hits. Taylor Swift monopolized the entire top five in the debut chart weeks for her LPs The Tortured Poets Department (May 4, 2024), 1989 (Taylor's Version) (Nov. 11, 2023) and Midnights (Nov. 5, 2022), while Drake held Nos. 2-5 the week that Certified Lover Boy made its chart start (Sept. 18, 2021).


	The Billboard Global 200 and Global Excl. U.S. charts rank songs based on streaming and sales activity culled from more than 200 territories around the world, as compiled by Luminate. The Global 200 is inclusive of worldwide data and the Global Excl. U.S. chart comprises data from territories excluding the United States.

	











	Chart ranks are based on a weighted formula incorporating official-only streams on both subscription and ad-supported tiers of audio and video music services, as well as download sales, the latter of which reflect purchases from full-service digital music retailers from around the world, with sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites excluded from the charts' calculations.


	“Golden” leads the Global 200 with 117.8 million streams (down less than 1% week-over-week) and 14,000 sold (up 7%) worldwide in the week ending Aug. 14.


	As for the only song not from the KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack in the Global 200's top five, Alex Warren's “Ordinary” holds at No. 2 after 10 weeks on top beginning in May.


	“Golden” tops Global Excl. U.S. with 86.1 million streams (down 1%) and 7,000 sold (up 8%) outside the U.S.


	“Ordinary” keeps at No. 2 on Global Excl. U.S., following eight weeks at No. 1 starting in May; BLACKPINK's “Jump” repeats at No. 3, after it led in its debut week in July; “Soda Pop” is steady at its No. 4 high; and “Your Idol” rises 8-5, returning to its best rank.


	The Billboard Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. U.S. charts (dated Aug. 23, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, Aug. 19. For both charts, the top 100 titles are available to all readers on Billboard.com, while the complete 200-title rankings are visible on Billboard Pro, Billboard's subscription-based service. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.


Luminate, the independent data provider to the Billboard charts, completes a thorough review of all data submissions used in compiling the weekly chart rankings. Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.
