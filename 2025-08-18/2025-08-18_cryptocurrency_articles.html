                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Both projects bring fresh approaches to token presales, capturing interest in a crowded space. With token presales playing a major role in shaping 2025's crypto presale projects, these two coins are showing how meme culture and strong ecosystems can merge to create meaningful traction. Pepe Dollar (PEPD) is redefining how memes interact with decentralized finance. The project positions itself as more than a joke coin by linking internet culture with financial tools, giving community-driven creativity real value in the digital economy. Currently in Stage 2, Pepe Dollar's pre-sale cryptocurrency is available at $0.006495, with a planned launch price of $0.03695. So far, over $1.4 million has been raised, reflecting consistent interest in new token presale opportunities. This success places PEPD firmly on the crypto presale list of top contenders in 2025. By mixing entertainment with serious infrastructure, Pepe Dollar shows how meme-based token presales can move beyond hype and into long-term ecosystems. It is emerging as one of the best crypto presales to buy right now. At Stage 10, the project has raised $17,037,116 out of its $19,325,000 goal, selling more than 11.5 billion tokens. Investor confidence remains high, with strong momentum even in competitive markets. The project's $777K Giveaway added more excitement, rewarding ten winners with $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens each. With LILPEPE presale tokens nearly sold out, many investors are beginning to look at other top crypto presales for 2025. Pepe Dollar (PEPD) has quickly become a destination for this shift. Its focus on memes, payments, and community-driven ecosystems has caught the attention of traders who already participated in LILPEPE's presale token stages. The transition reflects a wider trend in crypto pre-sales where investors move capital from one project to the next as presale coins reach completion. For many, buying presale crypto like PEPD offers a chance to stay ahead in token presales while diversifying exposure across multiple meme-driven assets. Together, these coins show how token presale models are evolving in 2025. For Pepe Dollar (PEPD), the journey through token presales shows how meme-driven innovation can gain traction alongside traditional pre-sale cryptocurrency models. LILPEPE's rapid sellout further reflects the appetite for new crypto presale projects that mix incentives with strong branding. With active participation, consistent funding, and unique positioning, they highlight how token presale opportunities are defining the future of the crypto presale 2025 market.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Circle's new layer-1 blockchain Arc will integrate with Fireblocks, a New York–based digital asset custody and tokenization platform serving more than 2,400 banks, asset managers and fintechs. Arc is not yet live, but Circle plans to roll out a public testnet this fall ahead of a full launch by year-end. Fireblocks said it prepares custody and compliance support so clients can transact on Arc once the network launches. Its platform supports over 120 blockchains and facilitates settlement for institutions across global markets. The unusually early integration drew some criticism on X. Solana, for example, launched in 2020, but wasn't added to Fireblocks until late 2021, after its ecosystem reached critical mass. Arc will instead debut with Fireblocks integration, giving banks and asset managers “day one” access. Related: Stablecoins will soon have their ‘iPhone moment,' Circle CEO While US regulators advanced clarity around stablecoins with the GENIUS Act signed on July 18, Circle has been expanding its footprint. On June 5, Circle raised $1.05 billion in the first IPO by a stablecoin issuer. The company's first earnings report since going public was released on Tuesday, reporting $658 million in Q2 revenue, a 53% increase year-over-year. That same day, Circle moved to expand its payments infrastructure with the launch of the Circle Payments Network, and announced Arc — describing it as a layer 1 purpose-built chain for “stablecoin finance.” While Circle was ahead of the curve with its IPO, the Arc announcement comes amid a broader wave of new blockchain launches, including Stripe developing Tempo with Paradigm and Robinhood rolling out a tokenization-focused L2 in June. Most of that profit came from Treasury yields, with the company's $127 billion short-term US debt generating steady income. Tether has now become one of the largest non-sovereign holders of US Treasurys, surpassing countries such as South Korea and the UAE, an unprecedented position for a private company.

A suburban man worried about an email warning he must pay a ticket for missing jury duty sends more than $15,000 to someone posing as a sheriff's official. A Chicago woman lured into romantic conversations with an online pen pal sends her life savings to her fictional lover. These tragic, real-life examples, in which people have used cryptocurrency kiosks to send large payments to scammers, drove Illinois Gov. One law gives the state broad regulatory power over the crypto industry, and the other provides specific consumer protections surrounding kiosks that handle digital currency transactions. A Chicago Sun-Times story earlier this year reported that more than 1,000 of the kiosks operate in the city at convenience stores, gas stations and currency exchanges. They can convert cash into crypto and vice versa. They're crime magnets for drug dealers who launder their illegal proceeds through the machines and for scammers who steal untraceable money from their victims, officials say. The Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, which has been given the power to regulate digital asset exchanges and businesses, will require the crypto industry to comply with protections now in place for consumers of traditional financial services, such as banks. To prevent fraud, the state will cap daily transaction amounts at kiosks at $2,500 for new customers, limit transaction fees at kiosks to 18%, and provide full refunds to new customers who get defrauded. “While the Trump administration is letting crypto ‘bros' write federal policy, Illinois is implementing common sense protections for investors and consumers,” Pritzker said in a statement. One sponsor of the legislation, Sen. Laura Ellman, said basic consumer protections in the cryptocurrency world are lacking. “This measure addresses areas in the virtual currency market vulnerable to fraud and empowers Illinois consumers to make informed investments,” said Ellman, a Democrat from Naperville.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new class of infrastructure is emerging—one that operates above our cities, outside traditional institutions, and is owned by the people who help build it. At the intersection of AI, climate response, and real-time spatial data, blockchain-verified drone networks are beginning to challenge satellites as the dominant source of Earth imagery. Spexi, a startup based in Vancouver, BC, is flipping that model. By enlisting thousands of microdrone pilots to operate within a standardized flight protocol, the company is building a real-time, blockchain-verified imaging network that's faster, cheaper, greener—and far more scalable. Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks, or DePINs, are emerging as a new blueprint for how physical systems such as compute, connectivity, and environmental sensing can be deployed. Rather than relying on centralized entities to build and maintain infrastructure, DePINs distribute that responsibility—and the value that flows from it—to the individuals who help operate them. In Spexi's case, that infrastructure layer is Earth imagery. “Most infrastructure is built top-down—slow, opaque, and exclusive,” said Spexi CEO, Bill Lakeland, in my interview with him. In this model, Spexi is more than a drone company. It becomes a spatial protocol serving carbon markets, AI models, insurance claims, smart city systems, and logistics providers that require verified, high-resolution, and frequently updated ground truth. Before launching Spexi, Lakeland spent two decades in traditional aerial mapping, operating fixed-wing aircraft with high-resolution cameras to capture imagery for municipalities and insurers. But as demand grew for more frequent and localized imagery, he saw the economics of traditional mapping collapse—too slow, too costly, and too infrequent to meet the pace of climate-driven disasters. Spexi now coordinates a fleet of sub-250g drones—lightweight enough to avoid stricter aviation requirements in most jurisdictions—flown autonomously by distributed pilots via a mobile app. These drones capture 25-acre tiles known as Spexigons, creating a uniform spatial grid across diverse terrain. “Most people don't even hear the drone,” said Alec Wilson, Spexi's cofounder and COO. “It's just a quiet, nearly invisible layer in the sky.” To date, over 4,000 pilots have flown nearly 100,000 missions, covering more than 2.3 million acres across 170 cities in North America and Europe. Each flight generates a Proof of Capture: a hashed packet of GPS telemetry, altitude, timestamp, and image metadata recorded on-chain in real time. These are cryptographically verifiable receipts of where, when, and how an image was captured. “We're minting [soulbound NFTs] that prove an image was captured by a compliant drone, at a specific time, place, and elevation.” The system was originally deployed on Flow but has since migrated to Ethereum Layer 2 Base, enabling low-cost validation and compatibility with the broader EVM ecosystem. This architecture makes Spexi's data not just visually accurate, but cryptographically trusted—critical for downstream use in AI pipelines, insurance claims, or regulatory-grade climate models. Over time, the team expects tokens to govern protocol upgrades, incentive structures, and access policies, drawing inspiration from prior DePIN networks like Helium and Render, but tuned for the unique demands of drone-based capture. Today, pilots are paid in fiat and accrue non-transferable reputation scores based on mission performance. “You can't fake your way into high rep,” Wilson said. Eventually, reputation may become a requirement for accessing sensitive zones or validating other contributors' data. The platform aims to be a trusted data layer for real-world systems where verifiability matters. While the imagery supports insurance claims, city planning, and AI model training, it is not a substitute for licensed land surveys. During Canada's 2023 wildfire season, Spexi imagery was used to assess damage in Kelowna and Shuswap, enabling faster, more informed, and safer decision-making by emergency responders. And after devastating fires in the Palisades region of Los Angeles, Spexi imagery allowed residents and officials to verify house-by-house damage—sometimes identifying the only home left standing on a block. Cities are also tapping Spexi for urban tree canopy tracking and infrastructure assessments. Insurance firms use it to benchmark post-disaster scenes against standardized Spexigon archives. And in San Francisco, Spexi is capturing dense imaging missions using Gaussian Splatting, supporting spatial computing models that reconstruct photorealistic environments for AI agents and simulation. The platform is also preparing to serve carbon markets. With validation underway by Greenlines Technology, Spexi is quantifying a 99.7% emissions reduction versus fixed-wing flights and developing MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, Verification) tools to support reforestation and permanence tracking. “Especially in carbon, where permanence matters—if a forest burns, that offset should be void.” Because Spexi's drones fall below 250 grams and operate under strict protocols, missions comply with aviation regulations in most jurisdictions without requiring pilot licenses. The company also adheres to strict privacy standards, redacting faces, license plates, and private property details. “We hold ourselves to street view standards,” Wilson said. Users currently access Spexi imagery via the World Viewer web app, which can render panoramic drone captures within 15 minutes of upload. APIs and developer portals are now rolling out, with orthomosaic products coming soon—enabling Spexi's data to plug directly into third-party tools, dashboards, or AI pipelines. In a world increasingly shaped by climate risk, AI automation, and decentralized coordination, infrastructure must evolve beyond centralized planning and institutional control. “We're building the most accessible ultra-high resolution Earth imagery network in history,” the company said, “powered by drones, owned by users, and designed for a future where geospatial data is open, decentralized, and fuels the next generation of real-world intelligence.” Disclaimer: The views expressed in this article are those of Infinity Advisory LLC and do not necessarily reflect the views of any affiliated organization.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a sharp reversal from last week's euphoric record highs and $300,000 bitcoin price targets, some of crypto's most followed traders are now warning of looming downside risks for both bitcoin BTC$116,864.09 and ether (ETH). Bitcoin is currently trading at $115,000, down nearly 3% overnight, but relatively comfortable within its recent $112,000 to $124,000 range. ETH, meanwhile, is down by 5% over the past 24 hours at $4,317, though still 21% from a month earlier. Among the possible reasons for Monday's decline are jitters around the Federal Reserve's potential rate cut in September, which would benefit risk assets liks crypto. Andrew Kang, co-founder of Mechanism Capital, was one of the loudest voices predicting crypto downside on Monday, suggesting ETH could be staring at billions in liquidations as leveraged positions unwind. “Would estimate we're about to hit $5 billion in ETH liquidations across exchanges,” Kang posted on X. He forecast a possible slide in ether's price to between $3,200 and $3,600, warning the market was “not ready to find out what happens when that buying dissipates.” His comments follow the launch of ETH DATs (Deposit Access Tokens), which drove short-term demand but may now face a vacuum of momentum. The bearish tone comes against the backdrop of a record-breaking validator exit queue, with 885,000 ETH ($3.8 billion) awaiting withdrawal from Ethereum's staking mechanism, as CoinDesk reported last week. The comments reflect a stark shift in sentiment, demonstrating the fragile psychology that drives crypto markets where bullish and bearish narratives can quickly unravel. Before joining CoinDesk in 2022 Oliver spent three years as the chief reporter at Coin Rivet. Stellar's XLM dropped 6% in under 24 hours as institutional selling overwhelmed the market, with heavy liquidations setting resistance at $0.42 and leaving prices stagnant near $0.41.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin's price retreated below $115,000 on Monday as two major corporate buyers, Strategy and Metaplanet, announced additions to their Bitcoin treasuries, highlighting the growing trend of institutional accumulation despite market volatility. Metaplanet, the Tokyo-listed company, acquired 775 BTC for approximately $93 million at an average price of $120,006 per coin, bringing its total holdings to 18,888 BTC acquired for $1.94 billion. Simultaneously, Michael Saylor's Strategy reported purchasing 430 BTC for $51.4 million between August 11-17, at an average price of $119,666 per coin. The US-based company's total holdings now stand at 629,376 BTC, acquired at an average price of $73,320 per coin, with an aggregate purchase value of $46.15 billion. This rapid expansion reflects growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a treasury asset, despite short-term price fluctuations. Companies are increasingly viewing Bitcoin as a strategic asset class, with new entrants joining the market almost daily. Metaplanet's systematic approach to Bitcoin acquisition has been particularly noteworthy, with the company executing over 20 separate purchases since July 2024, growing its holdings from under 200 BTC to its current position. The company reported a Bitcoin Yield of 29.3% for the latest period, though down from 129.4% in Q2, while maintaining a near-record low multiple to net asset value. Strategy has also updated its equity issuance guidance, announcing it will tactically issue shares to fund debt obligations and preferred equity dividends when its modified Net Asset Value (mNAV) falls below 2.5x. The increasing sophistication of corporate Bitcoin strategies reflects a maturing market. We're seeing innovative financing structures and treasury management approaches specifically designed for Bitcoin acquisition. The corporate buying activity comes as Bitcoin price trades near $116,000, down from its recent high of $124,000. Despite the pullback, institutional demand remains robust, with U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETFs recording significant inflows and corporate treasuries continuing to accumulate. As more corporations embrace Bitcoin as a treasury asset, the market continues to develop new financial instruments and investment vehicles designed specifically for institutional Bitcoin exposure.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Home - Crypto Presales - Best Altcoins to Buy Now — Top 3 Picks Before Altcoin Season: XRP, Solana & MAGACOIN FINANCE As altcoin season approaches, experts highlight XRP, Solana, and MAGACOIN Finance as the top 3 altcoins to buy before the next bull run and breakout market rotation. With Bitcoin consolidating and Ethereum maintaining strength, many traders are rotating capital into alternative coins that offer greater upside and momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a standout in the altcoin space as the crypto market booms on widening institutional adoption and ETF momentum. While still in its early stages, the project has gathered attention through community engagement, analyst coverage, and whale accumulation. Analysts increasingly highlight MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the memecoins that could deliver outsized gains. As capital rotates in from established names to early-stage coins with viral potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE's blend of strong ecosystem, solid branding, and utility places it on the radar of altcoin-focused investors. For investors and traders looking for hidden gems to accumulate before the next bull run, MAGACOIN FINANCE may be your best bet. With an 85% probability of approval in 2025, multiple ETF applications are nearing final stages. XRP's role in SWIFT's payments upgrade gives it an added boost, positioning it as a top altcoin to buy for investors seeking exposure to utility and compliance. Solana remains one of the strongest ecosystems in crypto, dominating daily activity and decentralized exchange (DEX) volume. Solana's TVL has climbed to $7.65 billion, ranking second among all blockchains. If you're looking for top altcoins to buy now, Solana's speed, scale, and active user base make it a compelling option. As regulatory clarity improves and macro trends favor crypto, early positioning in these top altcoins to buy may offer significant upside. However, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned to outperform, with analysts highlighting it as one of the tokens that will define the next bull run market.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Similarly, Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) are following the bearish trend, with nearly 4% losses. Amid the sell-off, institutional interest in top cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, could face volatility moving forward. The clear imbalance of massive long liquidations suggests a shift to risk-off sentiment among investors. Amid such conditions, the crypto market could face further correction as fear tightens its grip. Despite the pullback at the end of last week, Bitcoin and Ethereum were able to attract significant funds from US institutions. This marks an increase in confidence among institutional investors, which will be put to the test as Bitcoin and Ethereum experience steep declines this Monday. Sosovalue data shows Ethereum marking its largest weekly net inflow of $2.85 billion, marking its fourteenth consecutive week of positive flows. Bitcoin's bullish run from last week's peak at $124,474 on Thursday, resulting in a 4% drop on the day, ignited the ongoing pullback. The path of least resistance targets the $111,980 support level, last tested on August 3, as pressure on Bitcoin intensifies. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 44, below the halfway line, indicating a decline in buying pressure. Ethereum bulls fail to hold over $4,300 as the altcoin depreciates by over 4% at the time of writing on Monday. The MACD approaches its signal line, hinting at a potential trend reversal, as declining green histograms suggest that bullish momentum is fading. XRP's pullback puts a long-standing resistance trendline formed by connecting the June 23 and August 3 lows, and the 50-day EMA at $2.94 to test. The developer or creator of each cryptocurrency decides on the total number of tokens that can be minted or issued. Only a certain number of these assets can be minted by mining, staking or other mechanisms. On the other hand, circulating supply can also be decreased via actions such as burning tokens, or mistakenly sending assets to addresses of other incompatible blockchains. Trading volume refers to the total number of tokens for a specific asset that has been transacted or exchanged between buyers and sellers within set trading hours, for example, 24 hours. It is used to gauge market sentiment, this metric combines all volumes on centralized exchanges and decentralized exchanges. Increasing trading volume often denotes the demand for a certain asset as more people are buying and selling the cryptocurrency. Funding rates are a concept designed to encourage traders to take positions and ensure perpetual contract prices match spot markets. It defines a mechanism by exchanges to ensure that future prices and index prices periodic payments regularly converge. This means traders who are bullish and have opened long positions pay traders who are in short positions. On the other hand, a negative funding rate means perpetual prices are below the mark price, and hence traders with short positions pay traders who have opened long positions.

Monero (XMR) trades in the green at press time on Monday, marking its third consecutive day of uptrend. The privacy coin aims to reclaim its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), backed by increased demand from Qubic, which now controls over 51% of the Monero hashrate. Dogecoin (DOGE) price trades in red, slipping 4% at the time of writing on Monday, bringing it closer to the critical $0.21 support level; a firm close below could extend further downside. The decline comes as the Qubic community, which recently carried out a 51% attack on Monero (XMR), voted to target DOGE memecoin next. Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) are showing signs of weakness as momentum fades across the broader crypto market. BTC and XRP are hovering near the critical $116,000 and $2.99 supports, respectively, while ETH struggles to break above $4,488 resistance. Altcoins such as Arbitrum (ARB) and MemeCore (M) follow the bullish trend, gaining traction after a recovery run on Sunday. Bitcoin (BTC) price experiences a whirlwind week, surging to a new all-time high of $124,474 before sharply retreating to hover around $118,800 at the time of writing on Friday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hiring in crypto is hard – Campus makes it easy. Try The Block's hiring tool for free today. Bitcoin treasury giant Strategy disclosed another purchase of 430 BTC for $51.4 million, bringing its stash to about 629,376 BTC as of Monday. The company said it paid an average of $119,666 per bitcoin in its latest round of purchases, continuing a capital-markets-funded accumulation campaign that has made it the world's largest publicly traded holder of the asset. The latest purchases were funded with proceeds from Strategy's at-the-market preferred programs. Between Aug. 11 and Aug. 17, the company sold 179,687 shares of its Series A Perpetual Strike (STRK) for $18.0 million face value and $19.3 million in net proceeds. There were no sales under the Common ATM or the variable-rate Series A Perpetual Stretch (STRC) during this period, according to a Form 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. STRK pays an 8.00% coupon while STRF and STRD each pay 10.00% as perpetual preferreds. Those programs complement the firm's “42/42” plan targeting $84 billion of equity and convertible notes for bitcoin acquisitions through 2027, upsized from the original “21/21” strategy after equity capacity was exhausted. Five years after its first bitcoin purchase in 2020, Strategy now holds about $72.4  billion in BTC at current prices, acquired at an average $73,320 per coin for a total outlay of roughly $46.2 billion, including fees, co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor shared on Aug. 18. Monday's move followed a weekend teaser from Saylor, who posted “Insufficient orange” on X alongside a SaylorTracker image showing Strategy at 628,946 BTC, valued at about $74.5 billion before today's market slide. Strategy's balance-sheet firepower has also swelled alongside its BTC buying. In the second quarter, the company reported record net income of $10 billion and about $14.03 billion in operating income, a 7,106% year-over-year jump, driven largely by unrealized gains on its bitcoin holdings. Additionally, the figures reflect the new U.S. accounting standard that lets companies carry digital assets at fair value, recording mark-to-market gains and losses each quarter rather than only impairments. A stronger earnings backdrop has fed directly into Strategy's financing machine. Wall Street analysts have lauded the firm's market cap to net asset value-focused (mNAV) issuance model, known as capital precision, for its ability to tap preferreds, convertibles, and ATM programs when the company's market value exceeds the implied bitcoin per share. The Block's data dashboard shows multiple public companies controlling a multi-billion-BTC stack, with U.S. firms like miners MARA, Riot, Galaxy Digital, and newcomers such as Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company and Trump Media among the largest recent contributors. A few Asian-based firms also feature in the mix. After last week's disclosed add, the company's BTC balance sheet sits even closer to 3% of bitcoin's 21 million supply cap. The stock still trades at a sizable mNAV premium, a feature some see as a funding advantage given the firm's ability to issue equity and preferreds against that premium to acquire more BTC. TD Cowen has argued that Strategy's preferred-stock program is highly accretive, helping explain why the market has been willing to sustain a premium.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You might expect that the blockchain behind the world's third-largest cryptocurrency would earn top marks for security after more than a decade of operation. But you'd be wrong — at least according to blockchain research firm Kaiko. The XRP Ledger, which underpins the XRP token, ranked last for security in Kaiko's latest quarterly Blockchain Ecosystem Ranking, scoring just 41 out of 100. Kaiko's ranking evaluates blockchain networks across five criteria: governance, integration, liquidity, operational efficiency, and security. The security component includes assessments of operational resilience, validator decentralisation, audit frequency, and past incidents to evaluate infrastructure risks. While Kaiko did not publish individual sub-scores, senior analyst Adam Morgan McCarthy told DL News that “the main issues were the hack earlier this year, a poor Nakamoto coefficient, and a low number of validators.” In April, a hacker compromised an official software package used by XRPL developers, injecting malicious code capable of stealing users' private keys. Although the core ledger and GitHub repository were not affected, the breach put users at risk and raised alarms around XRPL's software supply chain security. Unlike Ethereum and Solana, which rely on large, open validator sets — over 1 million and 1,700, respectively — the XRP Ledger operates with around 190 active validators. However, only 35 of these are included in its default unique node list — a trusted subset used by most participants to reach consensus. While this design aims to optimise speed and reliability, critics say it limits diversity and makes the system more vulnerable to coordinated disruption. This limited validator distribution is reflected in XRP Ledger's low Nakamoto coefficient score. XRP Ledger architect and Ripple CTO David Schwartz did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
