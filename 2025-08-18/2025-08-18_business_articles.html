                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is CNBC's live coverage of President Donald Trump's meetings with European leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Aug. 18, 2025. CNBC reporters are covering the summit live, on air and online from our bureaus in Washington; New York; London; Singapore; San Francisco; and Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. "The latest from the next meeting on, I can't imagine that the next meeting would [take] place without a ceasefire, so let's work on that, and let's try to put pressure on Russia," he says. So if we can do the ceasefire, great, and if we don't do a ceasefire, because many other points were given to us, many, many points were given to us, great points." Russia is opposed to a temporary ceasefire, and Trump took the same view after his recent summit with Putin in Alaska. Zelenskyy also says that they will "speak more about security guarantees." Trump said, "We also need to discuss the possible exchanges of territory, taking into consideration the current line of contact" between Ukraine and Russia. Trump has suggested in the past that Ukraine would have to formally cede territory to Russia, including the Crimea region. Trump, who opens by saying that "we've had a very successful day thus far," began the meeting introducing the European leaders. "We're really honored that you guys came over," Trump says. Trump is poised to soon take a photo with the European leaders, according to the White House schedule, which this morning said it would take place around 2:30pm ET. Some of the European leaders have indicated that they will make a statement after their meeting with Trump. "Everything," Zelenskyy says when asked by a reporter in the Oval Office what security guarantees he's looking for from Trump to reach a deal. "And second, we will discuss with our partners. Trump says he will call Putin directly following his meetings with Zelenskyy and other European leaders. "I just spoke to President Putin indirectly, and we're going to have a phone call right after these meetings today," Trump says in the Oval Office. If that leads to a trilateral meeting between Russia, Ukraine and the U.S., then "there's a good chance of maybe ending" the war, Trump says. Trump reiterates that he doesn't think there should be a ceasefire in the ongoing war. "We can work a deal where we're working on a peace deal while they're fighting," Trump says from the Oval Office. "They have to fight, I wish they could stop, I'd like them to stop, but strategically that would be a disadvantage for one side or the other," he continues. Zelenskyy jabbed a reporter who had previously questioned his sartorial choices. When the Ukraine leader eschewed a jacket and tie during his first visit to the White House in February, reporter Brian Glenn for the conservative network Real America's Voice asked, "Why don't you wear a suit?" This time around, Zelenskyy appeared in the Oval wearing an all-black suit, and Glenn, in a callback, said he looked "fabulous." Trump bemoaned how the media treats him during his meeting with Zelenskky after conservative journalist Brian Glenn asked if the press wanted him to fail. Now I get the worst publicity," Trump said. Trump says that if "everything works out well" during his meeting with Zelenskyy, he would likely move towards a trilateral meeting with the Ukrainian leader and Putin. "I think there will be a reasonable chance of ending the war when we do that," Trump says from the Oval Office. Zelenskyy also says that he is "ready for [a] trilateral." Trump says in the Oval Office that he hopes a "lasting peace" between Ukraine and Russia can be reached "immediately." "I hope it doesn't have to go on. And I think people of the whole world is going to be very happy when that's announced," Trump says. Kirill Dmitriev, the head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund and one of Putin's top negotiators, made clear that Moscow remains opposed to any short-term ceasefire deal with Ukraine. Dmitriev on X posted an emoji of a dove with an olive branch in its beak after the words "Lasting Peace," contrasting that goal with a "Temporary Ceasefire." Trump echoed the same sentiment after his summit with Putin in Alaska. Meloni of Italy arrived at the White House a few minutes before 12:30pm ET. Just before arriving at the White House, Zelenskyy says European leaders are united in pursuit of a lasting peace. "Our main goal is a reliable and lasting peace for Ukraine and for the whole of Europe," he said. Rutte arrived at the White House a few minutes after noon ahead of Zelenskyy's meeting with Trump. Zelenskyy's first visit to the White House in late February devolved into a stunning on-camera argument, with Vance accusing him of disrespect and Trump claiming that he was "gambling with World War III." The European leaders accompanying Zelenskyy to the White House are expected to participate in a lunch upon their arrival. Zelenskyy, who is poised to meet with Trump at 1:15pm ET, is meeting at the Ukrainian embassy in Washington, D.C., ahead of the meeting. Von der Leyen and Stubb attended the meeting at the embassy, and other European leaders are likely to also join. After the European leaders' meeting with Trump, which is set to begin at 3pm ET, some are expected to make public remarks. He will head directly to the White House. Today's meetings come three days after Trump and Putin met in Anchorage, Alaska, for several hours, but ended that session without a ceasefire that the U.S. president had said he wanted. On Saturday, Trump wrote on Truth Social: "It was determined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a Peace Agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere Ceasefire Agreement, which often times do not hold up." Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that a ceasefire was "not off the table." Starmer has landed at Joint Base Andrews outside of Washington, D.C., for the planned meetings. "Together with the US, the EU will continue working towards a lasting peace that safeguards Ukraine's and Europe's vital security interests," Costa wrote in a tweet. Michael O'Hanlon, foreign policy research director at the Brookings Institution, says that one question ahead of the talks is whether the U.S. can "cajole President Zelenskyy into at least a de facto swap," giving up some land in exchange for a peace deal. "It may not have to be something that could be legally blessed and Ukraine could still retain its claims to all the land ... but acknowledge that for now and forever it's not going to fight to get that land back," he tells CNBC. He says that he believes European leaders are "pragmatic enough to know that Ukraine's not going to win back all of its land." Oil prices are barely budging ahead of Trump's talks with Zelenskyy and other European leaders, as investors look for developments on Russia's war in Ukraine that could affect global energy flows. That lack of movement coincides with Trump appearing to back off his threats to impose additional sanctions on Russia, even though his Alaskan summit with Putin produced no ceasefire or peace agreements. Russia has faced U.S. sanctions on parts of its oil industry over the war. But Trump recently hit a third country, India, with higher tariffs because, he said, it continues to buy Russian oil. Peter Navarro, one of Trump's top trade advisors, slammed India earlier today for continuing to buy Russian crude oil, calling the Asian nation "opportunistic" in an op-ed for the Financial Times. UK Prime Minister Starmer posted a video on X from his plane explaining his reasons for flying to  Washington to meet with Trump and Zelensky. "This war in Ukraine's been going on a really long time now, I mean, three-plus years. "But we've got to get this right," Starmer added. "We've got to make sure there is peace, that it is lasting peace, and that is fair and that it is just, and that's why I'm traveling to Washington with other European leaders to discuss this face-to-face with President Trump and President Zelenskyy." These are the key issues," Zelenskyy said afterwards. European leaders plan to begin arriving at the White House around 12 p.m. The two leaders are scheduled to begin bilateral talks there at 1:15 p.m. While it's unusual for so many European leaders to travel to the White House at once, each making the trip has already met with Trump during his second term. While this will be von der Leyen's first time at the White House this term, she has met with the president before, including last month in Turnberry, Scotland. Rutte has traveled to the White House at least twice since Trump's return to office, once in March and the other time in July. Starmer, Merz, Meloni and Macron have all previously met with Trump at the White House at least once, while Stubb is making his first trip this term. Stubb played golf with Trump earlier this year, however. Trump continued to complain about the ongoing criticism of his summit with Putin in Alaska last Friday, which ended with no ceasefire or peace deal and was followed by an abridged "press conference" that allowed no questions from the press. "I am totally convinced that if Russia raised their hands and said, 'We give up, we concede, we surrender, we will GIVE Ukraine and the great United States of America, the most revered, respected, and powerful of all countries, EVER, Moscow and St. Petersburg, and everything surrounding them for a thousand miles, the Fake News Media and their Democrat Partners would say that this was a bad and humiliating day for Donald J. Trump, one of the worst days in the history of our Country,'" Trump wrote on Truth Social. Thank you for your attention to this matter!!!" Hours before his meeting with Trump, Zelenskyy accused Russia of deliberately attacking civilian targets in Ukraine in order to undermine the upcoming peace talks at the White House and raise pressure on Kyiv and Europe. "This was a demonstrative and cynical Russian strike," Zelenskyy wrote in an X post that included video footage of an apartment building on fire with massive holes in its roof. He said at least 10 people have been killed and dozens more injured in Russian attacks in Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia and the Sumy region. He also said that Russia struck an Azerbaijani-owned energy facility in Odesa, calling it "an attack not only on us but also on our relations and energy security." "That is why reliable security guarantees are required. That is why Russia should not be rewarded for its participation in this war. And it is Moscow that must hear the word: 'Stop.'" Trump said it is "a big day at the White House" in a Truth Social post ahead of his meeting with Zelenskyy. "We have never had so many European Leaders here at one time," he wrote, calling the convening of leaders across the European Union a "great honor for America." The European leaders, which include French President Emmanuel Macron, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, are set to arrive at the White House at noon.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Satellite internet service Starlink, which is owned and operated by Elon Musk's SpaceX, appeared to suffer a brief network outage on Monday, with thousands of reports of service interruptions on Downdetector, a site that logs tech issues. SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The network's July 24 outage lasted for several hours, with SpaceX Vice President of Starlink Engineering Michael Nicolls blaming the matter on "failure of key internal software services that operate the core network" behind Starlink. That outage followed the launch of T-Mobile's Starlink-powered satellite service, a direct-to-cell-phone service created to keep smartphone users connected "in places no carrier towers can reach," according to T-Mobile's website. SpaceX provides Starlink internet service to more than six million users across 140 countries, according to the company's website, though churn and subscriber rates are not publicly reported by the company. The SpaceX Starlink constellation is far larger than any competitor. It currently features over 7,000 operational broadband satellites, according to research by astronomer Jonathan McDowell. On Monday, Musk's SpaceX successfully launched another group of satellites to add to its Starlink constellation from the Vandenberg Space Force Base in Southern California. SpaceX is currently aiming to increase the number of launches and landings from Vandenberg from 50 to about 100 annually. On Thursday last week, the California Coastal Commission voted unanimously to oppose the U.S. Space Force application to conduct that higher volume of SpaceX launches there. The Commission has said that SpaceX and Space Force officials have failed to properly evaluate and report on potential impacts of increased launches on neighboring towns, and local wildlife, among other issues. President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order seeking to ease environmental regulations seen by Musk, and others, as hampering commercial space operations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hamas has agreed to a 60-day ceasefire proposal with Israel that includes the return of half the hostages held in Gaza and Israel's release of some Palestinian prisoners, an Egyptian official source said on Monday. Senior Hamas official Basem Naim confirmed the group's approval on Facebook. Hamas said other Palestinian factions informed mediators of their approval also. Egypt and Qatar have been mediating between the sides with U.S. support. Thousands of Palestinians fearing an imminent Israeli ground offensive have left their homes in eastern areas of Gaza City, now under constant Israeli bombardment, for points to the west and south in the shattered territory. In an apparent show of force on Monday, Israeli tanks advanced into the Sabra suburb of Gaza City, according to witnesses who counted the presence of at least nine tanks and bulldozers. Israel's Army Chief of Staff, Lieutenant-General Eyal Zamir, said his country was at a turning point in the Gaza war, "with its focus on enhancing the strikes against Hamas in Gaza City," the military spokesman said in a statement. In a video issued by his office, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: "I, like you, hear the reports in the media, and from them you can get one impression - Hamas is under immense pressure." The Egyptian official source stated that the proposal accepted by Hamas included a suspension of Israeli military operations for 60 days and outlined a framework for a comprehensive deal to end the nearly two-year-old conflict. A source familiar with the negotiations said the proposal closely mirrored an earlier plan put forward by U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, which Israel had accepted. Israel approved the plan to take control of Gaza City earlier this month, but officials had said it could take weeks to start, leaving the door open for a ceasefire, even though Netanyahu had said it would get under way "fairly quickly" and end the war with Hamas' defeat. Netanyahu has described Gaza City as Hamas' last big urban bastion. But with Israel already holding 75% of Gaza, the military has warned that expanding the offensive could endanger hostages still alive and draw troops into protracted and deadly guerrilla warfare. Dani Miran, whose son Omri was taken hostage on October 7, said he feared the consequences of an Israeli ground offensive in Gaza City. "I'm scared that my son would be hurt," he told Reuters in Tel Aviv on Monday. Ahmed Mheisen, Palestinian shelter manager in Beit Lahiya, a war-devastated suburb abutting eastern Gaza City, said 995 families had departed the area in recent days for the south. "I am heading south because I need to ease my mental state," Mousa Obaid, a Gaza City resident, told Reuters. "I do not want to keep moving left and right endlessly. The last round of indirect ceasefire talks ended in deadlock in late July with the sides trading blame for its collapse. Israel has said it will agree to cease hostilities if all the hostages are released and Hamas lays down its arms - the latter demand publicly rejected by the Islamist group until a Palestinian state is established. A Hamas official told Reuters earlier on Monday the group rejected Israeli demands to disarm or expel its leaders from Gaza. Sharp differences also appeared to remain over the extent of an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and how humanitarian aid will be delivered around the enclave, where malnutrition is rife and aid groups warn of unfolding famine. U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on his social media platform on Monday: "We will only see the return of the remaining hostages when Hamas is confronted and destroyed!!! The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed across the border into southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies. More than 61,000 Palestinians have since been killed in Israel's ensuing air and ground war in Gaza, according to local health officials who do not distinguish between fighters and non-combatants.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The three-day competition hosted in Beijing wrapped on Sunday, attracting 280 teams from 16 countries, including the U.S. Teams used robots manufactured by Chinese companies such as Unitree and Booster. "Robots have stronger joints and core strength," said Guo Tong, who programmed one of the futuristic footballers for his team, Hephaestus. Guo said he sees robots replacing his idol, soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo, by 2050. "Robots are easier to coach," Chinese Olympic boxer Li Yang told CNBC while watching his robot slug it out with another. Hangzhou-based Unitree, seen as a competitor to Tesla's Optimus, won multiple medals. Beijing-based X-Humanoid and Hong Kong-listed Shenzhen firm UBTECH also impressed. The Chinese government has targeted humanoid robots as a key future industry for the economy and Beijing has plans to build a world-class industry of humanoid robots by 2027. The games are the latest in a series of events and programs aimed at promoting humanoid robot technology. China announced plans to hold its second Olympics-style event for humanoid robots next August. Robots also put job skills to the test, showcasing their abilities as drug store clerks, factory workers, and hotel staff. One challenge for a robot in housekeeping was to pick up all the garbage in a mock hotel room and take out the trash. Referees told CNBC the biggest obstacle for those robots was opening and closing the door. Robot designer Wang Xidong says the competition is key to testing the robots' skills and improving them. "We are refining our robots," Wang said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman warned that the U.S. may be underestimating the complexity and seriousness of China's progress in artificial intelligence, and said export controls alone likely aren't a reliable solution. Over Mediterranean tapas in San Francisco's Presidio — just five miles north of OpenAI's original office in the Mission — Altman offered a rare on-the-record briefing to a small group of reporters, including CNBC. He warned that the U.S.–China AI race is deeply entangled — and more consequential than a simple who's-ahead scoreboard. Asked whether it would be reassuring if fewer GPUs were reaching China, Altman was skeptical. "You can export-control one thing, but maybe not the right thing… maybe people build fabs or find other workarounds," he added, referring to semiconductor fabrication facilities, the specialized factories that produce the chips powering everything from smartphones to large-scale AI systems. His comments come as Washington adjusts its policies designed to curb China's AI ambitions. The Biden administration initially tightened export controls, but in April, President Donald Trump went further — halting the supply of advanced chips altogether, including models previously designed to comply with Biden-era rules. Last week, however, the U.S. carved out an exception for certain "China-safe" chips, allowing sales to resume under a controversial and unprecedented agreement requiring Nvidia and AMD to give the federal government 15% of their China chip revenue. The result is a patchwork regime that may be easier to navigate than enforce. And while U.S. firms deepen their dependence on chips from Nvidia and AMD, Chinese companies are pushing ahead with alternatives from Huawei and other domestic suppliers — raising questions about whether cutting off supply is having the intended effect. China's AI progress has also influenced how OpenAI thinks about releasing its own models. While the company has long resisted calls to make its technology fully open source, Altman said competition from Chinese models — particularly open-source systems like DeepSeek — was a factor in OpenAI's recent decision to release its own open-weight models. "It was clear that if we didn't do it, the world was gonna head to be mostly built on Chinese open source models," Altman said. "That was a factor in our decision, for sure. Wasn't the only one, but that loomed large." Earlier this month, OpenAI released two open-weight language models — its first since GPT-2 in 2019 — marking a significant shift in strategy for the company that has long kept its technology gated behind application programming interfaces, or APIs. An AI model is considered open weight if its parameters — the values learned during training that determine how the model generates responses — are publicly available. While that offers transparency and control, it's not the same as open source. OpenAI is still not releasing its training data or full source code. With this release, OpenAI joins that wave and, for now, stands alone as the only major U.S. foundation model company actively leaning into a more open approach. While Meta had embraced openness with its Llama models, CEO Mark Zuckerberg suggested on the company's second-quarter earnings call it may pull back on that strategy going forward. OpenAI, meanwhile, is moving in the opposite direction, betting that broader accessibility will help grow its developer ecosystem and strengthen its position against Chinese rivals. Ultimately, OpenAI's move shows it wants to keep developers engaged and within its ecosystem. That push comes as Meta reconsiders its open-source stance and Chinese labs flood the market with models designed to be flexible and widely adopted. Some developers have called the models underwhelming, noting that many of the capabilities that make OpenAI's commercial offerings so powerful were stripped out. Altman didn't dispute that, saying the team intentionally optimized for one core use case: locally-run coding agents.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anthropic has told investors it is displeased by the prevalence of a popular kind of investment vehicle being marketed to those eager to get in on the AI boom, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter. It told one of its largest investors, Menlo Ventures, that the venture capital firm must use its own capital and not resort to a special purpose vehicle, or SPV, as it did in a previous funding round, one of the people told BI. SPVs let investors pool their funds for a single, one-off deal. While they allow speed and can be marketed to a wider range of non-institutional investors, SPVs are generally seen as less desirable because most companies prefer to have a direct relationship with investors. With so many people eager to invest in a limited number of AI companies, investors have been sharing stories on social media about being marketed SPVs with extremely high fees. "Many friends including myself have been offered allocation into OpenAI or Anthropic SPVs this week," Michelle Lim, a founder and angel investor, posted last week on X. From what I understand, folks are creating SPVs on top of SPVs and making management fees on top of them. "The feeding frenzy for ownership in the AI labs has spawned a set of bottom feeding multi layered SPV brokers that have no relationship with the company, and straight up grifters," venture capitalist Sarah Guo wrote recently on X. Guo was tweeting generally, not about Anthropic's current fundraising efforts. Still, this shows how SPVs can be considered problematic, even though they're a common tool in the venture capital toolkit. When Anthropic raised funding in late 2023, Menlo Ventures was the lead investor and stepped forward with a $500 million check. So part of the money came from an SPV where a pool of cash from outside investors helped fund the investment. The SPV, revealed in regulatory filings, was an effective way for Anthropic to quickly raise a lot of money to keep up with OpenAI and other competitors. This time, Anthropic is being more choosy, probably because there's so much demand from investors. The startup has seen revenue soar lately, mostly thanks to its Claude models' ability to generate, fix, and deploy software code. Anthropic's round is five times oversubscribed, this person added, so the company has more leverage than it did in previous funding rounds. Since then, investor appetite for AI has only grown more voracious. OpenAI is reportedly seeking a $500 billion valuation in an employee stock sale, making Anthropic, even valued at $170 billion, may look like a relative bargain to some investors, in comparison. Do you have a tip about Anthropic or another AI startup?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The East African nation, rich in copper, cobalt, and iron ore, is seeking to expand its mining industry and establish itself as a major gold producer, according to Reuters. Gold has already become Uganda's largest foreign-exchange earner, generating $3.4 billion in export revenue last year, accounting for about 37% of total exports, although much of that came from re-exported gold. Domestic production has been largely confined to artisanal miners.

"In order to wake up in the minerals sector, we must have full value addition for all minerals like gold, lithium, tin among others," President Yoweri Museveni said. The practice has long been criticised, as it drains potential revenue from Africa while value-added processing is carried out abroad.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The cutthroat race for AI talent has seen tech giants like Meta dangling exorbitant bonuses in the hundreds of millions to lure talent. But Jad Tarifi, who founded Google's first generative AI team, told Business Insider that he would not encourage people to get a Ph.D. just to cash in on the AI hype. "AI itself is going to be gone by the time you finish a Ph.D. Even things like applying AI to robotics will be solved by then. So either get into something niche like AI for biology, which is still in its very early stages, or just don't get into anything at all," Tarifi said. He joined Google in 2012 and spent nearly a decade with the search giant. Tarifi said doctoral studies are an ordeal that only "weird people" — much like he was — should undertake, because it involves sacrificing "five years of your life and a lot of pain." And now, with the world advancing as fast as it is, you can achieve a lot more outside school, he added. "If you are unsure, you should definitely default to 'no,' and focus on just living in the world," Tarifi said. You'll be more adaptive to how things are changed." Degrees that take a long time to complete, like law and medicine, are in trouble, too, Tarifi said. "In the current medical system, what you learn in medical school is so outdated and based on memorization," he said, adding that people might end up "throwing away eight years" of their lives for their advanced degrees. Tarifi said people who want to thrive in the age of AI should develop social skills and empathy. This is because while the hard sciences can be learned, expertise at prompting and using AI involves "emotional attunement" and "good taste." "The best thing to work on is more internal. "For example, you can drive a car, but you might not know every single thing about the car. Tarifi isn't the only one who says that leaning into one's passions will become critical when navigating a world disrupted by AI. Paul Graham, the founder of startup incubator Y Combinator, said in an X post on August 5 that low-level programming jobs are "already disappearing" because AI is "good at scutwork." "So I think the best general advice for protecting oneself from AI is to do something so well that you're operating way above the level of scutwork," Graham wrote.</p>
