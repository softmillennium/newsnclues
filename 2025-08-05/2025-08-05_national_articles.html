When it comes to traveling abroad, some people may be worried about their safety and want to keep their guard up. "My family will be traveling to Paris next month," the person wrote. "It will be our first time visiting Europe, and we are very excited — but also a bit nervous." We won't have a tour guide and will be managing everything on our own." Others on the platform took to the comments section to share advice and their own experiences. Each year some 2,000 Americans report their passports stolen or lost in Paris. "Just know they target tourists," wrote one person. "They only hang out in tourist areas and by your clothing it will be obvious you are not Parisian. They never bother me and I've never been robbed nor has a single person I know." Said a different person, "Stay alert in touristy areas, keep your bag in front of you on the Metro, and avoid engaging with strangers who approach you (anyone)." Carry bags that close, wear a cross-body bag, keep all zippers closed, don't flash cash or jewelry. And if a stranger approaches you to hold something or offers to take your photo, walk away." Said yet another person, "I'm staggered how many tourists I see on the Metro with a backpack on. Makes it so easy for pickpockets to steal from them." A Redditor wrote, "The [number] of people I watched on their phones by the doors of the trains was staggering and does present an opportunistic grab-and-run scenario. Both the U.S. Embassy and the Reddit community have provided pickpocket prevention strategies for tourists who travel to Paris. Each year some 2,000 Americans report their passports stolen or lost in Paris, according to the U.S. Embassy in France. The Embassy and Consulate in France have a whole page dedicated to "Pickpockets in Paris." Says the site, "The first rule of thumb is don't have anything more in your wallet than you are willing to lose." The embassy also advises bringing only one credit card or ATM card along and only one piece of identification. Tourist spots such as the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame and the Champs-Elysées are areas where visitors are most likely to be pickpocketed, according to the embassy. "The first rule of thumb is don't have anything more in your wallet than you are willing to lose." "Americans in Paris should be particularly alert to thieves who commonly work near tourist attractions such as museums, monuments, restaurants, hotels, beaches, trains, train stations, airports, subways and target vehicles with non-local license plates," the embassy cautions. "Two or more people will approach you and ask for directions." You will be swarmed by several people all trying to get on or off." Pickpocketers most frequently use a distraction technique on the streets. While you are occupied with one person, another is picking your pocket," the embassy says. Travelers should also watch out for something getting spilled or thrown on them, as a criminal may offer to help clean up while another person picks your pocket. The Consular Section of the Embassy has information on how to replace certain items which have been stolen or lost. A look at the top-trending stories in food, relationships, great outdoors and more.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rwanda's President Paul Kagame arrives at the Seoul airport in Seongnam, South Korea, for the 2024 South Korea-Africa Summit which will be held on June 4-5, at the Seoul airport in Seongnam, South Korea, June 2, 2024. UN peacekeepers patrol the street in Juba, South Sudan on Feb. 12, 2025. Eswatini's King Mswati III, center, dances during a Reed Dance in Mbabane, Swaziland, on Sept. 3, 2012. The Rwandan government said Tuesday it has agreed to accept up to 250 deportees from the U.S. for resettlement but didn't immediately give any more details, including when they would arrive or what Rwanda got, if anything, out of the deal. The U.S. has already deported eight men it said were dangerous criminals who were in the U.S. illegally to South Sudan and another five to Eswatini. Here's what we know, and still don't know, about U.S. President Donald Trump's expanding third-country deportation program in Africa and the largely secretive deals the U.S. is striking. The U.S. sent eight men from South Sudan, Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar and Vietnam to South Sudan in East Africa in early July after their deportations were held up by a legal challenge. When it took custody of them a month ago, the South Sudan government said it would ensure their “safety and wellbeing” but has declined to give other details, including where the men are being held and what their fate might be. South Sudan has been wracked by conflict since it gained independence from Sudan in 2011 and is teetering on the edge of civil war again. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said they were also violent criminals whose home countries had refused to take them back. Eswatini's government said the men would be held in solitary confinement until their repatriation, and later said that might take up to a year. A human rights lawyer in Eswatini has taken authorities to court alleging the men are being denied legal representation while being held in a maximum-security prison, and questioning the legality of detaining them indefinitely when they have served their criminal sentences in the U.S. Eswatini, which borders South Africa, is one of the world's last absolute monarchies. King Mswati III has ruled since he turned 18 in 1986. Rwanda's deal with the U.S. comes after a contentious migrant agreement it reached with the U.K. in 2022 collapsed and was ruled unlawful by Britain's Supreme Court. That deal was meant to see people seeking asylum in the U.K. sent to Rwanda, where they would stay if their asylum applications were approved. The failed deal ultimately cost the U.K. nearly a billion dollars in public money, including around $300 million that it gave to Rwanda and didn't get back. Rwanda said that the deportees it will take from the U.S. will be resettled there and given work training, healthcare and help with accommodation. Analysts say that African nations might be seeking a range of benefits from the Trump administration in return for taking deportees, including more favorable tariff rates, aid and other financial assistance, and even the easing of sanctions against some of their officials.</p>

Dan Patrick discusses lawmakers fleeing the state to delay a GOP redistricting vote on 'The Ingraham Angle.' The Supreme Court on Friday ordered additional arguments in a major case centered on whether race can factor into drawing congressional maps, a clear sign that redistricting remains top-of-mind for the justices ahead of the 2026 midterms. Justices ordered both parties in Louisiana v. Callais to return for additional arguments next term. At issue is whether Louisiana's latest congressional map — which includes the creation of a second, majority-Black district — should be considered an unconstitutional "illegal racial gerrymander." The Supreme Court order comes months after justices first heard oral arguments in the case in March. It requires both parties to file supplemental briefs by mid-September, outlining in further detail their view of whether Louisiana's intentional creation of a second majority-minority congressional district "violates the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments to the U. S. Supreme Court justices attend the 60th inaugural ceremony on Jan. 20, 2025 at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. (Ricky Carioti /The Washington Post via Getty Images) Louisiana has revised its congressional map twice since the 2020 census. The first version, which included only one majority-Black district, was blocked by a federal court in 2022. 8 was almost immediately challenged by a group of non-Black plaintiffs in court, who took issue with a new district that stretched some 250 miles from Louisiana's northwest corner of Shreveport to Baton Rouge, in the state's southeast. They argued in the lawsuit that the state violated the equal protection clause by relying too heavily on race to draw the maps, and created a "sinuous and jagged second majority-Black district." The Supreme Court said in the unsigned, single-page order that reply briefs should be filed no later than Oct. 3. Oral arguments in March focused heavily on whether Louisiana's redistricting efforts were narrowly tailored enough to meet constitutional requirements and whether race was used in a way that violated the law, as appellees had alleged. The high court's request for additional information comes at a pivotal time for the U.S., as new and politically charged redistricting fights have popped up in other U.S. states ahead of next year's midterm elections. In Texas, tensions reached a fever pitch this week after Democratic state legislators fled the Lone Star State to block Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's ability to convene a legislative quorum needed to pass the state's aggressive new redistricting map, which would create five additional Republican-leaning districts. With an eye to this rule, Democratic lawmakers fled the state to Chicago, New York and Boston — beyond the reach of Texas authorities and of Abbott, who has little power in the near-term to compel their returns. In a press conference Monday, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul stressed the magnitude of the redistricting efforts, and vowed to explore "every option" in redrawing state lines. "We are at war," Hochul said, speaking alongside the six Texas Democrats who fled to her state. "And that's why the gloves are off — and I say, bring it on," she added. The move is part of a broader redistricting push aimed at helping Republicans defend their slim House majority. As with most midterms following a new president's election, 2026 is expected to serve as a referendum on the White House — raising GOP concerns that they could lose control of the chamber.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's part of a congressional probe that lawmakers believe may show links to President Donald Trump and other former top officials. The committee's actions showed how even with lawmakers away from Washington on a monthlong break, interest in the Epstein files is still running high. Trump has repeatedly tried to move past the Justice Department's decision not to release a full accounting of the investigation, but lawmakers from both parties, as well as many in the president's political base, have refused to let it go. Much of the information “was made publicly available at trial or has otherwise been publicly reported through the public statements of victims and witnesses,” prosecutors wrote in court papers Monday. They noted that the disclosures excluded some victims' and witnesses' names. Prosecutors also said last week that some of what the grand jurors heard, the public eventually did too, referring to Maxwell's 2021 trial and various victims' lawsuits. There were only two grand jury witnesses, both of them law enforcement officials, prosecutors said. DOJ attorneys made clear Monday that they're seeking to unseal only the transcripts of grand jury witnesses' testimony, not the exhibits that accompanied it. The White House says Trump later Tuesday is signing an executive order establishing a task force for the Los Angeles games in three years. The administration is calling to remove abortion coverage from the list of medical benefits for veterans and their families, saying it's not needed. The Department of Veterans Affairs posted the proposed rule change Monday and opened a public comment period on it that runs through Sept. 3. The department said in its proposal that it wants to ensure it “provides only needed medical services to our nation's heroes and their families.” Amy Friedrich-Karnik, director of federal policy at the Guttmacher Institute, said in a statement that the change would cut off millions of veterans and their families from services. ▶ Read more about abortion coverage at the Department of Veterans Affairs Lieutenant Governor Juliana Stratton speaks during a news conference in Chicago on Tuesday, Aug 5, 2025. National Democrats are closing ranks behind Texas state lawmakers who've left the state to prevent, at least for now, Republicans from satisfying President Trump's wishes for a gerrymandered congressional map that would help Republicans in the 2026 midterms. Standing with Texas legislators gathered in Illinois, Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin promised Tuesday that the party is “bringing a knife to a knife fight” rather than stand by. He warned that the GOP plan in Texas is “a test case for the rest of the country” and a “model for other red states to lie, cheat and steal away to victory.” JB Pritzker said Tuesday that Trump's push in Texas is “not democracy — that's not America.” He mocked Texas leaders for doing Trump's bidding. “When Donald Trump calls, they say, ‘Yes, sir, right away,'” Pritzker said of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton, who's running for the Senate in 2026. After making observations from the White House roof, Trump walked over to an area above the briefing room, briefly interacting with reporters gathered below. “Just another way to spend my money for this country,” Trump said. Trump may have been surveying ongoing renovation and construction work at the White House. Ukraine and the U.S. are also working on an agreement for bilateral drone production, he said, adding his thanks for Trump's efforts to end the war. Rep. Mike Flood, a Nebraska Republican, faced a heated Town Hall on Monday where hundreds booed him for supporting the GOP-backed tax-break and spending bill President Trump signed last month. Flood called the bill less than perfect, but stood specifically firm on its Medicaid changes. “More than anything, I truly believe this bill protects Medicaid for the future,” Flood said, setting off a shower of boos from the audience of roughly 700 in the University of Nebraska's Kimball Recital Hall. “What is Donald Trump hiding that he won't release the Epstein files?” It's part of a congressional probe that lawmakers believe may show links to President Trump and other former top officials. The committee's actions showed how even with lawmakers away from Washington on a monthlong break, interest in the Epstein files is still running high. Major reproductive rights groups announced Tuesday that they'd filed requests to probe the Trump administration's communications about medication abortion and emergency abortion care. Democracy Forward and Reproductive Freedom For All filed a host of Freedom of Information Act requests for records from the FDA and U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services about key political appointees, including FDA Commissioner Marty Makary and CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz. Makary has expressed openness to re-examining access to the major abortion pill mifepristone, most recently telling PBS “we can't promise we're not going to act on that data that we have not yet seen.” This is despite decades of evidence showing the drug is both safe and effective. The move by abortion rights groups also comes after the Trump administration in June announced it would revoke a guidance directing hospitals to provide emergency abortions for women when they're necessary to stabilize their medical condition. “The public has a right to know how and why the Trump-Vance administration is targeting vital health care and reproductive access,” Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, said in a statement.

President Donald Trump listens during a meeting with Bahrain's Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa in the Oval Office of the White House, Wednesday, July 16, 2025, in Washington. “The Trump administration is trying to suppress honest analysis.” President Trump defended Texas Republicans' decision to redraw the state's congressional map mid-decade, pointing to Democratic-led states where he says Republicans are underrepresented. “They did it to us,” Trump said in a TV interview Tuesday. But in many of the states Trump referenced — including California — partisan lawmakers are not in charge of drawing district lines. During the same interview, Trump also lashed out at Illinois Gov. Trump called Pritzker “probably the dumbest of all governors.” President Donald Trump points to the crowd at an election night watch party, Wednesday, Nov. 6, 2024, in West Palm Beach, Fla. (AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson) Touting his 2024 win and “the best poll numbers,” Trump told CNBC that “I'd like to run again.” But asked by the hosts if he will, Trump replied, “Probably not.” The back-and-forth came as Trump heralded his 2024 win in Texas, a record he said “they say won't be beaten unless I run again.” President Donald Trump shakes hands with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Oval Office of the White House, Thursday, Feb. 13, 2025, in Washington. Trump said on CNBC that higher tariffs could be coming for India. Last week, Trump said the U.S. said it would impose a 25% tariff on goods from India, plus an additional import tax because of India's purchasing of Russian oil. “I think I'm going to raise that very substantially over the next 24 hours because they're buying Russian oil, they're fueling the war machine,” Trump said Tuesday. Trump said tariffs on pharmaceuticals will be “initially small,” but that he would hike it to 150% or 200% over the subsequent year and a half. The president also said he would announce tariffs on semiconductors and computer chips. Trump told CNBC hosts that 35% tariffs will kick in with the European Union if they don't make good on promised investments in U.S. goods. “We're a rich country again,” Trump said, adding that the $600 billion investment can go in “anything I want.” The president said he was considering four people for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's replacement. Not one of them: current Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has indicated to Trump that he wants to stay where he is.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump speaks with reporters before boarding Air Force One at Lehigh Valley International Airport, Sunday, Aug. 3, 2025, in Allentown, Pa. (AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson) WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is establishing a task force on the 2028 Olympic Games being held in Los Angeles. Trump will sign an executive order on Tuesday to make the task force official, the White House said. Trump “considers it a great honor to oversee this global sporting spectacle,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement, calling sports one of the president's “greatest passions.” LA28 president and chair Casey Wasserman said the task force “marks an important step forward in our planning efforts and reflects our shared commitment to delivering not just the biggest, but the greatest Games the world has ever seen in the summer of 2028.” During a briefing Tuesday afternoon, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said the task force would “coordinate across federal, state and local agencies to ensure streamlined visa processes, robust security and efficient transportation.” Along with the 2028 Summer Games, Trump has said that the 2026 FIFA World Cup being hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico is among the events he's most looking forward to in his second term.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former President Bill Clinton, former first lady Hillary Clinton, and the Justice Department have been subpoenaed by the House Oversight Committee to further an investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) issued subpoenas Tuesday to the former president and first lady, along with a slew of others that could have connections to Epstein, as the issue plagues the Trump administration. Along with the Clintons, the committee also subpoenaed eight others for depositions from August through October, including former FBI Directors James Comey and Robert Mueller, former Attorneys General Merrick Garland, Bill Barr, Jeff Sessions, Alberto Gonzales, Loretta Lynch, and Eric Holder. 🚨BREAKING🚨The House Oversight Committee is compelling the following individuals to appear for depositions through issued subpoenas: Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton: October 9Former President Bill Clinton: October 14Former U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland:… They later reported that Clinton was also among the group who wrote a note to Epstein. “It's reassuring isn't it, to have lasted as long, across all the years of learning and knowing, adventures and [illegible word], and also to have your childlike curiosity, the drive to make a difference and the solace of friends,” Clinton's note wrote, according to the Wall Street Journal. The Washington Examiner reached out to a Clinton representative for comment. Epstein's pilot, who testified in Maxwell's trial, listed both Trump and Clinton on the list of those who flew on his private plane, adding that he would be given a notice if high-profile individuals were flying. “In 2002 and 2003, President Clinton took a total of four trips on Jeffrey Epstein's airplane: one to Europe, one to Asia, and two to Africa, which included stops in connection with the work of the Clinton Foundation,” Clinton spokesman Angel Urena told CNN in 2019. As part of Trump's tactics to divert attention away from his involvement with Epstein, he claimed he turned down an offer to visit the island, while calling out other people the press should focus on, Clinton in particular. And many other people that are very big people, nobody ever talks about them,” Trump said in Scotland as he sat with the U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Clinton received the massage from then 22-year-old Chauntae Davies, who served as Epstein's personal masseuse. The Clinton subpoenas are part of three motions that have passed the House Oversight Committee in efforts to unveil more information in relation to the Epstein files following the uproar after the Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigations releasing a two-page memo earlier this month stating there is no evidence Epstein blackmailed people or kept a “client list,” reiterating he died by suicide, a conclusion that has resulted in mounting backlash from Trump's MAGA base. The Oversight Committee has also issued a subpoena for Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's former girlfriend and convicted sex offender in his trafficking scheme. Three Republicans voted with the Pennsylvania Democrat, including Rep. Scott Perry (R-PA), who successfully pushed for a vote to subpoena the former attorneys general and other government officials. On top of House Oversight's subpoenas, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) announced the Epstein Files Transparency Act with Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) to force a vote on the complete release of government files related to Epstein.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Why this obscure survey has life-or-death stakes, and what its future could look like. In that time, it has carried out over 400 nationally representative surveys in more than 90 countries, capturing a wide range of vital signs such as maternal and child health, nutrition, education levels, access to water and sanitation, and the prevalence of diseases like HIV and malaria. Taken together, it offered perhaps the clearest picture ever compiled of global health. And that clarity came from how rigorous these surveys were. Each one started with a globally vetted blueprint of questions, used by hundreds of trained local surveyors who went door-to-door, conducting face-to-face interviews in people's homes. The final, anonymized data was then processed by a single contractor ICF International, a private consulting firm based in Reston, Virginia, which made the results standardized and comparable across countries and over time. Its data powered global estimates from institutions like the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which in turn shaped public health policy, research, and funding decisions around the world. “If DHS didn't exist, comparing anemia across countries would be a PhD thesis,” said Doug Johnson, a senior statistician at the nonprofit IDinsight. Crucially, DHS also tracked things few other systems touched, like gender-based violence, women's autonomy, and attitudes toward domestic abuse. Doctor's offices aren't representative and only capture folks who can access a formal health care system. Also, since DHS data is anonymized, unlike a police report, responders don't have to fear intervention if they don't want it. “You can't get answers from other sources to sensitive questions like the ones DHS posed,” said Haoyi Chen from the UN Statistics Division, pointing to one example: Is a husband justified in beating his wife if she burns the food? Then, earlier this year, DHS was shut down. The decision came as part of the Rescissions Act of 2025, a bill passed in June that clawed back $9.4 billion from foreign aid and other programs. That tiny budget cut has had immediate consequences. The move halted around 24 in-progress country surveys – 10 of which were just short of final publication, and three in Ethiopia, Guinea, and Uganda that were stopped mid-fieldwork. The shutdown isn't just about numbers on a spreadsheet. Here's how DHS data has shaped policy and saved lives across the globe. When governments or aid organizations can no longer see exactly where children are malnourished, where malaria outbreaks are quietly spreading, or where mothers are dying in childbirth, they can't effectively target life-saving interventions, leaving the most vulnerable populations to pay the price. Going forward, “it would just be basically estimates that are based on other countries' data,” says Saloni Dattani, a editor on science and global health at Works in Progress magazine and 2022 Future Perfect 50 honoree. The Gates Foundation recently committed $25 million in emergency funding to rescue some ongoing surveys, and Bloomberg Philanthropies has also stepped in with a separate commitment to support the effort. Everyone agrees that DHS delivered high-quality, trusted data — but it wasn't perfect. Many experts have criticized it as fundamentally “donor-driven,” with priorities that didn't always align with the national interests of the countries it surveyed. This has created a central dilemma for the global development community: is it possible to build a new system that is both genuinely country-led and also globally comparable? Faced with this data vacuum, an obvious question arises: Why can't other global organizations like the World Health Organization or the United Nations simply step in and take over? Think of it this way: The DHS Program was like a single, powerful architecture firm that perfected a blueprint and built houses in 90 neighborhoods for 40 years. And now that the DHS has been dissolved, both Grown and Chen are now part of a UN task force attempting to establish new internationally agreed-upon standards for how health data should be collected and governed. At the same time, other efforts are more focused on the practical work of implementation rather than on global governance. Montana is leading a coalition to “rebuild elements of DHS” by creating a global consortium of research institutions that can provide technical support to countries. These efforts were catalyzed by initial conversations hosted by organizations like the Population Reference Bureau, which brought together donors, government agencies, and global data users to grapple with the shutdown's immediate aftermath. Critics argue that for every India, there are a dozen other nations where the program's sudden collapse is proof that a deep, sustainable capacity was never built. Between this mishmash, the most practical development has been a lifeline from the Gates Foundation, which announced a $25 million investment in “bridge funding.” Separately, in a statement to Vox, Bloomberg Philanthropies confirmed its commitment to fund the completion of an additional 12-country surveys over the next eight months. A source from the Gates Foundation clarified that Bloomberg's commitment is on top of theirs, confirming the two are distinct but coordinated rescue efforts. The Gates Foundation framed its effort as a temporary, stabilizing measure designed to give the global health community a much-needed respite. “We believe data is — and must remain — a global public good,” said Janet Zhou, a director focused on data and gender equality at the Gates Foundation. “Our interim support is helping to stabilize 14 ongoing country surveys. … This investment is designed to give global partners and national governments the time and space needed to build a more sustainable, country-led model for health data.” That support is aimed at the most urgent work: finishing surveys that were nearly complete, like in Ethiopia, and reopening the four-decade-old data archive. Take a look at Nigeria, for example: Fieldwork for its 2023–'24 DHS finished in May 2024, and the questionnaires gathered new estimates of maternal and child deaths. Nigeria also ran a separate study to probe exactly why mothers and children are dying. In principle, the two datasets should dovetail but beyond a headline-numbers report, the full DHS micro-dataset is still in ICF's processing queue — likely frozen after DHS's shuttering. That bottleneck illustrates what critics mean by “donor-driven.” With barely 3 percent of household surveys in low-income countries fully-financed by the local government, the WHO notes, most nations must rely on “externally led surveys…limiting continuity and national ownership.” When the donor funding stops, so does the data pipeline. An ICF spokesperson pushed back saying survey priorities were “primarily shaped by the participating countries.” Yet, of the $25 million that arrived from Gates, a large portion of it will go toward completing large-scale surveys in Nigeria and Kenya, two countries that also happen to be key “geographies of interest” for the Gates Foundation's own strategic priorities, underscoring how funders still steer the spotlight. Insiders I spoke with described ICF's system as a “black box,” with key parts of its methodology controlled by the contractor, leaving countries without the capacity to stand on their own. In response, ICF stated that the program has a “proven track record of building a long-term capacity,” noting that countries like India no longer require its assistance. But critics argue that for every India, there are a dozen other nations where the program's sudden collapse is proof that a deep, sustainable capacity was never built. This dependency creates a fragile system that can, as just happened, collapse overnight, leaving countries unable to continue that work on their own. “DHS has been there for four decades,” she asks, “and why are we still having this program doing the survey for countries?” Existing global health data is already several years out of date due to the pandemic, while crises in maternal mortality and child nutrition continue to unfold. The need is for reliable data now, because the fundamental reality remains: You can't help people you can't see.

Dr. Phil McGraw's Peteski Productions says it voluntarily agreed to pay former Merit Street Media employees their pre-bankruptcy compensation as the legal process plays out. Merit Street Media, which was formed in 2023 and launched Merit TV in 2024, was a joint venture of McGraw's Peteski Productions and Trinity Broadcasting that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July and simultaneously filed a lawsuit against the network that specializes in Christian programming. The initial loan amount fell short once Trinity Broadcasting was allowed to delay a key hearing by three weeks, but Peteski has upped the figure to do the "right thing." Dr. Phil McGraw's Peteski Productions says it voluntarily agreed to pay former Merit Street Media employees their pre-bankruptcy compensation as the legal process plays out. "As this process has played out, one of our top priorities has been to do whatever we can for the workers. We thought the issue of worker compensation would be resolved at a July 29 hearing, but TBN asked for and received a three-week delay. In light of the real needs of the workers for this to be resolved, we felt this was the right thing to do," a Peteski spokesperson told Fox News Digital. Over 150 checks were written for a total of $925,000, according to the memo. The payments occurred outside of official bankruptcy proceedings. McGraw agreed to provide Merit Street with new episodes of his "Dr. Phil Show," primetime specials and other content, while Trinity Broadcasting contributed distribution and production services, according to the lawsuit that essentially blames the Christian broadcaster for the bankruptcy. Dr. Phil McGraw's Texas-based media company filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday. Merit Street accused Trinity Broadcasting of reneging on its obligations and abusing "its position as the controlling shareholder of Merit Street to improperly and unilaterally burden Merit Street with unsustainable debt, doing so either without notice or in direct violation of promises not to do so." The vast majority of former Merit Street Media employees are out of work, while a select few have stayed on based on the supervision of a bankruptcy judge. Merit Street is seeking damages, legal costs, and "further relief as the Court may deem just and proper."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The email arrived at 10:55 p.m. on Friday, July 25, with an upbeat subject line: “Big News: Key Federal Title Funds Set to Release Next Week.” It was sent by North Dakota's schools superintendent, Kirsten Baesler, who is awaiting confirmation to become an assistant secretary at the U.S. Department of Education, the very agency that had been holding back the funds in question—more than $5 billion—from school districts for weeks. “Thank you for your advocacy, patience, professionalism, and persistence as we've waited for these essential funds to flow,” Baesler wrote to local school leaders. Some had spent the summer pondering layoffs and sweating over spreadsheets. “Hopefully, this development will provide greater clarity as you move forward with budget planning for the upcoming year,” Baesler reassured them. But the four-week funding freeze—and the backlash it sparked—showed that cutting popular programs for schoolkids can be as unwelcome in Trump country as it is in coastal cities. Quinta Jurecic: The Supreme Court won't explain itself “After months of being told to ‘wait it out,' districts are now supposed to pick up the pieces and act like everything's fine,” Steven Johnson, the superintendent of Fort Ransom School District, in southeastern North Dakota, told me. “I've got to be honest—this doesn't sit well out here. You can't freeze money that was already allocated, leave schools hanging through hiring season and budget planning, and then expect us to just be grateful when it finally shows up. While the funds were frozen, an informal alliance emerged between rural and big-city educators who pushed back against the president. If the Trump administration's decision to abruptly cut off the funding began as a trial balloon, it ended as a cautionary tale. This is correct, but his proposed solution of sending education “back to the states” has always been a bit misleading. It represents more than 7.5 percent of the Education Department's current budget. The funds pay for after-school programs, teacher training, English-learner services, migrant-education grants, and STEM activities. Many schools rely on the money to pay educators and run summer programs. Educators across the country first learned on June 30 that the money was being frozen, just hours before it was supposed to be released. The closest thing to an explanation came from the Office of Management and Budget, which asserted in a statement that the funds had previously been used to “subsidize a radical left-wing agenda,” support LGBTQ programming, and “promote illegal immigrant advocacy.” Some teachers in Fargo, North Dakota, learned that their annual $500 bonus was abruptly being cut. Officials in California, which had been expecting almost $1 billion from the federal funds, abruptly paused operations for a teacher-training program. In the nation's second-largest school district, Los Angeles, officials braced for “impossible choices” such as potentially having to shut down after-school tutoring or lay off school counselors, the district's superintendent, Alberto Carvalho, told me. Johnson, whose hometown of Fort Ransom, North Dakota, has a population of 2,200 and is 70 miles from the nearest Walmart, made the same case when he spoke with me from his cattle ranch. “So the delay tactics already have hurt.” In a survey conducted last month by the School Superintendents Association, a group that advocates for more federal support for K–12 education, hundreds of school-district leaders from across the country similarly reported that they were planning to lay off teachers and cut classroom programs if the hold on funds persisted into August. David A. Graham: What does the Department of Education actually do? “Withholding these funds will harm students, families and local economies,” the senators wrote. Senator Tommy Tuberville of Alabama did not sign the letter but told reporters on July 17 that he planned to talk with Trump about the funds during a dinner that was planned for the following day. Meanwhile, local and state officials from across the demographic and political spectrum banded together to advocate for the funding's release. On July 21, a group that included school districts and teachers' unions filed a joint lawsuit challenging the halt in funding. Among the plaintiffs were the Kuspuk School District, in remote Alaska, which has about 300 students spread out over 12,000 square miles, as well as Cincinnati Public Schools, which has 35,000 students in about 80 square miles. “They want to do their jobs serving students and communities.” (The case is pending.) That same day, the Department of Education released part of the funding—$1.4 billion for “21st Century Community Learning Centers” grants, which high-poverty states such as West Virginia disproportionately rely on for after-school and summer-school programs. The Trump administration has used civil-rights legislation to go after schools for policies regarding transgender athletes and diversity, equity, and inclusion. Although OMB officials had initially attempted to cast the review as part of Trump's effort to root out liberal ideology from schools, Jon Valant, who researches K–12 policy at the Brookings Institution, told me that the White House was never likely to find much evidence to back up those claims. “But the vast majority of these funds are used in ways that hardly any American would object to.” Ed Hermes, a school-board member in Phoenix, echoed this. I know because my kids are in these programs,” Hermes, a former schoolteacher himself, told me. “This is going to fund kids getting help with their math homework after school.” The White House has asked Congress to slash grants for migrant education, English-language acquisition, and other programs funded by the money that was recently frozen, as part of next year's budget. Whether she will use her new perch to contribute to the Trump administration's goal of shutting down the department or advocate on behalf of schools that rely on federal funds is a question of great concern to educators in her home state. Wayne Trottier, who retired in June as superintendent of the school district in Sawyer, North Dakota (population 307), told me that he'd recently confronted Baesler about the funding freeze. “This is why the Department of Education needs me on staff now and not later,” he recalled her saying. Baesler did not respond to my requests for comment. In an email to superintendents yesterday, she said she was “pleased” to announce that the dollars were now available, and thanked McMahon, North Dakota lawmakers, and local educators “who advocated for the release of these funds.” She could have a tough time in Washington making the case for Trump's proposed cuts. On Thursday, a bipartisan group of lawmakers on the Senate Appropriations Committee passed a spending bill that rejected Trump's plan to scale down the Education Department. In my conversations with school officials from both urban and rural districts, I frequently heard them making the case for each other. “Why are they picking on the Hispanics?” he said at one point. “The federal government is able to support extremely rural areas—areas that, frankly, I don't think could generate that funding on their own if they needed to,” she said. This urban-rural alliance could be tested, however, as Trump aims to move forward with his broader education agenda, which includes advancing school-choice vouchers, filing lawsuits against schools over transgender policies, and promoting what the White House has called “patriotic education.” Some educators I spoke with feared that long-standing cultural divides over immigration, race, gender, sexuality, and how to teach American history could create fissures among school districts that have found common cause in advocating for broadly popular programs such as summer school. “I don't think this is the end at all.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Supreme Court will rehear arguments about the Louisiana congressional map, which could have wider ramifications for other states' maps as mid-decade redistricting is thrust into the spotlight. The request ahead of a second round of oral arguments tees up a pivotal case in the upcoming term, in which justices could further narrow the Voting Rights Act and eliminate mandatory minority-majority districts. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case in March, and the second set of oral arguments is expected as soon as this fall. The case was brought by a group of nonblack voters who argued that the congressional map with two black-majority districts was an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The Louisiana legislature adopted the map in 2024 to include a second black-majority district after a congressional map with only one black-majority district was ruled insufficient under the Voting Rights Act. A federal district court panel sided with the group of nonblack voters, a ruling that was appealed to the Supreme Court. “Isn't saying race is one consideration another way of saying race predominated?” Gorsuch asked during oral arguments. “And how do we square that with the Fourteenth Amendment's promise that race should play no role?” Litigation against state congressional maps citing the Voting Rights Act was brought in several southern states, including Louisiana, Alabama, and Florida, during the redistricting cycle following the 2020 Census. Because of the Democratic Party's dominance with black voters, the creation of minority-majority districts tends to lead to Democratic representatives in Congress. Eliminating or narrowing the Voting Rights Act's ability to create minority-majority districts could result in fewer Democratic representatives in southern states. Thomas, in the dissent, argued that Section 2 does not require “the State of Alabama to intentionally redraw its longstanding congressional districts so that black voters can control a number of seats roughly proportional to the black share of the State's population,” adding, “If it did, the Constitution would not permit it.” The justices appear poised to revisit the constitutionality of Section 2's use to create additional minority-majority districts. As the Supreme Court weighs a challenge to Louisiana's congressional map, Texas's proposal to create new congressional maps has prompted various states to examine mid-decade redistricting efforts. The high court's ruling in Louisiana v. Callais, which is expected by the end of June 2026, could spur more changes to congressional maps.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Israel's restrictions on humanitarian aid in Gaza are, first and foremost, a moral atrocity. There can be no defense for intentionally starving children. But strikingly, the policy has also become a strategic failure for Israel. Its aid limitations, intended to starve out Hamas, have actually strengthened the group's position and handed it new leverage in ceasefire negotiations. International outrage over the past week has prompted important Israeli partners — France, the UK, and Canada — to announce support for recognizing a Palestinian state. Perhaps most importantly, the suffering in Gaza has done severe damage to Israel's alliance with the United States, alienating masses of Democrats and even some MAGA Republicans. It is a point of emerging consensus of well-informed analysts across the political spectrum, who see the recent international uproar over starvation in Gaza as a catastrophe for Jerusalem. “Israel may have massive military superiority in Gaza but as of this week, it has lost the war,” writes Michael Stephens, a Middle East expert at the UK's RUSI think tank. If the policy is such an obvious disaster, both morally evil and strategically disastrous, then why did Israel do it all? The answer, in both cases, is the same: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu depends on Israel's extreme right to stay in office, and they support ever-more-brutal war policies to further their project of Israel reconquering and resettling the Gaza Strip. Netanyahu has, in short, deliberately caused mass suffering and inflicted a strategic disaster on the country he leads — all for the purpose of appeasing a handful of fanatics who hold his future in their hands. Roughly 95 percent of farmland is no longer operational; fishing, a vital activity in the coastal enclave, is now “virtually impossible” at scale, per a UN report. So today, Gazans either receive aid or face starvation — a reality that was already obvious back when Israel announced its aid cutoff back in March. This turned into a full-on effort to starve Hamas out. It then partnered with the US to support a new entity called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation — a parallel aid distribution mechanism alongside traditional UN efforts designed to ensure that Hamas was not, as Israel claimed, stealing supplies. This highly militarized effort did not provide sufficient aid and also led to Israeli soldiers regularly opening fire on crowds of desperate Palestinians trying to get some of the limited supplies. There was, at no point during any of this, even the slightest bit of evidence that the aid cutoff was weakening Hamas's resolve to fight — no wavering in its negotiating stances or signs of mass defection from its fighters. At that point, reserve supplies from before the aid cutoff had all but disappeared — and it became obvious that GHF wasn't providing nearly enough food to make up for Israel's other restrictions. By late July, even some UN aid workers couldn't find sufficient food for themselves. While Israel is used to international criticism, the volume and nature of the outrage was so significant that it was forced to change policy. Israel began airdropping supplies into Gaza, opened up new corridors for UN trucks to provide aid, and unilaterally announced 10-hour daily “pauses” in its military operations in order to facilitate aid provision. Whether these policies actually alleviate hunger in Gaza remains to be seen. But the key point, from a military point of view, is that Israel just proved that it cannot leverage suffering in Gaza into gains at the negotiating table. “[The aid cutoff] actually probably causes Hamas to take a harder line in negotiations.” The October 7 attacks themselves were intended, at least in part, to provoke an Israeli overreaction — something so violent and bloody that Israel would lose the world's post-attack goodwill and even suffer severe political consequences. By cutting off and limiting aid, Israel made a vicious choice that played directly into Hamas's hands. “Months wasted playing a game the enemy couldn't lose, and if you miscalculate the consequences are justifiably on you — on your head,” Haviv Rettig Gur, a prominent right-leaning Israeli journalist, said on his podcast last week. Israel's aid policy “failed so severely,” in Gur's view, “that Hamas has been propped up at every turn, its resilience assured, and all the gains on the battlefield jeopardized.” It is worth dwelling on why Israel cares so much about the current wave of international outrage. Throughout the Gaza war, Israel has been able to ride out increasingly hostile opinions in most countries thanks to its support among the leaders of Western democracies. So long as those relationships are intact, Israel faces few serious threats from global public opinion. It is not that the proposals by countries like Britain, Canada, and France to recognize a Palestinian state mean much in immediate practical terms. Just this week, the EU floated a bid to end some research cooperation with Israel — a punishment that, per key member states, will become more and more likely if the humanitarian situation in Gaza doesn't improve. Israel's decision to knowingly induce an acute starvation crisis has played a clear and direct role in weakening its most important strategic relationship. On the Republican side, President Donald Trump flatly contradicted Israel's claims that there was no starvation in Gaza. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene even described Israel's conduct in Gaza as a genocide. “As a direct result of [Gaza's starvation], we have now seen lower support among Democrats, measured in every way. So if Israel's starvation policy was so obviously self-defeating — to say nothing of its grotesque immorality — why did it do it in the first place? Put together, they suggest there's dim hope of positive changes so long as the current government is in power. Even a single defecting lawmaker could enable a vote in parliament calling for early elections, which polls have long said he would lose. The math makes Netanyahu unusually dependent on the leaders of two extremist factions — Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir — who have repeatedly threatened to jump ship if Netanyahu compromises on maximalism in Gaza. For these radicals, the war is part of a broader ideological agenda. The aid restrictions reflect these twisted values: Last year, Smotrich gave a speech declaring that it would be “just and moral” if Israel chose to “starve and thirst two million [Palestinian] citizens” until the hostages are returned. But it's not just aid: These lawmakers are the reason why this entire war continues despite the lack of obvious military benefits and widespread domestic support for a ceasefire. Smotrich and Ben Gvir have both said they would abandon Netanyahu if he agrees to stop the fighting indefinitely. These threats do not seem idle; Ben Gvir briefly quit the coalition in January in protest of Netanyahu's accession to a temporary ceasefire. There will likely be more so long as this coalition remains in power. Eighty years after Hiroshima, the idea that nuclear war can be controlled is making a comeback. The Ivy League agreements with Trump are a danger to all of higher ed. Democratic voters sympathize much more with Palestinians than Israelis, but you wouldn't know that from looking at the party establishment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem jetted across South America last week, there was one familiar face from President Donald Trump's orbit frequently at her side: Corey Lewandowski. Lewandowski has become a fixture at the Department of Homeland Security, serving as Noem's chief    adviser  . He's not included on the department's leadership list, but in other DHS materials he's been described as chief adviser to the secretary. Lewandowski — who has previously worked as a lobbyist, strategic adviser and campaign operative — has filed a financial disclosure, the DHS official said. CNN has asked for a copy of the disclosure form. Last week, Lewandowski was pictured at Noem's side during meetings in Argentina, the first stop of the secretary's South America swing, and later participated in a bilateral meeting with Chilean and Ecuadorian officials, along with senior Homeland Security officials. It's indicative of the enormous power Lewandowski has amassed during his time at DHS. Lewandowski has directed the firings of personnel, requested employees be put on administrative leave, called agency leaders “to hold them accountable,” and in at least one instance, signed off on billions of dollars in FEMA grant funding, according to multiple sources and documents viewed by CNN. Everyone is terrified of him because he has almost singular authority to fire people,” a source familiar with the dynamic told CNN. Homeland Security officials told CNN Lewandowski is viewed as Noem's gatekeeper. Asked about his role, the senior DHS official described him as an adviser. He served as Trump's campaign manager from June    2015 until he was fired a year later, amid a series of negative stories and internal tensions with other advisers and some of Trump's children. Lewandowski was formally brought on to staff Trump's 2024 campaign just months before Election Day, with the candidate telling his former campaign manager he missed the old days of his first run for the White House. Trump's co-campaign managers at the time, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, were irked by Lewandowski's efforts to constantly assert himself in high-level decisions, often taking his opinions directly to Trump, sources familiar with the discussions told CNN at the time. His actions, they felt, threatened to subvert a carefully crafted dynamic that Wiles and LaCivita cultivated for the previous two years. In a statement, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson called Lewandowski “one of President Trump's longest and most trusted advisers.” “The tremendous results coming from the Department of Homeland Security – a historically secure border, safer American communities, and successful deportations of criminal illegal aliens – speak for themselves,” Jackson said. Lewandowski also previously advised Noem when she was South Dakota governor. But both Noem and a pro-Trump super PAC cut ties with him in 2021 following allegations that he made unwanted sexual advances toward a GOP donor, accusations Lewandowski denied. Lewandowski eventually returned to Noem's orbit and is now often spotted at the secretary's side as she mounts an aggressive public relations strategy to advance Trump's immigration agenda. The Trump administration has leaned heavily on staunch allies serving in temporary roles — and extended immense authority to those people. But if their time is expected to span longer and they're taking on more responsibilities, then they would face higher requirements, according to experts. Federal agencies typically estimate how long an SGE will stay on board. “Previously, SGEs primarily served in advisory and technical positions that required expertise, and their outside conflicts of interest were less of a concern because they weren't involved in funding and personnel decisions in the same way as a senior career employee,” said Cristin Dorgelo, a former Office of Management and Budget official during the Biden administration. “The management of core government functions has not been something that SGEs have commonly filled roles around.” “This is not what this authority was intended for,” said Sam Berger, a former OMB official and senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Lewandowski's growing influence over DHS is strikingly evident in his relentless push to help the Trump administration dismantle the Federal Emergency Management Agency. On the campaign trail, Trump railed against FEMA for its response to Hurricane Helene, branding it partisan and ineffective – a narrative that grew into calls to eliminate the agency altogether. Lewandowski's hard-charging style quickly set him on a collision course with Cameron Hamilton , Trump's first acting FEMA administrator. The two clashed repeatedly, with Lewandowski ultimately orchestrating Hamilton's abrupt and public downfall, multiple sources told CNN. Behind closed doors, Hamilton pushed back, arguing that the agency's real challenges stemmed from a barrage of congressional mandates — not from its own staff. He became increasingly insistent that FEMA should not be scrapped, warning that the president and Noem were being led astray by bad advice. “Under Secretary Noem's leadership, DHS is unapologetic about its efforts to root out leakers that undermine national security,” the senior DHS official said, adding that the department is “agnostic about your standing, tenure    , political appointment, or status as a career civil servant.” Just hours before he was scheduled to testify before Congress, he was accidentally alerted of his impending termination, after DHS notified FEMA security that his access would soon be shut off. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later blamed Hamilton's testimony for his dismissal, saying, “This individual testified saying something that was contrary to what the president believes and the goals of this administration in regards to FEMA policy.” According to the sources, Lewandowski pushed to install his own loyalist, David Richardson, as Hamilton's successor, though the senior DHS official told CNN this is “categorically false.” Richardson — a personal friend of Lewandowski and DHS official with no prior experience managing natural disasters — had previously received a glowing public review from Lewandowski for his book, “War Story,” which Lewandowski described as “brutal, funny in places, unapologetic. At his first agencywide meeting, Richardson made a point of thanking three people for his new role at FEMA, according to a recording heard by CNN: “I do appreciate that President Trump, Secretary Noem and Corey Lewandowski had the confidence in me to send me here.” Lewandowski's grip on FEMA has only tightened as DHS has expanded its reach, installing more than half a dozen loyalists in FEMA's front office to effectively steer the agency from within. When he wants to kill a proposal, he's been known to scrawl “Denied” or “No” across documents in thick Sharpie, leaving no doubt about who truly holds the reins. Earlier this year, as billions in FEMA grant funds were paused for review, top brass at DHS instructed agency staff to prioritize payments for GOP-led Missouri. Current and former Homeland Security officials describe Lewandowski as Noem's right-hand man who, they say, keeps people in line on behalf of the secretary. That manifests in phone calls and meetings, which can be tense if something has gone awry. “He's the guy that's going to hold you accountable.” When asked about those instances, the senior DHS official said the department's Office of Management is responsible for placing individuals on administrative leave. When there's been abrupt turnover at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Lewandowski has joined the all-hands meetings, according to a former Homeland Security official. He also often travels with the secretary and was on site during a high-profile clash with California Sen. Alex Padilla, who was forcibly removed from a Noem news conference in Los Angeles earlier this year and coerced to the ground after attempting to ask the secretary a question about immigration enforcement operations in the city. Since joining the department, Lewandowski has also been named to other posts. In June, Trump and Noem announced appointments to the Homeland Security advisory council, which was first established in 2002 to provide “real-time, real-world and independent advice on homeland security operations” and relies on experts across industries, many of whom hold posts outside of government. Lewandowski was listed as chief advisor to the DHS secretary.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Massachusetts Municipal Police Training Committee classified Moms for Liberty as a hate group in its training materials, putting it in the same category as groups such as neo-Nazis and antifa, according to a report from the Daily Wire, which obtained the information through a Freedom of Information Act request. The MMPTC prepares over 20,000 police officers throughout Massachusetts for their duties as law enforcement officials. Moms for Liberty was categorized as an “anti-government extremist group,” according to the Daily Wire. The training materials acquired in the FOIA request revealed that the MMPTC claimed that Moms for Liberty “targeted books that reference race and gender identity” and weaponized the concept of parents' rights as a “vehicle to attack public education and make schools less welcoming for minority and LGBTQ students.” Moms for Liberty co-founder Tina Descovich rebuked the classification and subsequent accusations. She said her group encourages mothers to get engaged through activities such as attending school board meetings, among other things. “Moms for Liberty is here to show up at school board meetings, speak out against curriculum, failing schools, inappropriate books maybe in your public school library,” Descovich told the Daily Wire. “We want parents to have the ability to opt out of sexualized books or curriculum, things that don't align with their religious beliefs, as the Supreme Court just affirmed in their most recent ruling in the Montgomery County, Maryland case,” Descovich added. As a matter of fact, our chapter chair there in Plymouth County, Massachusetts, who is the one that brought all this to my attention, said she has local members of their police force come up to her all the time and say, ‘Please keep going. We can't talk about it publicly, but I have kids. The trainings link to a heavily critical article from PBS, which claims that Moms for Liberty is a “well-connected extremist group that attacks inclusion in schools.” It also specified that Moms for Liberty works to get right-wing candidates elected to school boards, the Daily Wire reported. “PBS is anything but fair and balanced,” Descovich said. “And now the state of Massachusetts is using those PBS articles to target us, to put a target on our back and tell police in that state that we are a threat.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Democrats might finally have learned something about Donald Trump — if they hope to beat him, they must get down in the gutter alongside him. Their promises came as they celebrated Democratic Texas state lawmakers who suddenly became the fresh faces of the anti-Trump resistance after facing arrest warrants for fleeing the state in an exodus that ground a special legislative session called by the president's allies to a halt. This all might look like yet another twist in a generationslong struggle by both parties to gerrymander districts to get a leg up in elections. And some voters' eyes might glaze over at what seems like an internal Texas tussle. Democrats currently need a net gain of three seats to take the majority. If the Texas plan passes without a response by another state, they will need eight. That could dash their goal of imposing a clamp on Trump's runaway presidency. There are growing signs American democracy is fraying. Republicans will argue, correctly, that Democrats have mounted their own egregious redistricting schemes in states such as Illinois and Maryland. Longer term, the national political fight that has erupted over Texas looks almost certain to further erode the checks and balances of democracy, however it ends. If both parties now simply go all-out in a national gerrymandering frenzy, they will produce a House of Representatives where it will be even more difficult for incumbents to lose their seats and that will make meaningful political change even harder. Republicans over the last decade have built an unassailable conservative Supreme Court majority that enabled GOP redistricting efforts based on race, including in Texas. In 2024, Democrats initially backed an aging and unpopular President Joe Biden, despite warnings that his candidacy could open the door again to Trump and his anti-democratic project. Some top Democrats see the Texas redistricting showdown as a moment for their party to show more ruthlessness. Kathy Hochul said Monday, alongside several exiled Texas lawmakers, warning that Democrats should forget independent redistricting panels intended to draw fairer maps that represent a complex electorate. Gavin Newsom unveiled a plan for a mid-decade redistricting in his state to match the one underway in deep-red Texas. His proposal would come before voters in November — the latest skirmish in a long-running ideological feud between the two states. But it will only be triggered if Texas moves ahead with its own plan. Newsom said he still favored a national independent districting body, but warned that Democrats needed to respond to the GOP's hardline tactics. And we are reacting to the change — they have triggered this response, and we are not going to roll over.” Potential 2028 Democratic primary candidates, including Newsom and Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois — who has also rushed to back the Democratic Texas lawmakers — have compelling personal interests in joining the fight. In two years, candidates will be asked on a debate stage what they did in the battle over Texas. But they're also seeking to revive a national party pummeled by Trump, which lacks leadership and has left its supporters listless. Grassroots progressives have been pining for someone, anyone, to show some stomach for the fight — even though Democrats lack any power in Washington to meaningfully hurt the president. On that score, a source told CNN on Monday that Attorney General Pam Bondi has ordered prosecutors to launch a grand jury investigation into Obama administration officials over the Russia investigation. As CNN's Eric Bradner reported Monday, the proposed new GOP maps could force two prominent Democratic lawmakers, Reps. Greg Casar and Lloyd Doggett, into a primary against one another. While the Democrats made a statement by leaving Texas, their chances of ultimately prevailing seem thin, given the financial pressure of $500 daily fines for non-attendance and their interrupted livelihoods when they are away. Greg Abbott, a key Trump ally, could call further special sessions later in the year. This is why some Democrats believe that if they can threaten Republican seats in their own states, they might convince House Speaker Mike Johnson to call off his allies in Austin. “Perhaps the Republican members of Congress here in New York could say to their Republican colleagues in Texas — ‘Hey, slow down on this because this could affect us,'” Carl Heastie, the speaker of the New York State Assembly, said. This seems a long shot, however, not least because there are considerable impediments in New York to a swift redrawing of maps. Hochul admitted that that even if everything goes smoothly, redistricting that would bypass New York's current nonpartisan commission could only be in place for the 2028 election — a lifetime away in Trump-era politics. So, if an outside Texas strategy is unlikely to force the Texas Republicans to back down, why are Democrats pursuing it? This may be one of those times in politics when a party can win something by losing. Democrats might not only engage their demoralized partisans by taking the fight to Trump on Texas; they can use the battle to organize and focus their message as they grapple for traction after a grim political year. Defending democracy might be a desirable project in the abstract. And impassioned warnings from Democratic leadership about how Trump would threaten democracy didn't stop his reelection. Hochul and other Democrats seemed on Monday to be reaching for a way to connect the democracy question to more immediate voter concerns through the prism of the Texas power grab. She argued that stopping such schemes was critical to charting a path back to power so Democrats could reverse Trump's policies on tariffs and deportations. That will require a toughening of the Democratic approach, one that underscores the distance traveled since former first lady Michelle Obama warned that when Republicans like Trump go low, “we go high.” “With all respect to the good governance groups, politics is a political process,” Hochul said, dismissing “purity tests” that would make electoral maps fair to everyone involved through nonpartisan commissions. “If Republicans win the legislature, they can have at it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rep. Mike Flood faced a barrage of criticism at a packed town hall in Lincoln, Nebraska, Monday evening as audience members repeatedly confronted him over his support for President Donald Trump's “big, beautiful bill,” immigration policy and what they described as threats to democracy. And more than anything, I truly believe this bill protects Medicaid for the future,” Flood said, speaking over outbursts from the crowd. Flood, one of few members of his party to hold in-person events during spring's congressional recess as the GOP looked to avoid blowback from the president's DOGE initiative, heeded the National Republican Congressional Committee's updated guidance to focus this August district work period on selling Trump's agenda. “With the One Big Beautiful Bill signed into law just a few weeks ago, this is a critical opportunity to continue to define how this legislation will help every voter and push back on Democrat fearmongering,” the memo from the NRCC, the House GOP's campaign arm, stated. But as he did earlier this year, Flood met a largely hostile crowd. No, but I supported this bill,” he told the crowd. “My question is fiscal,” the attendee began, referencing reports that the makeshift immigration detention facility in Florida dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” is expected to cost $450 million to operate for a single year. “Americans voted for a border that is secure, and I support the president enforcing our immigration laws, which, by the way, were written by Congress.” “Fascists don't hold town halls with open question-and-answer series,” he responded. Despite his efforts to present the recently passed budget bill – which one constituent called “the big, ugly bill” – as a solution for Medicaid funding and rural hospitals, audience members attacked Flood over cuts to SNAP benefits, veterans' programs and health care access. “How can you stand a bill that erodes the very services that people like me, my family, and younger vets rely on?” one Marine Corps veteran asked. Flood said he had personally met with the VA secretary and promised improvements to the system but offered no specifics. The Nebraska lawmaker also fielded a question on the Jeffrey Epstein files – a topic that has consumed Capitol Hill in recent weeks but yielded limited exchanges so far in the early public town halls during lawmakers' break from Washington. He added that he supports Congress' subpoena of Epstein's former associate Ghislaine Maxwell for a deposition, and declard: “I am for the release of those records.” The topic also arose at a Democrat's town hall Monday night in Benton Harbor, Michigan, where Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin made a case against presidential pardon power. Asked by an audience member if she thinks the presidential pardon power should be limited, Slotkin called it “a quirk of history that does not make sense in America for either party, for any reason.” “To me, it is just a strange thing that the president of the United States has a few extra chits in their pocket to give away,” she continued, adding that she doesn't think people who are wrongly imprisoned should be in jail. As pressure grows on the Trump administration to release more information related to the Epstein case, the president hasn't ruled out a pardon for Maxwell, who met recently with a top Justice Department official and also was transferred to a lower security prison camp from where she was previously being held. Asked last week if clemency was on the table in exchange for Maxwell's testimony, Trump said, “I'm allowed to do it, but nobody's asked me to do it. Slotkin expressed wariness that Trump is talking about pardon for Maxwell “in year one of his presidency, not the end of his presidency, which is what you typically see.” “Look, I thought it was controversial with President Biden, too. So to me, it's just this weird kind of literally get out of jail free card that I just think muddies the waters,” she said. “When you have a president who has a deep, deep problem with corruption, it just can be taken to such a dangerous degree that he's letting out pedophiles and criminals, violent people because he's paying back favors to others. I just can't support that,” she continued. The Michigan senator, who delivered what she called her “economic war plan for America” and argued against the massive domestic policy bill that Trump signed into law July 4, addressed another issue that looms large for lawmakers when they return to DC in a matter of weeks: government funding. In Washington state, Democratic Rep. Adam Smith's town hall was abruptly canceled Monday evening amid protests, with local police saying they arrested three people and charged them with trespassing. Before Smith took the stage, TVW – Washington state's public affairs network, which was broadcasting the town hall – announced on its website, “Town hall cancelled mid-meeting due to protests.” This behavior is unacceptable,” Smith later posted on social media. “One of my staff members was physically assaulted during the chaos – an act that crosses every line of civil discourse.” The police spokesperson, Meeghan Black, said she was not aware of any assault on a member of the congressman's staff and no one was charged with assault. Black told CNN that nine protestors initially entered the venue and started loudly protesting, three of whom walked on stage and were subsequently arrested. This story has been updated with additional developments.</p>
