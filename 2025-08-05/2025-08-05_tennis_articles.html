                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jannik Sinner is ready to return to action at the Cincinnati Masters 1000, a tournament where he had triumphed in 2024 without playing his best tennis. After winning his first Wimbledon title last month, the 23-year-old from Sesto Pusteria went on holiday to Sardinia and preferred to skip the Toronto Masters 1000 (where he had triumphed two years ago starting his rise). The four-time Grand Slam champion – who has also decided to reinstate Umberto Ferrara as his fitness coach – has already arrived in Ohio and immediately started practicing to get used to the conditions. Jannik wants to defend the title he won there last season and above all he wants to gain confidence in view of the US Open, which will start on August 24 in New York. As everyone knows, most of the top players will also play mixed doubles in this edition and Sinner will join forces with Emma Navarro. In a recent interview with 'SuperTennis', former ATP ace Davide Sanguinetti expressed his honest opinion on Sinner's current status: "He is a war machine who stops at nothing, he knows what his goals are and gives his best to achieve them. It must also be added that players are very professional nowadays and take care of every detail, whereas in my time we traveled almost alone. Jannik deserves to be thanked because he has contributed more than anyone else to the growth of Italian tennis, everyone knows him in Italy and wants to become like him." The world No.1 will have a first-round bye in Cincinnati and will make his debut directly in the second round.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BBC tennis presenter Qasa Alom has revealed he's spent time in hospital after delaying treatment for a health issue to work at Wimbledon. In June 2023, he was announced as the new presenter of Today at Wimbledon. However, Alom has now admitted to making an ‘error' by working throughout Wimbledon this summer, and has released a statement on social media to explain his situation to fans. You can check out at any time. Can't say the last few weeks have been easy…” he wrote on Instagram. “Ever since the middle of Wimbledon I've been battling my body with a health issue. I put off getting proper medical care because I just did not want to miss The Championships (error). Eventually, it became too much and escalated.” A real wake-up call to all those health-conscious young seemingly fit people out there seeing this. Let the British Grass Court Season begin! “No matter how good your VO2 max might be; or what your resting heart rate is….no matter how many chia seeds you eat or interval fasts you can do….things can happen inside of our bodies that you can't control and it will completely knock you for six. He concluded the message by saying: “ I am grateful to my family for helping me through a difficult period, and now on the road to recovery.” He regularly uses social media to provide updates on his tennis travels, and this summer described his job as a ‘privilege'.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novak Djokovic pulled out of the Cincinnati Open on Monday for what officially was listed as a "non-medical" reason, meaning he will head to the U.S. Open without having played a match in about 1 1/2 months. The 24-time Grand Slam champion hasn't competed since losing in the Wimbledon semifinals to eventual champion Jannik Sinner on July 11. That straight-set defeat against Sinner at the All England Club came two days after the 38-year-old Djokovic took what he described as a "nasty" and "awkward" fall in the last game of his quarterfinal victory. Djokovic clearly was compromised against Sinner and unable to move at his best; he received treatment on his upper left leg from a trainer. Djokovic's withdrawal from Cincinnati follows his decision to sit out the Toronto Masters that concludes this week. He cited a groin injury for that absence. His previous event before Wimbledon was the French Open, where he also lost to Sinner in the semifinals. Djokovic will have no hard-court tournament preparation before the U.S. Open singles competition begins on Aug. 24. He has won four championships at Flushing Meadows, most recently in 2023. That was also his most recent Grand Slam trophy.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At Wimbledon, Jannik Sinner defeated Carlos Alcaraz in the final to win his fourth Grand Slam title, and his second of 2025. However, just days before he returns to action, Sinner has been warned to ‘watch his back' by his fellow Italian. Writing for La Gazetta dello Sport, 1976 Davis Cup winner Paolo Bertolucci shared his thoughts on Sinner's return. “He'll have to watch his back from the Spaniard [Carlos Alcaraz], now his only real rival for the world number one spot. “Only two men in command, two players with very different technical and behavioral characteristics, but both aware of the respective strengths of their main opponent.” Between now and the end of the 2025 season, Sinner must defend over 5,000 points, whereas Alcaraz defends just over 1,000 points. The pressure will certainly be on Sinner to defend those points, as he looks to finish as year-end number one for the second time in his career. Serbia's Novak Djokovic holds the record for the most year-end number one finishes with eight, while Alcaraz and Sinner sit on one each. It remains to be seen who will finish top of the pile this time around, as it's almost too close to call. Sinner may have more to defend between now and the end of the season, but that is, of course, thanks to his excellent performances on hard courts in 2024.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>She shared several holiday snaps of the trip on Instagram, accompanied by a lighthearted caption which read: 'Ted's on the vineyard - heard it here first. Spontaneous 36h New England summer fun time w [with] friends in MA.' Martha's Vineyard sits just south of Cape Cod in the Atlantic and is famed for its picturesque harbour towns, lighthouses, sandy beaches and farmland. However, there was no sign of Carlos Alcaraz, Raducanu's close friend and doubles partner at the US Open after they were confirmed as wild card entries. Shortly after the defeat, it was confirmed that she had hired Rafael Nadal's former coach, Francisco Roig - the eighth trainer of her burgeoning career. Roig, 57, was in the box for all 22 of Nadal's Grand Slam titles and is highly regarded. Raducanu had worked with old friend Mark Petchey since the Miami Open and vastly improved under his guidance, but the fact he had to split his time between coaching and his broadcast commitments meant the partnership would never be long-term. Petchey himself admitted in July: 'We are very aware she needs a second coach to come on board and maybe just one coach, not me, as well.' Talks with Roig began during Wimbledon, and a trial took place shortly after. Obligations meant he was not available until this week, and he landed in Cincinnati on Monday to help Raducanu prepare for the final WTA 1000 event before the US Open. Then, the US Open will get underway in New York on August 25. Raducanu's highly anticipated doubles partnership is set to take place on August 19 and 20. Alcaraz revealed he had approached Raducanu about teaming up through their agents, and she said yes after taking 'time to think a little bit'. It was an amazing idea for the tournament,' Alcaraz said after his opening win at Queen's.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alex de Minaur has been on a tear since losing in the Wimbledon quarter-finals. De Minaur's most recent victory, against Frances Tiafoe, sparked broad admiration for the Australian on social media after an incredible demonstration of court coverage at a significant point in the match. However, the 26-year-old has failed to defeat a top-10 ATP player this season, which raises various questions regarding his Grand Slam title-winning credentials. After defeating Tiafoe in three sets at the Canadian Open, de Minaur discussed the motivation he takes from any criticism he receives. Speaking to the Tennis Channel after his victory over Tiafoe, De Minaur explained what drives his constant pursuit of improvement. De Minaur said: “I think what drives that constant pursuit of improving is just… yeah I hear all the reasons why I shouldn't be in the top 10, or all the reasons why I shouldn't be where I am, people don't understand it. “So it ends up making me find all those different aspects of my game where I can improve. And I know there's a lot of different aspects and obviously the serve is a big one. The serve comes and goes depending on the week but it has been an improvement. “I feel like I've been a lot more aggressive and just have the mindset right, like be okay with the result not going your way but playing on your terms. So these kind of things all together have given me a pretty good mindset. Alex de Minaur faces big-serving Ben Shelton in the Canadian Open quarter-finals. Like de Minaur, Shelton came through a gargantuan battle, this time against Italian star Flavio Cobolli. Shelton and de Minaur have never contested a match on the ATP Tour. The ‘Demon' only made 42 per cent of his first serves against Frances Tiafoe. He was somewhat fortunate that Tiafoe also struggled on serve, landing only 48 per cent of his first serves throughout the contest. After the match, Shelton spoke about de Minaur, saying he is ‘prepared for a war.' Shelton and de Minaur have never contested a match on the ATP Tour. Speaking to reporters, Shelton said: “Yeah, he's a dawg. He puts it on the line in practice as well, that's one of the things that I love about him. “I love playing against, you know, some of the best players in the world in late stages of tournaments, so that's the only thing that you can hope for, and what I always look forward to. You guys saw it last week in DC. Yeah, I'm really enjoying and looking forward to that matchup.”</p>

"I'm so happy to see it happening at such a big event like this as well. She seems to be handling the moment really well, taking it all in her stride and using it as motivation." After her win over Gauff, Bouchard added: "I'm very impressed with how cool, calm and collected she was on the court. She looked much more mature than her 18 years of age. Gauff was sent crashing out of the National Bank Open in Montreal in straight sets by Mboko, but praised the teenager's efforts. She's a great ball striker, and she seems pretty positive out there on the court, doesn't get really too negative," Gauff said. Hopefully, we have many more battles, and I look forward to playing her again in the future."

Both players knew what it was like to win Canadian Open, with Zverev winning one of his first Masters 1,000 titles in 2017. And this victory means that he joins Novak Djokovic as the only two active players to reach 75th tour-level semi-final (Djokovic has 196), according to ATP Tour. Now, Zverev wants to vindicate himself after a so so year and hearing frequent boos on the court (last night, an spectator was escorted out after shouting at him). "There's quite a lot of work that I do with my foundation, and with my family as well, which can be beneficial and helps people around the world. So I would much rather be known and remembered for that than the outbursts that I used to have, right?" he said after the match (via ATP Tour), referring to the foundation that supports children living with diabetes, a disease he also has.Juarez Santos / Shutterstock Now, Zverev wants to vindicate himself after a so so year and hearing frequent boos on the court (last night, an spectator was escorted out after shouting at him).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's note: This story has been updated during Victoria Mboko's run to the semifinals of the WTA 1,000 Canadian Open in Montreal. Or maybe Victoria Mboko, the 18-year-old, American-born, Canadian-raised daughter of Congolese parents, has been announcing herself for months now. Maybe folks just weren't listening closely enough. Everyone is now, as she backs up her run to the French Open third round with a last-four place at the WTA 1,000 Canadian Open in Montreal, one rung below a Grand Slam. As her Roland-Garros debut approached, Mboko played the same brain game she has been playing through a startling climb up the tennis biosphere. “Kind of just play it down,” she said during an interview after her 6-1, 7-6(4) win over Lulu Sun of New Zealand on a Sunday May. Three days later, she knocked out rising German Eva Lys 6-4, 6-4, to move into the third round at her first major. Her run ended there in a defeat to Zheng Qinwen, the 2024 Olympic gold medalist, but Mboko had shown everyone who had missed her rise that they should have been paying more attention. “Pretend like you're playing somewhere else, that you're not at a Grand Slam,” she said of her strategy there. That way, I don't put as much pressure on myself and the points. If playing make-believe before walking onto the biggest stages in tennis could lead to Mboko taking a spot next to Bianca Andreescu, Leylah Fernandez, Denis Shapovalov, Felix Auger-Aliassime, Milos Raonic and others in the Canadian tennis firmament, then Mboko probably ought to keep doing it. “We know Canada is a very multicultural country and we are very accepting of everyone,” Andreescu, who has become a mentor to Mboko, said during an interview in Rome. “I think it's a beautiful thing that we're all from different different cultures, different backgrounds, but at the end of the day Tennis Canada really has built this program in the acceptance of everybody, no matter who you are.” Now they have another problem on their hands. She lost one, then won another five, this time at a WTA 125 event, the next rung up, in Porto. Her record on the year is 49-9, as she prepares to face 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina in Montreal. I like to keep the same routine when I'm in a tournament,” she said after her win over Gauff, who had beaten her in three sets at the Italian Open. I like to do the exact same thing every day in a tournament.” “That's a lot,” Marko Strillic, one of three coaches she works with at the Canadian Tennis Federation, said during an interview at the Italian Open. “If she keeps winning, you have to figure out a way to manage the schedule so that she doesn't get hurt. That was before Mboko cruised through French Open qualifying to earn her main draw debut, and then knocked through Sun as though she knew she would all along. Mboko was all business again against Lys, but for a couple of service breaks she quickly recovered from. Her brother Kevin, 27 and a tennis coach in suburban Toronto, said that from the moment she woke up, she set her mind on only one thing: winning. “She looked at us and said, ‘I got to win today,'” he said in an interview after she did just that. “We were trying to bring her down a little bit, telling her that it's all right, to just go out there and have fun, enjoy the experience. “She was like ‘No, I got to win.” That's how she was during her hit before walking onto the court, and it's how she was through the 79-minute match. “It's been really calm between the days,” she said. “That's how my coach wanted it to be.” “Then I just chilled in the locker room until my match,” she said. She credited the presence of her sister and brother for that. “There is so much happening even behind the scenes,” she said. “I feel like my family has been doing a good job of keeping me, I guess, isolated from it all. I don't have so many people around me, and it's kept me very calm and very comfortable.” Her oldest sister Gracia, 28, who has been courtside all event, played tennis for the University of Denver. She said that she and her brothers always knew that their baby sister had something they did not. At the last minute, another slot opened up, and a pro at the club asked Victoria, who was just 9 and had come to watch, if she wanted to play. Victoria jumped at the opportunity and eventually faced her sister. “It's that belief in yourself that the very top of the one percent have,” Gracia, a consultant in private equity, said Sunday after watching her sister win. She spent much of last year based in Belgium at the academy of Justine Henin, the former world No. Even then, she ended the year losing more than she won, dropping three of her last four matches. “I didn't see any of this coming. Their father, Cyprien, a retired mechanical engineer who worked nights in part so that he could drive his children to their tennis obligations, was there too. Victoria's mother, Godée, an accountant, was back home, dealing with a heavy end-of-the-month workload, as was her other brother, David, a 25-year-old data scientist. Godée then moved to N.C., where the family lived for several years and where Victoria was born, before all moving to Toronto when she was still a baby. She decided to play like the version of herself that she has long believed in: an aggressive, athletic player who likes to take control of points and dictate the action. In Miami, she beat Camila Osorio, a 23-year-old tour mainstay, and pushed Paula Badosa, the No. Mboko has also showed off a precocious variety, mixing in drop shots and slices, including a hard, slicing forehand. Her coach is Nathalie Tauziat, who got to No. 3 in the world with a game molded around variety. But Mboko can also crack her serve at 120 mph. Not surprisingly, she grew up worshipping Serena Williams. In Rome, she cruised through the first set in her second-round match against  Gauff, lacing backhands and forehands through the court on the Campo Centrale like a seasoned veteran. Gauff turned the match into one of her long-distance track races, getting so many balls back that Mboko was huffing and puffing between every point. She “felt like playing myself,” Gauff said in a huddle after the match, especially with how well Mboko covered the court. Gracia Mboko said her sister came away from that loss both devastated and determined. “She kept saying, ‘I got to get in shape.' When she faced a double-fault-stricken version of Gauff in Montreal, she kept her foot on the accelerator after winning the first set 6-1. Mboko learned plenty from that first loss to Gauff. 2's grit frustrate her, thinking about the last point when she was supposed to be thinking about the next one. “They'll start to snap me right back into it,” she said. He is currently writing a book about tennis, "The Cruelest Game: Agony, Ecstasy and Near Death Experiences on the Pro Tennis Tour," to be published by Doubleday in 2026.</p>

The Serb, who was thrashed by Jannik Sinner in the semi-finals at the All England Club, picked up an injury during the defeat, and also withdrew from the ongoing event in Toronto.

Djokovic last set foot on a hard court back at the Miami Open in March, and hasn't played at a Masters event since April.

The three-time Cincinnati champion's previous appearance at the tournament came in 2023, winning the title as he overcame Carlos Alcaraz in one of the greatest best-of-three set matches ever.

As a result, Djokovic is next scheduled to be at the revamped US Open mixed doubles alongside fellow Serb Olga Danilovic on August 19th, after being awarded a wildcard entry.

The Cincinnati Open gets underway on Thursday, while the US Open begins on August 24th.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When she won her first singles title at the All England Club, she became the first African American woman to claim that championship since Althea Gibson in 1957. The victory inspired countless young athletes and shifted perceptions about who belonged at tennis's most prestigious venue. During an interview with Marie Claire magazine, when asked how conscious she was of the change she represented, particularly for women of colour, Venus Williams offered a candid response. “I was thinking about this today,” she admitted. Williams explained that her thoughts turned to family and heritage rather than broader history. “Gosh, if I have kids, I really have to raise them the way my parents raised us– just to be proud of who we were, to know our history as African Americans.” She maintained a practical view of her achievement rather than getting caught up in the historical significance. “Me being there was not necessarily even special. Williams even talked about her relationship with her sister, Serena Williams, as they are set to launch a new podcast together. Venus Williams becomes the oldest WTA match winner since Martina Navratilova in 2004. Williams received wildcard entry into Citi DC Open last month and at 45, she became oldest WTA match winner since Martina Navratilova in 2004. She defeated Peyton Stearns in the round of 32 match, which was her first match in over 16 months. Williams's powerful serve and athletic play dominated the tournament from start to finish. At just 20 years old, she had reached the summit of her sport. Her breakthrough challenged decades of tradition at the All England Club and earned fans and fellow players widespread acclaim. The win also increased interest in tennis among diverse communities worldwide, proving that barriers could be broken at the sport's most prestigious venue. 🔹First African American woman to become world #1 in Open Era Williams went on to claim four more Wimbledon singles titles in 2001, 2005, 2007 and 2008, building one of the most impressive grass-court legacies in tennis history. However, that first triumph in 2000 remains the moment that changed everything, showcasing her resilience and marking the start of a remarkable career at tennis's highest level.

Two days ago, I wrote that it was a shame that de Minaur and Frances Tiafoe had only met three times, because they both play crowd-pleasing tennis in their own ways, and together they would make for reliably entertaining rivals. We saw that in their round of 16 match, which swung back and forth and went down to the wire.The same applies to Shelton vs. de Minaur, who have never played before. Their lack of head-to-head matches is more understandable, considering that Shelton is still fairly new to the tour. But putting these two across from each other seems like a recipe for watchably feisty competition. That should be especially true when they're ranked No. The same applies to Shelton vs. de Minaur, who have never played before.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jannik Sinner was noticeably absent from a list of the nicest tennis players on the ATP Tour, compiled by his fellow competitors. Four-time Grand Slam champion Sinner, who pulled out of the Masters 1000 event to recover after his Wimbledon victory, was among several high-profile stars who withdrew from the tournament, including Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic. Despite his absence, it was Alcaraz who was the most frequently mentioned name on the lists compiled by Francisco Cerundolo, Daniil Medvedev, Holger Rune and Lorenzo Musetti. Casper Ruud, known for his kind demeanour like Alcaraz, was also a popular choice. Medvedev also opted for the duo of Ruud and Alcaraz, adding Joao Fonseca, Andrey Rublev and Miomir Kecmanovic to his list. Rune also selected Alcaraz and Cerundolo but made sure to give a nod to Gael Monfils and Ben Shelton, describing the latter as a "good lad." His other choice could potentially stir up controversy as he named Nick Kyrgios on his list, claiming that the Aussie, notorious for his fiery personality, is nice "with me personally", reports the Express. Despite Musetti's list being dominated by his fellow Italians, Sinner was notably absent. Instead, the 23-year-old opted for Flavio Cobolli, Lorenzo Sonego, Matteo Berrettini and Simone Bolelli. Sinner's omission is not a reflection of his character, as he has been highly praised by none other than his fiercest competitor, Alcaraz. Speaking about their off-court friendship to Gazzetta, the Spaniard said: "Tennis is a unique sport that allows you to be great rivals on the court and, at the same time, maintain mutual respect. "Sinner and I are good friends; we can talk about many things off the court. I have great respect for him; he's a great person; I'm sure we'll always be able to maintain this relationship." He added: "We talk a little bit besides tennis, about life. No stranger to one another on the court, Sinner and Alcaraz recently completed a battle for the ages at this summer's final of Wimbledon. While Alcaraz took the first set 6-4, ATP No.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Craig Tiley wants to make the Australian Open one of the world's top sports entertainment events - and he's not waiting for disruption to arrive. “We're trying to create our own disruption,” said Tiley, CEO of Tennis Australia, at the inaugural Sports Matters Sydney event. Tiley outlined a future-facing strategy built around personalisation, content innovation, and what he calls the “festivalisation” of tennis - transforming the Australian Open from a traditional sports event into a cultural phenomenon. “The way fans consume content has been completely disrupted,” he said. Tiley is pushing for a “bottom-up” content strategy built around personalisation and platform-agnostic distribution. Tennis Australia, he explained, has full production control across free-to-air, digital and streaming, with a mandate to tailor content to individual fan preferences. Tiley hinted at a broader plan to build a white-label content engine, giving global partners more tools to engage fans in new formats, with AI and immersive media set to play an expanding role. The Australian Open's evolution is already well underway. Over the past decade, Tennis Australia has doubled down on direct fan relationships, brought production in-house and added new pillars to the Open experience: food, music, family and tech. The youngest average audience of any Grand Slam, more than 1.2 million attendees and global broadcast reach. “The in-stadium audience is less than 1%,” he said. That means seamless, tech-powered experiences where fans don't even take their phones out of their pockets - on site or online. Tiley said his team is planning with 2030 in mind, backed by a 15-year roadmap split into three cycles. The focus now is globalisation, innovation, and new revenue models that don't depend on government funding. “The challenge in five years will be access to funds,” he said. “Government support won't flow as easily - we have to be self-sufficient.” That mindset is shaping Tennis Australia's appetite for innovation. “We're going to take some big bets,” Tiley said. For brands, the opportunity lies in aligning with a sports property that's actively redefining its role in the entertainment and tech ecosystem. “Sport is still the only live content where you can have real integrity,” Tiley said. Don't wait for change, be the one who drives it. MARKETING-INTERACTIVE is an online publication of Lighthouse Independent Media.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alexander Zverev singled out a heckling fan straight after beating Alexei Popyrin. Australian Alexei Popyrin's Canadian Open has ended in a three-set quarterfinal loss to first seed Alexander Zverev. Popyrin won the first set in a tense tiebreak, but could not stick with world number three Zverev over 2 hours and 42 minutes in Toronto. Alexei Popyrin's defence of the Canadian Open title has ended in the quarterfinals, with the Australian defeated by German top seed Alexander Zverev in three sets. Popyrin, who became the first Australian to win an ATP Masters 1000 tournament at last year's event, took the opening set before Zverev rallied. The German, who lost to top-ranked Jannik Sinner in the final at this year's Australian Open and made the French Open quarterfinal, not only overcame Popyrin but also a heckling fan late in the contest. Zverev responded by immediately firing a ball completely out of the stadium in frustration, but quickly regrouped to go up 2-0 in the second set. Popyrin grabbed a break of his own before holding serve at 4-4. Zverev, who won the Canadian title in Montreal eight years ago when he defeated childhood idol Roger Federer, took a 5-4 lead and then again broke his opponent to even the match. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines. Zverev has two tournament wins on clay this year, and is the highest-ranked player competing in the Toronto field. Australia's number-one-ranked male player, Alex de Minaur, will face American Ben Shelton tomorrow morning, AEST, in his quarterfinal.
