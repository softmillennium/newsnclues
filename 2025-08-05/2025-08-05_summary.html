The Trump administration has already sanctioned the judge presiding over Bolsonaro's alleged coup attempt trial.

Brazil's Supreme Court placed far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro under house arrest Monday in anticipation of his trial for allegedly attempting a coup following his loss in the 2022 election.

The order has heightened the current government's already simmering tensions with U.S. President Donald Trump, who has imposed high tariffs on some Brazilian imports over what he calls a “witch hunt” against his ally.

Bolsonaro's house arrest was ordered by Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who says the former president had violated restrictions imposed last month banning him from using social media, which he'd been using to rile up supporters to attack the Supreme Court.

The justice said Bolsonaro had used the accounts of allies, including his politician sons, to send “clear encouragement and incitement to attack the Supreme Federal Court, and overt support for foreign intervention in Brazil's judiciary.”

The Associated Press reports that Bolsonaro had his phones seized from his Brasilia residence.

Trump slapped Moraes, who is presiding over Bolsonaro's trial, with Magnitsky sanctions — typically reserved for major human rights abusers — last week, which supporters of Brazil's left-wing president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva called “a direct attack on Brazilian democracy.”

Brazilian journalist Brian Mier says Bolsonaro has been emboldened by Trump's support to defy Moraes' orders, assuming that threats from the U.S. would cause the judge “to back down.”

“It backfired,” Mier said.

The U.S. State Department's Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs issued a furious condemnation of Bolsonaro's arrest, promising to “hold accountable all those aiding and abetting sanctioned conduct.”

The department hinted that it may place more sanctions on other members of the Supreme Court.

Maria do Rosário, a federal deputy for Lula's Workers' Party (PT), hit back in a post on X.

“With what authority does this attempt to interfere in Brazil's judiciary power, and the threat to Brazilian authorities and citizens persist?” she asked. “None.”

The charges against Bolsonaro, often called the “Trump of the tropics,” bear a striking resemblance to those leveled against the U.S. president following his 2020 election loss.

Like Trump, Bolsonaro flagrantly spread false claims that his election loss was the result of rampant fraud, which prompted a mob of supporters to attack the legislature in hopes of overturning the “stolen” election.

Brazilian state police have accused Bolsonaro of going even further — allegedly enlisting military officers in a plot to assassinate Lula and forcibly retake power.

Trump has nevertheless drawn parallels between his own legal struggles and those faced by Bolsonaro.

“This is nothing more, or less, than an attack on a Political Opponent – Something I know much about! It happened to me, times 10,” Trump wrote last month on Truth Social.

Vinicios Betiol, a geopolitics scholar from the University of Rio de Janeiro, says that “Bolsonaro and Donald Trump are plotting a coup against Brazil.”

While he said the arrest of Bolsonaro is worth celebrating, he cautioned that provoking the Supreme Court was part of his strategy “to fuel the narrative of persecution” and whip up civil unrest among his supporters.

“Radical Bolsonarists,” he said, “are already talking about blocking roads, toppling power towers, and attacking the [Supreme Court].”

Following the announcement of Bolsonaro's arrest, supporters of the former president flooded the streets and drove around the capital Brasilia, with some chanting, “Brazil will stop.”

Many of Bolsonaro's supporters view Trump as a key cog in the effort to shield Bolsonaro from prosecution. As The Guardian reports:

On Monday night, hundreds of followers flocked to the gates of Bolsonaro's upmarket condominium to vent their anger, some carrying U.S. flags.

“We want Trump to help us,” said one protester, Ricardo, who wore a red MAGA cap and declined to give his second name as he stood outside Bolsonaro's compound holding up a star-spangled banner. “Our solution can no longer come from within [Brazil]. It has to come from abroad. The sanctions are working. More people need to be hit with Magnitsky.”

“They know that Bolsonaro will be convicted and have thus gone all-in,” Betiol said. “They are willing to cause civil unrest, force the [Supreme Court] to act, and then seek a coup with Trump's help.”

“We must indeed celebrate Bolsonaro's arrest,” he continued, “but we cannot lower our guard at this decisive moment in our country's history.”



As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

House oversight committee also issued subpoenas to several former attorneys general and FBI directors

The House oversight committee on Tuesday issued subpoenas to Bill and Hillary Clinton as well as several former attorneys general and directors of the FBI, demanding “testimony related to horrific crimes perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein”.

The investigative committee's Republican chair, James Comer, sent the subpoenas in response to two motions lawmakers approved on a bipartisan basis last month, as Congress navigated outrage among Donald Trump's supporters over the justice department's announcement that it would not release further details about Epstein, a disgraced financier who died in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking.

The subpoenas raise the possibility that more details will become public about Trump's relationship with Epstein, which stretched for years but appeared to have petered out by the time Epstein was convicted of sexually abusing girls in 2008. Last month, the Wall Street Journal reported on the existence of a sexually suggestive sketch and lewd letter Trump sent to Epstein as a 50th birthday gift in 2003.

The president and his allies have long flirted with conspiracy theories around Epstein's death in federal custody, but the justice department upended those by concluding he died by suicide and a long-rumored list of his client did not exist. That prompted some Trump supporters to criticize the president for failing to make good on his pledge to bring full transparency to the case, which Democrats moved to capitalize on by pushing congressional Republicans into tricky votes intended to make the Epstein case files public.

Shortly before House lawmakers left Washington DC for Congress's August recess, the Republican congressman Scott Perry won an oversight subcommittee's approval to compel depositions from the Clintons and the former top federal law enforcement officials in a bid to reveal more about Epstein's activities. Democratic congresswoman Summer Lee also successfully pushed a motion to subpoena justice department files related to the case.

In addition to the Clintons, the committee sent subpoenas to former attorneys general Jeff Sessions, Alberto Gonzales and William Barr, who served in George W Bush and Trump's presidencies, and Merrick Garland, Loretta Lynch and Eric Holder, who served under Joe Biden and Barack Obama. Former FBI directors James Comey and Robert Mueller also received subpoenas.

In the letter to Bill Clinton, Comer noted that the former president had flown four times on Epstein's private jet, and repeated an allegation that he had “pressured” Vanity Fair not to publish sex trafficking claims regarding Epstein. The chair further says that Clinton was “allegedly close” with Ghislaine Maxwell, a British socialite serving a 20-year prison sentence after being convicted on sex trafficking charges related to Epstein.

“Given your past relationships with Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell, the Committee believes that you have information regarding their activities that is relevant to the Committee's investigation,” Comer wrote.

In his letter to Hillary Clinton, Comer draws a more tenuous connect, writing: “Your family appears to have had a close relationship with both Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell”. In addition to details about them, Comer notes that Clinton “may have knowledge of efforts by the federal government to combat international sex trafficking operations of the type run by Mr. Epstein”.

Comer set Bill Clinton's deposition date as 14 October and Hillary's as 9 October. Others who received subpoenas were given dates ranging from mid-August through early October, while US attorney general Pam Bondi has until 19 August to release documents related to the case.

In addition to the subpoenas, Republican congressman Thomas Massie and Democrat Ro Khanna are collecting signatures for a discharge petition to force a vote on legislation compelling release of the Epstein files. That vote is not expected to happen until the House returns from recess in early September.

Trump has authorized the justice department to request release of the transcripts from the federal grand juries that indicted Epstein and Maxwell, while last week, deputy attorney general Todd Blanche interviewed Maxwell in Florida in what the White House said was a bid to uncover new details about the case.

            The National Weather Service has received permission to hire 450 meteorologists, hydrologists and radar technicians just months after being hit hard by Department of Government Efficiency-related cuts and early retirement incentives.
    


            The new hiring number includes 126 new positions that were previously approved and will apply to “front-line mission critical” personnel, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration official told CNN.
    


            The NWS cuts have spurred concerns over how well-prepared the country is to withstand hurricane season, which is just starting to heat up in the Atlantic. The staff reductions also have been scrutinized in the wake of the deadly Texas floods in July, with vacancies at weather service forecast offices there.
    


            The cuts to probationary employees, as well as early retirement incentives, meant the nation's front-line weather forecasting agency's staffing levels fell by more than 550 people since the second Trump administration began, to below 4,000 total employees.
    


            CNN has reached out to NOAA for comment.
    


            Agency employees are greeting the news, unveiled at an all hands meeting on Monday, with guarded optimism and relief. Current employees have been working additional hours with additional responsibilities since the layoffs and retirements earlier this year, trying to maintain the 24/7 posture US extreme weather requires. The agency has also been functioning with less data from fewer, less frequent weather balloon launches.
    


            The announcement was also met with frustration over the people the agency lost in the failed attempt at government savings.
    


            “How much time/money is it going to cost to train a bunch of new people when we had already-trained people in place?” asked another NOAA official, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media. It is possible that some of the new hires will have been previously trained employees who were let go in the DOGE cuts.
    


            The first NOAA official said there is going to be a focus on hiring in a smart, “asymmetric” way that is “based on workload.”
    


            The NWS, aided by lawmakers on Capitol Hill, had been arguing for months for a public safety exemption from the federal hiring freeze. That exemption has been granted, and the agency now has direct hiring authority under the Office of Personnel Management, the official told CNN.
    


            Direct hiring authority, according to OPM's website, can be given to federal agencies “for filling vacancies when a critical hiring need or severe shortage of candidates exists.” It can help speed up the hiring process, the NOAA official said.

Far right ministers in the governing coalition have pushed to reoccupy Gaza rather than negotiate a ceasefire.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

The Israeli war cabinet met on Monday to decide on the next phase of Israel's war on Gaza. The meeting was reportedly to choose between ending the war in favor of ceasefire talks or expanding it to reoccupy the entire Strip. According to initial unconfirmed reports, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has briefed “friendly journalists” that he has ordered the Israeli army to “conquer Gaza” in the face of opposition from the army's Chief of Staff, Eyal Zamir. Netanyahu's office reportedly told N12: “The decision has been made — Israel is going to conquer the Gaza Strip.”

The ceasefire was supported by Israeli army officials, while the decision to reoccupy Gaza is favored by the hardline ministers like National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who are key allies in Prime Minister Netanyahu's rightwing coalition and are credited with playing an influential role in sustaining the ongoing Israeli onslaught.

According to the Israeli army's radio on Monday, Zamir had demanded “clarity” from the Israeli government regarding the future of the war effort, reportedly discouraging the reoccupation of Gaza, believing it would “drain” the Israeli army.

Zamir's message to the cabinet came amid Israel's announcement last week of the end of its latest military offensive in Gaza, dubbed Operation Gideon's Chariots, while one of Israel's cabinet members, Zeev Elkin, threatened to “annex parts of Gaza” as a “pressure tool” against Hamas in ceasefire negotiations.

The message was also issued following the visit of U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to Israel and Gaza last week. On Friday, Witkoff met families of Israeli captives in Tel Aviv, where he reaffirmed U.S. efforts to reach a ceasefire deal, without giving any details on the progress of the talks. Witkoff said that Hamas was considering giving up its weapons, while the resistance group responded in a statement saying that it would only lay down its arms after the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.

Before going to Tel Aviv, Witkoff spent five hours at one of the centers of the controversial U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). Following his visit to one of the GHF sites, he said that there is hardship and shortage, but “no starvation” in Gaza. On Monday, a group of 17 international human rights organizations responded to Witkoff's claims in a joint statement, saying that the US envoy had “totally ignored the facts on the ground,” stating that “evidence can't be erased with statements,” and “starvation in Gaza is real and has already claimed the lives of 159 people including 90 children which is a documented number that reflects the size of the crime that can not be justified or denied.”

Last week, Israel handed over its objections to Hamas's response to Witkoff's latest ceasefire proposal. Israel's objections included Hamas's amendments to the Israeli military withdrawal maps, especially insisting on maintaining Israel's military presence in the Philadelphi Corridor— the militarized area straddling the Palestinian-Egyptian border — and the principle of exchanging bodies of slain Israeli captives for living Palestinian prisoners. However, the U.S. has not put forward a new version of the ceasefire proposal.

During Witkoff's visit, Hamas's armed wing released video footage of an emaciated Israeli captive suffering from starvation and severe malnutrition, who said in the video that he hadn't eaten in several days. The video sparked protests by the families of Israeli captives and provoked Netanyahu to comment on the video in a televised statement, saying that Hamas was “seeking to break us.”

On Sunday, Netanyahu's cabinet stated that it had requested the International Committee of the Red Cross to guarantee the entry of food to Israeli captives. Hamas responded by saying that it would “cooperate positively” with the Red Cross on the condition that a permanent humanitarian corridor is established for Gaza and that Israeli military aircraft cease flight over the Strip during the entry of aid.

The same day, Hamas stated that it would be “ready to engage in talks again when the starvation ends,” implying that the end of starvation is the resistance movement's new condition for the return to talks.

As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

More than a way of protest, social movements are occupying spaces to challenge authority and fight against oppression.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

This is an adapted excerpt from chapter 3: “From Occupation to Replacing the State” of Replace the State: How to Change the World When Elections and Protests Fail by Sasha Davis. 

From people taking over campus lawns in solidarity with Gaza, to freeway blockades protesting police and immigration enforcement brutality in 2025, to the 2011 Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street protests: the activist takeover of space is an important technique for social change and justice. While many folks refer to these takeovers as “occupations,” others (including myself) refer to them as “counteroccupations” to emphasize that many of the locations where they take place are already occupied by oppressive governments or institutions.

Regardless of the label we use to describe them, this method of activism is quite popular and movements around the world use this tactic in many ways. Some groups temporarily take over a space simply to get attention for a certain issue. It can essentially be a tool of protest designed to make other people and governments hear their demands. People may put themselves in a place where they “aren't supposed to be” to get media attention for their issue. They may block a freeway to bring attention to the issues of police violence and racialized urban inequalities, or they may climb a polluting factory to hang a protest banner in an off-limits space to embarrass a polluting company. In these ways, activists may take over spaces not with the intent of staying around and controlling them, but as Bart Cammaerts puts it, just to create “extreme speech acts — a crying out for visibility” designed to strengthen existing demands.

On the other hand, some protesters take over a space with the aim of physically disrupting a particular event: like blocking a meeting where people are making decisions that increase inequality, exclusion, or environmental damage. Examples of this would be the massive anti-globalization protests in Seattle, Genoa, Cancún and other sites where the World Trade Organization and other international financial institutions met in the late 1990s and early 2000s. There are also actions that use counteroccupation tactics in order to block a specific construction project, destructive activity, or the circulation of a dangerous commodity. The struggles against the Dakota Access Pipeline in South Dakota, the Maunakea telescope project in Hawai‘i, forest clearcutting projects in the American West, the Coastal GasLink pipeline in the Wet'suwet'en Nation, as well as the protests in the Nevada desert against nuclear weapons testing in the 1980s and 1990s, have all made use of these kinds of counteroccupation and blockade tactics.

These tactics up the ante from protests that simply make demands in that they are not just trying to be visible and get the public's attention. They are physically blocking the state's (or a corporation's) ability to act in a place. Some movements may then use these blockading tactics in order to gain leverage for the demands they are making of existing governing institutions. However, some movements — and this is crucial — are not using the tactic to ‘ask' for anything or improve their bargaining position for a demand. Instead, they are using the tactic with the aim of supplanting the existing institutions of governance. 

One fall morning in 2014 I had the opportunity to watch something that changed forever how I viewed political action and strategies for social change. I was visiting the island of Okinawa to study U.S. plans to construct a new military base, but I was also there to learn more about activist tactics from the people who were organizing against it. On the beach that morning a group of protesters in kayaks set out to sea in order to make a rather daring claim: that a section of the nearby bay should not be a military base, but instead be a place governed by local citizens according to the ethics of environmental protection, community health, and peaceful international relations. What made their claim so daring was who they were up against and the way they made this claim. These kayakers heading off into the waters offshore of Henoko Village were taking on the combined power of the Japanese government and the U.S. military. These two powerful entities had decided — against overwhelming public opposition — that the waters off of Henoko should be filled in with sediment and turned into a new U.S. Marine Corps Air Station. The kayakers, however, had other ideas.

People in Okinawa have had a difficult time effectively influencing government policies through elections and protests. Okinawa's history, though, is unique in that this group of islands (which lay between Taiwan and the main islands of Japan) were once the independent Ryukyu Kingdom, but they are now the site of a “double colonization” where local desires and self-determination have been thwarted by both the Japanese and U.S. governments. Okinawa was annexed by Imperial Japan in 1879 and since the end of World War II the main island has been used as a site for a large collection of U.S. military bases which cause numerous social and environmental problems for the 1.3 million residents. People have tried to influence the governments in Tokyo and Washington D.C. to reduce the burden of the bases, but negotiations in the 1990s only went so far as to promise closing one problematic base in central Okinawa (Futenma Marine Corps Air Station) if another one is built to replace it in the Henoko area of northern Okinawa. Island residents have elected anti-base governors one after another, but these governors have not been able to stop the plans of the U.S. military or the Japanese central government. In February of 2019 Okinawans went to the polls and over 72 percent voted against the construction of the new base. Both the U.S. and Japanese governments, however, claimed they did not have to heed the results. Even as the COVID-19 epidemic raged in the spring of 2020, the Japanese Supreme Court ruled the construction of the base could continue. In early 2025 that same court denied the last active lawsuit from the local prefectural government which aimed to halt the project. All told, thousands of people in Okinawa have engaged in protests that fill streets (and even whole stadiums) over the past few decades. Still, the construction moves forward. Faced with this situation, people in Okinawa have had to come up with other tactics to try and govern their island according to the will of the people that call it home. 

It is not just in Okinawa, of course, where activists have been using this tactic. Over the past several decades, demonstrators around the world have been performing counteroccupations that attempt to replace the state. While many of these kinds of protests erupt in places (like Okinawa) with long histories of colonial repression, people living in other places are also now seeing that the systems of governance that rule over them are sliding evermore toward being dictatorial and unresponsive. Folks in these situations can learn a lot from the experiences of communities where people have long had few illusions that the ruling powers are trying to help. 

That fall morning back in 2014, I hopped in a small boat piloted by activists who were supporting and documenting the kayakers. As we sped out of the fishing port and into the small swells of the Pacific, we caught up to kayakers arrayed on the edge of a floating barrier that marked the restricted area of the bay. On the other side of the barrier were Japanese Coast Guard boats warning the protesting kayakers not to enter the cordoned waters. Eventually, one kayaker traversed the floating barrier. As he did this, the Coast Guard boats descended upon him. This however left gaps in the Coast Guard's line which other kayakers exploited. The bulk of kayakers then entered the waters that were officially the jurisdiction of the U.S. military. The outnumbered Coast Guard boats then retreated further back towards the shore and monitored the situation while the kayakers paddled triumphantly through the exclusion zone in the bay. 

At first, I thought about this as a tactic of protest — a way for activists to use civil disobedience to bring attention to an issue, to voice disagreement with a government policy, and demand a change. Through observations and conversations with activists, however, I realized that something much different was happening. I had personally participated in and witnessed occupation-style protests in a number of places in the past, but that morning in Okinawa I saw that something more was going on here. These activists were not merely protesting against something and asking for different policies. They were directly taking over the space, challenging both the U.S. and Japanese governments' right to govern the bay, and making the claim that the place should be managed according to local life-affirming ethics. In short, the kayakers were attempting to block the governing power of unrepresentative institutions while also replacing it with citizen-led management. The activists offshore from Henoko Village decided to halt the unwanted destruction of their bay by physically putting themselves in that place and attempting to change how it is governed. By doing so, they were undermining the legitimacy of claims by both the distant U.S. and Japanese central governments to control what happens in this place. In the local view, the Japanese and U.S. governments were undemocratically and unfairly imposing a massive project that was sure to have enormous negative political, economic, social, and environmental impacts. The solution to this was to try to wrest control of the space and govern it according to different ethics — whether the official state powers wanted them to or not. I refer to this as ‘replacing the state'.

Replacing the state involves having an alternative vision for a place, but it is also about claiming to have the authority and developing the ability to make the vision real in that space, regardless of what state or corporate actors want to do there. The importance of this cannot be understated. When activists move beyond reform, resilience, and resistance (the three Rs of ineffective activism) and start being able to dictate what will occur in a place and develop the logistical capabilities to make it happen, then activists cross a line into a whole new realm of strategy. Activists can stretch beyond electoral campaigns, government petitions, demands, and counteroccupations that just resist a project or policy. Instead, they can become creative agents building an alternative system of governing in a place.

To put it simply, more and more of us are recognizing that our current governments, electoral processes, and non-confrontational methods of protest are not enough to really make the world better. It is therefore critical to consider other strategies and tactics. The more people are excluded from effective participation in traditional politics, economic opportunity, maintaining the health of their communities, and environmental decision-making, the more it makes sense to pursue tactics like creating counteroccupations which aim to replace the state.

            A former NFL player has been convicted for running an operation that bred and trafficked “grand champion” dogs and their offspring for dogfighting, the Department of Justice said.
    


            LeShon Johnson, 54, a former running back for the Green Bay Packers, Arizona Cardinals and New York Giants, was convicted by a federal jury in Oklahoma on six felony counts of violating the federal Animal Welfare Act's prohibitions against “possessing, selling, transporting, and delivering animals to be used in fighting ventures,” the department said.
    


            Following the verdict, the ex-NFLer surrendered 190 dogs from his “Mal Kant Kennels,” the largest number ever seized from a single person in a federal dogfighting case, officials said. He faces up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 on each count.
    


            “My client respects the verdict,” defense attorney Courtney Jordan told CNN, noting Johnson was convicted of only six of 23 counts. He was acquitted on 17 counts of possessing a dog for use in an animal fighting venture, court records show.
    


            “The jury saw there is more to this story than what the government has made it out to be. He is a family man, a good person who loves his dogs. He was never involved in dogfighting himself, per se,” Jordan said.
    


            Johnson's conviction recalls the 2007 federal case against then-NFL quarterback Michael Vick, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy involving illegal dogfighting. Admitting he participated in killing dogs and ran a business that involved illegal gambling, Vick was sentenced to 23 months in prison. After his 2009 release, he advocated against dogfighting, returned to the NFL and now coaches a college team.
    


            While dogfighting is a felony in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, more than 40,000 people participate in enterprises that breed, condition and train dogs to be “placed in a pit to fight each other for spectator entertainment and profit,” the Humane Society of the United States and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals say.
    


            In Johnson's case, “the American government is really after the American pit bull terrier, and that's what LeShon Johnson was breading,” his lawyer said. The breed is “the dog of choice” for fighting in the United States, according to the ASPCA.

            Johnson had a 2004 state conviction for dogfighting, the Justice Department said. In the federal case against him, Johnson bred and trafficked “fighting dogs” and their puppies for dogfighting, “profiting from the cruel and illegal industry,” evidence presented to the jury showed.
    


            “This criminal profited off of the misery of innocent animals and he will face severe consequences for his vile crimes,” Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement.
    


            “This case underscores the Department of Justice's commitment to protecting animals from abuse – 190 dogs are now safe thanks to outstanding collaborative work by our attorneys and law enforcement components.”
    


            The federal government is pursuing the forfeiture of the dogs, after which the US Marshals Service would care for them, the department said.

            Stymied by treacherous terrain and untamed wilderness, authorities are struggling to find an Army veteran suspected of killing four people at a Montana bar last week.
    


            Investigators say Michael Paul Brown, 45, vanished Friday after gunning down a bartender and three patrons at The Owl Bar in Anaconda – a community of less than 10,000 people nestled between the dense forests and formidable mountains of western Montana.
    


            “This is an unstable individual who walked in and murdered four people in cold blood – for no reason whatsoever,” Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen said Sunday. “So there absolutely is concern for the public.”
    


            Among the countless potential hideouts: Garrity Mountain, a popular hiking and camping site lined with cabins for outdoor enthusiasts.
    


            As of Tuesday, the Garrity Mountain Wildlife Management Area remained closed “until further notice” due to public safety concerns and an ongoing law enforcement presence, Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks said.
    


            Other manhunts in the wilderness have lasted weeks – with at least one fugitive still missing after two months.
    


            But it's not just the challenging landscape impeding Brown's capture.
    


            “That mountain is gigantic,” said Anaconda resident Dan Haffey, a former fire foreman for the Montana Division of Forestry whose team cut trails for hikers.
    


            “There's a thousand places to hide on that mountain.”
    


            And Brown fled in a sparsely populated area with fewer authorities, one official said, essentially giving him a head start while partnering law enforcement agencies were brought in from around the state.
    


Hunt for man accused of gunning down 4 people at his neighborhood bar spans a maze of Montana wilderness



            An array of local, state and federal authorities have joined in the manhunt, including the FBI, the Granite County Sheriff's Office and the Denver office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. But many of them had to travel to the manhunt, giving Brown more time to get away.
    


            Denver is about 600 miles from Anaconda.
    


            Over the weekend, authorities had about “250 boots on the ground” searching for Brown, along with air and ground resources from other states and federal agencies, Montana's attorney general said Sunday. But he said that number would be reduced as the search shifts to a “fugitive location operation.”
    


            A $10,000 reward is available for information leading to Brown's capture. But four days after the killings, Brown still hasn't been found.
    


            “There's a lot of land, and not a lot of people,” said Dan Brunner, a former agent at the FBI's field office in Bozeman, Montana.
    


            “So there's not a lot of civilians that will be looking out their window looking for a suspicious person,” Brunner said. “This man could easily hide for multiple, multiple weeks if he had resources prepared for himself.”
    


            Brown has already been resourceful in his escape. Even though surveillance footage showed him fleeing in his underwear shortly after the killings, authorities believe he gathered fresh supplies from a white Ford F-150 pickup truck.
    


            “It was a stolen vehicle, but there was camping equipment in it. We believe there was some clothing in it,” Knudsen said.
    


            “So at this point, we have every reason to believe the suspect is fully clothed, shoes on his feet, able to get around.”
    


            Brown's military background may have also honed his tactical skills.
    


            He served in the US Army from January 2001 to May 2005 and was part of an armored vehicle crew, Army spokesperson Lt. Col. Ruth Castro told CNN. Brown was deployed to Iraq from February 2004 to March 2005.
    


            He later joined the Montana National Guard from April 2006 to March 2009 and left military service as a sergeant, Castro said.
    


            Brown is the latest fugitive with military experience who's led authorities on an arduous manhunt through the wilderness.
    


Is Travis Decker alive? A fruitless 4-week manhunt has produced ‘no certain evidence'



            Army veteran Travis Decker is still nowhere to be found two months after authorities said he suffocated his three daughters and left their bodies in the woods near Leavenworth, Washington.
    


            Joseph Couch, a former combat engineer in the Army Reserve, evaded capture for more than a week last year after he sprayed bullets from an AR-15 onto cars on Interstate 75 in Kentucky, wounding five people. After an 11-day manhunt, Couch's body was found with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
    


            It's not clear how long Brown might be able to elude authorities.
    


            “If someone has knowledge of a wooded area – in other words, they live there, they may have hunted there, they know that area – they can live there for quite a long time, and those are some of the toughest people to locate,” retired US Marshal Steve Prosser said.
    


            However, “even if you have survival skills, you're not equipped in the long term to be self-sustaining without the help of other human beings,” said Donald Lane, who worked as a Secret Service agent and with the Department of Homeland Security for 20 years.
    


Some fugitives don't get very far, even with a good head start. What complicates their escape?



            But authorities are confident Brown won't outsmart them.
    


            “We've got a lot of expertise, a lot of knowledge of the area,” Knudsen said.
    


            “We've got every cabin, every hunting site that's known up there pinned. There is a tremendous number of assets focused on searching that area.”

            The House Oversight Committee has issued nearly a dozen subpoenas to the Justice Department and high-profile Democratic and Republican figures for files and information related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a major move that comes as many congressional Republicans call for more transparency around the case.
    


            The subpoena to the Justice Department calls for it to provide Congress any Epstein files in its possession, with victims' names redacted. It also calls for communications between former Biden administration officials and the Justice Department related to the case.
    


            The Republican-led panel additionally subpoenaed 10 individuals for closed-door depositions between August and mid-October. Those are: former Attorneys General Merrick Garland, William Barr, Jeff Sessions, Loretta Lynch, Eric Holder and Alberto Gonzales; former FBI Director James Comey; former special counsel and FBI Director Robert Mueller III; former Secretary of State and first lady Hillary Clinton; and former President Bill Clinton.
    


Trump administration debating releasing transcript of Ghislaine Maxwell interview with DOJ, sources say



            Subpoena deadlines are often starting points for negotiation on Capitol Hill and are sometimes pushed back, narrowed or challenged as political and legal disputes evolve around congressional inquiries.
    


            The House has fought for years to bolster its ability to force executive branch officials to testify pursuant to subpoenas. But the courts have ultimately given little legal help to congressional committees, causing subpoena fights to drag out for years with no conclusive ability for the House to use the courts to enforce them quickly.
    


            The Republican-led panel subpoenaed the six former attorneys general and two former FBI directors to speak with them about their time leading the DOJ and FBI that coincided with the criminal investigation into Epstein and his former associate Ghislaine Maxwell.
    


            Republicans zeroed in on former President Bill Clinton for his documented association with Epstein, which has publicly surfaced as part of civil lawsuits. In their subpoena letter to Hillary Clinton, Republicans cited as reasons to depose her the hiring of Maxwell's nephew to her 2008 campaign, as well as her relationship to her husband.
    


            “While the Department undertakes efforts to uncover and publicly disclose additional information related to Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell's cases, it is imperative that Congress conduct oversight of the federal government's enforcement of sex trafficking laws generally and specifically its handling of the investigation and prosecution of Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell,” the committee wrote in its subpoena letters.
    


            CNN has reached out to those subpoenaed.
    


            A spokesperson for the Justice Department confirmed that the department received the subpoena for documents, but declined to comment further. An attorney for Comey also declined to comment.
    


            In a number of its subpoena letters, the panel told those being asked to sit for interviews: “The Committee believes that you possess knowledge and information relevant to its investigation.”
    


            Demands for more information related to Epstein have roiled Capitol Hill in recent weeks. The subpoena amounts to a show of defiance by some Republicans against House Speaker Mike Johnson – who has attempted to tamp down congressional efforts to push for the release of the so-called Epstein files, instead arguing President Donald Trump's administration should have time to act on the issue.
    


            House Oversight Chair James Comer issued the subpoenas Tuesday after three Republicans joined with Democrats in a subcommittee vote late last month to release the files.
    


            As pressure mounted on Capitol Hill, the Republican House speaker shut the door on the possibility of a House vote on releasing information on Epstein before the August recess and moved to send lawmakers home early after it became clear that the issue was not going to fade away.
    


            Johnson has said that he supports transparency and has argued the president should be granted space to handle the matter before Congress intervenes, pointing to the administration's push to unseal grand jury materials related to the case. 



            Last month, the Justice Department sent its No. 2 official, Todd Blanche, to interview Maxwell, while asking courts to unseal grand jury materials from the case, and Trump has said he is open to releasing “credible” materials.
    


            Still, members of both parties have plowed ahead on the issue.
    


            The oversight panel separately subpoenaed Maxwell for a deposition – though it recently agreed to delay her testimony until after the US Supreme Court weighs her pending appeal of her conviction. Maxwell, who was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison in 2022 for carrying out a years-long scheme with Epstein to groom and sexually abuse underage girls, has asked the Supreme Court to take up her appeal and overturn her sex-trafficking conviction.
    


            And Democrats, who have viewed the controversy as a key test for Trump as he tries to satisfy his normally loyal base, moved to use an arcane procedural tool to force the Justice Department to release additional materials. The likelihood of their success hinges in part on the willingness of the Trump administration to release the information, as a court fight would be unlikely to force the documents over to Congress in the short term.
    


            CNN reported Tuesday that the Justice Department has an audio recording of Blanche's interview with Maxwell, and the administration is considering releasing a transcript of the interview publicly, according to three senior administration officials.

People in affected area of Harlem who are experiencing flu-like symptoms are advised to seek medical attention

Two people have died and at least 58 have been sickened amid an outbreak of legionnaires' disease in the Harlem area of New York City, according to health officials.

Details about those who have died are not immediately available, but officials have tracked the outbreak since 25 July in the central Harlem area and bordering communities.

Officials on 31 July had reported 22 sick and one dead before reporting the higher numbers on Monday.

A statement from the acting New York City health commissioner, Dr Michelle Morse, said people in the affected area who are experiencing flu-like symptoms “should contact a healthcare provider as soon as possible”.

“Legionnaires' disease can be effectively treated if diagnosed early, but New Yorkers at higher risk, like adults aged 50 and older and those who smoke or have chronic lung conditions, should be especially mindful of their symptoms and seek care as soon as symptoms begin,” Morse's statement added.

Legionnaires' disease is a type of pneumonia caused by the bacteria legionella, which grows in warm water. According to the New York City health department, “Legionnaires' disease can be caused by plumbing systems where conditions are favorable for legionella growth, such as cooling towers, whirlpool spas, hot tubs, humidifiers, hot water tanks and evaporative condensers of large air-conditioning systems.”

The disease cannot be transmitted person to person but can be contracted from breathing water vapor with the bacteria.

The department noted it had completed remediation for 11 cooling towers that tested positive for initial positive results for the presence of Legionella pneumophila, a type of bacteria that causes legionnaires' disease. Antibiotics are used to treat infections.

The disease is named after an outbreak in Philadelphia in 1976 where members of the Pennsylvania chapters of the American Legion attended a convention at a hotel and several became ill with atypical cases of pneumonia; 182 who attended the convention became ill and 29 died.

An estimated 8,000 to 18,000 people in the US are hospitalized for legionnaires' disease each year, and it has a fatality rate of 10%.

OceanGate's chief executive “completely ignored” safety inspections in the run-up to the Titan submarine implosion, which killed all five people on board.

A report into the disaster found that OceanGate's cultural and safety practices were “critically flawed” and that the company used “intimidation tactics” to avoid proper scrutiny.

It singled out Stockton Rush, the company's chief executive, who was accused of creating a “false sense of safety” for passengers by misrepresenting the submersible as indestructible.

Rush was onboard the Titan when it disappeared on June 18 2023, while about 3,800 metres below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean.

A four-day search for the vessel ensued, with the eventual discovery of a debris field containing parts of the Titan found around 500 metres from the bow of the Titanic shipwreck.

He was killed alongside Hamish Harding, a British explorer, Henri Nargeolet, a French diver, and Shahzada Dawood, the British-Pakistani businessman who took Suleman, his son, on board to see the Titanic wreckage.

The US Coast Guard's (USCG) final report into the implosion comes as Rush's estate is facing a $50m lawsuit from one of the victim's family.

The report found that Rush's “exhibited negligence” contributed to the death of himself and the four passengers who joined him on the Titan.

It said he “completely ignored” crucial inspections that could have spotted fatal flaws in the submersible's design.

It read: “The lack of both third-party oversight and experienced OceanGate employees on staff during their 2023 Titan operations allowed OceanGate's chief executive officer to completely ignore vital inspections, data analyses and preventative maintenance procedures, culminating in a catastrophic event.”

Rush “may have been subject to criminal liability” had he not been killed in the incident, with the USCG saying they would have referred him to the Department of Justice to pursue a “separate criminal investigation”.

A separate investigation into the implosion will “not occur in this instance due to the death of Mr Rush”.

As of this month, no criminal charges have been filed, though a separate investigation by the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York is ongoing.

OceanGate fully suspended all work shortly after the implosion in June 2023, and permanently ceased operations less than a month later. The report's findings effectively end any chance of the company resuming operations, as its reputation is irreparably damaged.

The report also claimed that Rush led a company with a “toxic workplace environment”, which led to staff members being fired to stop them from expressing concerns about safety standards.

Warnings about the safety of Titan's design were raised prior to the dive. A former OceanGate employee said a safety incident was inevitable, telling investigators that the company had bypassed all standard safety rules.

The ultimate cause of the Titan's implosion was the loss of structural integrity of its carbon fibre hull, which led to the “instantaneous” death of everyone on board, the USCG said.

“This loss of structural integrity caused the sudden catastrophic implosion of the hull,” the report said.

The people on board were “exposed to approximately 4,930 pounds per square inch of water pressure, resulting in the instantaneous death of all five occupants”.

In total, eight primary factors were given as reasons for the submersible's implosion, including the fact that the vessel did not meet the strict engineering standards required for an “inherently hazardous environment”.

OceanGate did not conduct an analysis to understand the life-cycle of the Titan, instead relying on a real-time monitoring system.

The company also continued to use the vessel, despite a number of incidents that compromised its safety, which were not properly investigated. It also failed to conduct proper maintenance before the doomed 2023 expedition.

The USCG believes the carbon fibre layers began to break down during a previous expedition – the 80th such dive the vessel had made.

Passengers on that dive said they heard a loud bang, which Rush attributed to the sub shifting its frame.

But the USCG now believes it would have been caused by delamination, which involves a material breaking down into thinner layers.

Following the sub's implosion, its wreckage was scattered across the seabed of the Atlantic, as was Rush's clothing and business cards.

A message that was sent from the doomed submersible gave false hope to Wendy Rush, the chief executive's widow, that the journey was proceeding as normal.

“What was that bang?” she asked, not realising that her husband had just been killed alongside Titan's four other passengers.

She then received a text message from the sub, which was at a depth of 3,300 metres as it descended to the wreck of the Titanic, saying that it had dropped two weights.

The message reassured Ms Rush that the expedition was proceeding normally, but in reality it took longer to receive than the sound of the implosion.

The family of Shahzada and Suleman Dawood released a statement in the aftermath of the report, calling for tougher regulation and oversight of submersible diving.

The report confirmed “unregulated behaviour, a lack of accountability, and a fundamentally flawed design” led to their deaths, a family statement read.

It continued: “No report can alter the heartbreaking outcome, nor fill the immeasurable void left by two cherished members of our family.

“We believe that accountability and regulatory change must follow such a catastrophic failure,” it said, adding that the family hopes the tragedy will serve as a turning point to bring “meaningful reform, rigorous safety standards, and effective oversight”.

“If Shahzada and Suleman's legacy can be a catalyst for regulatory change that helps prevent such a loss from ever happening again, it will bring us some measure of peace.”

Though criminal charges are unlikely, the Coast Guard has made 14 safety recommendations to the submersible industry in order to avoid future incidents.

It recommends that the USCG should require sub owners to notify them before they carry out operations, including by sending emergency response plans.

It also suggests that the Coast Guard has dedicated resources to “providing field support for vessels of novel design”.

A lawsuit filed by the administrator of Nargeolet's estate in Washington is seeking more than $50m. Rush's estate is fighting to have the case thrown out of court.

            The US Coast Guard Marine Board of Investigation tasked with examining the June 2023 implosion of the Titan submersible released its report on Tuesday, with the board chair stating that the deaths of the five people on board were “preventable.”
    


            The report lays responsibility for the tragedy largely at the feet of OceanGate, the Washington-based company that operated Titan. The MBI found the “primary contributing factors” to the implosion were OceanGate's “inadequate design, certification, maintenance and inspection process for the Titan,” a Coast Guard release said, also pointing to the company's “toxic workplace culture.”

            The ill-fated expedition seized the world's attention just over two years ago, when the vessel vanished during a dive to the wreck of the Titanic. A massive search operation unfolded in the North Atlantic, but the submersible's mangled wreckage was found on the ocean floor.
    


Stockton Rush, the founder and CEO of the vessel's operator, OceanGate; businessman Shahzada Dawood and his 19-year-old son, Suleman Dawood; businessman Hamish Harding; and French diver Paul-Henri Nargeolet were all killed. Those remains were matched to the five men on board through DNA testing and analysis, the Marine Board of Investigation previously said.
    


            “The two-year investigation has identified multiple contributing factors that led to this tragedy, providing valuable lessons learned to prevent a future occurrence,” Jason Neubauer, the MBI chair, said in the statement. “There is a need for stronger oversight and clear options for operators who are exploring new concepts outside of the existing regulatory framework.”
    


            OceanGate is no longer operating, but a spokesperson on Tuesday extended its condolences to the families of those killed in the implosion.
    


            “We again offer our deepest condolences to the families of those who died on June 18, 2023, and to all those impacted by the tragedy,” the spokesperson said. “After the tragedy occurred, the company permanently wound down operations and directed its resources fully towards cooperating with the Coast Guard's inquiry through its completion.”

David Paperny is a Vancouver-based film and television producer and director. 

In the winter of 1975, I went to work on a kibbutz. 

I was 17 years old. The work in the fish ponds was not glamorous: I stood for hours in a large, stinky pool of muddy water hauling spiny St. Peter's fish out into a tank for export. But the trip was an ideological inspiration. Here was Jewish community. Here were whole neighbourhoods celebrating my holidays. The communal kibbutz lifestyle united in the building of something new, something hopeful.

That kibbutz experience, combined with values I learned at home watching my parents' community work, drove home a strong sense of social justice.

I returned from Israel and entered the larger world imbued with a positive Jewish identity. Back then I didn't label it, but I now see it more clearly as carrying forward the Jewish value of Tikkun Olam – healing the world. 

For years I dedicated myself to that value, which included throwing myself into my Jewish community in Vancouver. We sent our kids to Jewish elementary school.

Fast forward to Oct. 9, 2023, when Israel's defence minister vowed a “complete siege” of the Gaza Strip in the wake of a devastating Hamas attack. 

Videos of Israeli hostages increase pressure for ceasefire as warnings about famine in Gaza grow

And fast forward again to last month, when I scrolled past photo after photo of mothers holding children whose vertebrae I could count, as truckloads of food awaited metres or kilometres away. What kind of country does this? Who foments manmade famine after bombarding such a densely populated area? Basic things that defined my identity have been shattered.

What inspires me about the concept of Tikkun Olam is that it exhorts us to act in the greater good, thinking beyond our own self-interests. To see others as ourselves.

What we are seeing in Gaza is not Tikkun Olam. It is a Chillul Hashem – a desecration of God's name. (Do I even believe in God? Most days I'm not sure. But I believe in humanity, and this is as profound a desecration as I have witnessed.) 

The past 22 months have been an agony and a mind warp. I watch as women, men and children are killed by bombs, buried in rubble, shot dead awaiting aid or killed fetching water. I turn to the leaders of my community for guidance for leadership.

And what do I get? Condemnation of Oct. 7, 2023. Concern for the hostages. And, for the most part, utter silence on the suffering of Gaza. 

Let me be clear: Oct. 7 was an atrocity. I still recall the horror of that day, when roughly 1,200 people were murdered and some 250 were taken hostage, the majority of them civilians. The fate of the remaining hostages should concern us all. (Including the Israeli government.)

But we are long past the time when silence was acceptable.

I hear silence and I hear fear. Fear of appearing anti-Israel – as though it were impossible to both love a country and condemn its actions. As though our community cannot withstand a conversation around how and whether a state can be dedicated to both Jewry and equality. Fear of antisemitism – as though one of the most significant endangerments to Jews around the world were not the actions of the state of Israel itself.

Gazans describe scenes of chaos, violence as Israel allows airdrops of aid

The more we conflate the Israeli government with Israel, the more we conflate Israel with Jewry, the more those who abhor the actions of the Israeli government will blame Jews.

What would address this? Action on the part of Canadian and American Jewish leaders. In fairness, there are Jewish organizations speaking out. I salute them. I wish they were louder and we gave them the respect they deserve.

Major Jewish organizations won't say this, so I will: Mark Carney, please demand action from Israel. The joint statement urging the end of the war and more aid was a good first step. Keep demanding an end to this murderous aid blockade – and back that demand up with the threat of economic sanctions.

I speak for myself, but I know I am not alone in feeling this way. There are other Canadian Jews – Zionists, even – who are aghast at what is unfolding and long for a community conversation. Many are rendered silent for fear of being labelled self-hating Jews or worse. There's fear of fomenting antisemitism, that ever-present spectre.

I understand this silence. But I can no longer abide it. We are witnessing horrors, and have no choice but to speak out.

I still cling to the Jewish values I espoused as a youth. It is the state of Israel that has abandoned them.

Byron Black, 69, put to death after legal battle in which lawyers said defibrillator would shock heart repeatedly

Tennessee has executed a man without deactivating his implanted defibrillator, despite uncertainty about whether the device would shock his heart when a lethal drug takes effect.

Byron Black died at 10.43am, prison officials said. Shortly after the lethal injection started, witnesses said Black told a spiritual adviser in the room that he was hurting badly.

Black looked around the room as the execution started and could be heard sighing and breathing heavily, witnesses said.

Black, 69, was executed after a back-and-forth in court over whether officials would need to turn off his implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, or ICD. He used a wheelchair, and had dementia, brain damage, kidney failure, congestive heart failure and other conditions, his attorneys said.

The non-profit Death Penalty Information Center said it was unaware of any other cases in which a prisoner was making similar claims to Black about ICDs or pacemakers.

The execution was Tennessee's second since May, after a pause for five years, first because of Covid-19 and then because of missteps by the Tennessee department of correction.

Twenty-eight men have died by court-ordered execution this year in the US, and nine other people are scheduled to be put to death in seven states during the remainder of 2025.

The number of executions this year exceeds the 25 carried out last year and in 2018. It is the highest total since 2015, when 28 people were put to death.

In mid-July, a trial court judge agreed with Black's attorneys that officials must have the instrument deactivated to avert the risk that it could cause unnecessary pain and prolong the execution. But the state supreme court intervened on 31 July to overturn that decision, saying the other judge lacked the authority to order the change.

The state disputed that the lethal injection would cause Black's defibrillator to shock him. Even if shocks were triggered, Black would not feel them, the state added.

Black's attorneys countered that even if the lethal drug being used, pentobarbital, renders someone unresponsive, they are not necessarily unaware or unable to feel pain.

On Monday, the US supreme court rejected Black's final appeal, and the Tennessee governor, Bill Lee, declined to stop the execution.

Black was convicted over the 1988 shooting deaths of his girlfriend Angela Clay, 29, and her two daughters, Latoya Clay, nine, and Lakeisha Clay, six. Prosecutors said he was in a jealous rage when he shot the three at their home. At the time, Black was on work release while serving time for shooting Clay's estranged husband.

Linette Bell, whose sister and two nieces were killed, recently told WKRN-TV: “He didn't have mercy on them, so why should we have mercy on him?”

“It feels like it is never-ending,” Bell told the news outlet. “They aren't even resting in their own grave.”

An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is a small, battery-powered electronic device that is surgically implanted in the chest, typically near the left collarbone. It serves as a pacemaker and an emergency defibrillator. Black's attorneys say the only way to be sure it's off is for a doctor to place a programming device over the implant site, sending it a deactivation command, with no surgery required.

The legal case also spurred a reminder that most medical professionals consider participation in executions a violation of healthcare ethics.

While the judge's order to deactivate the device was in place, state officials said Nashville general hospital practitioners would perform the procedure the day before at the hospital, but would not travel to the prison on execution day as the court required. The judge offered some leeway, allowing the procedure at the hospital on the morning of the execution.

But the Nashville hospital then released a statement saying the state's contractor did not contact proper hospital leadership and that there had been no agreement to do the work.

In recent years, Black's legal team has also tried and failed to get a new hearing over whether he is intellectually disabled and ineligible for the death penalty under US supreme court precedent.

His attorneys have said that if they had delayed a prior attempt to seek his intellectual disability claim, he would have been spared under a 2021 state law.

Nashville's district attorney, Glenn Funk, contended in 2022 that Black is intellectually disabled and deserves a hearing under that 2021 law, but the judge denied it. That is because an inmate cannot get an intellectual disability hearing under the 2021 law if they have already filed a similar request and a court has ruled on it “on the merits”.

In Funk's attempt, he focused on input from an expert for the state in 2004 who determined back then that Black didn't meet the criteria for what was then called “mental retardation”. But she concluded that Black met the new law's criteria for a diagnosis of intellectual disability.

Black had also been seeking a determination by the courts that he is incompetent to be executed.

Rwanda on Tuesday became the third African nation to agree to accept deportees from the United States under the Trump administration's plans to send migrants to countries they have no ties with to get them off American soil.

Rwandan government spokesperson Yolande Makolo told The Associated Press in a statement that the East African country would accept up to 250 deportees from the U.S., with “the ability to approve each individual proposed for resettlement” under the agreement.

Makolo didn't provide a timeline for any deportees to arrive in Rwanda or say if they would arrive at once or in several batches. She said details were still being worked out.

The U.S. sent 13 men it described as dangerous criminals who were in the U.S. illegally to South Sudan and Eswatini in Africa last month and has said it is seeking more agreements with African nations. It said those deportees' home countries refused to take them back.

The U.S. has also deported hundreds of Venezuelans and others to Costa Rica, El Salvador and Panama under President Donald Trump's plans to expel people who he says entered the U.S. illegally and are “the worst of the worst.”

Tony Keller: Trump wants to deport millions. What impact will that have on Canada?

Rwanda attracted international attention and some outrage when it struck a deal in 2022 with the U.K. to accept migrants who had arrived in the U.K. to seek asylum. Under that proposed deal, their claims would have been processed in Rwanda and, if successful, they would have stayed there.

The contentious agreement was criticized by rights groups and others as being unethical and unworkable and was ultimately scrapped when Britain's new Labour government took over. Britain's Supreme Court ruled in 2023 that the deal was unlawful because Rwanda was not a safe third country for migrants.

The Trump administration has come under scrutiny for the African countries it has entered into secretive deals with to take deportees. It sent eight men from South Sudan, Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar and Vietnam to South Sudan in early July after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling cleared the way for their deportations.

They were held for weeks in a converted shipping container at an American military base in Djibouti as the legal battle over their deportations played out. South Sudan, which is tipping toward civil war, has declined to say where the men are being held or what their fate is.

The U.S. also deported five men who are citizens of Vietnam, Jamaica, Cuba, Yemen and Laos to the southern African kingdom of Eswatini, where the government said they will be held in solitary confinement in prison for an undetermined period of time.

A human rights lawyer in Eswatini said the men are being denied access to legal representation there and has taken authorities to court. Eswatini is Africa's last absolute monarchy, and the king rules over government and political parties are effectively banned.

Both South Sudan and Eswatini have declined to give details of their agreements with the U.S.

Rwanda, a relatively small country of some 15 million people, has long stood out on the continent for its recovery from a genocide that killed over 800,000 people in 1994. It has promoted itself under longtime President Paul Kagame as an example of stability and development, but human rights groups allege there are also deadly crackdowns on any perceived dissent against Kagame, who has been president for 25 years.

Government spokesperson Makolo said the agreement with the U.S. was Rwanda doing its part to help with international migration issues because “our societal values are founded on reintegration and rehabilitation.”

“Those approved (for resettlement in Rwanda) will be provided with workforce training, health care, and accommodation support to jumpstart their lives in Rwanda, giving them the opportunity to contribute to one of the fastest-growing economies in the world over the last decade,” she said. There were no details about whether Rwanda had received anything in return for taking the deportees.

Gonzaga Muganwa, a Rwandan political analyst, said “appeasing President Trump pays.”

“This agreement enhances Rwanda's strategic interest of having good relationships with the Trump administration,” he said.

The U.K. government estimated that its failed migration deal with Rwanda cost around US$900-million in public money, including approximately US$300-million in payments to Rwanda, which said it was not obligated to refund the money when the agreement fell apart.

MOSCOW, August 5. /TASS/. Russia ends its moratorium on the deployment of short-and medium-range missiles; the EU is unlikely to jointly purchase US weapons for Ukraine; and Iran forms a Defense Council as it rules out direct dialogue with the US. These stories have topped Tuesday's newspaper headlines across Russia.

 

Moscow is ending its moratorium on the deployment of ground-launched short-and medium-range missiles, the Russian Foreign Ministry announced. According to its statement, the West is openly stationing short-and medium-range missiles in various parts of the world, while Russia's initiatives on the issue have seen no reciprocity, Vedomosti reports.

The Russian Foreign Ministry added that officials from the US and its allies announced plans to ensure ‘long-term'—that is, permanent—presence of such US weapons in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. In particular, this is about the Typhon medium-range missile system deployed to the Philippines, which was delivered to the country under the guise of military drills but remained there afterward. The Precision Strike Missile (PrSM), whose subsequent modifications will have a range of over 1,000 km, was once again tested during an exercise in Australia in 2025. Additionally, the US has announced plans to deploy medium-range missiles to Germany in 2026.

Oleg Barabanov, program director at the Valdai International Discussion Club, does not rule out that Russia's move to end the moratorium is an element of psychological pressure. Moscow is not seeking to raise the stakes but is rather conducting an informational campaign against the US president. "An arms race between the US and Russia has been going on for years. Now, a new aspect is being added to the Ukrainian theater of war—a global nuclear missile threat," Barabanov said.

According to Dmitry Stefanovich, researcher with the Center for International Security at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of World Economy and International Relations, this is a somewhat belated move to "even up the stakes." However, it's also clear that tensions continue to mount, with all parties contributing to the process. The expert notes that Russia's unilateral moratorium never took full effect after the collapse of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF Treaty), even though the initiative had a lot of potential to strengthen strategic stability.

Sergey Oznobishchev, director of the Institute for Strategic Assessments, told Kommersant that although in the short term, an arms race is expected to take place with regard to ground-based short-and medium-range missiles, in the longer run, the parties will try to make an agreement on some limitation measures. In the expert's view, the current situation is a bit reminiscent of the late 1970s European missile crisis between the Soviet Union and NATO, which actually resulted in the INF Treaty. "After all, the Russian president has repeatedly said that an arms race is not our preference," the analyst emphasized.

 

Participation in the United States' initiative on weapons supplies to Kiev does not require consensus within the European Union, an official at the Dutch embassy in Russia told Izvestia. Earlier, the EU and the US reached a deal, which particularly includes weapons procurement for Ukraine. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte called on the bloc's members to start purchasing more US weapons for the Ukrainian army as soon as possible. However, US President Donald Trump's initiative is too demanding for many EU nations at this point, experts point out.

Earlier reports said that European countries would use various mechanisms to send US weapons to Ukraine. The options include the handover of weapons from their own stockpiles and later purchases of similar weapons for their needs. Germany was one of the countries that supported the initiative, announcing plans to transfer Patriot systems to Kiev. Denmark also expressed readiness to buy US weapons for Ukraine. The Netherlands pledged to send €500 million worth of US weapons to the Ukrainian armed forces. The NATO chief said that those willing to support Kiev also included Finland, Sweden, Norway, the United Kingdom and Canada.

The thing to note is that the deals Trump has been making recently tend to only formally document obligations, political scientist Ivan Loshkaryov noted. "But when it comes to details, the setup of agreements often changes. Given that EU countries' finances are limited and decision-making by EU institutions is complicated, the real scope of weapons supplies to Ukraine will be smaller than announced, and the deliveries will take more time," the expert elaborated.

Clearly, the initiative threatens to have at least several repercussions, including a rise in debt and budget deficit, Loshkaryov noted. Weapons supplies to Ukraine are objectively becoming a burden for European politicians. "In view of low arms output in the US, deliveries to Ukraine leave open the question of EU countries' rearmament within NATO," the expert stressed.

Another thing to keep in mind is the possibility of a peaceful solution to the Ukraine conflict, the analyst went on to say. If agreements are reached on the entire range of related issues, a compromise may also be found on weapons supplies. Some weapons could be sent back to NATO countries, or Ukraine could be forced to resell them to pay its debts.

 

On August 4, the Iranian leadership rejected the prospect of direct talks with the US, which had been suspended due to the Israeli military operation launched overnight into June 13. As Tehran expects another round of escalation, it has announced the establishment of the Defense Council, which is supposed to make coordinated decisions on security issues, Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes.

The Defense Council will handle issues related to defending the country against external threats. Foreign media outlets point out that such an initiative has been implemented for the first time in decades and is likely aimed at combining the capabilities of the country's armed forces and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). In addition, a crucial context for the creation of the Defense Council is that dozens of generals responsible for strategic fields were killed in the recent 12-day war.

Russian International Affairs Council expert Kirill Semyonov notes that Iran's move to establish the Defense Council is part of preparations for a new war with Israel. "The Defense Council is being created in Iran in order to make sure that decision-making is more rapid," the expert explained. "Until recently, it was up to the Supreme National Security Council, a far more cumbersome institution, which discussed a large number of issues, but now, a body is being formed where it's clear who is accountable for what," he added.

The analyst pointed out that it used to take Iran a long time to develop retaliatory measures in the direct conflict with Israel. "There were problems stemming from the complexity of internal communication and decision-making," Semyonov observed, referring to the recent 12-day war. That said, the Defense Council will now work so that military commanders and civilian authorities don't have to spend time on such discussions, the expert concluded.

 

Central Asian nations are facing a risk of gas shortages, with a deficit threatening Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, Rossiyskaya Gazeta reports, citing Kazakh news outlet Bugin.info. One of the ways out of the situation is to increase gas supplies from Russia.

The reasons for a rise in gas consumption in Central Asia include population growth, industrial development, infrastructure wear and tear and limited domestic resources.

Alexey Grivach, deputy head of the National Energy Security Fund, points to certain advantages of Russian gas imports aimed at meeting the current and potential energy shortages in these countries: there are enough resources and infrastructure facilities that require minor upgrading.

According to Yevgenia Popova, project manager at the Implementa company, the deficit scenario will unfold in a situation where energy consumption significantly grows in Central Asian countries but production does not increase. For Russia, infrastructure constraints will be the main obstacle to raising exports. At this point, plans include gas supplies to Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan to meet their own needs. However, swap deliveries to China are possible in the future (with Russian gas provided to Central Asian countries and their gas exported to China).

As Russia has lost access to the European gas market, this option for increasing pipeline gas exports could be very appealing. The only question is what the commercial terms will be. In Grivach's view, there is currently no better offer on the market for Russian pipeline gas exports, and none is likely to emerge anytime soon.

Valery Andrianov, associate professor at the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation, also believes that the Central Asian market, which requires a relatively short transportation leg, is a promising option for Russia's gas giant Gazprom to maintain and even increase its exports.

 

The Thailand-Cambodia talks that kicked off in Kuala Lumpur on August 4 are unlikely to settle the years-long conflict between the two countries, said experts interviewed by Izvestia. Observers from China and the US are expected to join the parties later. For Beijing and Washington, it's not only about peacekeeping ambition, but also geopolitics, as China-US confrontation is particularly intensifying in the Asia-Pacific region.

Hostilities between Thailand and Cambodia broke out on July 24, and four days later, the countries agreed on a ceasefire brokered by Malaysia, China and the United States. However, both parties have been accusing each other of violating the truce ever since. As no lasting ceasefire has been established yet, the parties will try to make an agreement for those evacuated from border areas to return home, said Yelena Fomichova, senior researcher with the Center of Southeast Asia, Australia and Oceania at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of Oriental Studies.

The main reason behind the conflict between Thailand and Cambodia is that their border is not demarcated. Differences in documents date back to the times of French Indochina, a colony that included Cambodia, which had earlier been partially under the sovereignty of Siam (now Thailand). "The issue will not be resolved at the current stage because it is too complex," Fomichova pointed out.

Meanwhile, territorial disputes are often used to mask domestic problems, which is especially true for Thailand, the expert remarked. The situation in the country is tense particularly due to political instability stemming from a change of prime minister, as well as to economic issues related to a sluggish GDP growth rate. That said, the risk remains of a renewed conflict, said Paul Chambers, visiting fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies.

Regional instability is no good for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which is why it was the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur that hosted talks between two members of the group. Malaysia currently holds the ASEAN presidency and it's clearly important for the country's government to demonstrate its leading, although temporary, role in the organization. Maintaining unity within the association is a crucial political goal, Fomichova stressed.

NEW YORK, August 5. /TASS/. The sale of US weapons to Ukraine via European countries will relieve American taxpayers of the financial burden, US Permanent Representative to NATO Matthew Whitaker said.

"[US] President [Donald] Trump announced this mechanism where our NATO allies would buy American armaments and ammunition and then those allies would provide that to Ukraine," the diplomat said during a Newsmax TV broadcast. "Obviously, this takes the American taxpayer out of the equation. No longer are American taxpayers bearing the burden of the war in Ukraine," he explained.

Whitaker pointed out that the new mechanism does not weaken US positions but strengthens them. Washington sells weapons produced by US workers, thus ensuring employment in the country and supporting the national defense industry. According to the diplomat, the US has successfully shifted responsibility for Europe's security onto the continent's countries.

On July 14, President Donald Trump announced at a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte that the two had agreed to the delivery of US weapons to Ukraine at the expense of European countries. The alliance will coordinate the deliveries, which will include weapons such as Patriot systems. The US president said that the volume of military aid that will be supplied to Ukraine through NATO will amount to billions of dollars.

Five German Eurofighter Typhoon jets landed at an air base near Warsaw on Aug. 4 as a deterrent ahead of the planned Zapad military exercises in Belarus, the German media reported.

The fighter planes landed at the Minsk Mazowiecki Air Base and will help monitor NATO airspace and potential Russian activity along the eastern flank for the next few weeks, starting on Aug. 5, a German Air Force spokesperson told DPA news agency.

The Russian-Belarusian Zapad-2025 drills are expected to take place in mid-September and involve around 13,000 troops. Kyiv and NATO officials have voiced concern over the drills, which are set to occur amid Russia's ongoing full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

"This deployment is a clear sign of alliance solidarity within NATO and serves as a credible deterrent and the protection of shared airspace," a German Air Force spokesperson told Bild.

The German military also deployed around 150 soldiers to Poland as NATO braces for the large-scale drills.

While Belarus initially announced its intention to move the exercises deeper inland to ease tensions, Belarusian Deputy Defense Minister Pavel Muraveika warned last month that this decision may be reversed due to the "difficult military and political situation."

Although Minsk has not deployed its own troops in combat during Russia's war in Ukraine, it has been a key ally to Moscow. Russian forces used Belarusian territory as a staging ground for military operations in 2022, including for the unsuccessful invasion of Kyiv Oblast.

President Volodymyr Zelensky warned in February that Russia planned to deploy up to 150,000 troops, or 15 divisions, to Belarus in preparation for a potential military escalation this year.

Allied leaders have been increasingly warning about a potential armed clash with Russia in the coming years, with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte warning that the conflict could erupt within the next five years.

The funding will be channeled through NATO's Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA), which enables fast-track purchases of U.S. arms to meet Ukraine's most urgent defense needs. 

President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine has already prepared a draft agreement on drones and is ready to finalize what he called "one of the strongest agreements this could be."



Gazprom, Russia's state-owned gas giant, has seen its exports to Europe hit lows not seen since the 1970s, according to the Moscow Times. 



"(Russian President Vladimir) Putin will stop killing people if you get (the price of) energy down another $10 a barrel. He's going to have no choice, because his economy stinks," U.S. President Donald Trump said. 

Putin is reluctant to provoke Trump and recognizes that pressing ahead with the war could jeopardize a potential thaw in relations with Washington and the West, but his military objectives remain the top priority, two sources told Reuters.

Ukraine has detected Indian-made components in Russian Shahed-type attack drones, Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak confirmed on Aug. 5, adding Moscow must be denied access to supplies that "enable the killing of Ukrainians."

Colonel Vasyl Myshanskyi is accused of signing government contracts with supplier companies at knowingly inflated prices.

Russian forces launched an Iskander-M ballistic missile from Russia's Bryansk Oblast and 46 Shahed-type drones from Kursk, Bryansk, Orel, and Primorsk-Akhtarsk against Ukraine overnight, according to Ukraine's Air Force.

A Chisinau court ruled that Evghenia Gutul was guilty of systematically bringing funds from Russia to Moldova for the now-banned pro-Russian Shor Party's needs between 2019 and 2022.

K-555 Knyaz Pozharsky is a Project 955A Borei–A–class vessel, a crucial component of the Kremlin's nuclear triad.

Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) special forces fought off a Russian attempt to advance in Sumy Oblast, "destroying more than eight Russian companies" during the battle, the agency said on Aug. 5

"The soldiers on this front are recording the participation of mercenaries from China, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, and African countries in the war. We will respond," President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a statement.

Lithuanian foreign minister Kęstutis Budrys says drone, which authorities say was carrying explosives, shows incidents crossing ‘onto Nato territory'

Lithuania's foreign minister Kęstutis Budrys said a bit more about the incident on his social media channels:

“Last Monday, a Russian military drone violated Lithuanian airspace. This marks the second such incident in less than a month. Similar airspace violations have also been reported recently by other Allies. 

These repeated incidents represent an alarming sign of the spillover of Russia's aggression against Ukraine onto Nato territory. 

We cannot compromise the security of our country and citizens, nor the integrity of Nato airspace. We must remain vigilant, as the threat is real and growing. 

Today, with @DSakaliene, we issued a joint letter to @SecGenNATO calling for immediate measures to enhance air defence capabilities in #Lithuania & accelerate the full implementation of the rotational air defence model. 

Air defence is vital to Allied security. Securing Nato's Eastern Flank must remain a top priority for the Alliance.”

… and on that note, it's a wrap!

Lithuania warned about “an alarming spillover of Russia's aggression” into Nato territory after confirming that a Russian drone which violated the country's airspace last week was carrying explosives – even if it still believed it only got across the border by accident (17:33)

The incident prompted the authorities in Vilnius to request additional air defence support from Nato (17:18.)

On Ukraine,

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he had a “productive conversation” with US president Donald Trump this afternoon, talking about the importance of keeping the pressure on Russia to “stop the killings as soon as possible” (16:35).

The pair discussed the US plans to impose sanctions and secondary tariffs aiming to disrupt Russia's financing of its war operations in Ukraine (14:34), endorsed by the EU (12:31), but criticised by India (13:13).

Earlier, the Netherlands (10:15) and three Nordic countries – Denmark, Norway and Sweden (13:57) – announced their plans to finance further military aid for Ukraine under a new US-Nato mechanism agreed with Trump last month.

Earlier today, 38 countries backed a call to Russia to return “unlawfully deported and forcibly transferred Ukrainian children” back to their families in Ukraine. (18:01).

On trade,

The EU defended its recently agreed deal with the US, saying the choice was not “between a good and a great outcome,” but a “bad but less bad outcome” (11:57) rejecting fresh criticism from German finance minister, Lars Klingbeil (12:46).

But US president Trump warned he could impose punishing tariffs of 35% on the EU should the bloc failed to meet its investment promises (14:56), signalling a significant difference of opinion between Washington and Brussels over what was agreed on that point (15:26, 15:56, 17:39).

Trump also repeated his warnings on pharmaceuticals, repeating it was his intention to have them “made in our country.”

38 countries, including Canada, France, Germany, Japan and the UK, urged Russia to return “unlawfully deported and forcibly transferred Ukrainian children” back to their families in Ukraine.

The statement, published by the office of the Ukrainian president and also signed by Council of Europe and the European Union, said that Ukraine gave Russia a list of 339 Ukrainian children, and expected it to “act promptly and meaningfully on the initial list”, and to then cooperate on returning all children back to Ukraine “in accordance with international law and relevant UN resolutions.”

“The return of Ukrainian children is one vital step in this broader imperative, to ensure that children are never used as pawns of war. All actions must be guided by the best interests of the child in accordance with international law,” the signatories said.

Speaking of Geneva:

Delegates at the UN plastic pollution treaty talks in Geneva must secure an ambitious global agreement so they can look future generations in the eye, one of the world's leading marine litter experts has said.

Prof Richard Thompson, who was named one of Time's 100 most influential people this year for his groundbreaking work on plastic pollution, said decisive action was needed to protect human health and the planet.

He spoke as delegates from more than 170 countries prepared to meet in Geneva to bridge what have become deep divisions over whether limits on plastic production are included in a final treaty.

Since 2022, when the UN first secured an agreement from 173 countries to develop a legally binding treaty to cut plastic pollution, five separate negotiations have failed to secure a final text to sign.

The initial agreement was for a treaty to address the whole life cycle of plastics. But increasing numbers of plastics industry lobbyists have attended each round of talks to push back against production cuts.

The president of Switzerland is travelling to Washington to try and avert a punishing 39% tariff rate on all exports including pharma and luxury watches exported to the US.

Karin Keller-Sutter and economy minister Guy Parmelin were heading to Washington “to facilitate meetings with the US authorities at short notice and hold talks with a view to improving the tariff situation for Switzerland,” the government said in a statement.

The 39% tariff announced by Trump last Friday blindsided the government and led industry associations to warn of job losses.

The Swiss government noted that the country will be hit by much higher tariffs than what other wealthy economies, such as Britain, Japan or the European Union, are facing.

Switzerland counts the US as its top export market for pharmaceuticals, watches, machinery and chocolates with bilateral trade quadrupling in the past two decades.

But it still has a $48bn trade deficit with the US, something that has irritated Trump to such a degree that he took a personal swipe at Keller-Sutter on Tuesday.

He told CNBC that “the woman was nice but she didn't want to listen” when they spoke last Thursday.

Donald Trump's White House is doubling down on claims that he can do “anything” he likes with the $600m (£451m) of investments pledged by the EU as part of the tariff deal Brussels struck at his Scottish golf course nine days ago.

A White House press release hailing the top 10 take outs from Trump's interview today on CNBC starts with his “historic trade deals”.

“We're taking in trillions of dollars … If you look, Japan – we're taking in $550 billion, and ... that's OUR money. It's our money to invest as we'd like. European Union – $650 billion... and they're going to buy $750 billion worth of our energy.”

The investment pledge is not an EU fund for the US, senior EU officials have pointed out. Rather, it is an aggregate of what private EU companies have committed to, or say they will invest, in the next three years.

And for the second historic move, the White House refers to Trump's pledge to end what he sees as Europe's price gouging on pharma quoting him saying:

“For 30 years, Europe has had drug prices that are, in many cases, one-tenth the cost of drugs here... We're not going to pay ten times more for a pill than they pay in Europe, and that's going to have a tremendous impact.”

Lithuania's foreign minister Kęstutis Budrys said a bit more about the incident on his social media channels:

“Last Monday, a Russian military drone violated Lithuanian airspace. This marks the second such incident in less than a month. Similar airspace violations have also been reported recently by other Allies. 

These repeated incidents represent an alarming sign of the spillover of Russia's aggression against Ukraine onto Nato territory. 

We cannot compromise the security of our country and citizens, nor the integrity of Nato airspace. We must remain vigilant, as the threat is real and growing.

Air defence is vital to Allied security. Securing Nato's Eastern Flank must remain a top priority for the Alliance.”

We're getting big news from Lithuania with the country's prosecutor general confirming that an unmanned drone that crossed into the country from Belarus last week and crashed near a military training ground was carrying explosives.

The drone was originally reported by local residents concerned by the sight and the noise the object was making when flying near Lithuania's capital, Vilnius. It took authorites four days before they eventually located it on the ground near the Gaižiūnai military training base.

Prosecutor general Nida Grunskienė said today that it was established that the drone was carrying an explosive device, which was “neutralised at the scene,” Lithuania's public broadcaster LRT reported. Various parts of the aircraft are now undergoing more in-depth forensic examination, she said.

Col Dainius Paškevičius, chief of staff of the Lithuanian Air Force, noted the drone carried only “about two kilograms of explosives,” way less than a typical load of 50 kg, LRT noted.

Lithuania's defence minister Dovilė Šakalienė said the current assumption was that the drone entered Lithuania by accident after being disoriented by the Ukrainian defence systems, but this will remain a part of the investigation.

Both Šakalienė and the country's foreign minister Kęstutis Budrys also said that Lithuania had notified Nato of the initial findings and requested urgent additional air defence support to protect the Lithuanian sky from similar incidents.

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he had a “productive conversation” with US president Donald Trump this afternoon, discussing how to end the war with Russia.

Repeatedly thanking Trump for his support, Zelenskyy said it was “really necessary to stop the killings as soon as possible,” adding this could have already happened “if Russians had not dragged it out.”

The Ukrainian president said the leaders noted that “the Russians have increased the severity of the strikes,” and said that Trump was "fully informed” about the situation.

“Of course, we talked about sanctions against Russia. Their economy continues to fall, and that is why Moscow is so attentive to this prospect and President Trump's determination. This can change a lot,” he said.

Zelenskyy also said they briefly discussed the European aid packages for Ukraine confirmed by the Netherlands last night and the three Nordic countries today, adding that “this interaction with Nato will continue.”

He also said that Ukraine has prepared a draft agreement on drones with the US, and was ready “to discuss in detail and conclude it.”

Back to Ukraine, the country's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has welcomed the €430m military aid package put together by Denmark, Norway and Sweden (13:57), saying it will “significantly boost our ability to protect lives.”

“These steps are a new, real foundation for long-term security across all of Europe. Russia will never turn Europe into a continent of war, and it is precisely through our joint efforts that we are ensuring peace will prevail,” he said.

The EU's promise to invest $600bn in the US as part of its tariff deal is just that. It is an “intention” and not a “gift” as decribed by Donald Trump (14:56), senior officials have said.

Trump's characterisation of the money is the type of clash Brussels is desperate to avoid, given the US president's history of making declarations he does not deliver on.

The day after the EU-US tariff deal was struck at Donald Trump's Scottish golf resort, officials explained very clearly that the promise of investments was an “aggregate” of money promised by EU companies, including major car manufacturers in Germany and pharma companies, many of which are based in Ireland, the target of much of Trump's ire when it comes to medicines.

A senior official in the EU insisted last week that $600bn did not “come out of thin air” but was the result of detailed conversations with trade associations and big EU companies about their investment plans in the US.

The EU itself has no power to invest money itself in the US.

“We have basically aggregated what we know about investment intentions of companies, of private companies,” said one senior source who added that that this would be expressed in the joint statement as “an intention”.

This is at odds with Trump's description of it as a fund that he can personally direct.
 “The details are, $600bn to invest in anything I want, anything. I can do anything I want with it. And the purpose was, they've been, you know, ripping us to so many years that it's time that they pay up and they have to pay up,” he said earlier today.

But it is also at odds with the White House statement on 28 July, the day after the EU-US deal was struck.

It describes the $600m as “new investments” that will be made “by 2028”.
  Under the title “Massive EU Investment in the United States”, the White House repeats the point saying: “The EU will invest $600 billion in the United States over the course of President Trump's term.”

You won't be surprised to hear that the $600bn investment promised by the EU is a tiny bit more complicated than “a gift” that Trump can do anything he wants with it (14:56).

It mostly covers existing and future commitments already made by EU companies – and not represent a blank cheque for Trump to do anything he wants with it.

We will bring you more on this shortly.

Trump also bragged in passing that leaders of Nato “do whatever I want.”

Erm.

US president Donald Trump also said that if the EU fails to meet its investment promises under the EU-US deal, the bloc will face tariffs of 35%.

He said:

“They bought down their tariffs. They paid $600bn and because of that I reduced their tariffs from thirty percent down to fifteen percent, and a couple of countries came, ‘How come, the EU is paying less than us', and I said well, because they gave me $600bn.

And that's a gift, that's not like, you know, a loan … they gave us $600bn that we can invest in anything we want.”

He added:

“The details are, $600bn to invest in anything I want, anything. I can do anything I want with it.

And the purpose was, they've been, you know ripping us to so many years that it's time that they pay up and they have to pay up.”

He then criticised the Swiss “prime minister” – it was the country's federal president – saying she “didn't want to listen” to his arguments.

Trump then moved on to pharmaceuticals, saying “they make a fortune with pharmaceuticals, and they make in China and Ireland and everything else,” and that he will be announcing separate tariffs on them “within the next week or so.”

“This is a, you know, this is a separate class than the 15% tariffs on sort of everything. These are excluded classes, I like to call them, like steel, aluminium.”

He added:

“We'll be putting an initially small tariff on pharmaceuticals, but in one year, one and a half years maximum, it's going to go to 150%, and then it's going to go to 250%, because we want pharmaceuticals made in our country.”

There are many more lines of interest in this Trump interview, as he also spoke about the EU-US trade deal. Let me get them for you now.

US president Donald Trump has been talking to CNBC's Squawk Box in the last few minutes, and he suggested that a further drop in energy prices could make Russian president Vladimir Putin halt the Russian invasion of Ukraine and “stop killing people.”

If energy goes down enough, Putin is going to stop killing people.

He explained:

“If you get energy down, another $10 a barrel, he's going to have no choice because his economy stinks.”

Trump also repeated his threat he would increase US tariffs on India soon over their continuing purchase of Russian oil.

“They have the highest tariff of anybody ... We settled on 25%, but I think I'm going to raise that very substantially over the next 24 hours because they're buying Russian oil, they're fueling the war machine, and if they going to do that, I'm not going to be happy.”

Nato secretary general Mark Rutte has just responded to the Nordic package of help for Ukraine, saying:

“Grateful to Denmark, Norway & Sweden for fast action to fund a package of US military support for Ukraine. This will deliver life-saving equipment & critical supplies to the front-line, strengthening Ukraine's hand & helping them deter aggression as they pursue lasting peace.”

He also earlier thanked the Netherlands for its contribution, saying:

“Great to see the Netherlands taking the lead and funding the first package of US military equipment for Ukraine under NATO's Prioritised Ukraine Requirements List initiative. I thank Allies for getting Ukraine the equipment it urgently needs to defend against Russian aggression. I expect further significant announcements from other Allies soon.”

Norway, Sweden and Denmark have just announced plans to jointly finance a support package for Ukraine under the new US-Nato mechanism, Prioritised Ukraine Requirement List, agreed with US president Donald Trump last month.

The package, estimated to be worth some €430m in total, will include support for “Ukraine's air defence, ammunition and other essential equipment,” Norwegian government's press release said. The details of the package will not be made public for security reasons.

Sweden will make the largest contribution of over €230m, with Norway to follow at around €120m and Denmark at around €80m, according to indicated totals.

Norwegian defence minister Tore O. Sandvik said the new package was meant to ensure that Ukraine “quickly receives the equipment it needs” to defend itself from Russia.

Simultaneously, Swedish ministers presented the outline of the deal at a press conference in Stockholm.

In her opening statement, deputy prime minister and energy, industry minister Ebba Busch insisted “Ukraine's cause is our cause,” as she stressed the need to continue supporting Ukraine amid sustained Russian attacks.

Defence minister Pål Jonson added that the continued strikes showed there was little appetite from Russia to end the conflict.

This is a second package of this kind after the Netherlands announced its plans to spend around €500m on US weapons for Ukraine under the new scheme (10:15).

Meanwhile, India has responded to criticism from the US and the EU, saying it is being unfairly singled out by them over its Russian oil purchases when they both trade extensively with Moscow despite the war in Ukraine, Reuters reported.

In a rare show of unity, prime minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the main opposition Congress condemned Trump's repeated criticism of New Delhi.

India's foreign ministry said in a statement issued late on Monday that “it is revealing that the very nations criticising India are themselves indulging in trade with Russia“.

“It is unjustified to single out India,” the ministry said. It said the EU conducted €67.5bn euros ($78.02bn) in trade with Russia in 2024, including record imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) reaching 16.5 million metric tons.

The United States, the statement said, continues to import Russian uranium hexafluoride for use in its nuclear power industry, palladium, fertilisers and chemicals. It did not give a source for the export information.

Oh-oh.

The EU has just publicly clashed with Germany over finance minister Lars Klingbeil's comments on EU-US trade in Washington last night.

Klingbeil said the EU was “too weak” in negotiations, and argued that “we can't be satisfied with the result that was achieved,” suggesting he would push for limited exemptions for Germany's steel sector, as reported by Deutsche Welle.

But EU trade spokesperson, Olof Gill, pointedly said the bloc was “quite surprised” to hear his comments.

He said:

“I would remind you that EU, member states and business stakeholders have consistently underscored that a trade conflict with the US was not a desirable course of action. They have insisted to us that only a negotiated solution could ensure stability and protect our shared interests. 

This was the view of an overwhelming majority of EU member states, including the one from which the minister you mentioned hails.”

Gill said the EU “reached a negotiated solution to avoid a lose-lose tariff escalation, that's what our member states asked for, … that's what we have delivered.”

“So … it is most surprising to us to hear that a minister from the member state in question has expressed that view, given that nothing has happened here in terms of the Commission's approach, negotiation or outcome achieved without the clear signal received from our member states.”

He also said that more work on steel is being done at the EU level.

Deputy chief spokesperson Arianna Podestà went further saying that Klingbeil's comments “do not correspond to the conversations we have had with the same member state over the past weeks and months.”

After 90% loss of global sunflower sea star population in 10 years, researchers hope decline can now be tackled

A decade after the onset of a sea star wasting disease (SSWD) epidemic considered the largest ever documented in the wild, researchers have identified the microbial culprit responsible: a strain of the bacterium Vibrio pectenicida.

In 10 years, the bacterium has ravaged sunflower sea stars (Pycnopodia helianthoides), a large sea star or starfish, along the western coast of North America, with a loss of 5.8 billion since 2013 – or 90% of the total global population. The sunflower sea star is on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's red list of critically endangered species.

Previous studies had tested for V pectenicida in tissue samples and yielded inconclusive results. Instead, by examining the sea stars' coelomic fluid, which acts like blood, researchers were able to confirm with certainty V pectenicida's role in causing SSWD due to its high abundance there.

Infection with the V pectenicida strain FHCF-3 begins with exterior lesions, leading to limb loss and contortion, and ultimately kills afflicted individuals by melting their tissues into a white, mucus-like paste. Identifying the disease in afflicted sea stars was impossible without a known pathogen, as sea stars can respond with similar visual signals to other stressors such as low oxygen, salinity variation and extreme heat. The indirect link between rising ocean temperatures and SSWD remains a key area of interest, since V pectenicida is known to proliferate in warm water during seasonal variations and anomalous marine heating events.

The research, published this week in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution, was led by Dr Melanie Prentice and Dr Alyssa Gehman, of the Hakai Institute in British Columbia, Canada, as part of a four-year international collaboration involving the University of British Columbia, the University of Washington and the Nature Conservancy, among other parties.

The decline of sunflower sea stars has ramifications for marine ecosystems beyond the loss of a single species. “Identifying the cause of SSWD is incredibly impactful,” Prentice said. “In the absence of sunflower stars, [kelp-eating] sea urchin populations increase, which means the loss of kelp forests, and that has broad implications for all the other marine species and humans that rely on them.”

Kelp forests provide a habitat for thousands of marine creatures, support local economies through fisheries and recreation, and are culturally important for First Nations and tribal communities. They also stabilise sediments, protect coastlines from storms, and are an important carbon sink for sequestering carbon dioxide.

Though the epidemic is still ongoing, the hope is that this breakthrough will aid recovery and treatment efforts for various sea star species across the world and the ecosystems affected by their decline. Methods being explored include captive breeding for resistant individuals and developing probiotic solutions that can be introduced to ecosystems.

“Now that we have found the causative agent of disease, it makes me hopeful that we might actually be able to do something for sunflower sea stars,” says Gehman. “We can be really targeted in how we work with them, and I think that's going to help us move a lot faster and to try to tackle SSWD.”

Russian drone and artillery strikes in Zaporizhzhia Oblast killed four people and injured three others on Aug. 4, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported early the next day.

"During the day, the occupiers carried out 431 strikes on 16 settlements in Zaporizhzhia Oblast," Fedorov said in a Telegram post.

Residential buildings, homes, commercial buildings, and warehouses were damaged in 21 reported instances.

305 drones were launched at Ukrainian-held territory in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, with another 110 artillery strikes targeting the region, Fedorov said.

Russia regularly strikes frontline regions as it continues to wage its war against Ukraine.

Much of southern Zaporizhzhia Oblast remains occupied as Russian forces continue attempts to push forward despite calls for a ceasefire.

Russian drone strikes in Ukraine's Kharkiv Oblast on Aug. 4 killed three civilians, the regional prosecutor's office reported.

As Russia continues to launch strikes on Ukrainian cities and shows no interest in ending its war, Ukraine's allies have intensified efforts to broker a ceasefire and supply Kyiv with military aid.

U.S. President Donald Trump has announced an Aug. 8 deadline for Russia to reach a ceasefire with Ukraine, following an initial 50-day period to reach an agreement.

If Russia fails to reach an agreement, Moscow will face secondary U.S. sanctions. The measures could impose tariffs on Moscow's trading partners, including Brazil, China, and India.

Ukraine and Russia have held three rounds of peace talks in recent months. The negotiations were largely inconclusive as the Kremlin continues to issue maximalist demands towards Ukraine.

Volodymyr Ivanyshyn is a news editor for The Kyiv Independent. He is pursuing an Honors Bachelor of Arts at the University of Toronto, majoring in political science with a minor in anthropology and human geography. Volodymyr holds a Certificate in Business Fundamentals from Rotman Commerce at the University of Toronto. He previously completed an internship with The Kyiv Independent.

The funding will be channeled through NATO's Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA), which enables fast-track purchases of U.S. arms to meet Ukraine's most urgent defense needs. 

President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine has already prepared a draft agreement on drones and is ready to finalize what he called "one of the strongest agreements this could be."



Gazprom, Russia's state-owned gas giant, has seen its exports to Europe hit lows not seen since the 1970s, according to the Moscow Times. 



"(Russian President Vladimir) Putin will stop killing people if you get (the price of) energy down another $10 a barrel. He's going to have no choice, because his economy stinks," U.S. President Donald Trump said. 

Putin is reluctant to provoke Trump and recognizes that pressing ahead with the war could jeopardize a potential thaw in relations with Washington and the West, but his military objectives remain the top priority, two sources told Reuters.

Ukraine has detected Indian-made components in Russian Shahed-type attack drones, Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak confirmed on Aug. 5, adding Moscow must be denied access to supplies that "enable the killing of Ukrainians."

Colonel Vasyl Myshanskyi is accused of signing government contracts with supplier companies at knowingly inflated prices.

Russian forces launched an Iskander-M ballistic missile from Russia's Bryansk Oblast and 46 Shahed-type drones from Kursk, Bryansk, Orel, and Primorsk-Akhtarsk against Ukraine overnight, according to Ukraine's Air Force.

A Chisinau court ruled that Evghenia Gutul was guilty of systematically bringing funds from Russia to Moldova for the now-banned pro-Russian Shor Party's needs between 2019 and 2022.

K-555 Knyaz Pozharsky is a Project 955A Borei–A–class vessel, a crucial component of the Kremlin's nuclear triad.

Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) special forces fought off a Russian attempt to advance in Sumy Oblast, "destroying more than eight Russian companies" during the battle, the agency said on Aug. 5

"The soldiers on this front are recording the participation of mercenaries from China, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, and African countries in the war. We will respond," President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a statement.

Five German Eurofighter Typhoon jets will help monitor NATO airspace and potential Russian activity along the eastern flank for the next few weeks, a German Air Force spokesperson told DPA news agency.

With the 2026 midterm season drawing nearer, Republicans are examining the possibility of using redistricting to give themselves an advantage at the polls—and Democrats have indicated they're ready to respond in kind.

Republicans hope that redistricting in red states like Texas, Florida, Ohio, and other states may expand their thin House majority during the next midterm election.

Paris has re-opened the River Seine for public swimming for the first time since 1923.

When it comes to traveling abroad, some people may be worried about their safety and want to keep their guard up.

In the "r/ParisTravelGuide" forum on Reddit, a traveler asked others for advice on pickpockets. 

"My family will be traveling to Paris next month," the person wrote. "It will be our first time visiting Europe, and we are very excited — but also a bit nervous."

The user added, "We tend to look quite innocent, and we're worried we might be easy targets for pickpockets. We won't have a tour guide and will be managing everything on our own."

Others on the platform took to the comments section to share advice and their own experiences.

"Just know they target tourists," wrote one person. "They only hang out in tourist areas and by your clothing it will be obvious you are not Parisian. They never bother me and I've never been robbed nor has a single person I know."

Another user shared, "In the last 2 years, I've stopped two pickpockets in the subway. In one case, they were reaching into someone's backpack and in the other for a phone in a loose back pocket. The strategy is to keep [your] items in places that are difficult to access."

Said a different person, "Stay alert in touristy areas, keep your bag in front of you on the Metro, and avoid engaging with strangers who approach you (anyone)."

One person wrote, "Be mindful. Carry bags that close, wear a cross-body bag, keep all zippers closed, don't flash cash or jewelry. And if a stranger approaches you to hold something or offers to take your photo, walk away."

Said yet another person, "I'm staggered how many tourists I see on the Metro with a backpack on. Makes it so easy for pickpockets to steal from them."

A Redditor wrote, "The [number] of people I watched on their phones by the doors of the trains was staggering and does present an opportunistic grab-and-run scenario. Don't do that."

Each year some 2,000 Americans report their passports stolen or lost in Paris, according to the U.S. Embassy in France. 

The Embassy and Consulate in France have a whole page dedicated to "Pickpockets in Paris."

Travelers are advised not to bring along more than $50 to $60 in cash.

Says the site, "The first rule of thumb is don't have anything more in your wallet than you are willing to lose."

The embassy also advises bringing only one credit card or ATM card along and only one piece of identification.

Travelers are also advised not to bring along more than $50 to $60 in cash.

Tourist spots such as the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame and the Champs-Elysées are areas where visitors are most likely to be pickpocketed, according to the embassy.

"Americans in Paris should be particularly alert to thieves who commonly work near tourist attractions such as museums, monuments, restaurants, hotels, beaches, trains, train stations, airports, subways and target vehicles with non-local license plates," the embassy cautions. 

The embassy also discusses the different tactics pickpocketers use, whether on the street or on public transportation.

"Two or more people will approach you and ask for directions."

If riding the Metro, the embassy says that "the most popular is the crush-and-grab. You will be swarmed by several people all trying to get on or off."

"While they are pushing you, they are also picking your pockets," notes the advisory.

"Another trick is to grab the purse of someone sitting right by the door and to hop off just as the doors are closing."

Pickpocketers most frequently use a distraction technique on the streets. 

"Two or more people will approach you and ask for directions, try to sell you stuff or just crowd you. While you are occupied with one person, another is picking your pocket," the embassy says.

CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — Rwanda has become the third African nation to enter into a deal with the Trump administration to accept migrants deported by the United States.

The Rwandan government said Tuesday it has agreed to accept up to 250 deportees from the U.S. for resettlement but didn't immediately give any more details, including when they would arrive or what Rwanda got, if anything, out of the deal.

The U.S. has already deported eight men it said were dangerous criminals who were in the U.S. illegally to South Sudan and another five to Eswatini.

Here's what we know, and still don't know, about U.S. President Donald Trump's expanding third-country deportation program in Africa and the largely secretive deals the U.S. is striking. 

The U.S. State Department and the Department of Homeland Security haven't responded to requests seeking more details on the deals in Africa.

The U.S. sent eight men from South Sudan, Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar and Vietnam to South Sudan in East Africa in early July after their deportations were held up by a legal challenge. That led to them being kept for weeks in a converted shipping container at an American military base in nearby Djibouti.

U.S. officials said the men had been convicted of violent crimes in the U.S.

When it took custody of them a month ago, the South Sudan government said it would ensure their “safety and wellbeing” but has declined to give other details, including where the men are being held and what their fate might be.

South Sudan has been wracked by conflict since it gained independence from Sudan in 2011 and is teetering on the edge of civil war again.

Two weeks after the South Sudan deportations, the U.S. announced that it had sent another five men — citizens of Vietnam, Jamaica, Cuba, Yemen and Laos — to the small kingdom of Eswatini in southern Africa.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said they were also violent criminals whose home countries had refused to take them back.

Eswatini's government said the men would be held in solitary confinement until their repatriation, and later said that might take up to a year. A human rights lawyer in Eswatini has taken authorities to court alleging the men are being denied legal representation while being held in a maximum-security prison, and questioning the legality of detaining them indefinitely when they have served their criminal sentences in the U.S.

U.S. authorities didn't name the men or say if they had been deported straight from prison or detained in another way.

Eswatini, which borders South Africa, is one of the world's last absolute monarchies. King Mswati III has ruled since he turned 18 in 1986. Authorities under him are accused of violently subduing pro-democracy movements in a country where political parties are effectively banned.

Rwanda's deal with the U.S. comes after a contentious migrant agreement it reached with the U.K. in 2022 collapsed and was ruled unlawful by Britain's Supreme Court. That deal was meant to see people seeking asylum in the U.K. sent to Rwanda, where they would stay if their asylum applications were approved.

The failed deal ultimately cost the U.K. nearly a billion dollars in public money, including around $300 million that it gave to Rwanda and didn't get back.

Rwanda said that the deportees it will take from the U.S. will be resettled there and given work training, healthcare and help with accommodation.

Analysts say that African nations might be seeking a range of benefits from the Trump administration in return for taking deportees, including more favorable tariff rates, aid and other financial assistance, and even the easing of sanctions against some of their officials.

Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick discusses lawmakers fleeing the state to delay a GOP redistricting vote on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

The Supreme Court on Friday ordered additional arguments in a major case centered on whether race can factor into drawing congressional maps, a clear sign that redistricting remains top-of-mind for the justices ahead of the 2026 midterms.

Justices ordered both parties in Louisiana v. Callais to return for additional arguments next term. At issue is whether Louisiana's latest congressional map — which includes the creation of a second, majority-Black district — should be considered an unconstitutional "illegal racial gerrymander." 

The Supreme Court order comes months after justices first heard oral arguments in the case in March. It requires both parties to file supplemental briefs by mid-September, outlining in further detail their view of whether Louisiana's intentional creation of a second majority-minority congressional district "violates the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments to the U. S. Constitution." 

Reply briefs should be filed no later than Oct. 3, the Supreme Court said in the unsigned, single-page order — just three days before the high court gavels in for the 2025-2026 session.

The order comes after the Supreme Court in June said they would not decide the case this term as had been expected — punting it to the fall for further consideration. At the time, the justices said they needed more information before ruling on the case.

The issue underscores the challenges states face with congressional redistricting. 

Louisiana has revised its congressional map twice since the 2020 census. The first version, which included only one majority-Black district, was blocked by a federal court in 2022. The court sided with the Louisiana State Conference of the NAACP and other plaintiffs, ruling the map diluted Black voting power and ordering the state to redraw it by January 2024.

The new map, S.B. 8, created the second Black-majority district at the center of the Supreme Court case. However, S.B. 8 was almost immediately challenged by a group of non-Black plaintiffs in court, who took issue with a new district that stretched some 250 miles from Louisiana's northwest corner of Shreveport to Baton Rouge, in the state's southeast. 

They argued in the lawsuit that the state violated the equal protection clause by relying too heavily on race to draw the maps, and created a "sinuous and jagged second majority-Black district."

That map remains in place for now, until the Supreme Court can hear the additional information submitted to the court this fall.  

Oral arguments in March focused heavily on whether Louisiana's redistricting efforts were narrowly tailored enough to meet constitutional requirements and whether race was used in a way that violated the law, as appellees had alleged.

The high court's request for additional information comes at a pivotal time for the U.S., as new and politically charged redistricting fights have popped up in other U.S. states ahead of next year's midterm elections. 

In Texas, tensions reached a fever pitch this week after Democratic state legislators fled the Lone Star State to block Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's ability to convene a legislative quorum needed to pass the state's aggressive new redistricting map, which would create five additional Republican-leaning districts. 

Under the state's constitution, two-thirds of the House legislators must be present for the body to conduct business. With an eye to this rule, Democratic lawmakers fled the state to Chicago, New York and Boston — beyond the reach of Texas authorities and of Abbott, who has little power in the near-term to compel their returns.

The governor has, however, threatened to take them to court to have them removed from office altogether.

In a press conference Monday, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul stressed the magnitude of the redistricting efforts, and vowed to explore "every option" in redrawing state lines.

"We are at war," Hochul said, speaking alongside the six Texas Democrats who fled to her state.

 "And that's why the gloves are off — and I say, bring it on," she added.

The move is part of a broader redistricting push aimed at helping Republicans defend their slim House majority. As with most midterms following a new president's election, 2026 is expected to serve as a referendum on the White House — raising GOP concerns that they could lose control of the chamber.

The House Oversight Committee has subpoenaed the Justice Department for files in the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking investigation and is seeking depositions with the Clintons and former law enforcement officials.

The House Oversight Committee subpoenaed the Department of Justice on Tuesday for files in the sex trafficking investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. It's part of a congressional probe that lawmakers believe may show links to President Donald Trump and other former top officials.

The Republican-controlled committee also issued subpoenas for depositions with former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and eight former top law enforcement officials.

The committee's actions showed how even with lawmakers away from Washington on a monthlong break, interest in the Epstein files is still running high. Trump has repeatedly tried to move past the Justice Department's decision not to release a full accounting of the investigation, but lawmakers from both parties, as well as many in the president's political base, have refused to let it go.

Other news we're following today:








Much of the information “was made publicly available at trial or has otherwise been publicly reported through the public statements of victims and witnesses,” prosecutors wrote in court papers Monday. They noted that the disclosures excluded some victims' and witnesses' names.

The filing aimed to support the DOJ's request to release the usually secret grand jury records amid a public clamor for more transparency about the investigation into Epstein, six years after the financier died in prison.

Prosecutors also said last week that some of what the grand jurors heard, the public eventually did too, referring to Maxwell's 2021 trial and various victims' lawsuits. There were only two grand jury witnesses, both of them law enforcement officials, prosecutors said.

DOJ attorneys made clear Monday that they're seeking to unseal only the transcripts of grand jury witnesses' testimony, not the exhibits that accompanied it.

The White House says Trump later Tuesday is signing an executive order establishing a task force for the Los Angeles games in three years.

Trump has said the Los Angeles Olympics are among the events he's most looking forward to in his second term.

The 2028 Games will be the first Olympics to be hosted by the U.S. since the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City, Utah.

The administration is calling to remove abortion coverage from the list of medical benefits for veterans and their families, saying it's not needed.

The Department of Veterans Affairs posted the proposed rule change Monday and opened a public comment period on it that runs through Sept. 3. The department said in its proposal that it wants to ensure it “provides only needed medical services to our nation's heroes and their families.”

The department says it would still provide abortion in life-threatening circumstances — something state laws allow, even in places where bans are in place. But critics of the change note abortion wouldn't be provided when pregnancies are the result of rape or incest.

Amy Friedrich-Karnik, director of federal policy at the Guttmacher Institute, said in a statement that the change would cut off millions of veterans and their families from services.

National Democrats are closing ranks behind Texas state lawmakers who've left the state to prevent, at least for now, Republicans from satisfying President Trump's wishes for a gerrymandered congressional map that would help Republicans in the 2026 midterms.

Standing with Texas legislators gathered in Illinois, Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin promised Tuesday that the party is “bringing a knife to a knife fight” rather than stand by. He warned that the GOP plan in Texas is “a test case for the rest of the country” and a “model for other red states to lie, cheat and steal away to victory.”

California officials are considering their own effort to further tilt their U.S. House delegation to Democrats to counter Texas.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said Tuesday that Trump's push in Texas is “not democracy — that's not America.” He mocked Texas leaders for doing Trump's bidding. “When Donald Trump calls, they say, ‘Yes, sir, right away,'” Pritzker said of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton, who's running for the Senate in 2026.

After making observations from the White House roof, Trump walked over to an area above the briefing room, briefly interacting with reporters gathered below.

Asked why he was on the roof, Trump said he was “taking a little walk” and mentioned the “ballroom on the other side.”

Last month, the White House announced that construction on a massive, new $200 million ballroom — the first structural change to the Executive Mansion itself since the addition of the Truman balcony in 1948 — would begin in September. One of the five men with him appeared to be James McCrery, architect for the project.

“Just another way to spend my money for this country,” Trump said. “Anything I do is financed by me.”

He appeared to be taking stock of several areas including the roof of the press briefing room and the Rose Garden.

Wearing a suit with a red tie, Trump walked the area Tuesday with several other people, as someone with them took photographs.

Trump may have been surveying ongoing renovation and construction work at the White House. He returned to the presidency with grand ideas for remaking the building, like paving over the Rose Garden and building a massive ballroom.

It comes days before the U.S. deadline for Russia to stop the killing in its 3-year-old invasion of Ukraine.

Zelenskyy said the two leaders discussed the possible severe sanctions on Russia that Trump has threatened to announce Friday.

Such a move “can change a lot” in the war, Zelenskyy said on social media.

Ukraine and the U.S. are also working on an agreement for bilateral drone production, he said, adding his thanks for Trump's efforts to end the war.

The White House did not immediately return a message seeking information on the call.

The second-term Nebraska Republican, who represents the GOP-leaning district that includes the University of Nebraska, braved the ire of a college town audience Monday to discuss his support of President Trump's “Big Beautiful Bill.”

For their part, most in the crowd joined in a 90-minute barrage of jeers and chants, in a scenario House Republican leaders have specifically advised GOP members to avoid.

Rep. Mike Flood, a Nebraska Republican, faced a heated Town Hall on Monday where hundreds booed him for supporting the GOP-backed tax-break and spending bill President Trump signed last month.

A favorite? “Tax the rich! Tax the rich!”

Flood called the bill less than perfect, but stood specifically firm on its Medicaid changes.

“More than anything, I truly believe this bill protects Medicaid for the future,” Flood said, setting off a shower of boos from the audience of roughly 700 in the University of Nebraska's Kimball Recital Hall. “We protected Medicaid.”

Although the House Oversight Committee is controlled by Republicans, it was Democrats who sparked the move to subpoena the Justice Department for its files on Epstein. They were joined by some Republicans to successfully initiate the subpoena through a subcommittee of the House Oversight Committee.

“Democrats are focused on transparency and are pushing back against the corruption of Donald Trump,” Rep. Robert Garcia, who's the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, told reporters last month. “What is Donald Trump hiding that he won't release the Epstein files?”

Major reproductive rights groups announced Tuesday that they'd filed requests to probe the Trump administration's communications about medication abortion and emergency abortion care.

Democracy Forward and Reproductive Freedom For All filed a host of Freedom of Information Act requests for records from the FDA and U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services about key political appointees, including FDA Commissioner Marty Makary and CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz.

Makary has expressed openness to re-examining access to the major abortion pill mifepristone, most recently telling PBS “we can't promise we're not going to act on that data that we have not yet seen.” This is despite decades of evidence showing the drug is both safe and effective.

The move by abortion rights groups also comes after the Trump administration in June announced it would revoke a guidance directing hospitals to provide emergency abortions for women when they're necessary to stabilize their medical condition.

“The public has a right to know how and why the Trump-Vance administration is targeting vital health care and reproductive access,” Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, said in a statement.

When the coronavirus surged during Trump's first term, he called for a simple fix: Limit the amount of testing so the deadly outbreak looked less severe. When he lost the 2020 election, he had a ready-made reason: The vote count was fraudulent.

And on Friday, when the July jobs report revisions showed a distressed economy, Trump had an answer: He fired the official in charge of the data and called the report of a sharp slowdown in hiring “phony.”

Trump has a go-to playbook if the numbers reveal uncomfortable realities, and that's to discredit or conceal the figures and to attack the messenger — all of which can hurt the president's efforts to convince the world that America is getting stronger.

“Our democratic system and the strength of our private economy depend on the honest flow of information about our economy, our government and our society,” said Douglas Elmendorf, a Harvard University professor who was formerly director of the Congressional Budget Office. “The Trump administration is trying to suppress honest analysis.”

President Trump defended Texas Republicans' decision to redraw the state's congressional map mid-decade, pointing to Democratic-led states where he says Republicans are underrepresented.

“They did it to us,” Trump said in a TV interview Tuesday.

But in many of the states Trump referenced — including California — partisan lawmakers are not in charge of drawing district lines.

During the same interview, Trump also lashed out at Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who welcomed Texas Democrats to his state after they left to block a vote on the new map. Trump called Pritzker “probably the dumbest of all governors.”

Touting his 2024 win and “the best poll numbers,” Trump told CNBC that “I'd like to run again.”

But asked by the hosts if he will, Trump replied, “Probably not.”

The back-and-forth came as Trump heralded his 2024 win in Texas, a record he said “they say won't be beaten unless I run again.”

Trump said on CNBC that higher tariffs could be coming for India.

Last week, Trump said the U.S. said it would impose a 25% tariff on goods from India, plus an additional import tax because of India's purchasing of Russian oil.

“I think I'm going to raise that very substantially over the next 24 hours because they're buying Russian oil, they're fueling the war machine,” Trump said Tuesday. “And if they're going to do that, then I'm not going to be happy.”

The 25% tariffs were part of a flurry of trade activity that included a series of executive actions regarding Brazil, copper and shipments of goods worth less than $800, as well as a reduced 15% tax on imports from South Korea, including its autos.

The U.S. president said imported pharmaceutical drugs could eventually face tariffs as high as 200%.

“We want pharmaceuticals made in our country,” Trump said in the CNBC interview.

Trump said tariffs on pharmaceuticals will be “initially small,” but that he would hike it to 150% or 200% over the subsequent year and a half.

The president also said he would announce tariffs on semiconductors and computer chips.

Trump told CNBC hosts that 35% tariffs will kick in with the European Union if they don't make good on promised investments in U.S. goods.

The president was asked what “teeth” were in deals to force European officials to make good on their pledges.

Trump initially said the EU was paying $650 billion but then rounded the figure down to $600 billion.

“We're a rich country again,” Trump said, adding that the $600 billion investment can go in “anything I want.”

The president said he was considering four people for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's replacement.

Among the top on his list are his current economics director, Kevin Hassett, and former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.

“I think Kevin and Kevin, both Kevins are very good,” Trump said during an interview on CNBC Tuesday morning.

He said two other people were in consideration. Not one of them: current Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has indicated to Trump that he wants to stay where he is.

“It'll be one of four people,” he said. “We're going to make a decision soon.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is establishing a task force on the 2028 Olympic Games being held in Los Angeles.

Trump will sign an executive order on Tuesday to make the task force official, the White House said.

The 2028 Games will be the first Olympics to be hosted by the U.S. since the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City, Utah. 

Trump “considers it a great honor to oversee this global sporting spectacle,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement, calling sports one of the president's “greatest passions.”

LA28 president and chair Casey Wasserman said the task force “marks an important step forward in our planning efforts and reflects our shared commitment to delivering not just the biggest, but the greatest Games the world has ever seen in the summer of 2028.”

During a briefing Tuesday afternoon, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said the task force would “coordinate across federal, state and local agencies to ensure streamlined visa processes, robust security and efficient transportation.”

Along with the 2028 Summer Games, Trump has said that the 2026 FIFA World Cup being hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico is among the events he's most looking forward to in his second term. 

In preparation for next year's competition, the governments of all three countries on Tuesday said they had held the first meeting of a trilateral coordinating council of government officials, industry leaders and security professionals discussing a variety of issues including preparedness for any security threats ahead of the World Cup.

Former President Bill Clinton, former first lady Hillary Clinton, and the Justice Department have been subpoenaed by the House Oversight Committee to further an investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) issued subpoenas Tuesday to the former president and first lady, along with a slew of others that could have connections to Epstein, as the issue plagues the Trump administration.

Comer subpoenaed the DOJ for the Epstein files as the issue has continued heating up over the last several weeks, with a deadline of Aug. 19.

Along with the Clintons, the committee also subpoenaed eight others for depositions from August through October, including former FBI Directors James Comey and Robert Mueller, former Attorneys General Merrick Garland, Bill Barr, Jeff Sessions, Alberto Gonzales, Loretta Lynch, and Eric Holder.

🚨BREAKING🚨The House Oversight Committee is compelling the following individuals to appear for depositions through issued subpoenas: Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton: October 9Former President Bill Clinton: October 14Former U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland:…

Last month, as the Epstein drama began to heat up, the Wall Street Journal reported that President Donald Trump's name was on a 2003 birthday card to Epstein that included a suggestive drawing, the president denied any relation to the birthday card. They later reported that Clinton was also among the group who wrote a note to Epstein.

“It's reassuring isn't it, to have lasted as long, across all the years of learning and knowing, adventures and [illegible word], and also to have your childlike curiosity, the drive to make a difference and the solace of friends,” Clinton's note wrote, according to the Wall Street Journal. 

The Washington Examiner reached out to a Clinton representative for comment. 

Epstein's pilot, who testified in Maxwell's trial, listed both Trump and Clinton on the list of those who flew on his private plane, adding that he would be given a notice if high-profile individuals were flying. 

Clinton's spokesperson then admitted to the former president being aboard the plane, but claimed he knew nothing about the crimes being committed.

“In 2002 and 2003, President Clinton took a total of four trips on Jeffrey Epstein's airplane: one to Europe, one to Asia, and two to Africa, which included stops in connection with the work of the Clinton Foundation,” Clinton spokesman Angel Urena told CNN in 2019.

As part of Trump's tactics to divert attention away from his involvement with Epstein, he claimed he turned down an offer to visit the island, while calling out other people the press should focus on, Clinton in particular. 

“I never went to the island, and Bill Clinton went there supposedly 28 times. I never went to the island, but Larry Summers, I hear, went there, he was the head of Harvard. And many other people that are very big people, nobody ever talks about them,” Trump said in Scotland as he sat with the U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

A 2002 photo surfaced — just about a year after the former president left office — of him receiving a massage from an Epstein accuser getting off a long flight to Africa, on the sex offender's plane. Clinton received the massage from then 22-year-old Chauntae Davies, who served as Epstein's personal masseuse.

Davies told the Daily Mail of the interaction, “Although the image looks bizarre, President Clinton was a perfect gentleman during the trip, and I saw absolutely no foul play involving him.” She has come forward as a victim of Epstein's, saying she was repeatedly raped.

The Clinton subpoenas are part of three motions that have passed the House Oversight Committee in efforts to unveil more information in relation to the Epstein files following the uproar after the Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigations releasing a two-page memo earlier this month stating there is no evidence Epstein blackmailed people or kept a “client list,” reiterating he died by suicide, a conclusion that has resulted in mounting backlash from Trump's MAGA base.

The Oversight Committee has also issued a subpoena for Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's former girlfriend and convicted sex offender in his trafficking scheme. Maxwell already met with a senior Department of Justice official in July while in prison. However, her congressional deposition that was initially scheduled for Aug. 11 has been delayed as her petition to appeal her criminal conviction is to be considered by the Supreme Court on Sept. 29.

HOUSE MEMBERS FACE EPSTEIN HEAT AS THEY RETURN HOME FOR AUGUST RECESS

The third successful bipartisan effort included Rep. Summer Lee's (D-PA) motion to subpoena the Epstein records from the Justice Department. Three Republicans voted with the Pennsylvania Democrat, including Rep. Scott Perry (R-PA), who successfully pushed for a vote to subpoena the former attorneys general and other government officials.

On top of House Oversight's subpoenas, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) announced the Epstein Files Transparency Act with Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) to force a vote on the complete release of government files related to Epstein. Eleven Republicans have cosponsored the legislation as of Tuesday, as Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) has dodged voting on the legislation.

NEW YORK (AP) — Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Richard Russo i s the latest author to be welcomed into the inner circle of Oprah Winfrey book club picks. 

Winfrey announced Tuesday that she had selected Russo's “Bridge of Sighs,” a 2007 novel centered in a rural New York community. Russo has set much of his work in small, Northeastern towns, including “Nobody's Fool,” later adapted into a movie of the same name that starred Paul Newman; and “Empire Falls,” winner of the Pulitzer in 2002 and the basis for an Emmy-winning HBO series that featured Newman and his wife, Joanne Woodward. 

Winfrey often chooses new books for her club, but has at times looked to older releases, from Toni Morrison's “The Bluest Eye” to John Steinbeck's “East of Eden.”

“It is, of course, a profound honor to be chosen for Oprah's Book Club,” Russo said in a statement. “But to be chosen for a novel written two decades earlier? A book that will introduce a whole new generation of readers to my work? How special is that?”

A conversation between Winfrey and Russo, held recently at a Starbucks in Seattle, can be seen on Winfrey's YouTube channel and on other outlets where podcasts are aired. Starbucks is the current partner for Winfrey's book club, which she founded in 1996.

On Tuesday, Winfrey issued a statement praising “Bridge of Sighs” as a “classic summer read,” with “romance, unrequited love, life-long friendships, and of course — epic family drama.” 

“If you're a fan of Richard Russo or discovering him for the first time, here's your opportunity to read one of America's most beloved writers,” she added.

Why this obscure survey has life-or-death stakes, and what its future could look like.

When President Donald Trump and Elon Musk fed the US Agency for International Development into the wood chipper earlier this year, one of the lesser-known casualties was the shutdown of an obscure but crucial program that tracked public health information on about half of the world's nations.

For nearly 40 years, the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program has served as the world's health report card. In that time, it has carried out over 400 nationally representative surveys in more than 90 countries, capturing a wide range of vital signs such as maternal and child health, nutrition, education levels, access to water and sanitation, and the prevalence of diseases like HIV and malaria.

Taken together, it offered perhaps the clearest picture ever compiled of global health.

And that clarity came from how rigorous these surveys were. Each one started with a globally vetted blueprint of questions, used by hundreds of trained local surveyors who went door-to-door, conducting face-to-face interviews in people's homes. The final, anonymized data was then processed by a single contractor ICF International, a private consulting firm based in Reston, Virginia, which made the results standardized and comparable across countries and over time. Its data powered global estimates from institutions like the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which in turn shaped public health policy, research, and funding decisions around the world. “If DHS didn't exist, comparing anemia across countries would be a PhD thesis,” said Doug Johnson, a senior statistician at the nonprofit IDinsight.

Crucially, DHS also tracked things few other systems touched, like gender-based violence, women's autonomy, and attitudes toward domestic abuse. Doctor's offices aren't representative and only capture folks who can access a formal health care system. Also, since DHS data is anonymized, unlike a police report, responders don't have to fear intervention if they don't want it. “You can't get answers from other sources to sensitive questions like the ones DHS posed,” said Haoyi Chen from the UN Statistics Division, pointing to one example: Is a husband justified in beating his wife if she burns the food?

Then, earlier this year, DHS was shut down.

The decision came as part of the Rescissions Act of 2025, a bill passed in June that clawed back $9.4 billion from foreign aid and other programs. Eliminating DHS saved the government some $47 million a year — only about 0.1 percent of the total US aid budget, or half the cost of a single F-35 fighter jet.

Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

That tiny budget cut has had immediate consequences. The move halted around 24 in-progress country surveys – 10 of which were just short of final publication, and three in Ethiopia, Guinea, and Uganda that were stopped mid-fieldwork. The program's public-facing website remains up, but the machinery behind it is gone. With no one to approve new applications, the process for researchers to access the underlying microdata has ground to a halt.

The shutdown isn't just about numbers on a spreadsheet. Here's how DHS data has shaped policy and saved lives across the globe.

There will also be long-term damage. When governments or aid organizations can no longer see exactly where children are malnourished, where malaria outbreaks are quietly spreading, or where mothers are dying in childbirth, they can't effectively target life-saving interventions, leaving the most vulnerable populations to pay the price. For 24 countries, including the Democratic Republic of Congo and Mali, the DHS was the sole data source for the UN's official maternal mortality estimates. Going forward, “it would just be basically estimates that are based on other countries' data,” says Saloni Dattani, a editor on science and global health at Works in Progress magazine and 2022 Future Perfect 50 honoree. “We just wouldn't know.”

Without the data DHS provided, foreign aid becomes less effective, and less accountable “We have no way of externally or objectively estimating the positive impact that those [aid] programs are having, or negative,” said Livia Montana, the former deputy director of the DHS Program, who is now a survey director for the Understanding America Study at the University of Southern California.

Naturally, the global health community has been scrambling to plug the enormous gap. The Gates Foundation recently committed $25 million in emergency funding to rescue some ongoing surveys, and Bloomberg Philanthropies has also stepped in with a separate commitment to support the effort.

This funding is a crucial lifeline, but only a stopgap. The search for a long-term fix has forced a reckoning with the old programs' flaws. Everyone agrees that DHS delivered high-quality, trusted data — but it wasn't perfect. Many experts have criticized it as fundamentally “donor-driven,” with priorities that didn't always align with the national interests of the countries it surveyed. For instance, the program's historic focus on reproductive health was a direct reflection of the priorities of its primary funder, USAID, and some country officials privately felt the data served the accountability needs of international organizations better than their own immediate planning needs.

This has created a central dilemma for the global development community: is it possible to build a new system that is both genuinely country-led and also globally comparable?

Faced with this data vacuum, an obvious question arises: Why can't other global organizations like the World Health Organization or the United Nations simply step in and take over?

It's not out of the question, but it would be really, really difficult. Think of it this way: The DHS Program was like a single, powerful architecture firm that perfected a blueprint and built houses in 90 neighborhoods for 40 years. Because it was a single program managed by private contractor, ICF International, and backed by one major funder, USAID, it could enforce a standardized methodology everywhere it worked. As a for-profit firm, ICF's interest was also financial, it managed the global contract and profited from the work.

The UN and WHO, by contrast, act as the global city planners: Their mandate isn't to design and build the houses themselves, but to set the building codes and safety standards for everyone. According to WHO, its role is not to “directly fund population-based surveys,” but to provide leadership and bring the right stakeholders together.

While that mandate may prevent the UN from simply inheriting the old program's work, it makes it an ideal coordinator for the path forward, says Caren Grown, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution's Center for Sustainable Development. Grown argues that the UN is the only body that can handle the “heavy lift” of coordinating all the different countries, donors, and organizations.

And now that the DHS has been dissolved, both Grown and Chen are now part of a UN task force attempting to establish new internationally agreed-upon standards for how health data should be collected and governed.

At the same time, other efforts are more focused on the practical work of implementation rather than on global governance. Montana is leading a coalition to “rebuild elements of DHS” by creating a global consortium of research institutions that can provide technical support to countries. These efforts were catalyzed by initial conversations hosted by organizations like the Population Reference Bureau, which brought together donors, government agencies, and global data users to grapple with the shutdown's immediate aftermath.

Critics argue that for every India, there are a dozen other nations where the program's sudden collapse is proof that a deep, sustainable capacity was never built.

Between this mishmash, the most practical development has been a lifeline from the Gates Foundation, which announced a $25 million investment in “bridge funding.” Separately, in a statement to Vox, Bloomberg Philanthropies confirmed its commitment to fund the completion of an additional 12-country surveys over the next eight months. A source from the Gates Foundation clarified that Bloomberg's commitment is on top of theirs, confirming the two are distinct but coordinated rescue efforts.

The Gates Foundation framed its effort as a temporary, stabilizing measure designed to give the global health community a much-needed respite. “We believe data is — and must remain — a global public good,” said Janet Zhou, a director focused on data and gender equality at the Gates Foundation. “Our interim support is helping to stabilize 14 ongoing country surveys. … This investment is designed to give global partners and national governments the time and space needed to build a more sustainable, country-led model for health data.”

That support is aimed at the most urgent work: finishing surveys that were nearly complete, like in Ethiopia, and reopening the four-decade-old data archive. But rather than giving each respective country the money to complete their ongoing surveys, the Gates funding will be administered by ICF International, the same for-profit firm that ran the original DHS.

The decision to work with the existing contractor, ICF International, was a pragmatic one. Continuing with the same implementer was the “quickest, most affordable way” to prevent waste, and “multiple host countries have shared a preference” to complete their work with the firm, said a source at the Gates Foundation.

It's a powerful argument for triage in an emergency, but it also papers over deeper flaws. Take a look at Nigeria, for example: Fieldwork for its 2023–'24 DHS finished in May 2024, and the questionnaires gathered new estimates of maternal and child deaths. Nigeria also ran a separate study to probe exactly why mothers and children are dying. In principle, the two datasets should dovetail but beyond a headline-numbers report, the full DHS micro-dataset is still in ICF's processing queue — likely frozen after DHS's shuttering.

That bottleneck illustrates what critics mean by “donor-driven.” With barely 3 percent of household surveys in low-income countries fully-financed by the local government, the WHO notes, most nations must rely on “externally led surveys…limiting continuity and national ownership.” When the donor funding stops, so does the data pipeline.

An ICF spokesperson pushed back saying survey priorities were “primarily shaped by the participating countries.” Yet, of the $25 million that arrived from Gates, a large portion of it will go toward completing large-scale surveys in Nigeria and Kenya, two countries that also happen to be key “geographies of interest” for the Gates Foundation's own strategic priorities, underscoring how funders still steer the spotlight.

Insiders I spoke with described ICF's system as a “black box,” with key parts of its methodology controlled by the contractor, leaving countries without the capacity to stand on their own. That matters because without home-grown statisticians and know-how, ministries can't rerun surveys or update indicators without outside help. In response, ICF stated that the program has a “proven track record of building a long-term capacity,” noting that countries like India no longer require its assistance.

But critics argue that for every India, there are a dozen other nations where the program's sudden collapse is proof that a deep, sustainable capacity was never built. This dependency creates a fragile system that can, as just happened, collapse overnight, leaving countries unable to continue that work on their own.

This unresolved tension brings the debate back to a central question from the UN's Chen. “DHS has been there for four decades,” she asks, “and why are we still having this program doing the survey for countries?”

Chen's question gets to the heart of the debate. But grappling with the flaws of the past can't get in the way of surviving the present. Existing global health data is already several years out of date due to the pandemic, while crises in maternal mortality and child nutrition continue to unfold. The need is for reliable data now, because the fundamental reality remains: You can't help people you can't see.

TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — YouTube videos that won't load. A visit to a popular independent media website that produces only a blank page. Cellphone internet connections that are down for hours or days.

Going online in Russia can be frustrating, complicated and even dangerous.

It's not a network glitch but a deliberate, multipronged and long-term effort by authorities to bring the internet under the Kremlin's full control. Authorities adopted restrictive laws and banned websites and platforms that won't comply. Technology has been perfected to monitor and manipulate online traffic.

While it's still possible to circumvent restrictions by using virtual private network apps, those are routinely blocked, too. 

Authorities further restricted internet access this summer with widespread shutdowns of cellphone internet connections and adopting a law punishing users for searching for content they deem illicit.

They also are threatening to go after the popular WhatsApp platform while rolling out a new “national” messaging app that's widely expected to be heavily monitored.

President Vladimir Putin urged the government to “stifle” foreign internet services and ordered officials to assemble a list of platforms from “unfriendly” states that should be restricted.

Experts and rights advocates told The Associated Press that the scale and effectiveness of the restrictions are alarming. Authorities seem more adept at it now, compared with previous, largely futile efforts to restrict online activities, and they're edging closer to isolating the internet in Russia.




Human Rights Watch researcher Anastasiia Kruope describes Moscow's approach to reining in the internet as “death by a thousand cuts.” 

“Bit by bit, you're trying to come to a point where everything is controlled.”





Kremlin efforts to control what Russians do, read or say online dates to 2011-12, when the internet was used to challenge authority. Independent media outlets bloomed, and anti-government demonstrations that were coordinated online erupted after disputed parliamentary elections and Putin's decision to run again for president.

Russia began adopting regulations tightening internet controls. Some blocked websites; others required providers to store call records and messages, sharing it with security services if needed, and install equipment allowing authorities to control and cut off traffic.

Companies like Google or Facebook were pressured to store user data on Russian servers, to no avail, and plans were announced for a “sovereign internet” that could be cut off from the rest of the world. 

Russia's popular Facebook-like social media platform VK, founded by Pavel Durov long before he launched the Telegram messaging app, came under the control of Kremlin-friendly companies. Russia tried to block Telegram between 2018-20 but failed.

Prosecutions for social media posts and comments became common, showing that authorities were closely watching the online space. 

Still, experts had dismissed Kremlin efforts to rein in the internet as futile, arguing Russia was far from building something akin to China's “Great Firewall,” which Beijing uses to block foreign websites. 





After Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the government blocked major social media like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, as well as Signal and a few other messaging apps. VPNs also were targeted, making it harder to reach restricted websites. 

YouTube access was disrupted last summer in what experts called deliberate throttling by authorities. The Kremlin blamed YouTube owner Google for not maintaining its hardware in Russia. The platform has been wildly popular in Russia, both for entertainment and for voices critical of the Kremlin, like the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny. 

Cloudflare, an internet infrastructure provider, said in June that websites using its services were being throttled in Russia. Independent news site Mediazona reported that several other popular Western hosting providers also are being inhibited.

Cyber lawyer Sarkis Darbinyan, founder of Russian internet freedom group Roskomsvoboda, said authorities have been trying to push businesses to migrate to Russian hosting providers that can be controlled. 

He estimates about half of all Russian websites are powered by foreign hosting and infrastructure providers, many offering better quality and price than domestic equivalents. A “huge number” of global websites and platforms use those providers, he said, so cutting them off means those websites “automatically become inaccessible” in Russia too.

Another concerning trend is the consolidation of Russia's internet providers and companies that manage IP addresses, according to a July 30 Human Rights Watch report.

Last year, authorities raised the cost of obtaining an internet provider license from 7,500 rubles (about $90) to 1 million rubles (over $12,300), and state data shows that more than half of all IP addresses in Russia are managed by seven large companies, with Rostelecom, Russia's state telephone and internet giant, accounting for 25%.

The Kremlin is striving “to control the internet space in Russia, and to censor things, to manipulate the traffic,” said HRW's Kruope.





A new Russian law criminalized online searches for broadly defined “extremist” materials. That could include LGBTQ+ content, opposition groups, some songs by performers critical of the Kremlin — and Navalny's memoir, which was designated as extremist last week. 

Right advocates say it's a step toward punishing consumers — not just providers — like in Belarus, where people are routinely fined or jailed for reading or following certain independent media outlets. 

Stanislav Seleznev, cyber security expert and lawyer with the Net Freedom rights group, doesn't expect ubiquitous prosecutions, since tracking individual online searches in a country of 146 million remains a tall order. But even a limited number of cases could scare many from restricted content, he said.

Another major step could be blocking WhatsApp, which monitoring service Mediascope said had over 97 million monthly users in April.

WhatsApp “should prepare to leave the Russian market,” said lawmaker Anton Gorelkin, and a new “national” messenger, MAX, developed by social media company VK, would take its place. Telegram probably won't be restricted, he said.

MAX, promoted as a one-stop shop for messaging, online government services, making payments and more, was rolled out for beta tests but has yet to attract a wide following. Over 2 million people registered by July, the Tass news agency reported. 

Its terms and conditions say it will share user data with authorities upon request, and a new law stipulates its preinstallation in all smartphones sold in Russia. State institutions, officials and businesses are actively encouraged to move communications and blogs to MAX.

Anastasiya Zhyrmont of the Access Now digital rights group said both Telegram and WhatsApp were disrupted in Russia in July in what could be a test of how potential blockages would affect internet infrastructure. 

It wouldn't be uncommon. In recent years, authorities regularly tested cutting off the internet from the rest of the world, sometimes resulting in outages in some regions. 

Darbinyan believes the only way to make people use MAX is to “shut down, stifle” every Western alternative. “But again, habits ... do not change in a year or two. And these habits acquired over decades, when the internet was fast and free,” he said. 

Government media and internet regulator Roskomnadzor uses more sophisticated methods, analyzing all web traffic and identifying what it can block or choke off, Darbinyan said.

It's been helped by “years of perfecting the technology, years of taking over and understanding the architecture of the internet and the players,” as well as Western sanctions and companies leaving the Russian market since 2022, said Kruope of Human Rights Watch.

Russia is “not there yet” in isolating its internet from the rest of the world, Darbinyan said, but Kremlin efforts are “bringing it closer.”

Dr. Phil McGraw tells Hannity why he visited the southern border and spoke with Border Patrol agents.

Dr. Phil McGraw's Peteski Productions says it voluntarily agreed to pay former Merit Street Media employees their pre-bankruptcy compensation as the legal process plays out. 

Merit Street Media, which was formed in 2023 and launched Merit TV in 2024, was a joint venture of McGraw's Peteski Productions and Trinity Broadcasting that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July and simultaneously filed a lawsuit against the network that specializes in Christian programming.

According to a memo sent by Peteski attorneys to former Merit Street Media employees and independent contractors, Dr. Phil's production company agreed to loan the bankrupt company enough cash to fully pay workers for pre-bankruptcy work. The initial loan amount fell short once Trinity Broadcasting was allowed to delay a key hearing by three weeks, but Peteski has upped the figure to do the "right thing."

"As this process has played out, one of our top priorities has been to do whatever we can for the workers. We thought the issue of worker compensation would be resolved at a July 29 hearing, but TBN asked for and received a three-week delay. In light of the real needs of the workers for this to be resolved, we felt this was the right thing to do," a Peteski spokesperson told Fox News Digital. 

Over 150 checks were written for a total of $925,000, according to the memo. The payments occurred outside of official bankruptcy proceedings.

McGraw agreed to provide Merit Street with new episodes of his "Dr. Phil Show," primetime specials and other content, while Trinity Broadcasting contributed distribution and production services, according to the lawsuit that essentially blames the Christian broadcaster for the bankruptcy.

Merit Street accused Trinity Broadcasting of reneging on its obligations and abusing "its position as the controlling shareholder of Merit Street to improperly and unilaterally burden Merit Street with unsustainable debt, doing so either without notice or in direct violation of promises not to do so."

The vast majority of former Merit Street Media employees are out of work, while a select few have stayed on based on the supervision of a bankruptcy judge. 

The bankruptcy filing lists both estimated assets and liabilities in the $100-$500 million range. Merit Street is seeking damages, legal costs, and "further relief as the Court may deem just and proper."

WASHINGTON (AP) — Mairekk Griffiths, a 26-year-old cook in a Denver suburb, doesn't think he'll ever pay a lot of attention to U.S. politics unless radical change happens.

“If another party was likely to win, I'd be interested in that,” said Griffiths, who voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year's presidential race but, like many his age, does not see voting as that valuable.

“I can't say either way that voting matters,” Griffiths said. “It's just picking the least bad option. That's what I remember my whole life — both sides are bad, but this side is less bad.”

Young people such as Griffiths are less engaged with U.S. politics than older Americans and less likely to say voting is important, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Young people — even those who follow politics closely — are less likely to say issues such as the economy, government spending and health care are “extremely important” to them than comparable older adults.




The findings point to a broad sense of disillusionment among younger people about the country's political system — even if, like Griffiths, they still end up casting a ballot. Alberto Medina, who leads the Center for Information and Research on Civic Engagement at Tufts University, which studies youth and politics, noted that turnout among young people hit record levels in the 2020 election and was high last year.

“There's a sense that democracy isn't working for young people. There's a lack of belief that democracy is even able to improve their lives,” Medina said. “At the same time, we have been living in an era of high youth voting.”

In another sign of their general estrangement from politics, the poll shows young adults are more likely to reject political party labels. About one-third of adults under age 30 identify as political independents who don't lean toward either major political party, compared with 17% of Americans age 60 or older. 

The poll also finds young people are far less likely to follow politics closely than older adults are. 

Only about 2 in 10 of adults under age 30 say they follow U.S. politics “extremely” or “very” closely, compared with about one-third of Americans overall. That's even higher among adults age 60 or older — 45% of this group says they follow U.S. politics at least very closely.

Disengagement is higher among teenagers, with an AP-NORC poll from May finding 44% of teens ages 13 to 17 report following U.S. politics “not very closely” or “not closely at all.”

Meanwhile, about two-thirds of adults under age 30 say it's “extremely” or “very” important to vote, compared with almost 9 in 10 over age 45 who say it's at least “very” important to vote.

Some of these habits could shift as people grow older. Younger people traditionally are less likely to vote than older people, and voter participation tends to go up with age. It's possible that engagement with politics could follow a similar pattern.

Brittany Diaz, 28, follows politics closely for an unusual reason: Her oldest son, who is 7, is obsessed with the news and watches it every night. Diaz, a Republican who lives in an Albuquerque, New Mexico, suburb, acknowledges that she's unusual among her age group because she decided to start paying attention to politics when she had her first child at 20.

“Now that I have kids, I'm like, ‘I need to care,'” she said.

In closely following politics, Diaz is different from many other women under 30.

Women in her age group are less likely than young men to say they follow U.S. politics, the poll finds. About one-quarter of men under 30 say they follow politics “extremely” or “very” closely, compared with 16% of women in the same age group. And about 4 in 10 young women say they follow U.S. politics “not very closely” or “not closely at all” compared with about a quarter of young men.

On a few issues, such as the economy and health care, the divide between the youngest and oldest Americans isn't large. About 8 in 10 Americans under age 30 say the economy is “extremely” or “very” important to them personally, compared with about 9 in 10 Americans age 60 or older.

But older adults are much likelier to say topics that have taken center stage during the first six months of President Donald Trump's second term — including immigration and government spending — are “extremely” or “very” important to them personally compared with Americans under 30.

That's even true for topics such as the situation in the Middle East, which has become a rallying cry for young activists since the Israel-Hamas war broke out. Only about 4 in 10 adults under 30 say this is highly important to them personally, compared with about 6 in 10 Americans age 60 or older.

For some, that lack of interest could be related to a sense that the political system doesn't respond to their needs.

At 18, Blake Marlar is just starting to pay attention to politics. As Trump's tax cut and spending bill moved through the Republican-controlled Congress, the aspiring geology major at the University of Nebraska emailed his state's two senators, both Republicans, objecting to its Medicaid cuts and increases in immigration enforcement funding.

“They didn't seem to take me seriously,” Marlar said. “While I recognize they have to represent the whole state and the whole state doesn't agree with me, it could have been a different experience.”

But he's resolved not to give up on politics: “In the future,” he said, “I'll do my part and vote.”

Defunding popular programs can be as unwelcome in Trump country as it is in coastal cities.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

The email arrived at 10:55 p.m. on Friday, July 25, with an upbeat subject line: “Big News: Key Federal Title Funds Set to Release Next Week.” It was sent by North Dakota's schools superintendent, Kirsten Baesler, who is awaiting confirmation to become an assistant secretary at the U.S. Department of Education, the very agency that had been holding back the funds in question—more than $5 billion—from school districts for weeks.

“Thank you for your advocacy, patience, professionalism, and persistence as we've waited for these essential funds to flow,” Baesler wrote to local school leaders. Like their peers across the country, North Dakota educators had grown dismayed as the congressionally approved money, one of the largest federal-grant programs for K–12 students, had been held up. Some had spent the summer pondering layoffs and sweating over spreadsheets. “Hopefully, this development will provide greater clarity as you move forward with budget planning for the upcoming year,” Baesler reassured them. She signed the message, “With relief and gratitude.”

That an incoming official of the Department of Education was touting the importance of federal dollars for a heavily Republican state underscores the conundrum that President Donald Trump faces in his attempt to dismantle the agency. On the campaign trail, Trump's promise to “send education back to the states” was often greeted with applause, and the Supreme Court has allowed the president to go ahead with his plans to gut the Education Department. But the four-week funding freeze—and the backlash it sparked—showed that cutting popular programs for schoolkids can be as unwelcome in Trump country as it is in coastal cities.

Quinta Jurecic: The Supreme Court won't explain itself

“After months of being told to ‘wait it out,' districts are now supposed to pick up the pieces and act like everything's fine,” Steven Johnson, the superintendent of Fort Ransom School District, in southeastern North Dakota, told me. “I've got to be honest—this doesn't sit well out here. You can't freeze money that was already allocated, leave schools hanging through hiring season and budget planning, and then expect us to just be grateful when it finally shows up. Rural folks don't like being jerked around.”

While the funds were frozen, an informal alliance emerged between rural and big-city educators who pushed back against the president. Lawmakers from some of the reddest parts of the country opposed the funding pause too, an early warning signal to the White House as it weighs plans that might further disrupt the public-education system.

If the Trump administration's decision to abruptly cut off the funding began as a trial balloon, it ended as a cautionary tale.

In arguing for the dismantling of the Education Department, Trump has asserted that America's schoolchildren have fallen further behind their global peers since the department's creation, in 1979. This is correct, but his proposed solution of sending education “back to the states” has always been a bit misleading. The federal government accounts for only about 10 percent of K–12 funding; states and localities cover the bulk of the cost. Still, the money that the administration withheld last month—which initially totaled about $6.8 billion—is significant. It represents more than 7.5 percent of the Education Department's current budget. The funds pay for after-school programs, teacher training, English-learner services, migrant-education grants, and STEM activities. Many schools rely on the money to pay educators and run summer programs.

Educators across the country first learned on June 30 that the money was being frozen, just hours before it was supposed to be released. In a three-sentence email, the Department of Education told states that it was withholding the funds to conduct a review, “given the change in Administrations.” The unsigned message came from [email protected] and offered no details on what the review entailed, how long it would take, or whether the money would ultimately be released. The closest thing to an explanation came from the Office of Management and Budget, which asserted in a statement that the funds had previously been used to “subsidize a radical left-wing agenda,” support LGBTQ programming, and “promote illegal immigrant advocacy.”

Schools immediately began to feel the impact of the missing funds. In Cincinnati, administrators were forced to cancel orders for new curriculum materials and pause some services for students learning English. Some teachers in Fargo, North Dakota, learned that their annual $500 bonus was abruptly being cut. Officials in California, which had been expecting almost $1 billion from the federal funds, abruptly paused operations for a teacher-training program.

Back-to-school planning was affected too. In the nation's second-largest school district, Los Angeles, officials braced for “impossible choices” such as potentially having to shut down after-school tutoring or lay off school counselors, the district's superintendent, Alberto Carvalho, told me. “For us to organize and budget and prepare for a school year impacting 540,000 students—in addition to 70,000 adult learners—we need to know what our recurring revenues are,” he said. Johnson, whose hometown of Fort Ransom, North Dakota, has a population of 2,200 and is 70 miles from the nearest Walmart, made the same case when he spoke with me from his cattle ranch. “If we don't hire staff between such-and-such a date, we're not going to get them,” he told me. “So the delay tactics already have hurt.” In a survey conducted last month by the School Superintendents Association, a group that advocates for more federal support for K–12 education, hundreds of school-district leaders from across the country similarly reported that they were planning to lay off teachers and cut classroom programs if the hold on funds persisted into August.

David A. Graham: What does the Department of Education actually do?

In Washington, lawmakers from both parties began to relay these concerns to the White House. In a July 16 letter to OMB Director Russell Vought, Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia joined nine other Republican senators—including lawmakers from six of the 10 states Trump carried by the largest margins in November—to urge the administration to release the money immediately. The senators noted that Congress had already approved the funding as part of a spending law and called on the administration to “faithfully implement” that legislation. “Withholding these funds will harm students, families and local economies,” the senators wrote. Senator Tommy Tuberville of Alabama did not sign the letter but told reporters on July 17 that he planned to talk with Trump about the funds during a dinner that was planned for the following day. (I asked Tuberville's office if the senator had gone through with the conversation but didn't get a response.)

Meanwhile, local and state officials from across the demographic and political spectrum banded together to advocate for the funding's release. On July 21, a group that included school districts and teachers' unions filed a joint lawsuit challenging the halt in funding. Among the plaintiffs were the Kuspuk School District, in remote Alaska, which has about 300 students spread out over 12,000 square miles, as well as Cincinnati Public Schools, which has 35,000 students in about 80 square miles. “They do not want to spend their time suing the federal government,” the lawsuit said of the schools. “They want to do their jobs serving students and communities.” (The case is pending.)

That same day, the Department of Education released part of the funding—$1.4 billion for “21st Century Community Learning Centers” grants, which high-poverty states such as West Virginia disproportionately rely on for after-school and summer-school programs. A few days later, on July 25, the department said it would release the more than $5 billion in remaining funds. Federal officials offered no public accounting of what their review had turned up, but they threatened further scrutiny of school districts that ran afoul of federal civil-rights laws and presidential directives. The Trump administration has used civil-rights legislation to go after schools for policies regarding transgender athletes and diversity, equity, and inclusion.

The White House and the Education Department did not respond to requests for comment about the funds. Speaking at a National Governors Association meeting on the day the funds were released, Education Secretary Linda McMahon said the federal government was “well satisfied” after evaluating the grant programs under review and that she expected dollars to flow more seamlessly in the future.

Although OMB officials had initially attempted to cast the review as part of Trump's effort to root out liberal ideology from schools, Jon Valant, who researches K–12 policy at the Brookings Institution, told me that the White House was never likely to find much evidence to back up those claims. “When you have a country with millions of public-school teachers across about 100,000 public schools, if you look, sure, you're going to find someone somewhere who's doing something objectionable,” he said. “But the vast majority of these funds are used in ways that hardly any American would object to.”

Ed Hermes, a school-board member in Phoenix, echoed this. “This is going to Girl Scouts. This is going to softball. I know because my kids are in these programs,” Hermes, a former schoolteacher himself, told me. “This is going to fund kids getting help with their math homework after school.”

The decision to hold back the congressionally mandated funding came as the Education Department has lost nearly half its workforce under Trump, who is proposing additional budget cuts for the agency. The White House has asked Congress to slash grants for migrant education, English-language acquisition, and other programs funded by the money that was recently frozen, as part of next year's budget.

If she is confirmed by the Senate, Baesler, the North Dakota superintendent, could soon join that effort as the next assistant secretary for elementary and secondary education. Whether she will use her new perch to contribute to the Trump administration's goal of shutting down the department or advocate on behalf of schools that rely on federal funds is a question of great concern to educators in her home state. Wayne Trottier, who retired in June as superintendent of the school district in Sawyer, North Dakota (population 307), told me that he'd recently confronted Baesler about the funding freeze. Trottier said that he'd asked her whether she would fight from the inside against the Trump administration's cuts. “This is why the Department of Education needs me on staff now and not later,” he recalled her saying.

Baesler did not respond to my requests for comment. In an email to superintendents yesterday, she said she was “pleased” to announce that the dollars were now available, and thanked McMahon, North Dakota lawmakers, and local educators “who advocated for the release of these funds.”

Kevin Carey: Scammers are coming for college students

She could have a tough time in Washington making the case for Trump's proposed cuts. On Thursday, a bipartisan group of lawmakers on the Senate Appropriations Committee passed a spending bill that rejected Trump's plan to scale down the Education Department. The bill also included language essentially banning the Trump administration from pursuing another funding freeze for K–12 schools next year. It passed by a 26–3 margin and now heads to the full Senate for a vote.

The Trump administration could also continue to face resistance from around the country. In my conversations with school officials from both urban and rural districts, I frequently heard them making the case for each other. Johnson, who serves on the board of the National Rural Education Association, which advocates for schools in remote areas, stressed the crucial role the department plays in defending the civil rights of minority students and immigrants—of which there are few in his town. “Why are they picking on the Hispanics?” he said at one point. Luisa Santos, who serves on the school board in Florida's large and very diverse Miami-Dade County, told me that without the Education Department, smaller districts would struggle the most. “The federal government is able to support extremely rural areas—areas that, frankly, I don't think could generate that funding on their own if they needed to,” she said.

This urban-rural alliance could be tested, however, as Trump aims to move forward with his broader education agenda, which includes advancing school-choice vouchers, filing lawsuits against schools over transgender policies, and promoting what the White House has called “patriotic education.” Some educators I spoke with feared that long-standing cultural divides over immigration, race, gender, sexuality, and how to teach American history could create fissures among school districts that have found common cause in advocating for broadly popular programs such as summer school.

The administration's decision to end the funding freeze, these sources said, could ultimately be a tactical retreat ahead of a more aggressive push to demolish the Department of Education. “It's a half-sigh of relief,” Santos said about the release of federal funds, adding that a “roller coaster of unknowns” still awaits educators as the new school year begins. “I don't think this is the end at all.”

The Supreme Court will rehear arguments about the Louisiana congressional map, which could have wider ramifications for other states' maps as mid-decade redistricting is thrust into the spotlight.

The high court on Friday requested briefs from the parties in Louisiana v. Callais, a case about whether the state's “intentional creation of a second majority-minority congressional district violates the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments.”

The request ahead of a second round of oral arguments tees up a pivotal case in the upcoming term, in which justices could further narrow the Voting Rights Act and eliminate mandatory minority-majority districts.

The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case in March, and the second set of oral arguments is expected as soon as this fall.

The case was brought by a group of nonblack voters who argued that the congressional map with two black-majority districts was an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The Louisiana legislature adopted the map in 2024 to include a second black-majority district after a congressional map with only one black-majority district was ruled insufficient under the Voting Rights Act. A federal district court panel sided with the group of nonblack voters, a ruling that was appealed to the Supreme Court.

The high court agreed to hear the case in November 2024 and was scheduled to make a decision by the end of June. On the final release day for decisions for the 2024-2025 term, the Supreme Court punted on making a ruling and announced it would rehear the case in the next term, with Justice Clarence Thomas dissenting.

During the first oral arguments in March, the conservative majority on the Supreme Court questioned whether the use of race in congressional redistricting had gone too far. The question presented to the high court was whether the lower court erred by finding that race predominated in enacting the challenged congressional map.

“Isn't saying race is one consideration another way of saying race predominated?” Gorsuch asked during oral arguments. “And how do we square that with the Fourteenth Amendment's promise that race should play no role?”

As the justices ask for briefs on a wider question over the creation of the second black-majority district, parts of the Voting Rights Act and the 14th Amendment appear to be the center of the next round of oral arguments.

Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 has been used in lawsuits that have led to the creation of more minority-majority districts, including the second black-majority district at the center of the current case before the Supreme Court. The creation of black-majority districts under the Voting Rights Act aims to prevent the dilution of the voting power of minorities and allow them to elect their own representatives.

Litigation against state congressional maps citing the Voting Rights Act was brought in several southern states, including Louisiana, Alabama, and Florida, during the redistricting cycle following the 2020 Census. Because of the Democratic Party's dominance with black voters, the creation of minority-majority districts tends to lead to Democratic representatives in Congress.

In Louisiana, the second black-majority district resulted in Democrats picking up the redrawn seat from the GOP. Eliminating or narrowing the Voting Rights Act's ability to create minority-majority districts could result in fewer Democratic representatives in southern states.

The Supreme Court has struck down and narrowed parts of the Voting Rights Act in the past, notably with the 2013 ruling in Shelby County v. Holder. In the landmark decision, the preclearance requirement, which mandated select jurisdictions get authorization from the attorney general or a panel on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia before making changes to their election laws, was found to be unconstitutional.

The high court ruled in 2023 for Alabama to create a second black-majority district, declining to narrow Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act to exclude redistricting. In the 5-4 decision, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined the three liberal justices in the majority.

Thomas, in the dissent, argued that Section 2 does not require “the State of Alabama to intentionally redraw its longstanding congressional districts so that black voters can control a number of seats roughly proportional to the black share of the State's population,” adding, “If it did, the Constitution would not permit it.”

SUPREME COURT TO REHEAR ARGUMENTS NEXT TERM IN LOUISIANA RACIAL REDISTRICTING CASE

The justices appear poised to revisit the constitutionality of Section 2's use to create additional minority-majority districts.

As the Supreme Court weighs a challenge to Louisiana's congressional map, Texas's proposal to create new congressional maps has prompted various states to examine mid-decade redistricting efforts. The high court's ruling in Louisiana v. Callais, which is expected by the end of June 2026, could spur more changes to congressional maps.

﻿A policy whose cruelty was matched only by its incompetence.

Israel's restrictions on humanitarian aid in Gaza are, first and foremost, a moral atrocity. Israeli policies since March, most notably the initial shutdown on aid entering the Strip, were very obviously going to cause a hunger crisis down the line. There can be no defense for intentionally starving children.

But strikingly, the policy has also become a strategic failure for Israel.

Its aid limitations, intended to starve out Hamas, have actually strengthened the group's position and handed it new leverage in ceasefire negotiations. International outrage over the past week has prompted important Israeli partners — France, the UK, and Canada — to announce support for recognizing a Palestinian state. Perhaps most importantly, the suffering in Gaza has done severe damage to Israel's alliance with the United States, alienating masses of Democrats and even some MAGA Republicans.

This is not only my opinion. It is a point of emerging consensus of well-informed analysts across the political spectrum, who see the recent international uproar over starvation in Gaza as a catastrophe for Jerusalem.

“Israel may have massive military superiority in Gaza but as of this week, it has lost the war,” writes Michael Stephens, a Middle East expert at the UK's RUSI think tank.

If the policy is such an obvious disaster, both morally evil and strategically disastrous, then why did Israel do it all?

In some sense, this is the question of the entire war, which Israeli generals concluded over a year ago was no longer improving the country's security. The answer, in both cases, is the same: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu depends on Israel's extreme right to stay in office, and they support ever-more-brutal war policies to further their project of Israel reconquering and resettling the Gaza Strip.

Netanyahu has, in short, deliberately caused mass suffering and inflicted a strategic disaster on the country he leads — all for the purpose of appeasing a handful of fanatics who hold his future in their hands.

Even before October, Gaza was in poor economic straits — thanks both to Israeli restrictions and Hamas's own poor governance. But the war has destroyed even the limited capacities Gazans had to sustain themselves. Roughly 95 percent of farmland is no longer operational; fishing, a vital activity in the coastal enclave, is now “virtually impossible” at scale, per a UN report.

So today, Gazans either receive aid or face starvation — a reality that was already obvious back when Israel announced its aid cutoff back in March.

At the time, a statement from the prime minister's office described the policy as punishment for Hamas' refusal to release Israeli hostages during ongoing ceasefire negotiations. This turned into a full-on effort to starve Hamas out.

First, Israel cut off aid entirely from early March through May, blocking assistance from entering at border crossings. It then partnered with the US to support a new entity called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation — a parallel aid distribution mechanism alongside traditional UN efforts designed to ensure that Hamas was not, as Israel claimed, stealing supplies. This highly militarized effort did not provide sufficient aid and also led to Israeli soldiers regularly opening fire on crowds of desperate Palestinians trying to get some of the limited supplies.

There was, at no point during any of this, even the slightest bit of evidence that the aid cutoff was weakening Hamas's resolve to fight — no wavering in its negotiating stances or signs of mass defection from its fighters. The people who suffered were not primarily Hamas, but Gazan civilians (and the remaining Israeli hostages).

The Gaza hunger crisis, building for months, came to a head in the past several weeks. At that point, reserve supplies from before the aid cutoff had all but disappeared — and it became obvious that GHF wasn't providing nearly enough food to make up for Israel's other restrictions. By late July, even some UN aid workers couldn't find sufficient food for themselves.

As the reality of starvation on the ground became undeniable to all but the most blinkered Israeli propagandists, the world erupted in outrage. While Israel is used to international criticism, the volume and nature of the outrage was so significant that it was forced to change policy. Israel began airdropping supplies into Gaza, opened up new corridors for UN trucks to provide aid, and unilaterally announced 10-hour daily “pauses” in its military operations in order to facilitate aid provision.

Whether these policies actually alleviate hunger in Gaza remains to be seen. But the key point, from a military point of view, is that Israel just proved that it cannot leverage suffering in Gaza into gains at the negotiating table. Quite the opposite, in fact: The worse things get, the more Israel feels a need to change course — to slow down its military operations unilaterally, without Hamas having to give up anything in exchange.

“The world coming down on you…that takes the pressure off Hamas,” says Ilan Goldenberg, the senior vice president at J Street who recently served as a top Israel-Palestine official in the Biden administration. “[The aid cutoff] actually probably causes Hamas to take a harder line in negotiations.”

This should not come as a shock. The October 7 attacks themselves were intended, at least in part, to provoke an Israeli overreaction — something so violent and bloody that Israel would lose the world's post-attack goodwill and even suffer severe political consequences. The more misery Netanyahu's government inflicts on Gazans, the better off Hamas is in the long term.

By cutting off and limiting aid, Israel made a vicious choice that played directly into Hamas's hands.

“Months wasted playing a game the enemy couldn't lose, and if you miscalculate the consequences are justifiably on you — on your head,” Haviv Rettig Gur, a prominent right-leaning Israeli journalist, said on his podcast last week.

Israel's aid policy “failed so severely,” in Gur's view, “that Hamas has been propped up at every turn, its resilience assured, and all the gains on the battlefield jeopardized.”

It is worth dwelling on why Israel cares so much about the current wave of international outrage.

Throughout the Gaza war, Israel has been able to ride out increasingly hostile opinions in most countries thanks to its support among the leaders of Western democracies. The European Union is Israel's trading partner, and the United States its military supplier and diplomatic patron. So long as those relationships are intact, Israel faces few serious threats from global public opinion.

But in the past week, that dam has started to crack — beginning what Michael Koplow, the chief policy officer at the Israel Policy Forum, calls a “long-predicted diplomatic tsunami.”

It is not that the proposals by countries like Britain, Canada, and France to recognize a Palestinian state mean much in immediate practical terms. It is what they signal as newly possible: a world where countries begin actually treating Israel not as a peer democracy, but as a rogue aggressor more akin to Russia than an EU member state. Just this week, the EU floated a bid to end some research cooperation with Israel — a punishment that, per key member states, will become more and more likely if the humanitarian situation in Gaza doesn't improve.

Yet for all Israel's woes in Europe, it is the United States where it faces the most dangerous long-term threat.

Democrats have been turning from Israel since the Obama presidency, a trend that accelerated sharply and dramatically during the Gaza war. And there are forces on the MAGA right, including some unsavory ones, that have long wanted to sever the Republican party's bond with the Jewish state.

But the past week has been a watershed in US-Israel relations — and not in a good way for Israel. Israel's decision to knowingly induce an acute starvation crisis has played a clear and direct role in weakening its most important strategic relationship.

For the first time, a majority of the Senate Democratic caucus voted to suspend US military assistance to Israel — a move reflecting the Democratic base's increasingly harsh view of Israel. On the Republican side, President Donald Trump flatly contradicted Israel's claims that there was no starvation in Gaza. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene even described Israel's conduct in Gaza as a genocide.

“The only truly existential strategic threat that Israel faces is loss of support from the United States,” Koplow says. “As a direct result of [Gaza's starvation], we have now seen lower support among Democrats, measured in every way. [And] anyone can see the trends in MAGA world, which is now the base of the Republican Party.”

So if Israel's starvation policy was so obviously self-defeating — to say nothing of its grotesque immorality — why did it do it in the first place?

The answer has two layers — the first political, the second ideological. Put together, they suggest there's dim hope of positive changes so long as the current government is in power.

Politically, Netanyahu's coalition has exactly half of the seats in Israel's parliament (60 out of 120). Even a single defecting lawmaker could enable a vote in parliament calling for early elections, which polls have long said he would lose.

The math makes Netanyahu unusually dependent on the leaders of two extremist factions — Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir — who have repeatedly threatened to jump ship if Netanyahu compromises on maximalism in Gaza.

For these radicals, the war is part of a broader ideological agenda. They believe that Israel should rightfully control all of the land between the river and the sea, and that pursuit of Israeli control and security justifies seemingly unlimited cruelty towards Palestinians. The aid restrictions reflect these twisted values: Last year, Smotrich gave a speech declaring that it would be “just and moral” if Israel chose to “starve and thirst two million [Palestinian] citizens” until the hostages are returned.

But it's not just aid: These lawmakers are the reason why this entire war continues despite the lack of obvious military benefits and widespread domestic support for a ceasefire. Smotrich and Ben Gvir have both said they would abandon Netanyahu if he agrees to stop the fighting indefinitely. These threats do not seem idle; Ben Gvir briefly quit the coalition in January in protest of Netanyahu's accession to a temporary ceasefire.

Netanyahu is so afraid of the consequences of losing office — he's currently on trial for corruption — that he has chosen to outsource portions of his war policy to these fanatics, including the most fundamental choice of whether to continue the war at all.

The Gaza starvation disaster is a direct product of this combination of fanaticism and rank self-interest. There will likely be more so long as this coalition remains in power.

            As Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem jetted across South America last week, there was one familiar face from President Donald Trump's orbit frequently at her side: Corey Lewandowski.
    


            Lewandowski has become a fixture at the Department of Homeland Security, serving as Noem's chief    adviser  . But on paper, he was originally tapped to serve as a special government employee, a unique role meant to span a limited number of days. He's not included on the department's leadership list, but in other DHS materials he's been described as chief adviser to the secretary.
    


            A senior Homeland Security official, speaking on behalf of the department in response to questions from CNN, said Lewandowski remains a special government employee — a status that typically lasts up to 130 days in a yearlong period — and his time “is kept by a career DHS employee who submits the paperwork on a bi-weekly basis.” He isn't paid by DHS and doesn't receive federal government benefits, the official said.
    


            Lewandowski — who has previously worked as a lobbyist, strategic adviser and campaign operative — has filed a financial disclosure, the DHS official said. CNN has asked for a copy of the disclosure form.
    


            Last week, Lewandowski was pictured at Noem's side during meetings in Argentina, the first stop of the secretary's South America swing, and later participated in a bilateral meeting with Chilean and Ecuadorian officials, along with senior Homeland Security officials.
    


            It's indicative of the enormous power Lewandowski has amassed during his time at DHS.
    


            Lewandowski has directed the firings of personnel, requested employees be put on administrative leave, called agency leaders “to hold them accountable,” and in at least one instance, signed off on billions of dollars in FEMA grant funding, according to multiple sources and documents viewed by CNN.
    


            “He's the de facto chief of staff in the department. Everyone is terrified of him because he has almost singular authority to fire people,” a source familiar with the dynamic told CNN. Homeland Security officials told CNN Lewandowski is viewed as Noem's gatekeeper. Asked about his role, the senior DHS official described him as an adviser.
    


            Lewandowski joined the department on a temporary basis in mid-February after floating in and out of Trump's world over several years.
    


            He served as Trump's campaign manager from June    2015 until he was fired a year later, amid a series of negative stories and internal tensions with other advisers and some of Trump's children.
    


            Lewandowski was formally brought on to staff Trump's 2024 campaign just months before Election Day, with the candidate telling his former campaign manager he missed the old days of his first run for the White House.
    


            But his addition — which came in the midst of a tumultuous time for Trump's political operation as it sought to adapt to their new opponent, then-Vice President Kamala Harris — quickly led to internal drama.
    


            Trump's co-campaign managers at the time, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, were irked by Lewandowski's efforts to constantly assert himself in high-level decisions, often taking his opinions directly to Trump, sources familiar with the discussions told CNN at the time. His actions, they felt, threatened to subvert a carefully crafted dynamic that Wiles and LaCivita cultivated for the previous two years.
    


            Those clashes quickly spread throughout much of the senior campaign team, the sources said, many of whom continued working for Trump throughout his presidential transition and accompanied him to the White House.
    


            Lewandowski was sidelined before the campaign ended, and he didn't score a top position in the West Wing. Many people considered core members of Trump's inner circle, who are not only fiercely loyal to Trump but also to Wiles and each other, continue to view Lewandowski with a dose of skepticism.
    


            In a statement, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson called Lewandowski “one of President Trump's longest and most trusted advisers.”
    


            “The tremendous results coming from the Department of Homeland Security – a historically secure border, safer American communities, and successful deportations of criminal illegal aliens – speak for themselves,” Jackson said.
    


            Lewandowski also previously advised Noem when she was South Dakota governor. But both Noem and a pro-Trump super PAC cut ties with him in 2021 following allegations that he made unwanted sexual advances toward a GOP donor, accusations Lewandowski denied. Lewandowski later made a deal with Las Vegas prosecutors to resolve a misdemeanor battery charge stemming from the allegations.
    


            Lewandowski eventually returned to Noem's orbit and is now often spotted at the secretary's side as she mounts an aggressive public relations strategy to advance Trump's immigration agenda.
    


            “Everything he's doing is to increase (Noem's) profile,” a DHS official said, referring to Lewandowski.
    


            The Trump administration has leaned heavily on staunch allies serving in temporary roles — and extended immense authority to those people. Elon Musk, who similarly held special government employee status until departing the administration, attempted to reshape the federal government by slashing the workforce and cutting billions in funding.
    


            It's not unusual for secretaries to lean on people outside government for advice or for senior Homeland Security officials to be intimately involved in day-to-day business. But Lewandowski appears to be somewhere in between, raising questions internally, primarily: How long can he continue to call the shots in a position meant to be temporary?
    


Special government employees are subject to less stringent ethics requirements and as a result, are generally allowed to serve 130 days in a yearlong period, which don't have to be consecutive. But if their time is expected to span longer and they're taking on more responsibilities, then they would face higher requirements, according to experts. Federal agencies typically estimate how long an SGE will stay on board.
    


            “Previously, SGEs primarily served in advisory and technical positions that required expertise, and their outside conflicts of interest were less of a concern because they weren't involved in funding and personnel decisions in the same way as a senior career employee,” said Cristin Dorgelo, a former Office of Management and Budget official during the Biden administration. “The management of core government functions has not been something that SGEs have commonly filled roles around.”
    


            Lewandowski's straddling of senior government functions at DHS and service as a special government employee is another example of uncharted territory.
    


            “This is not what this authority was intended for,” said Sam Berger, a former OMB official and senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
    


            Lewandowski's growing influence over DHS is strikingly evident in his relentless push to help the Trump administration dismantle the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
    


            On the campaign trail, Trump railed against FEMA for its response to Hurricane Helene, branding it partisan and ineffective – a narrative that grew into calls to eliminate the agency altogether. From the early days of the Trump administration, Lewandowski made his intentions clear: he would be the president's hatchet man, determined to take FEMA apart — no matter who stood in his way.
    


            Lewandowski's hard-charging style quickly set him on a collision course with Cameron Hamilton , Trump's first acting FEMA administrator. The two clashed repeatedly, with Lewandowski ultimately orchestrating Hamilton's abrupt and public downfall, multiple sources told CNN.
    


            Publicly, the Trump administration cast FEMA as a bloated, “woke” bureaucracy in desperate need of a reckoning. Behind closed doors, Hamilton pushed back, arguing that the agency's real challenges stemmed from a barrage of congressional mandates — not from its own staff. He became increasingly insistent that FEMA should not be scrapped, warning that the president and Noem were being led astray by bad advice.
    


            Lewandowski repeatedly berated Hamilton in front of colleagues, accusing him of losing sight of the administration's mission.
    


            The atmosphere inside FEMA grew increasingly tense. After CNN reported details of a high-level meeting about dismantling the agency, Lewandowski ordered staff to administer a polygraph test to several employees including Hamilton, seeking to determine whether he had leaked information to the press.
    


            “Under Secretary Noem's leadership, DHS is unapologetic about its efforts to root out leakers that undermine national security,” the senior DHS official said, adding that the department is “agnostic about your standing, tenure    , political appointment, or status as a career civil servant.”
    


            Hamilton's tenure ended swiftly and unceremoniously. Just hours before he was scheduled to testify before Congress, he was accidentally alerted of his impending termination, after DHS notified FEMA security that his access would soon be shut off. He then broke with the administration, telling lawmakers he could not support the plan to eliminate FEMA. He was fired the next day.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later blamed Hamilton's testimony for his dismissal, saying, “This individual testified saying something that was contrary to what the president believes and the goals of this administration in regards to FEMA policy.”
    


            In reality, Lewandowski's plan to remove Hamilton had been weeks in the making, multiple sources told CNN.
    


            According to the sources, Lewandowski pushed to install his own loyalist, David Richardson, as Hamilton's successor, though the senior DHS official told CNN this is “categorically false.”
    


            Richardson — a personal friend of Lewandowski and DHS official with no prior experience managing natural disasters — had previously received a glowing public review from Lewandowski for his book, “War Story,” which Lewandowski described as “brutal, funny in places, unapologetic. Will make liberals cringe!”
    


            At his first agencywide meeting, Richardson made a point of thanking three people for his new role at FEMA, according to a recording heard by CNN: “I do appreciate that President Trump, Secretary Noem and Corey Lewandowski had the confidence in me to send me here.”
    


            Lewandowski's grip on FEMA has only tightened as DHS has expanded its reach, installing more than half a dozen loyalists in FEMA's front office to effectively steer the agency from within. And his authority continues to grow.
    


            Lewandowski routinely overrides the department's Deputy Secretary Troy Edgar, acting as the department's de facto second-in-command. When he wants to kill a proposal, he's been known to scrawl “Denied” or “No” across documents in thick Sharpie, leaving no doubt about who truly holds the reins.
    


            The senior DHS official told CNN that “multiple staff have the ability to provide recommendations and input” and both Edgar and Lewandowski make recommendations to the secretary, “who has the final decision.”
    


            But sources painted a different picture.
    


            “If you're not getting through Corey, it's not getting done,” a source with knowledge of Lewandowski's influence told CNN. “Noem gives the final thumbs up on the calls, but Corey drives the conversations and the narrative.”
    


            When politics and policy collide, Lewandowski is often at the heart of the action. Earlier this year, as billions in FEMA grant funds were paused for review, top brass at DHS instructed agency staff to prioritize payments for GOP-led Missouri. Internal emails obtained by CNN at the time show Lewandowski at the center of these conversations, ensuring FEMA leaders greenlit the payments — even as some officials raised concerns about the optics of favoring certain states.
    


            Current and former Homeland Security officials describe Lewandowski as Noem's right-hand man who, they say, keeps people in line on behalf of the secretary. That manifests in phone calls and meetings, which can be tense if something has gone awry.
    


            “He's the hammer and you're the nail,” one Homeland Security official said. “He's the guy that's going to hold you accountable.”
    


            In two instances, one source recalled, Lewandowski directed two people be placed on administrative leave — one for use of gender pronouns in email, the other for a late edit in briefing materials. When asked about those instances, the senior DHS official said the department's Office of Management is responsible for placing individuals on administrative leave.
    


            When there's been abrupt turnover at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Lewandowski has joined the all-hands meetings, according to a former Homeland Security official.
    


            He also often travels with the secretary and was on site during a high-profile clash with California Sen. Alex Padilla, who was forcibly removed from a Noem news conference in Los Angeles earlier this year and coerced to the ground after attempting to ask the secretary a question about immigration enforcement operations in the city.
    


            It was Lewandowski who told DHS to remove the handcuffs, according to a Senate aide.
    


            “After the incident, Corey was the one who came down and asked DHS to release the senator and offered the meeting with the secretary,” the aide said, adding that Lewandowski offered refreshments and facilitated getting a room for the senator to wait until the secretary was available.
    


            “He seemed to be the one calling all the shots,” the aide said, adding that Lewandowski referred to himself as a “staff guy.”
    


            Since joining the department, Lewandowski has also been named to other posts. In June, Trump and Noem announced appointments to the Homeland Security advisory council, which was first established in 2002 to provide “real-time, real-world and independent advice on homeland security operations” and relies on experts across industries, many of whom hold posts outside of government. Lewandowski was listed as chief advisor to the DHS secretary.
    


            “It's a privilege to be here and I hope to get to offer some advice and counsel as we go through this very important job,” he said during the council's first meeting in July, according to a transcript .

CIA director John Ratcliffe explains the contents of the Durham Annex and what may be coming next in the investigation into the Russia 'hoax' on 'Sunday Night in America.'

Put yourself in Hillary Clinton's shoes. No, really. I know it's an abhorrent thought, but imagine being Hillary, having initiated the greatest political dirty trick of all time, watching Russiagate unspool over the past decade. Think of her witnessing the country go down the granddaddy of all rabbit holes in 2017 – a rabbit hole she personally helped dig -- looking for proof of Russian collusion between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin that she knew didn't exist. 

What was she thinking as the country hired a special prosecutor and spent tens of millions of taxpayer dollars to pursue leads that she and her campaign team had fabricated out of thin air? Was she ever remorseful? Was there ever a moment when she wanted to reel in the whole sorry deception and tell the country that she was sorry, and that she had lied?

No, there was not. Hillary Clinton even wrote a book called "What Happened?" in which she blamed Putin, along with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. and former CIA Director James Comey for her shocking loss to Donald Trump, a non-politician whom she mocked and derided. To this day, she sticks to her self-serving fable, that Russian President Vladimir Putin was out to get her and, but for his interference, she would surely have become the country's first female president.

JONATHAN TURLEY: DEMOCRATS PULLED THE GREATEST POLITICAL CON JOB EVER ON AMERICANS. IT'S FINALLY UNRAVELING

The reality is that Hillary Clinton was a terrible candidate, disliked and distrusted by most Americans. Polling from CNN that came out about the time of the 2016 Democrat Convention gives a taste of what voters thought of Clinton.  The Washington Post reported, "68 percent say Clinton isn't honest and trustworthy… her worst number on-record….  The 30 percent who see Clinton as honest and trustworthy is now well shy of the number who say the same of Trump: 43 percent." 

The public was right not to trust Clinton; the more we learn about Russiagate, and her role in it, the more apparent that is. 

Any normal person would conclude that Clinton, whose approval rating CNN pegged at a dismal 31% in July 2016, was not a shoo-in come the November election. Barack Obama had been president for eight years and the country had become less Democrat-leaning during his term; only 31% of the nation identified as Democrat in 2016, while 36% had described themselves as true blue in 2008, when he was first elected. 

DAVID MARCUS: THE RUSSIA HOAX IS SIMPLE. DEMOCRATS LIED AND HALF THE COUNTRY BELIEVED THEM

Though expressing confidence that she would win, maybe Hillary knew she had to pull out all stops to beat Donald Trump. Perhaps that's why she signed off on two dirty tricks that led to the despicable undermining of Donald Trump's presidency. 

First, her former campaign manager Robby Mook testified in court that she personally approved her campaign's scheme in October 2016 to tell a Slate magazine reporter about an unverified server backchannel between the Trump Organization and Alfa bank in Moscow. This supposed connection formed the first step in trying to convince the public that Donald Trump was a tool of Vladimir Putin. The purported link never existed, but it was widely publicized by Hillary's supporters and the legacy media (I repeat myself), creating suspicion in the public's mind. 

After the Slate story emerged, weeks before the election, Hillary put out a tweet claiming "Computer scientists have apparently uncovered a covert server linking the Trump Organization to a Russian-based bank," followed up by a news release in which she said, "This secret hotline may be the key to unlocking the mystery of Trump's ties to Russia." 

The FBI subsequently concluded no "hotline," indeed no link, ever existed. Interestingly, another apparatchik pushing the Trump-Alfa bank lie was Jake Sullivan, later presumably rewarded by President Joe Biden appointing the unknown politico to be National Security Adviser. 

Of course, the bigger and more destructive Russia collusion lie that Hillary helped originate came from the salacious allegations contained in the Steele dossier, paid for by the Clinton campaign, which led to the longtime investigation into Russian interference and the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. This is a fact, verified by the fact that the Federal Election Commission under Biden penalized the campaign and the DNC for lying about having funded that opposition research. 

The story, however, goes on. New revelations have revived accusations that Hillary Clinton, as well as Barack Obama, James Comey, John Brennan and others manipulated intelligence and facts to feed the public even more lies about Donald Trump's supposed ties to Russia.

Amazingly, the New York Times has again leapt into the breach to protect Clinton, perhaps concerned they might lose their 2018 Pulitzer earned for helping promote a fake news story. They reference, "An annex to a report by the special counsel John H. Durham" but claim the disclosures are an effort by "the Trump team [seeking] to distract from the Jeffrey Epstein files." They write that GOP allegations that "Mrs. Clinton had approved a campaign proposal to tie Mr. Trump to Russia to distract from the scandal over her use of a private email server" is not valid because…the damning emails contained in the annex are likely fabrications from Russian spies. Sure. 

Will we ever know the complete truth about the plot hatched to discredit the Trump presidency? Probably not, and it is probably also true that key players like Hillary Clinton will never be held accountable.

But, as Hillary watches the ongoing revelations coming from the Trump White House, we can also imagine that she is getting her comeuppance. Her treachery and deceit -– knowing how badly she has abused the public's trust -- has surely shriveled her soul, leaving her bitter and defeated.

People now see her as a corrupt schemer, someone who knew she could not win an election on her merits and so resorted to lies and fabrications that hurt the country. 

We also now see her as someone who didn't just attack President Trump, but also the 61 million Americans who voted for him in 2016.

Moms for Liberty, the parents' rights organization that rose to prominence for championing more parental involvement in education, was labeled a hate group by a state committee responsible for training police officers.

The Massachusetts Municipal Police Training Committee classified Moms for Liberty as a hate group in its training materials, putting it in the same category as groups such as neo-Nazis and antifa, according to a report from the Daily Wire, which obtained the information through a Freedom of Information Act request.

The MMPTC prepares over 20,000 police officers throughout Massachusetts for their duties as law enforcement officials. This includes developing and delivering “training standards of municipal, MBTA, environmental, UMass, campus police officers, and deputy sheriffs performing police duties and functions.”

“The Municipal Police Training Committee contributes to the safety and security of the Commonwealth's citizens by establishing training standards for and delivering training to more than 20,000 individuals who serve as police officers throughout the Commonwealth,” the organization's website reads. “The training ranges from basic training for new officers to mandatory and specialized professional development training for incumbent officers.”

Moms for Liberty was categorized as an “anti-government extremist group,” according to the Daily Wire. The designation came from assessments made by the Southern Party Law Center, a left-wing policy establishment, yet apparently used by the MMPTC. The training materials acquired in the FOIA request revealed that the MMPTC claimed that Moms for Liberty “targeted books that reference race and gender identity” and weaponized the concept of parents' rights as a “vehicle to attack public education and make schools less welcoming for minority and LGBTQ students.”

Moms for Liberty co-founder Tina Descovich rebuked the classification and subsequent accusations. She said her group encourages mothers to get engaged through activities such as attending school board meetings, among other things.

“Moms for Liberty is here to show up at school board meetings, speak out against curriculum, failing schools, inappropriate books maybe in your public school library,” Descovich told the Daily Wire. “Antifa is burning down whole cities and parts of cities and rioting in the streets. These two are not equivalent.”

“We want parents to have the ability to opt out of sexualized books or curriculum, things that don't align with their religious beliefs, as the Supreme Court just affirmed in their most recent ruling in the Montgomery County, Maryland case,” Descovich added.

She also questioned the MMPTC, pondering the motives behind Moms for Liberty being included in the trainings.

“We have to ask what is going on here in Massachusetts with these trainings to police officers,” Descovich said. “We are not conducting ourselves in a way that police ever need to be concerned about the way we act. As a matter of fact, our chapter chair there in Plymouth County, Massachusetts, who is the one that brought all this to my attention, said she has local members of their police force come up to her all the time and say, ‘Please keep going. We can't talk about it publicly, but I have kids. I appreciate you guys speaking out. So thank you for your courage and your bravery.'”

The trainings link to a heavily critical article from PBS, which claims that Moms for Liberty is a “well-connected extremist group that attacks inclusion in schools.” It also specified that Moms for Liberty works to get right-wing candidates elected to school boards, the Daily Wire reported.

TEXAS HOUSE PASSES MOTION FOR ARREST WARRANTS FOR DEMOCRATS WHO FLED STATE

“PBS is anything but fair and balanced,” Descovich said. “And now the state of Massachusetts is using those PBS articles to target us, to put a target on our back and tell police in that state that we are a threat.”

“All we are is moms and dads that are concerned about our children, that are speaking up in a public forum, which we have the constitutional right to do,” she added.

            Democrats might finally have learned something about Donald Trump — if they hope to beat him, they must get down in the gutter alongside him.
    


            Party leaders in powerhouse blue states on Monday vowed to emulate the president's methods to create new Democratic-friendly seats in the House of Representatives in response to his bid to carve out five new GOP districts in Texas.
    


            Their promises came as they celebrated Democratic Texas state lawmakers who suddenly became the fresh faces of the anti-Trump resistance after facing arrest warrants for fleeing the state in an exodus that ground a special legislative session called by the president's allies to a halt.
    


            This all might look like yet another twist in a generationslong struggle by both parties to gerrymander districts to get a leg up in elections. And some voters' eyes might glaze over at what seems like an internal Texas tussle.
    


            But the fight has profound national implications.
    


            In the short term, the House of Representatives — which Democrats hope to win back in midterm elections next year to rein in Trump's presidency — could be at stake. Democrats currently need a net gain of three seats to take the majority. If the Texas plan passes without a response by another state, they will need eight. That could dash their goal of imposing a clamp on Trump's runaway presidency.
    


            In the medium term, the Texas redistricting fight must be seen against the backdrop of a fraught political age.
    


            There are growing signs American democracy is fraying. Republicans will argue, correctly, that Democrats have mounted their own egregious redistricting schemes in states such as Illinois and Maryland. But the instigator of the effort to make the Texas congressional delegation even redder was a president who already has a dark record of trying to subvert the verdict of voters.
    


            Longer term, the national political fight that has erupted over Texas looks almost certain to further erode the checks and balances of democracy, however it ends. If both parties now simply go all-out in a national gerrymandering frenzy, they will produce a House of Representatives where it will be even more difficult for incumbents to lose their seats and that will make meaningful political change even harder.
    


            If nothing else, the furor demonstrates the imperative of winning power and forging transformational change before the opportunity is lost.
    


            Republicans over the last decade have built an unassailable conservative Supreme Court majority that enabled GOP redistricting efforts based on race, including in Texas. And they've elected and supported a president with an expansive and constitutionally questionable thirst for imposing his own personal power that has shattered most political norms. Most presidents would not be as blatant in Trump in trying to change the electoral battlefield.
    


            Over the same period, Democrats failed to bolster ranks of liberals on the Supreme Court — for instance, by not persuading late Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to retire when a liberal replacement could be confirmed while the party controlled the presidency and the Senate. In 2024, Democrats initially backed an aging and unpopular President Joe Biden, despite warnings that his candidacy could open the door again to Trump and his anti-democratic project.
    


            This loss of power has been disastrous to progressive aspirations and to protecting the liberal victories of the last 50 years, including the nationwide constitutional right to abortion.
    


            Some top Democrats see the Texas redistricting showdown as a moment for their party to show more ruthlessness.
    


            “We are at war,” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said Monday, alongside several exiled Texas lawmakers, warning that Democrats should forget independent redistricting panels intended to draw fairer maps that represent a complex electorate. “The playing field has changed dramatically, and shame on us if we ignore that fact and cling tight to the vestiges of the past,” Hochul said. “That era is over. Donald Trump eliminated that forever,” she said.
    


            California Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled a plan for a mid-decade redistricting in his state to match the one underway in deep-red Texas. His proposal would come before voters in November — the latest skirmish in a long-running ideological feud between the two states. But it will only be triggered if Texas moves ahead with its own plan. Newsom said he still favored a national independent districting body, but warned that Democrats needed to respond to the GOP's hardline tactics.
    


            “Things have changed. Facts have changed. So we must change,” Newsom said. “We have got to think anew. We have got to act anew. And we are reacting to the change — they have triggered this response, and we are not going to roll over.”
    


            Potential 2028 Democratic primary candidates, including Newsom and Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois — who has also rushed to back the Democratic Texas lawmakers — have compelling personal interests in joining the fight. In two years, candidates will be asked on a debate stage what they did in the battle over Texas.
    


            But they're also seeking to revive a national party pummeled by Trump, which lacks leadership and has left its supporters listless. Grassroots progressives have been pining for someone, anyone, to show some stomach for the fight — even though Democrats lack any power in Washington to meaningfully hurt the president.
    


            The Texas uproar also coincides with multiple examples of Trump's widening authoritarianism, following his cowing of Congress, crushing of constraints within the federal government, and co-option of the Justice Department and some intelligence services into instruments of his whims. On that score, a source told CNN on Monday that Attorney General Pam Bondi has ordered prosecutors to launch a grand jury investigation into Obama administration officials over the Russia investigation.
    


            Given all this, if the Democrats don't fight back now, when will they ever fight?
    


            As CNN's Eric Bradner reported Monday, the proposed new GOP maps could force two prominent Democratic lawmakers, Reps. Greg Casar and Lloyd Doggett, into a primary against one another. They'd also merge two other seats and make two south Texas seats held by Democrats more Republican-leaning.
    


            While the Democrats made a statement by leaving Texas, their chances of ultimately prevailing seem thin, given the financial pressure of $500 daily fines for non-attendance and their interrupted livelihoods when they are away. And Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a key Trump ally, could call further special sessions later in the year.
    


            This is why some Democrats believe that if they can threaten Republican seats in their own states, they might convince House Speaker Mike Johnson to call off his allies in Austin. “Perhaps the Republican members of Congress here in New York could say to their Republican colleagues in Texas — ‘Hey, slow down on this because this could affect us,'” Carl Heastie, the speaker of the New York State Assembly, said.
    


            This seems a long shot, however, not least because there are considerable impediments in New York to a swift redrawing of maps. Hochul admitted that that even if everything goes smoothly, redistricting that would bypass New York's current nonpartisan commission could only be in place for the 2028 election — a lifetime away in Trump-era politics. And attempts by Democratic states to rebalance electoral maps might convince more GOP bastions to do the same.
    


            So, if an outside Texas strategy is unlikely to force the Texas Republicans to back down, why are Democrats pursuing it?
    


            This may be one of those times in politics when a party can win something by losing.
    


            Democrats might not only engage their demoralized partisans by taking the fight to Trump on Texas; they can use the battle to organize and focus their message as they grapple for traction after a grim political year.
    


            Defending democracy might be a desirable project in the abstract. But in the past, especially when Biden was warning that Trump imperiled America's “soul,” the idea felt distant from voters infuriated by high grocery prices and the cost of housing. And impassioned warnings from Democratic leadership about how Trump would threaten democracy didn't stop his reelection.
    


            Hochul and other Democrats seemed on Monday to be reaching for a way to connect the democracy question to more immediate voter concerns through the prism of the Texas power grab. She argued that stopping such schemes was critical to charting a path back to power so Democrats could reverse Trump's policies on tariffs and deportations.
    


            That will require a toughening of the Democratic approach, one that underscores the distance traveled since former first lady Michelle Obama warned that when Republicans like Trump go low, “we go high.”
    


            “With all respect to the good governance groups, politics is a political process,” Hochul said, dismissing “purity tests” that would make electoral maps fair to everyone involved through nonpartisan commissions.
    


            “If Republicans win the legislature, they can have at it. But until then, we are in charge, and we are sick and tired of being pushed around.”

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — A new Arkansas law requiring public classrooms to display the Ten Commandments cannot be enforced in a handful of the state's largest school districts where parents brought challenges on the grounds that it violates the separation of church and state, a federal judge ruled Monday.

But the ruling by U.S. District Judge Timothy L. Brooks, an appointee of former President Obama, only narrowly applied to four of the state's 237 districts. That left the impact of the decision limited as thousands of Arkansas students prepared to return to class this month.

The injunction is the latest legal turn in a widening push in Republican-led states to give religion a bigger presence in public schools. Texas and Louisiana have passed similar laws requiring classrooms to display the Ten Commandments and the issue is expected to eventually reach the U.S. Supreme Court.

“Why would Arkansas pass an obviously unconstitutional law?” Brooks wrote in his 35-page ruling. “Most likely because the state is part of a coordinated strategy among several states to inject Christian religious doctrine into public-school classrooms.”

The Arkansas law, signed earlier this year by Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, takes effect Tuesday and requires the Ten Commandments to be prominently displayed in public school classrooms and libraries. The suit was filed on behalf of the families by the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for the Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation.




“The court saw through this attempt to impose religious doctrine in public schools and upheld every student's right to learn free from government-imposed faith,” John L. Williams, legal director of ACLU of Arkansas said in a statement. “We're proud to stand with our clients — families of many different backgrounds — who simply want their kids to get an education.”

Attorney General Tim Griffin, whose office defended the law, said he was reviewing the decision and assessing legal options. 

The lawsuit says the requirement violates the families' constitutional rights and pressures students into observing a religion favored by the state.

It was not immediately clear if the groups would seek an broader block of the law beyond the four districts. ACLU of Arkansas Executive Director Holly Bailey said through a spokesperson that “it is clear from this order and long established law that all should refrain from posting” the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms.

Similar requirements enacted in Texas and Louisiana are also being challenged in court. A group of families and faith leaders filed a lawsuit seeking to block Texas' requirements days after it was signed into law.

Last month in Louisiana — the first state that mandated the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms — a panel of three appellate judges ruled that the law was unconstitutional.

The ruling marked a major win for civil liberties groups who say the law violates the separation of church and state. But the legal battle is likely far from over.

Many, including Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, expect the case to eventually reach the U.S. Supreme Court. Most recently, Murrill filed a petition seeking the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit's review in the matter.

Dramatic video shows rescuers using 100-foot line to hoist pair from secluded shoreline near Elephant Rock (Credit: Sonoma County Sheriffs Office and Marin County Fire Department)

Dramatic video captures the moment two hikers were rescued after becoming stranded on a secluded beach near one of Point Reyes National Seashore's most dangerous hazards.

The pair became trapped near Elephant Rock when rising tides cut off their only way out, according to a social media update from the Sonoma County Sheriff's Office.

After spending several hours in the area, the hikers realized they were stuck and called emergency services, department spokesperson Emily Fuller said in a statement to SFGATE.

Due to the lack of safe access by land or sea, a helicopter crew was dispatched to carry out the rescue. Using a 100-foot line, responders hoisted the hikers from the beach after securing them in a "hot seat," a harness designed for aerial rescues.

The hikers were then flown to the Marin County Fire Department, the sheriff's office confirmed. Fortunately, no injuries were reported.

Video of the rescue shows the dramatic scene as a rescuer descends to the rocky shoreline, then lifts off with both hikers suspended above the water.

While Point Reyes is a popular destination for hiking and coastal exploration, it poses serious risks, the National Park Service warns.

"The ocean is among the most dangerous features at Point Reyes," the park's website notes.

Visitors are cautioned about dangers such as powerful surf, unexpected "sneaker" waves, strong currents, polluted water, cold temperatures and hidden hot coals. There are no lifeguards, and the area features challenging terrain, including unstable cliffs and bluffs.

Fuller emphasized that some beach areas can become "completely locked in" once the tide rises, leaving no safe path out. She advised that anyone exploring the coastline should check tide charts and carry a reliable way to call for help.

"Having access to emergency communication is crucial," she added. "Some parts of the coastline don't have cell service, so carrying a satellite communication device like a Garmin inReach could be a lifesaver."

Rep. Mike Flood (R-NE) was given a poor reception at a town hall after saying he voted to cut SNAP programs because the United States doesn't have “unlimited money.”

Flood held a town hall in Lincoln, Nebraska, that followed a pattern of other recent Republican town halls in getting taken over by hostile citizens. At one point, a crowd member took the microphone and asked Flood why he “cut SNAP and healthcare research.”

“We do not have unlimited money in the United States,” he answered after a brief pause, triggering loud boos from much of the audience.

Flood went more into depth with another answer, attempting to explain the cuts and why he voted for them.

“It talks about two big changes to the Medicaid program,” he said, referring to the healthcare reforms instituted by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. “One of those changes is that if you are able to work and you are able-bodied, you have to work. If you choose not to work, you do not get free healthcare.”

The audience was heckling Flood throughout his answer, then erupted in a crescendo of boos at his conclusion.

“OK, OK, so here's a question,” he continued. “Do you think that people who are 28 years old that can work and refuse to work should get free healthcare?”

The crowd loudly responded mostly in the affirmative.

“I don't think the majority of Nebraskans agree with you,” Flood responded.

Republicans have been plagued by raucous town halls for months, with hecklers usually targeting cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency or cuts made through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The displays caused House Republicans to cut back on town halls.

Defenders have argued that the harsh displays aren't organic and that Democratic activists purposefully target the events to make Republicans look bad, with some outlets and Republican leaders alleging that liberal groups infiltrated Republican town halls to give the appearance of organic dissent.

In a May appearance on Fox News's Hannity, Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY), who was given similar treatment, pointed out that a woman escorted out of his town hall by police was an activist with a history of inflammatory statements.

“I've done over 50 town hall meetings and mobile office hours in my district since taking office back in 2023. I have no problem doing them,” he said. “This is part of democracy. People have a right to come and ask their representatives questions. But the fact is, these folks don't want to hear answers. They don't want to know what I have to say or why I may vote the way I vote on a certain issue. They want to come and protest.”

“They want to come and try to silence debate and discussion, and the fact is we have them on video just a week ago talking about what they're going to do to interrupt, boo, hiss, jeer, yell, scream, stomp their feet, and storm out, and so that's exactly what they've done,” Lawler added.

Flood's Monday town hall was a near repeat of his last town hall in March, which was effectively shut down due to heckling.

            Rep. Mike Flood faced a barrage of criticism at a packed town hall in Lincoln, Nebraska, Monday evening as audience members repeatedly confronted him over his support for President Donald Trump's “big, beautiful bill,” immigration policy and what they described as threats to democracy.
    


            It didn't take long for those gathered for the meeting at the University of Nebraska to erupt in chants of “tax the rich,” while the Republican congressman attempted to defend his decision to vote for the the president's massive agenda.
    


            “I truly believe that this bill will allow America to experience growth, that it will allow our communities to thrive, that it will spark our economy, that it will help farmers and ranchers, that it will take care of the vulnerable. And more than anything, I truly believe this bill protects Medicaid for the future,” Flood said, speaking over outbursts from the crowd.
    


            Flood, one of few members of his party to hold in-person events during spring's congressional recess as the GOP looked to avoid blowback from the president's DOGE initiative, heeded the National Republican Congressional Committee's updated guidance to focus this August district work period on selling Trump's agenda.
    


            “With the One Big Beautiful Bill signed into law just a few weeks ago, this is a critical opportunity to continue to define how this legislation will help every voter and push back on Democrat fearmongering,” the memo from the NRCC, the House GOP's campaign arm, stated.
    


            But as he did earlier this year, Flood met a largely hostile crowd. The congressman was pressed on everything from the president's sweeping tax and spending cuts legislation to veterans' issues, Medicaid funding and the war in Gaza during a wide-ranging question-and-answer period – all against a backdrop of near-constant heckling, chants and booing from the audience.
    


            Still, the he maintained his position on the president's domestic agenda package. “Is every bill perfect? No, but I supported this bill,” he told the crowd.
    


            In one tense back-and-forth in Nebraska, an audience member confronted Flood about government spending and authoritarianism.
    


            “My question is fiscal,” the attendee began, referencing reports that the makeshift immigration detention facility in Florida dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” is expected to cost $450 million to operate for a single year.
    


            “How much does it cost for fascism? How much do the taxpayers have to pay for a fascist country?” the attendee asked, as the crowd erupted in applause.
    


            Flood responded, “Americans went to the polls in November, and they had a choice between a Democratic candidate that had an open border, no enforcement, fentanyl, drugs, human trafficking, and they had a choice between that and a candidate that said close the border, get illegal immigrants out of our country, stop the fentanyl, stop the human trafficking, stop the drugs, stop the crime, stop the violence. That's what Americans voted for.”
    


            “Americans voted for a border that is secure, and I support the president enforcing our immigration laws, which, by the way, were written by Congress.”
    


            The audience appeared to grow increasingly agitated, with continued shouts hurled at the congressman.
    


            Another member from the audience accused Flood of staying silent in the face of what they called a “fascist machine,” referring to the conservative blueprint Project 2025. “You said in Seward that you were not a fascist,” the person said. “But your complicity says otherwise.”
    


            “Fascists don't hold town halls with open question-and-answer series,” he responded. The audience again booed.
    


            Despite his efforts to present the recently passed budget bill – which one constituent called “the big, ugly bill” – as a solution for Medicaid funding and rural hospitals, audience members attacked Flood over cuts to SNAP benefits, veterans' programs and health care access.
    


            Veterans in the audience criticized him for backing a law they said threatens benefits for those who served. “How can you stand a bill that erodes the very services that people like me, my family, and younger vets rely on?” one Marine Corps veteran asked.
    


            Flood said he had personally met with the VA secretary and promised improvements to the system but offered no specifics.
    


            The Nebraska lawmaker also fielded a question on the Jeffrey Epstein files – a topic that has consumed Capitol Hill in recent weeks but yielded limited exchanges so far in the early public town halls during lawmakers' break from Washington.
    


            Read aloud by an aide at the event, the written question posed: “Why are you covering up the Epstein files?” It was met with raucous applause from the audience.
    


            Flood responded: “Let's be very clear – at the next pro forma session of the Congress, you will find my name as a sponsor on a resolution from the House Rules Committee to release the Epstein files to protect the victims and not re-victimize them again.”
    


            He added that he supports Congress' subpoena of Epstein's former associate Ghislaine Maxwell for a deposition, and declard: “I am for the release of those records.”
    


            The topic also arose at a Democrat's town hall Monday night in Benton Harbor, Michigan, where Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin made a case against presidential pardon power.
    


            Asked by an audience member if she thinks the presidential pardon power should be limited, Slotkin called it “a quirk of history that does not make sense in America for either party, for any reason.”
    


            “To me, it is just a strange thing that the president of the United States has a few extra chits in their pocket to give away,” she continued, adding that she doesn't think people who are wrongly imprisoned should be in jail.
    


            As pressure grows on the Trump administration to release more information related to the Epstein case, the president hasn't ruled out a pardon for Maxwell, who met recently with a top Justice Department official and also was transferred to a lower security prison camp from where she was previously being held.
    


            Asked last week if clemency was on the table in exchange for Maxwell's testimony, Trump said, “I'm allowed to do it, but nobody's asked me to do it. I know nothing about it. I don't know anything about the case, but I know I have the right to do it.”
    


            Slotkin expressed wariness that Trump is talking about pardon for Maxwell “in year one of his presidency, not the end of his presidency, which is what you typically see.”
    


            “Look, I thought it was controversial with President Biden, too. It was controversial with everyone that Obama or Clinton or Bush did. So to me, it's just this weird kind of literally get out of jail free card that I just think muddies the waters,” she said.
    


            “When you have a president who has a deep, deep problem with corruption, it just can be taken to such a dangerous degree that he's letting out pedophiles and criminals, violent people because he's paying back favors to others. I just can't support that,” she continued.
    


            The Michigan senator, who delivered what she called her “economic war plan for America” and argued against the massive domestic policy bill that Trump signed into law July 4, addressed another issue that looms large for lawmakers when they return to DC in a matter of weeks: government funding.
    


            As Democrats weigh how to approach negotiations with Republicans to keep the government funded past the September 30 deadline, Slotkin, who did not vote for the GOP-led bill to avert a shutdown earlier this year, said she would not be open to any proposal without a commitment by Republicans to restore some of the health care-related funding they have voted to slash.
    


            “For me, for my vote, for my willingness to join in that negotiation, you're going to have to restore something of Americans' health care in order to get me back on that team,” she said.
    


            In Washington state, Democratic Rep. Adam Smith's town hall was abruptly canceled Monday evening amid protests, with local police saying they arrested three people and charged them with trespassing.
    


            Before Smith took the stage, TVW – Washington state's public affairs network, which was broadcasting the town hall – announced on its website, “Town hall cancelled mid-meeting due to protests.”
    


            “Today's town hall was intentionally disrupted to attempt to silence a democratic conversation between a Representative and his constituents. This behavior is unacceptable,” Smith later posted on social media. “One of my staff members was physically assaulted during the chaos – an act that crosses every line of civil discourse.”
    


            A Renton Police Department spokesperson said three protesters were arrested and charged with trespassing on the Renton Technical College in Renton, Washington, where the meeting was being held.
    


            The police spokesperson, Meeghan Black, said she was not aware of any assault on a member of the congressman's staff and no one was charged with assault.
    


            Black told CNN that nine protestors initially entered the venue and started loudly protesting, three of whom walked on stage and were subsequently arrested.

During an address at Fort Bragg on Tuesday, President Trump announced that several Army base titles would be restored to their original names after changes made during the Biden administration.

The National Park Service announced Monday that it will be restoring and reinstating a statue of Confederate General Albert Pike. 

"The National Park Service announced today that it will restore and reinstall the bronze statue of Albert Pike, which was toppled and vandalized during riots in June 2020," the Monday announcement from the National Park Service read. 

"The restoration aligns with federal responsibilities under historic preservation law as well as recent executive orders to beautify the nation's capital and re-instate pre-existing statues," it added.

On June 19, 2020, also known as Juneteenth, the day that recognizes the end of slavery in the United States, protesters toppled the statue of Pike and set it on fire. 

Pike, who was a Confederate general in the Civil War, also served as an associate justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court.

The vandalization occurred during the anti-racism riots that erupted across the country after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

The announcement pointed to President Donald Trump's executive orders on "Making the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful," and "Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History."

The orders call for the protection of American monuments, preservation of American history and heritage, and combating the "revisionist movement."

In a statement to Fox News Digital, White House official Lindsey Halligan said, "Thank you to the National Park Service for announcing the restoration of the Albert Pike statute after it was unlawfully toppled and vandalized."

Halligan added, "Erected in 1901 and funded entirely by private Masonic organizations, the statue stood for over a century as a tribute to Pike's contributions as a scholar and Masonic leader. Such action aligns with President Trump's Executive Order 14253, which calls for reinstating monuments removed under ideological pressure. It's encouraging to see our National Park Service stand up for historical preservation, due process, and the rule of law."

Acting NASA administrator Sean Duffy explains how the agency's Artemis program aims to return Americans to the Moon on 'Hannity.'

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy will reportedly announce plans this week to build a nuclear reactor on the moon, according to media reports. 

NASA has had discussions about the building of a reactor on the lunar surface, but Duffy's directive gives a more definitive timeline and expedites the process. Duffy also serves as the interim administrator of the space agency. 

"Fission surface power (FSP) is both an essential and sustainable segment of the lunar and Mars power architectures for future human space exploration missions," the directive states. "To properly advance this critical technology to be able to support a future lunar economy, high power energy generation on Mars, and to strengthen our national security in space, it is imperative the agency move quickly."

China and Russia have announced on several occasions a joint effort to place a reactor on the moon by the mid-2030s, NASA said. If successful, that would potentially result in the declaration of a "keep-out zone," which could inhibit the United States from establishing a presence there. 

"There are very specific areas of the moon that are critical that who gets there first gets to plant their flag," Duffy recently said on "Hannity." "We know the Chinese want to get there as well, so speed is of the essence."

The move means that NASA will continue to have input in nuclear development, despite the Pentagon's recent cancellation of a joint program on nuclear-powered rocket engines.

The agency will be required to solicit proposals for a 100 kilowatt nuclear reactor to launch by 2030, around the time China intends to put a man on the moon, within 60 days of the directive. 

Duffy spoke with Fox News about how NASA's Artemis program aims to return Americans to the Moon.

"We're going to set up a base camp," Duffy said. "And what we learn on the moon is going to take us to Mars."

Duffy also issued another directive to quickly replace the International Space Station, a priority for NASA. The agency plans to award at least two companies, preferably three of four, a contract within six months of the agency's request for proposals. 

SNUB OF MUSK'S NASA NOMINEE ALLY PRECEDED SUDDEN 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' CRITICISM, TRUMP FEUD

In April, China launched three astronauts into space to begin a six-month-long mission aboard the Tiangong space station, which translates to Heavenly Palace.

China built its own space station after it was excluded from the International Space Station, amid U.S. concerns over the Chinese space programs' ties with the People's Liberation Army, the military branch of the ruling Communist Party.

NASA has increasingly factored into the Trump administration's national defense, innovation, and economic agenda.

Trump announced Duffy to serve as interim administrator of NASA in July as withdrawing the nomination of Jared Isaacman in May.

Isaacman, a billionaire private astronaut and longtime associate of Elon Musk, was nominated by Trump in December 2024 but faced mounting scrutiny over ties to Musk and SpaceX, which some officials viewed as a conflict of interest.

The International Space Station was launched into orbit in 1998. At the time, the U.S. agreed to the peaceful use of the orbital laboratory with several other countries, including Russia, Japan, Canada and 11 European countries. 

China was left out of the plan.

OpenAI on Tuesday released two open-weight language models for the first time since it rolled out GPT-2 in 2019.

The text-only models are called gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b, and are designed to serve as lower-cost options that developers, researchers and companies can easily run and customize, OpenAI said.

An artificial intelligence model is considered open weight if its parameters, or the elements that improve its outputs and predictions during training, are publicly available. Open-weight models can offer transparency and control, but they are different from open-source models, whose full source code becomes available for people to use and modify.

Several other tech companies, including Meta, Microsoft-backed Mistral AI and the Chinese startup DeepSeek, have also released open-weight models in recent years.

"It's been exciting to see an ecosystem develop, and we are excited to contribute to that and really push the frontier and then see what happens from there," OpenAI President Greg Brockman told reporters during a briefing.

The company collaborated with Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Cerebras, and Groq to ensure the models will work well on a variety of chips.

"OpenAI showed the world what could be built on Nvidia AI — and now they're advancing innovation in open-source software," Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement.

The release of OpenAI's open weight models has been highly anticipated, in part because the company repeatedly delayed the launch.

In a post on X in July, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company needed more time to "run additional safety tests and review high-risk areas." That came after a separate post weeks earlier, where Altman said the models would not be released in June.

OpenAI said Tuesday that it carried out extensive safety training and testing on its open-weight models.

It filtered out harmful chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear data during pre-training, and it mimicked how bad actors could try to fine-tune the models for malicious purposes. Through this testing, OpenAI said it determined that maliciously fine-tuned models were not able to reach the "high capability" threshold in its Preparedness Framework, which is its method for measuring and protecting against harm.

The company also worked with three independent expert groups who provided feedback on its malicious fine-tuning evaluation, OpenAI said.

OpenAI said people can download the weights for gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b on platforms like Hugging Face and GitHub under an Apache 2.0 license. The models will be available to run on PCs through programs such as LM Studio and Ollama. Cloud providers Amazon, Baseten and Microsoft are also making the models available.

Both models can handle advanced reasoning, tool use and chain‑of‑thought processing, and are designed to run anywhere — from consumer hardware to the cloud to on-device applications.

Users can run gpt-oss-20b on a laptop, for instance, and use it as a personal assistant that can search through files and write, OpenAI said.

"We're excited to make this model, the result of billions of dollars of research, available to the world to get AI into the hands of the most people possible," Altman said in a statement Tuesday.

The U.S. should deploy a small nuclear power plant to the surface of the moon before China and Russia are able to do so, the interim head of NASA has told the space agency's staff.

NASA should be ready to launch a reactor to the lunar surface by the first quarter of fiscal year 2030, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who is serving as the space agency's acting administrator, said in a directive to NASA dated July 31. This would work out to late 2029.

China and Russia are aiming to deploy a reactor to the moon by the mid-2030s to power a joint base, officials in Moscow and Beijing have said. The first country to deploy a reactor on the moon "could potentially declare a keep-out zone which would significantly inhibit the United States from establishing a planned Artemis presence if not there first," Duffy warned NASA. The Artemis mission is NASA's lunar exploration program, which was first announced in 2017.

NASA should issue a request for proposals to industry within 60 days, according to Duffy's directive. The reactor should be able to generate 100 kilowatts of electricity at a minimum, according to the directive. It would be transported aboard a heavy class lander with a payload of 15 metric tons.

A reactor without a 100-kilowatt output could power about 80 U.S. homes. By contrast, the average nuclear reactor in the U.S. fleet can power more than 700,000 homes.

The NASA program, called Fission Surface Power, will rely on microreactor technology, according to Duffy's directive. But no microreactor has been licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, let alone built in the U.S. President Donald Trump issued a series of executive orders in May that aim to expedite the commercialization of small nuclear reactors.

Duffy's ambitious directive comes as the Trump administration has proposed steep cuts to NASA's budget. The space agency also remains without a Senate-confirmed leader. Trump named Duffy as acting administrator after pulling his original nominee in May amid a feud with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk.

Politico first reported Duffy's plans to launch a nuclear reactor to the moon.

The rift between Moscow and Washington looks set to deepen after U.S. President Donald Trump said Tuesday that Russia's economy "stinks" and that lower oil prices will hammer President Vladimir Putin's oil-funded war machine.

"Putin will stop killing people if you get energy down another $10 a barrel. He's going to have no choice because his economy stinks," the president told CNBC's "Squawk Box."

The comments come after relations between Moscow and Washington, which remained cordial at the start of Trump's second term in office despite the ongoing war, soured in recent weeks.

Trump has appeared to lose patience with Putin given Russia's apparent reluctance to pursue a ceasefire or peace deal with Ukraine. Last Monday, the president said he was cutting from 50 days to less than two weeks his deadline for Putin to reach a peace deal with Ukraine or face big "secondary tariffs" on Moscow's trade partners.

That prompted former Russian President and high-ranking Russian official Dmitry Medvedev to respond on social media that each new ultimatum that Trump makes about Russia to force an end to its war on Ukraine "is a threat and a step towards war."

"Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country," Medvedev wrote on X. Trump said on Friday said that he had ordered two nuclear submarines "to be positioned in the appropriate regions" in response to Medvedev's comments.

Russia, one of the world's top oil exporters, has used revenues from oil exports to largely fund its war machine in Ukraine, which it invaded in 2022. Ukraine's Western partners have used sanctions and restrictions to try to stifle those revenues, but countries like India and China have continued to buy discounted Russian crude.

This has infuriated Trump and he has, in the last few days, threatened India with steep tariffs if it does not stop buying Russian oil. The president threatened a 25% duty on Indian exports, as well as an unspecified "penalty" last week, accusing New Delhi of buying discounted Russian oil and "selling it on the Open Market for big profits."

On Tuesday, Trump told CNBC that the tariff threshold could be hiked above 25% in the next 24 hours.

"India has not been a good trading partner ... so we settled on 25%, but I think I'm going to raise that very substantially over the next 24 hours, because they're buying Russian oil, they're fueling the war machine, and if they're going to do that, I'm not going to be happy," Trump said.

Russia earlier on Tuesday weighed into the spat, with the Kremlin saying India was free to choose its own trading partners and that Trump's tariff threats were "attempts to force countries to stop trade relations with Russia."

"We do not consider such statements to be legitimate," Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov continued, speaking to reporters Tuesday.

"We believe that sovereign countries should have, and have the right to choose their own trade partners, partners in trade and economic cooperation. And to choose those trade and economic cooperation regimes that are in the interests of a particular country."

Oil prices declined to around the mid-$65 a barrel mark on Tuesday as traders assessed the announcement by OPEC and its oil-producing allies on Sunday that they would hike output, amid potential weaker global demand.

After Trump's comments on Tuesday, Brent crude futures were down 83 cents, or 1.2%, to $67.92 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude slipped 87 cents to $65.41.

Meanwhile, dark clouds certainly appear to be gathering on the horizon when it comes to Russia's war-focused economy. It has labored under the weight of international sanctions as well as homegrown pressures, also largely resulting from war, such as rampant inflation and high food and production costs that even Putin described as "alarming." Russia's Economic Development Ministry also predicts that economic growth will slow from 4.3% in 2024 to 2.5% this year.

Russia's finance ministry said in April that it expects 24% lower revenues from oil and gas this year, compared to earlier estimates, and lowered its oil price forecast from $69.7 to $56 per barrel. The ministry also raised the 2025 budget deficit estimate to 1.7% of GDP, from a previous forecast of 0.5%.

In this article

President Donald Trump said Tuesday that the two largest American banks previously rejected him as a customer, reviving claims that conservative clients were being unfairly denied accounts.

Trump told CNBC's "Squawk Box" in a wide-ranging interview that JPMorgan Chase informed him he had 20 days to move "hundreds of millions of dollars in cash" to another bank. He didn't say when this happened.

The president said he then approached Bank of America to "deposit a billion dollars-plus" and was told the bank couldn't provide him an account, Trump said.

"[Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan] said, 'We can't do it,'" Trump said. "So I went to another one, another one, another one. I ended up going to small banks all over the place. I mean, I was putting $10 million here, $10 million there."

Shares of the two banks dipped more than 1% in afternoon trading.

Some conservatives, crypto executives and religious organizations have claimed to be unfairly "de-banked" by large U.S. financial institutions. Banks generally deny rejecting clientele based on political or religious beliefs, but say they are required to comply with federal laws aimed at preventing financial crimes, including the 1970 Bank Secrecy Act, and have faced regulatory pressure related to crypto and other industries that are considered higher risk for money laundering or fraud.

The topic came up again in January, when Trump accused Moynihan of denying services to conservative customers.

The issue puts banks in a bind; the companies risk further angering the president as he airs grievances that resonate with his supporters. At the same time, banks have been a major beneficiary of the Trump administration's efforts to roll back Biden-era regulatory rules across a wide swath of financial activities.

The Trump administration is preparing an executive order that threatens the industry with fines if they drop customers on political grounds, The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. A draft version of the order asks regulators to investigate whether banks violated laws, according to the Journal.

A trade group for big banks said that "regulatory overreach" was the root cause of the de-banking problem.

"Banking agencies have already taken steps to address issues like reputational risk, and we're hopeful that any forthcoming executive order will reinforce this progress by directing regulators to confront the flawed regulatory framework that gave rise to these concerns," the Bank Policy Institute told CNBC.

While Trump on Tuesday mentioned his business, likely referring to his real estate and hospitality conglomerate, it wasn't clear if the events he described were in reference to personal or business accounts, or both.

Trump said that he believes banks rejected him and his supporters because regulators during the Biden administration applied pressure to the companies.

In a March lawsuit filed against Capital One, the president's company alleged that the bank improperly closed more than 300 accounts a few months after the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol. The bank denied the accusations.

JPMorgan denied targeting conservatives or Trump supporters for de-banking.

"We don't close accounts for political reasons, and we agree with President Trump that regulatory change is desperately needed," a JPMorgan spokeswoman said Tuesday. "We commend the White House for addressing this issue and look forward to working with them to get this right."

In a broadcast interview later Tuesday, Moynihan told CNBC that Trump was "after the right thing" in terms of criticizing an industry that is beholden to a web of regulations.

"We bank everybody, but the reality is, we want to make sure that the rules and regulations don't cause decisions we make that then are looked at in the aftermath" and questioned, Moynihan said.

President Donald Trump told CNBC on Tuesday that he has narrowed the field of potential future Federal Reserve chairs to four candidates, a list that does not include Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.

While the president did not disclose who is in contention, he revealed that Bessent, previously considered a leading candidate, has taken himself out of contention.

"Well, I love Scott, but he wants to stay where he is," Trump said during a "Squawk Box" interview. "I asked him just last night, 'Is this something you want?' [Bessent said], 'Nope, I want to stay where I am. He actually said, 'I want to work with you.' It's such an honor. I said, 'That's very nice. I appreciate that.'"

The news follows Fed Governor Adriana Kugler's surprise announcement Friday that she is resigning effective this Friday. The move allows Trump to install another of his appointees to the Fed Board of Governors at a time when the White House is aggressively pushing the central bank to lower interest rates.

Among the likely candidates remaining are former Governor Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett, the National Economic Council director and a key Trump advisor. Both have advocated for lower rates. Fed Governor Christopher Waller also is thought to be in the running.

"Both Kevins are very good, and there are other people that are very good, too," Trump said, adding that Kugler's resignation "was a pleasant surprise."

Current Chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May 2026. He has been a frequent target of Trump's criticism, and there has been speculation that the president would name a "shadow chair" who could help undermine Powell until his term expires. Trump did not commit to taking that approach but conceded that it is "a possibility."

Trump nominated Powell for the Fed job in 2017, during his first term as president. The Senate then confirmed Powell the following February. Trump alleged Tuesday that Powell told him, "Sir, I'll keep interest rates so low. I'm a low interest rate person."

The Fed last week voted to hold its benchmark interest rate steady in a range between 4.25%-4.5%. Markets expect the Fed to approve its next cut in September. The central bank lowered its policy rate a full percentage point from September through December 2024, moves that Trump has said were politically motivated to help Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris.

When Nikesh Arora was named CEO of Palo Alto Networks in June 2018, the cybersecurity company was valued at about $19 billion and was taking on large networking vendors like Cisco and Juniper, which were building security into their products.

Seven years later, Palo Alto's market cap has expanded by sixfold, driven in part by an acquisition spree that's seen Arora spearhead more than 20 deals in an effort to create a one-stop shop for all things cybersecurity.

Arora's ambitions took a dramatic turn last week, when Palo Alto announced by far its biggest bet to date: the $25 billion purchase of Israeli identity security platform CyberArk.

Wall Street's reaction so far has been downbeat, with multiple analysts downgrading the stock, and the shares dropping 16% since news of the deal first leaked out last Tuesday.

Not only does CyberArk represent Palo Alto's heftiest deal in the 20 years since its founding, but it's the second-biggest U.S. tech acquisition announced in 2025, after Alphabet's $32 billion purchase of Wiz, another cloud security company from Israel.

Alphabet had become a more notable player in Palo Alto's universe even before the calendar turned. In the company's 2024 annual report published in October, Palo Alto named Alphabet as a competitor for the first time, listing it alongside Cisco and Microsoft as companies "that have acquired, or may acquire, security vendors and have the technical and financial resources to bring competitive solutions to the market." In 2023, Cisco paid $28 billion for Splunk, which focuses on data protection.

The era of cybersecurity megadeals coincides with a surge in the number of sophisticated cybercrimes tied to rapid advancements in artificial intelligence.

With CyberArk, Palo Alto is making a big splash in the identity management market, taking on the likes of Okta as well as Microsoft and IBM's HashiCorp. It also puts the company into further competition with CrowdStrike, the other pure-play security company that's topped $100 billion in market cap.

In an interview with CNBC soon after last week's announcement, Arora said CyberArk fits squarely into his company's focus on AI and, in this case, the complexities that come with granting permissions and access. Arora said that with M&A he looks for emerging trends, particularly when it involves technology that's at a crossroads.

"Our entire acquisition strategy, our organic product growth strategy, our selling strategy, has always been based on that approach," said Arora, 57, who's seen his personal wealth top $1 billion with the big run-up in the stock.

In CyberArk's earnings report last week, the company said revenue jumped 46% in the latest quarter to $328 million, equal to about 14% of Palo Alto revenue, based on the most recent report. Arora said in the conference call announcing the deal that he intends to work with CyberArk CEO Matt Cohen and Chairman Udi Mokady to "accelerate the pace of innovation."

"We look for great products, a team that can execute in the product, and we let them run it," Arora told CNBC. "This is going to be a different challenge, but we've done well 24 times, so I'm pretty confident that our team can handle this."

Most of Arora's acquisitions over the years have been of smaller startups. That includes a $400 million deal to buy Dig Security and the $625 million purchase of Talon Cyber Security in 2023. Last month, the company closed its takeover of Seattle-based startup Protect AI for an undisclosed amount.

Before joining Palo Alto, Arora spent a decade at Google, including his last three years there as chief business officer. Some analysts called him the "acting CEO," due to his lengthy roster of responsibilities, such as strategic partnerships and navigating the needs of advertisers.

In 2014, Arora left Google to join SoftBank as head of its internet and media operations business and vice chairman of the overall company. At SoftBank, Arora had been tapped as the likely successor to visionary founder and CEO Masayoshi Son. But less than two years after taking the job, Arora resigned. As he explained it, Son told him he was going to keep running the show for another five to 10 years.

Roughly 10 months before leaving SoftBank, Arora said he was buying more than $480 million worth of stock in the Japanese conglomerate, which he said involved taking an "enormous risk" reflecting his confidence "about the future" of the company.

While that's all firmly in the past, Arora said that over the years, he's "scavenged" different leadership qualities from each of his mentors, including an appetite for risk from Son.

"It's about finding role models for certain behaviors and wanting to understand what makes them really successful," he said. "That's my model."

Investors weren't completely sold on Arora when he joined Palo Alto in 2018, said Joseph Gallo, an analyst at Jefferies. He was a skilled and experienced businessman but some worried that he hadn't created a notable product or founded a company like many of his industry peers, said Gallo, who recommends buying Palo Alto shares.

Arora made up for it with an ability to spot trends ahead of the curve, Gallo said. That included investing aggressively in a transition from on-premises technology to the cloud and then recognizing early the power of AI.

In his first few years at the company, Arora made numerous acquisitions for a total of about $3 billion, helping Palo Alto penetrate the cloud security space as more businesses were moving their workloads to Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google's cloud.

"Every company wishes they were in Palo Alto shoes, where they could actually offer all these different products," said Andrew Nowinski, an analyst at Wells Fargo who has a buy recommendation on the stock. "It's very difficult. You're not going to see many vendors like Palo Alto."

With its expansion into identity management, Palo Alto is going big in a space that's viewed by experts as a key spending area for IT in the coming years.

"You can't slow down your spending because the hackers aren't slowing down," Nowinski said. "That's your growth driver."

Ofer Schreiber, senior partner and head of YL Ventures' Israel office, said Palo Alto has helped take an extremely fragmented market, consisting of lots of point solutions, and created a centralized vendor for clients.

According to a joint report from IBM and Palo Alto published in January, the average organization uses 83 different security products from 29 separate companies.

"From the customer's perspective, it's much more convenient dealing with with one vendor with multiple products tightly integrated," Schreiber said. "You can't really be just a one-product company."

Still, Arora is in untested waters with CyberArk.

Palo Alto's shares dropped on all five days following the announcement of the deal. It's the first time at Palo Alto that Arora has led a multibillion-dollar purchase, and he now faces the execution challenges of integrating thousands of new employees.

Analysts at KeyBanc lowered their rating to the equivalent of hold from buy, due partly to concerns about a lack of "meaningful synergies" in the product offerings and a view that customers would prefer an "independent vendor solely focused on identity."

But TD Cowen's Shaul Eyal still recommends buying the shares. He said that what's made Arora successful is his "relentless focus on execution" and his strategy of betting on sizeable markets where Palo Alto can quickly scale and become the leader or runner-up.

That, and his ability to bundle.

"It's all about upsell," Eyal said. "Every other second, third, fourth module you're selling to an existing customer flows straight to the bottom line."

Yum Brands on Tuesday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that missed analysts' expectations as Pizza Hut and KFC reported U.S. same-store sales declines.

Here's what the company reported for the period ended June 30 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Yum reported second-quarter net income of $374 million, or $1.33 per share, up from $367 million, or $1.28 per share, a year earlier.

Excluding refranchising gains and other items, the company earned $1.44 per share.

Net sales climbed 10% to $1.93 billion. Digital transactions, which include mobile app, delivery and kiosk orders, accounted for 57% of the company's system sales.

Yum's same-store sales, which only tracks the metric at restaurants open at least 12 months, rose 2% during the quarter.

"I'm proud that Yum Brands delivered another strong quarter in a tough consumer environment," CEO David Gibbs said on his final conference call before his retirement. CFO Chris Turner will succeed him as chief executive on Oct. 1.

For the second quarter, KFC reported same-store sales growth of 2%, lifted by its international restaurants. The fried chicken chain counts China as its biggest market.

But domestically, KFC's struggles continue. Its U.S. same-store sales slid 5%. Last year, the chain dropped from the No. 3 chicken chain in the U.S. by sales to No. 5, falling behind Raising Cane's and Wingstop.

Executives said Tuesday that KFC's value messaging and new menu items haven't resonated with consumers.

Yum has responded by shaking up the chain's leadership; in March, Scott Mezvinsky took the reins as KFC's CEO, and in April, Catherine Tan-Gillespie took over as president of KFC U.S.

Globally, Pizza Hut's same-store sales fell 1%, hurt by weaker demand in its home market. Like KFC, Pizza Hut saw its U.S. same-store sales fall 5% during the quarter. The chain is facing increased competition from its rivals as many consumers dine out less often.

Gibbs said that Pizza Hut's U.S. sales also faltered because of an "insufficient value message," but the chain's leadership is already addressing that with new promotions.

Taco Bell, the jewel of Yum's portfolio, reported same-store sales growth of 4%, helped by the reintroduction of its Crispy Chicken Nuggets and the launch of new Crispy Chicken products.

Taco Bell's chicken sales have climbed 50% over the last two years, according to Gibbs. The chain has also been gaining market share from fast-casual restaurants and fast-food rivals.

"Most people are reporting negative quarters. We haven't even had a negative week for Taco Bell," Gibbs said.

Still, Wall Street had higher expectations for Taco Bell. Analysts were projecting that the chain would report global same-store sales growth of 5.2%, based on StreetAccount estimates.

Taco Bell's growing international business reported a same-store sales increase of 4% during the quarter.

Yum's total restaurant count rose 3%, lifted by 871 location openings in the quarter. That growth was driven primarily by international KFC openings.

Artificial intelligence is reshaping the US job market — and young tech workers are feeling the brunt of it.

"It is true that AI is starting to show up more clearly in the data," wrote Jan Hatzius, Goldman Sachs' chief economist, in a Monday note.

Goldman's analysis shows that the tech sector's share of the US employment market peaked in November 2022 — when ChatGPT was launched — and has since fallen below its long-term trend.

The impact has been especially sharp for young tech workers. The unemployment rate for 20- to 30-year-olds in tech has risen by nearly 3 percentage points since early 2024, over four times the increase in the overall jobless rate.

That spike is yet another sign that generative AI is starting to displace white-collar jobs, especially among early-career workers.

"While this is still a small share of the overall US labor market, we estimate that generative AI will eventually displace 6-7% of all US workers," Hatzius wrote.

Goldman expects that shift to happen over the next decade. The firm forecasts that the peak unemployment impact will be limited to a "manageable" 0.5 percentage point, as other industries absorb many displaced workers. 

The report comes amid growing concerns about US labor market weakness.

The US economy added just 73,000 jobs in July, far short of the 106,000 expected by economists, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday. Job growth for May and June was also revised sharply lower.

"Friday's jobs numbers reinforced our view that US growth is near stall speed — a pace below which the labor market weakens in a self-reinforcing fashion," wrote Hatzius.

Despite AI's impact, Hatzius pointed to a bigger near-term problem: a slowdown in US output growth, which he attributes in part to higher tariffs.

Goldman estimates that real GDP grew at a 1.2% annualized rate in the first half of the year. Analysts wrote that they expect a "similarly sluggish pace" in the second half.

"While the easing in financial conditions and the pickup in business confidence should support growth, real disposable income and consumer spending are likely to grow very slowly, not just because of the weakness in job growth but also because most of the pass-through from tariffs to consumer prices is still ahead of us," Hatzius wrote.

Tech leaders have warned of an AI-induced jobs cliff. In May, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said that AI may eliminate 50% of entry-level, white-collar jobs in the next five years.

A Palantir exec had some strong words for Large Language Models.

The Denver-based AI software company reported its first-ever billion-dollar quarter in Monday's Q2 earnings report, and the executives opened the investors call with comments on LLMs and how it plans to win the AI race.

"LLMs, on their own, are at best a jagged intelligence divorced from even basic understanding," Ryan Taylor, the company's chief revenue officer and chief legal officer, told shareholders on the earnings call. "In one moment, they may appear to outperform humans in some problem-solving task, but in the next, they make catastrophic errors no human would ever make."

"By contrast, our ontology is pure understanding concretized in software. This is reality, not rhetoric," Taylor added, referring to a company approach to AI that is based on using logic and data to recreate a digital model of how an organization works.

These comments came after the company smashed analyst expectations and nearly doubled its commercial revenue in the US since last year's second quarter to $628 million, mostly thanks to a 10-year, $10 billion consolidated contract with the US Army.

Company executives also outlined how it plans to win the AI race and what kind of talent would thrive at Palantir.

Shyam Sankar, chief technology officer, told investors that the Trump administration's new AI Action Plan, which promotes the deregulation of AI, has taken "all the brakes off" and that industry customers are "really excited to get to work."

These comments are in response to a Bank of America analyst, who asked how Palantir plans to win the AI race both in innovation and in talent retention.

"If you are a highly talented person and would believe that the West is superior or at least tolerant of me telling you it every day, you'll not find a place anywhere I've seen — and now over 20 years I've interacted with almost every agency in the West, many of the largest companies, many of the smaller companies — that is comparable on time of joining to full agency like Palantir," Karp said toward the end of the call.

"If you come to Palantir, your career is set," he added.

Palantir did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

The SEC issued its latest crypto-focused exemptive statement Tuesday, formally greenlighting the activities of liquid staking providers, including issuing staking tokens and paying users financial rewards.

The announcement comes two months after the agency issued a similar statement exempting self-custodial staking with a third party, self-staking, and custodial staking from securities regulation. 

Now, some of DeFi's biggest players have been invited to the party—with their business activities confirmed to be outside the SEC's jurisdiction.

"Today's guidance on liquid staking shows the same nuanced understanding of [liquid-staking-token] technology that the Crypto Task Force exhibited when we met with them on this topic back in February," Jito Labs CEO Lucas Bruder told Decrypt. "We are gratified to have worked with so many other in the industry, across ecosystems, in collaboration with the SEC on this important topic," he said.

Top liquid staking projects like Ethereum's Lido and Solana's Jito are lynchpins of the decentralized finance ecosystem, which allow users to deposit crypto and receive staking tokens—thus remaining “liquid”—that track the value of the deposited token. (Lido gives ETH depositors stETH; Jito hands JitoSOL to SOL depositors.) DeFi users can then trade with their staking receipt tokens across protocols while their deposits accrue staking rewards.

DeFi broadly refers to crypto-native applications that allow traders to transact without third-party intermediaries. DeFi applications are the lifeblood of the on-chain economy, enabling users to interact with, buy, borrow, lend or sell crypto assets without giving up control of their assets to a custodian or disclosing personal information like names and addresses.

Projects like Lido and Jito have accumulated vast amounts of the world's top cryptocurrencies by offering such services. Lido, for instance, currently holds over $31 billion worth of ETH, according to DeFi Llama—making it the largest player across all of decentralized finance generally, and handily the top ETH staker globally. 

Today's SEC statement makes explicit that in offering staking tokens like stETH, and paying out ETH staking rewards to customers, liquid stakers like Lido are explicitly not engaging in securities offerings, and do not need to register with the SEC to continue providing such services.

“[I]t is the Division's view that participants in Liquid Staking Activities do not need to register with the Commission transactions under the Securities Act, or fall within one of the Securities Act's exemptions from registration in connection with these Liquid Staking Activities,” the agency said today.

The exemption is the latest in a string of similar moves made by the SEC since President Donald Trump's return to power, to explicitly carve out core sectors of the crypto market from the agency's jurisdiction. Other statements in recent months have exempted crypto mining, meme coin trading, and stablecoins from the agency's purview.

Those moves have accompanied a shutdown of nearly every crypto-focused lawsuit and investigation instigated under previous administrations. The SEC, under the Biden administration, sued several custodial staking providers for offering staking rewards to customers, but never filed lawsuits against liquid staking providers like Lido and Jito.

 In a new staff statement, the SEC clarifies that certain crypto liquid staking practices do not constitute securities offerings, marking a step toward clearer digital asset regulation. 

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has clarified that certain cryptocurrency liquid staking activities do not constitute securities offerings, a notable step in the agency's ongoing effort to provide clearer guidance on digital asset regulation.

“The statement clarifies the division's view that, depending on the facts and circumstances, the liquid staking activities covered in the statement do not involve the offer and sale of securities,” the regulator said Tuesday, referring to key sections of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

In its Staff Statement, the SEC defined liquid staking as the process of staking digital assets through a protocol and receiving a “liquid staking receipt token,” which serves as evidence of the staker's ownership.

“Today's staff statement on liquid staking is a significant step forward in clarifying the staff's view about crypto asset activities that do not fall within the SEC's jurisdiction,” SEC Chair Paul Atkins said in a statement. 

The SEC's clarification comes amid rising institutional interest in liquid staking exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with firms like Jito Labs, VanEck and Bitwise urging the agency to approve liquid staking strategies for Solana (SOL)-based funds.

Liquid staking has become one of the largest subsectors in crypto, with total value locked (TVL) nearing $67 billion across all protocols, according to DefiLlama. Ethereum alone accounts for $51 billion of that total.

The announcement follows the SEC's launch of Project Crypto — a sweeping initiative to overhaul the regulatory framework for cryptocurrency trading in the United States. As SEC Chair Paul Atkins noted last week, the project was developed in response to recommendations from the White House's Working Group on Digital Assets

Since taking office, Atkins has led a more lenient approach to digital asset regulation, moving away from the agency's prior “regulation by enforcement” stance under former Chair Gary Gensler. That shift included a May clarification that proof-of-stake protocols do not constitute securities transactions.

Under Atkins' leadership, the SEC has also taken meaningful steps to ease regulatory burdens on cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). 

Notably, on July 29, the agency approved in-kind creations and redemptions for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) ETFs, allowing authorized participants to exchange ETF shares directly for the underlying assets rather than cash.

The US crypto industry is also gaining momentum from sweeping policy reforms designed to make digital assets more accessible. These include the passage of the GENIUS Act, a landmark stablecoin bill, and House approval of market structure and anti-CBDC legislation ahead of the August recess.

Phantom, the leading wallet on the Solana blockchain, said it has acquired SolSniper, an advanced on-chain trading terminal for memecoins and NFTs. Financial terms were not disclosed. The deal, announced 4 Aug., is Phantom's fourth acquisition in 16 months and is intended to accelerate the company's plan to evolve from a wallet into what it calls a comprehensive consumer-finance platform.



Founded as an NFT marketplace, SolSniper pivoted to high-speed memecoin trading after NFT volumes slumped and wound down its original NFT services in June 2025. The platform offers automated sniping, wallet tracking and analytics designed for rapid execution on Solana's low-latency network—features Phantom intends to embed directly into its wallet for a more sophisticated trading experience.



The deal deepens Phantom's push into higher-margin trading services. Phantom's own perpetual-futures product has generated about $1.5 million in fees on $3.11 billion in volume during the past month, according to Flowscan. “Combining SolSniper's advanced feature set with Phantom's infrastructure and distribution will help us build for and serve entirely new audiences,” said Brandon Millman, Phantom's co-founder and chief executive.



Phantom has been on an acquisition spree, previously buying blockchain indexer Simplehash in February 2025 and earlier snapping up security firm Blowfish and embedded-wallet provider BitSki. The latest purchase reflects a broader trend on Solana, where companies such as Jupiter and Kamino Finance are bundling multiple DeFi services under a single brand to capture a growing base of on-chain traders.

Bank of China Hong Kong has taken a major step forward in its digital currency rollout, completing the second phase of testing for the city's central bank digital currency, the e-HKD. 

This follows a series of pilot programmes first launched in 2023 by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the “Digital HKD Plus” initiative, aimed at integrating central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) into everyday finance.

The new round of testing, which included nearly 500 participants and more than 1,500 simulated transactions, focused on real-life applications, further accelerating the CBDC's readiness for public deployment.

In the latest pilot concluded on August 5, the Bank of China Hong Kong (BOCHK) issued unified digital wallets to approximately 500 test participants. 

Identity verification was required before activation, aligning with Hong Kong's regulatory standards on anti-money laundering and user authentication.

The wallets were powered by BOCHK's proprietary alliance blockchain, with full integration into multiple mobile banking applications. This allowed users to conveniently access their digital wallets through existing digital banking infrastructure.

Once the wallets were activated, users were provided with simulated digital Hong Kong dollar (e-HKD) vouchers. These were used to complete purchases at local coffee shops across the city, providing a retail-focused setting to evaluate payment speed, system stability, and transaction authentication. 

Each of the 1,500 test transactions was validated using digital signatures from both the user and the participating banks, simulating the conditions of a live CBDC payment environment.

The second phase builds on BOCHK's earlier round of testing, which covered six categories of potential use. 

In those trials, BOCHK and HKMA explored the use of e-HKD in programmable finance, government grant distribution, offline payments, tokenised asset settlement, and digital retail transactions.

These earlier tests marked the first official pilot under the HKMA's three-rail approach for e-HKD development. With both the first and second scheduled pilots now concluded, the e-HKD project moves closer to the implementation rail, although no official launch date has been announced yet.

Alongside CBDC development, Hong Kong is also setting legal foundations for the broader digital asset space. On August 1, the city's first stablecoin legislation officially came into effect, introducing a unified licensing and regulatory framework for fiat-backed stablecoin issuers. 

This framework aims to ensure financial stability and investor protection while allowing regulated digital currencies to coexist with public sector CBDCs.

In addition, the Hong Kong government released its second digital asset policy statement this year, reinforcing its commitment to building a “full-fledged digital ecosystem.” 

The statement outlined key focus areas such as local adoption, compliance infrastructure, and market development.

As the e-HKD moves through its pilot stages, the combination of private stablecoin regulation and government-backed digital currency experimentation positions Hong Kong as a dual-track leader in Asia's rapidly evolving digital finance landscape.

Oops, something went wrong

A version of this article appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on August 5. Sign up here.

Last week Ethereum turned 10, and now the world's second-most valuable blockchain must cut the baby fat, argues Justin Drake, an Ethereum Foundation researcher.

His vision, named Lean Ethereum, aims to streamline the blockchain's bloated code, and shield it from future encryption-smashing quantum computers.

The diet could also unlock performance improvements, including boosting transaction throughput, Drake said.

“Lean Ethereum is a generational oath to keep Ethereum online no matter what — to scale it without compromise,” he wrote.

At this stage, it's just a proposal. But it appears to have the Foundation's tacit approval: the Foundation published an explainer on its blog on July 31.

Lean Ethereum comes six months after the blockchain faced a mini-crisis, as longtime supporters agonised over its cryptocurrency's lacklustre performance as the price of Solana and other rivals skyrocketed.

Now, Ethereum appears to have reclaimed its mojo. Exchange-traded funds and so-called treasury companies are gobbling up Ether.

US lawmakers have also passed legislation that allows banks and tech giants to issue stablecoins, a class of crypto asset dominated by Ethereum.

Lean Ethereum has its roots in a talk Drake delivered at last year's Devcon conference where he proposed the “beam chain,” an update to Ethereum's so-called Beacon chain.

As Tim Craig explained at the time, Ethereum is made up of two layers: the Beacon chain, which handles Ether staking and keeps track of transactions, and the execution layer, where users submit transactions.

Fast-forward to May, and Drake told colleagues his vision had broadened. This was spurred, in part, by his receiving a cease-and-desist letter from another project that had trademarked the word “Beam.”

“If we do change [the name],” Drake told colleagues in May, it should be “a really strong meme.”

Finding a new name with memetic potential could be an opportunity for the rest of Ethereum, Drake added.

The beam chain was supposed to be better than the beacon chain. But it was also supposed to be simpler, to feature more streamlined code. Leaner, if you will.

There are “huge opportunities” in trimming the execution layer as well, Drake said.

“Ethereum entering the Ozempic era,” quipped Sophia Gold, an Ethereum Foundation engineer, in the comments, referencing the popular diet drug.

The result? A massive transaction bump, according to Drake's July 31 blog post.

A lean Ethereum could deliver eye-popping throughput: 10,000 transactions per second on Ethereum itself, 10 million on layer 2 blockchains, Drake wrote. That's 49,900% and 4,999,900% more than what Ethereum has processed in recent months, according to data from L2BEAT.

While it's generally understood that scale comes at the expense of decentralisation, Drake argued that Lean Ethereum can achieve both.

Advances in zero-knowledge technology, data availability sampling, and hash-based cryptography will allow Ethereum fans to have their cake and eat it too, he argued.

Something went wrong

A version of this article appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on August 5. Sign up here.

Last week Ethereum turned 10, and now the world's second-most valuable blockchain must cut the baby fat, argues Justin Drake, an Ethereum Foundation researcher.

His vision, named Lean Ethereum, aims to streamline the blockchain's bloated code, and shield it from future encryption-smashing quantum computers.

The diet could also unlock performance improvements, including boosting transaction throughput, Drake said.

“Lean Ethereum is a generational oath to keep Ethereum online no matter what — to scale it without compromise,” he wrote.

At this stage, it's just a proposal. But it appears to have the Foundation's tacit approval: the Foundation published an explainer on its blog on July 31.

Ripple's XRP posted a 5% gain on the day as traders shrugged off a fresh wave of opposition from traditional banks to Ripple's license application. Price action remained volatile between $2.83 and $3.11, with short-term upside stalling at resistance levels while volumes surged past 110 million XRP — including a $33 million one-minute transaction that spooked order books.

What to Know

News Background

The banking sector's coordinated filing against Ripple's license effort marks the most concentrated resistance the firm has faced since its partial victory against the SEC. For traders, the news was mostly background noise — as XRP's price held firm above $3.00 and saw liquidity bursts typically associated with large players moving in and out of the asset.

 Bitcoin lacks upward momentum as eyes fall on old all-time highs near $109,000 — can upside liquidity provide the springboard bulls need? 

Key points:

Bitcoin bulls face multiple resistances as price stays stuck, but some see upside liquidity sparking a short squeeze.

BTC price forecasts continue to see lower levels closer to $109,000 in the short term.

Volatility is all but guaranteed to return, and traders now need “patience.”

Bitcoin (BTC) struggled to hold $113,000 after Tuesday's Wall Street open as analysis expected new lows.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC price action wedged between areas of high order-book liquidity.

Room for movement was thus limited, and short-term forecasts favored further downside next.

“$BTC is going lower before it goes higher,” trading resource Material Indicators summarized in a post on X.

An accompanying chart of BTC/USDT order-book liquidity on largest global exchange Binance revealed a lack of significant bid support above $110,000.

Continuing, onchain analytics firm Glassnode eyed the cost basis of recent Bitcoin buyers, likewise suggesting that the area around old all-time highs could provide a BTC price floor.

“For $BTC, the airgap between $109K–$116K is gradually being filled on dips. The staircase pattern points to steady investor engagement over the past month,” it explained on the day. 

Not everyone was concerned about a more significant BTC price dip.

Analyzing liquidity, popular X account TheKingfisher stressed the allure of overhead asks.

“Look at $BTC – almost 70% of liquidations are shorts sitting above us,” part of an X post read alongside a chart of crypto long and short distributions. 

Popular trader Daan Crypto Trades meanwhile eyed resistance in the form of the 200-period simple (SMA) and exponential (EMA) moving averages on 4-hour timeframes.

“Bulls need to break this region to be back in control and start aiming for higher,” he argued.

Crypto trader, analyst and entrepreneur Michaël van de Poppe said that regardless, rangebound BTC price behavior would not last.

“Patience is required when it comes to $BTC. No breakout upwards, no breakout downwards,” he concluded Tuesday.

Anas is a crypto native journalist and SEO writer with over five years of writing experience covering blockchain, crypto, DeFi, and emerging tech.

Figure Technology Solutions has confidentially submitted a draft registration statement with the SEC for a proposed initial public offering (IPO) of its equity securities, expected to launch in 2025.

According to an official press release, the blockchain-focused financial technology company has not yet determined the number of shares to be offered or the price range for the proposed listing.

The filing coincides with Figure's simultaneous pursuit of regulatory approval for what would become the first interest-bearing stablecoin regulated as a security within the United States.

The confidential SEC filing is yet another significant milestone for Figure, which has been developing blockchain-based financial products since its founding under Cagney's leadership.

Company founder and former SoFi CEO Mike Cagney confirmed the filing through social media, signaling the company's readiness to pursue public market capital.

I know it's been discussed by others, but here it is from the source. Boom. https://t.co/IRjVvEy72R

The IPO filing builds on Figure's ongoing efforts to introduce an interest-bearing stablecoin that would operate as a regulated security under U.S. law.

Figure filed its initial draft registration statement for this stablecoin project in October through its subsidiary, Figure Certificate Co., seeking to register the tokens as “face-amount certificates.”

The proposed stablecoin would break from traditional models by offering 1 cent redemption value per certificate rather than the standard 1:1 dollar peg, meaning 100 certificates would equal $1.

Interest would accrue daily and be paid monthly to holders, with returns generated from reserves including treasury securities, commercial paper, corporate debt, and other investment-grade assets.

Beyond the stablecoin initiative, Figure is simultaneously pursuing registration of Figure Installment Certificates, an investment product targeting investors who want to earn yields while holding digital assets.

These regulatory filings position Figure to potentially become the first company offering SEC-compliant interest-bearing stablecoins to both retail and institutional U.S. investors.

Figure's move follows Circle Internet Financial's spectacular NYSE debut in June, when the USDC stablecoin issuer's shares surged 160% on their first trading day.

🔴 @Circle the company behind the USDC stablecoin, made a dramatic entrance on the NYSE with its shares surging as much as 160% during its trading debut. #Circle #NYSE https://t.co/EJQJ4Yy3m3

That explosive performance appears to have opened the floodgates for crypto companies seeking public market validation and capital.

Within weeks of Circle's success, Grayscale submitted confidential IPO documents to the SEC as Bitcoin topped $120,000, positioning itself to capitalize on the renewed institutional momentum.

BitGo followed suit with its own filing, leveraging its position as a custody firm managing $100 billion in digital assets to attract public market investors.

Most recently, Peter Thiel-backed crypto exchange Bullish entered the pipeline, targeting a $4.2 billion valuation through its NYSE listing under the ticker BLSH.

Each filing has built upon the precedent Circle established, suggesting that regulated crypto infrastructure companies may have found their moment to access traditional capital markets.

The pattern emerging from these filings reveals companies with strong compliance frameworks and institutional relationships leading the charge toward public listings.

Yet the sustainability of this IPO wave remains uncertain, particularly as the crypto market's $4 trillion valuation invites questions about whether current enthusiasm can support multiple high-profile public debuts.

The regulatory environment under President Trump's crypto-friendly administration has certainly provided tailwinds, but market conditions remain volatile enough to challenge even well-positioned companies.

However, Figure's IPO success will depend on completing the SEC's review process and favorable market conditions, with the company noting that the offering remains subject to regulatory approval and market factors.

The company's unique positioning in both stablecoin innovation and yield-generating products could differentiate it from other crypto IPO candidates, though approval for its regulatory-compliant stablecoin remains uncertain.

 Public markets provide new fundraising avenues for blockchain companies, enabling them to tap into capital from traditional markets. 

Figure Technology Solutions, a fintech company focused on transforming financial services through blockchain technology, has filed confidentially for an initial public offering (IPO) with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, joining a growing list of crypto-related companies preparing to enter traditional financial markets.

Figure Technology submitted a confidential IPO filing with the SEC related to its equity securities offering expected in 2025, the company announced on Monday.

The number of shares and the price range have yet to be determined, subject to market conditions and the completion of the SEC's review process. The IPO filing was made under a new SEC clause that enables confidential filing ahead of a final public offering.

More cryptocurrency companies are filing for traditional IPO listings, demonstrating a convergence of digital and traditional markets, attracting more capital from traditional investors to the crypto industry. 

Participating in public markets offers crypto companies like Figure more funding opportunities through public stock offerings and similar strategies employed by the likes of Michael Saylor's Strategy.

Figure offers blockchain-based financial services including lending and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization through the Provenance Blockchain, a public, proof-of-stake blockchain built by Figure in 2018, aiming to “address issues of data control for use specifically in financial services.”

Figure surpassed $30 billion in onchain loans and securities transactions in March 2024, three days after it announced a $60 million Series A funding round to launch Figure Markets, its first step in building its so-called “everything exchange” for crypto, tokenized stocks and securities, the firm announced on March 18, 2024.

Circle, the issuer of the world's second-largest stablecoin USDC (USDC), debuted on the New York Stock Exchange on June 5 after upsizing its IPO to more than $1.05 billion.

Circle's success may inspire a renewed crypto IPO season in 2025, tempting more companies to enter public markets. Circle's IPO pricing gave it a $6.9 billion valuation based on 220 million outstanding shares as of June 2.

A month later, crypto-focused asset management company Grayscale submitted a confidential IPO filing with the SEC, Cointelegraph reported on July 14.

Crypto exchange operator and media company Bullish also plans to raise up to $629 million through an IPO, eying a $4.2 billion valuation, Cointelegraph reported on Tuesday.

Targeting Multi-Chain Digital Asset Growth and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Integration

SARASOTA, FL, Aug.  05, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  Silo Pharma, Inc. (Nasdaq: SILO), today announced the launch of a cryptocurrency treasury strategy which is expected to focus on leading digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. The Company intends to make opportunistic purchases of digital currencies following launch and to leverage staking to generate yield while also focusing on capital preservation and token appreciation. Expanded implementation of this strategy is anticipated to be based on available capital and market conditions. Silo has appointed digital asset tech pioneer, Corwin Yu, as the first member of its newly formed Crypto Advisory Board to lead this new strategy. To further this initiative, Silo has recently acquired market intelligence technology powered by artificial intelligence, equipping the team with real-time insights to potentially drive smarter, faster decision-making.

“With the recent rise of successful cryptocurrency treasury allocations, and increasing capital inflows to digital assets, we believe there is an opportunity to potentially create and unlock long-term value for Silo's stockholders, starting now,” said Silo CEO Eric Weisblum. “We believe that we are fortunate to appoint Corwin Yu as our lead strategic advisor and head of a newly formed three-member advisory board overseeing our crypto treasury strategy, with 2 other members to be appointed in the future.” 

Corwin Yu is a senior technology and trading executive with over 20 years of experience building and managing mission-critical systems for institutional finance. Mr. Yu currently serves as Global Head of Digital Assets at fintech company TSImagine, and previously he was the founding Chief Technology Officer of MARKTS, one of the first institutional crypto trading platforms. In addition to these leadership roles, his prior experience spanned PIMCO, Credit Suisse, hedge funds and digital asset firms. As a proven leader in cryptocurrency trading infrastructure, fund management, and regulatory compliance, Mr. Yu has an extensive background in deploying scalable cloud-native platforms and overseeing cross-asset trading strategies. His track record includes founding and scaling digital asset trading platforms, managing global engineering and DevOps teams, and delivering secure and compliant crypto custody and treasury solutions.

“Alongside our launching of a digital asset treasury strategy, we remain deeply committed to our core biopharmaceutical enterprise focused on innovative therapeutics for underserved conditions,” Mr. Weisblum continued. “Our lead asset, PTSD drug SPC-15, is completing final studies before submitting an FDA investigational new drug (IND) application, and if such IND is approved we would look to commence a first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial.”

About Silo Pharma  Silo Pharma is a diversified developmental-stage biopharmaceutical and cryptocurrency treasury company. Its therapeutic focus is on addressing underserved conditions, including stress-induced psychiatric disorders, chronic pain, and central nervous system (CNS) diseases. The Company's portfolio includes innovative programs such as SPC-15 for PTSD, SP-26 for fibromyalgia and chronic pain, and preclinical assets targeting Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis.

                            Why HIVE Digital's Green Bitcoin Mining Strategy Is Winning Big With AI                        

Companies that began as pure Bitcoin miners are increasingly repositioning themselves as diversified digital infrastructure providers, addressing both emerging technology demands and environmental concerns.

One of the voices leading this transition is Frank Holmes, Executive Chairman and co-founder of HIVE Digital Technologies. A long-time advocate for Bitcoin mining's strategic role in modern energy markets, Holmes also serves as CEO and Chief Investment Officer of U.S. Global Investors, a mutual fund and asset management firm. 

Holmes has helped shape HIVE's growth from high-efficiency Bitcoin mining into one of the leanest data center infrastructures now optimized for growing AI workloads. In a recent interview with CCN, he discussed this transformation and how HIVE is positioning itself at the intersection of blockchain, AI and sustainable computing.

Holmes explained that the Nasdaq listing was primarily about exposure and institutional access. Holmes mentioned that “the Nasdaq gave us exposure,” he said. “A lot of global family offices, institutions will not buy Canadian-listed stock. They want Nasdaq.”

Holmes noted:

HIVE was early to integrate green energy into its mining operations. Holmes emphasized that this approach created competitive advantages beyond environmental benefits. “Intel reached out to us because we were green,” he said. “Nvidia reached out because we were green.”

Holmes added that Hive facilities, designed for energy and thermal efficiency, have value beyond Bitcoin. “These are data centers. These are not warehouses with computers and fans,” Holmes said. “They're real data centers. They're compute assets.”

Since its inception in 2017, HIVE has operated in Iceland, Sweden and Canada, strategically choosing regions with abundant green energy. Holmes also pointed to their latest expansion explaining how HIVE is operating in Paraguay. 

“We have low-cost hydro, and we're mining down there. Each location reinforces HIVE's approach to building sustainable, high-performance infrastructure across borders,” Holmes explained.

He also noted that hydro remains his preferred energy source for long-term operations. “Hydro is reliable. It's constant. You don't have the same disruptions as with solar or wind,” he said. “When it rains, that dam is full and we've got energy. You can't say the same with wind or clouds.”

Each location, he explained, reinforces HIVE's approach to building sustainable, high-performance infrastructure across borders.

Holmes explained that traditional Bitcoin rigs don't adapt well to diversified compute, this means that most Bitcoin mining rigs, typically ASICs, are designed solely for one function, hashing SHA-256.

In contrast, diversified compute tasks like AI or rendering require flexible, general-purpose hardware like GPUs but HIVE's newer buildouts are structured differently. 

“We realized early on that if you're building for mining, you might as well build for the next layer,” Holmes said.

The next layer? High-performance computing (HPC) in the following manner:

We've entered a new industrial era:

When asked if declining Bitcoin transaction fees or on-chain activity is risky to HIVE's mining model, Holmes replied, “Think short term, yes. Long term, no.” He noted that while short-term fluctuations can affect daily revenue, they don't undermine Bitcoin mining's long-term value. 

HIVE focuses on block rewards and infrastructure, treating mining as a reserve engine rather than a transactional business.

Holmes emphasized just how capital-intensive AI infrastructure has become.

“It costs ten times more to build an AI compute facility than a Bitcoin mining site,” he said. “That creates a serious moat, only those already operating at scale can afford to reallocate resources and compete.”

Despite the heavy cost of entry, Holmes argued that HIVE is uniquely positioned because of its lean and disciplined approach.

“We make nearly $900,000 a day in revenue with just 25 employees. It's not just about scale, it's about discipline,” he said.

HIVE's philosophy, according to Holmes, is to avoid bloated operational structures.

“We don't want 200 employees. We want Navy SEALs.”

He added that with over $6 million in annual revenue per employee, HIVE's efficiency rivals top-tier tech companies like Nvidia, in annual revenue per employee, a byproduct of its refusal to scale through excessive HR or marketing spend.

When asked about expanding into solo or consumer-facing mining, Holmes was direct:

“You have to deal with customers. You have to deal with refunds. You have to deal with noise. It's not scalable, it's a distraction.”

While HIVE has the technical capacity to support such operations, Holmes made it clear that retail infrastructure isn't part of the company's focus.

Holmes also acknowledges that “while HIVE scales its operations, it's equally disciplined about what not to pursue.”

On altcoins, Holmes was even more blunt. “We're like an 18-wheeler on a dirt road,” he said. “If we mine those smaller coins, we distort the network.” The firm avoids assets whose scale could overwhelm the ecosystem, preferring to stay within robust, high-capacity networks like Bitcoin.

For Holmes, Bitcoin mining isn't the endgame, it's the gateway.

“We're not betting on just Bitcoin,” he said. “We're building what comes next.”

According to Holmes, today's energy-efficient, thermally optimized mining sites are quietly laying the foundation for tomorrow's high-demand compute infrastructure.

And what comes next, he argued, is a wave of geopolitical and industrial AI deployment, where sovereign data control becomes critical. Countries won't just want access to AI, they'll want to own the infrastructure that powers and protects it.

“That includes military, intelligence and industrial applications,” Holmes said. “In those cases, an outsourced compute becomes a liability.”

HIVE's long-term strategy is rooted in controlling the full physical stack, such as power, chips, cooling and location, that enables advanced computing. Bitcoin mining, Holmes said, was simply the economic catalyst that made these sites viable.

“Bitcoin mining created the initial economic logic,” he explained. “But the next chapter is about leveraging them as sovereign-ready infrastructure.”

From early builds in Iceland to recent expansion into Paraguay, HIVE has consistently focused on green-powered, energy-stable regions, not just for mining, but for building real compute infrastructure.

“These are data centers. They're compute assets,” Holmes emphasized.

Whether it's securing Bitcoin or preparing for a sovereign AI-driven future, Holmes made one thing clear: HIVE is building for more than just this cycle.

Tech analyst warns AMD stock has run ahead of itself as company prepares to report

Bitcoin price today: little changed at $114k amid macro uncertainty, Ether upbeat

Up 23%+ in two sessions, this satellite stock looks poised for further upside

The crypto market ended its five-week winning streak with a drop of over 5% last week. Bitcoin performed worse than the overall market, and altcoins fell even more, with an average decline of 8%. This week, cryptocurrencies are showing more strength, suggesting that last week's pullback may not continue for long. Still, they have not yet broken through key resistance levels needed to confirm a new upward trend.

Last week, Ethereum tried but failed again to move above the $3,900 level and dropped back to around $3,400. As August began, buying interest from this lower level pushed prices back up, but the recovery has been slow and cautious.

One notable trend is increased activity from big investors. Data from Santiment shows a rise in the number of wallets holding 10,000 ETH or more. Demand for Ethereum-based investment products also remains strong. Still, Ethereum is having a hard time breaking past the $3,900 resistance. This shows that broader concerns—like the US economic outlook and global trade tensions—are making investors more cautious.



Ethereum is currently moving sideways between $3,450 and $3,980. Within this range, $3,700 is acting as a key resistance. If ETH closes above $3,700 on the daily chart, it could try to test the main resistance again. Right now though, buying pressure still looks too weak to break through. The daily Stochastic RSI shows there could be another attempt to move past $3,700. For the uptrend to continue, Ethereum likely needs to close the week above $4,000.

If ETH fails to break $3,700, selling pressure may increase. In that case, the $3,450–$3,500 range becomes important support. If this zone breaks, a deeper correction is likely. The weekly Stochastic RSI remains flat in the overbought zone and may start heading down if ETH drops below $3,450. If that happens, prices could fall toward $3,000, and possibly even to $2,500.

In short, Ethereum's short- to medium-term outlook depends on how long institutional buying continues. But overall, macroeconomic factors are still the biggest influence on whether ETH breaks out of its current range.

Solana failed to hold above $200 in late July and entered a deeper correction. After breaking below the $183 support level, it dropped to the next support zone between $160 and $165.

This week, Solana is trying to recover above $165, but the move is not yet confirmed. If it can break the short-term downtrend, it may retest $183. For the correction to end, Solana needs a daily close above $172, followed by a move above $183. If that happens, a push past $202 could lead to a rally toward $230. The daily Stochastic RSI is starting to turn upward, but a stronger signal will come if SOL climbs above $172.



On the downside, if Solana fails to break the downtrend, a fall below $165 could send it toward $142.

Litecoin ended its correction quickly in late July, finding strong support at $105 in early August and showing stronger performance than the rest of the market.

Since yesterday, Litecoin has surged sharply, recovering recent losses. To keep the uptrend going, $125 is the first support to watch. If there is profit-taking, the price could pull back to around $115. So the $115–$125 range will act as a key support zone for now. As long as Litecoin stays above $125, it may continue rising toward $155.



The $130–$135 range, which was tested earlier this year, is now a major resistance zone. A weekly close above $135 would signal a breakout from its 2025 trading range and could strengthen the upward trend. But if it fails to break this resistance, short-term gains could quickly disappear.

- Moonbirds NFT holders gain exclusive access to Monad's $MON airdrop via a strategic partnership to promote the new blockchain network.

- The collaboration leverages Moonbirds' 10,000+ Ethereum-based NFTs with nesting rewards to boost engagement in crypto ecosystems.

- Monad's Ethereum-compatible blockchain processes 10,000+ transactions/second, addressing scalability challenges through fast block times.

- The airdrop announcement via Moonbirds' official channels highlights cross-project alliances driving innovation and user adoption in NFTs.

Moonbirds, the NFT project known for its vibrant and collectible pixelated owl avatars, has entered a strategic partnership with Monad, a team developing a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain. This collaboration offers Moonbirds, Mythics, and Oddities NFT holders the exclusive opportunity to claim the upcoming $MON airdrop, which is part of Monad's broader strategy to increase awareness of its new blockchain network [1]. The airdrop initiative is expected to enhance engagement among NFT holders and position Moonbirds as a key player in the evolving crypto ecosystem [2].

Moonbirds, launched by Proof Collective and now managed by Orange Cap Games, has gained significant traction in the NFT market due to its unique nesting mechanism, which rewards long-term holders [1]. The collection, hosted on the Ethereum network, includes 10,000 Moonbirds, 9,774 Mythics, and 10,000 Moonbirds Oddities. These NFTs are more than just digital images; they grant access to a private community, special events, and other exclusive benefits [1].

Monad, which is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, is designed to overcome scalability issues by processing over 10,000 transactions per second with block times of just 0.5 seconds [1]. This partnership allows Moonbirds holders to be among the first to engage with the new blockchain and potentially benefit from its airdrop. The move underscores the growing integration between NFT projects and emerging blockchain infrastructure [2].

The announcement was made via the official Moonbirds blog and social media channels, with a direct link to the $MON airdrop portal [1]. This collaboration highlights the strategic value of cross-project alliances in the NFT and crypto space, where partnerships can drive innovation and user adoption. For NFT holders, the opportunity to claim $MON not only represents a potential financial benefit but also a deeper integration into the blockchain ecosystem [1].

Emma Burleigh is a reporter at Fortune, covering success, careers, entrepreneurship, and personal finance. Before joining the Success desk, she co-authored Fortune's CHRO Daily newsletter, extensively covering the workplace and the future of jobs. Emma has also written for publications including the Observer and The China Project, publishing long-form stories on culture, entertainment, and geopolitics. She has a joint-master's degree from New York University in Global Journalism and East Asian Studies.

Being in the C-suite is a high-pressure job with long hours, responsibilities to the board, and intense scrutiny. But what is it like to be a top executive when you're off the clock?

Fortune's series, The Good Life, shows how up-and-coming leaders spend their time and money outside of work.





Today we meet Eric Chen, the CEO and cofounder of financial blockchain Injective Foundation.





Hype around cryptocurrency has been growing for years, and Wall Street is now finally embracing it. Chen's company provides investors a secure platform to reinvent global markets; he says his layer 1 blockchain is one of the largest crypto networks ever built, leading the industry in user activity, transactions, and monetary volume. Since its 2018 inception, Injective has processed more than 2 billion on-chain transactions, with over 1.5 million wallets on the system. It has raised $56 million from major investors such as Binance, BitGo, Pantera, Jump—and even ex–Shark Tank billionaire investor Mark Cuban.





“The mission is simple: to create a truly free and fair financial system through decentralization,” Chen tells Fortune. “It does so by giving every builder, financial institution, and user the tools they need to reinvent global markets in a fully transparent and permission-less manner.”




Over the past seven years, Injective has grown to a $1.34 billion company—and at 26 years old, Chen is just getting started. More impressively, he launched the company at just 19 while enrolled in New York University. Chen was studying finance and mining Ethereum in his dorm room, all while interning at Innovating Capital on a hedge fund desk. The then-teenager was inspired to launch Injective after witnessing the inefficiencies of the traditional market, so he dropped out of NYU and started building his billion-dollar business. 





Injective has since made leaps in progress; Deutsche Telekom, T-Mobile's telecoms arm, joined as a validator, bringing Fortune 500–quality network infrastructure. Cboe Global Markets—the largest options exchange in America—also submitted a request to list the fund, signaling strong institutional interest and placing Injective among networks with potential U.S.-listed ETFs. 





Because of his business's massive growth, Chen says he can't remember a time when he was fully away from his work. The CEO's fun luxury gadgets—including a $2,900 mattress cover, Oura ring, and racing simulator—help keep him sane, he says, in the thick of his busy schedule. He never buys groceries, opting to eat out in New York City or DoorDash his food. Taking very few swanky vacations, he lives a globe-trotting lifestyle through his business, with trips to Seoul, London, Toronto, Abu Dhabi, and Singapore this year. 





Fortune: What's been the best investment you've ever made?


My Eight Sleep mattress cover, around $2,900. It enables me to be maximally efficient with sleep and minimize chances of productivity drop-off due to poor sleep quality.




And the worst?


I wouldn't say there's been a single “worst” investment so far. Every decision, whether it's worked out or not, has taught me something valuable and shaped how I think going forward. I try to approach everything with a learning mindset, which helps turn even the less successful bets into long-term upside.





How do you commute to work?


I live in New York, so my commute is usually a quick walk from home to the office.





How much is in your wallet? Do you have any fun credit cards you'd recommend?




Fiat [government tender, like the U.S. dollar] is dying so I actually never carry any cash!





Do you invest in shares?


I mainly only buy and hold crypto via apps on Injective. I dollar-cost-average into my favorite assets and use various programmable AI-driven bots to automate most trades, since I'm normally very caught up with work to follow the markets closely these days. 





The best approach is to learn by doing, while keeping risk low at the start. There are many great resources online including tutorials, videos, and forums that can help you build a strong foundation. Most platforms also offer paper trading, which allows you to practice with simulated money and no real financial risk. Use that experience to gain confidence before investing actual funds. Make sure you feel prepared to handle the ups and downs of the market before jumping in.





What personal finance advice would you give your 20-year-old self?




Invest more in Bitcoin.





What's the one subscription you can't live without?


My Oura ring subscription. It's great for tracking daily calories and sleep, which honestly is a godsend.





Where's your go-to wristwatch from?


I love my Apple watch. Simple yet effective.




How do you get your daily coffee fix?


Back when I first started Injective in college, I was running almost entirely on Red Bull. We even had a Red Bull fridge in our first office to keep a steady supply. These days I've made the switch to Celsius or double-espresso to keep me going.





What about eating on the go?


Like with my workouts, I try to be pretty disciplined about stepping away from my desk for lunch when I can. Most days, I'll eat in our communal office kitchen. It's a good break and gives me a chance to catch up with the team. That said, there are definitely days when things are nonstop and I end up eating at my desk or on the go.





I used to order takeout a ton since I have no time to cook, but recently I've started to meal prep. So, usually I just eat that at my desk while catching up on news at the same time.




Where do you buy groceries?


This is going to sound horrible, but I am not sure I ever really buy groceries. I live off of meal prep and DoorDash most days.





How often in a week do you dine out versus cook at home?


About 90% of the time, I end up eating out between work meetings, dinners, or just taking advantage of being in New York. There's always something new to try, and so many great spots nearby.





Any go-to restaurants or takeaways near you?




One of my favorites right now is Barlume, a Mediterranean place near our office that I go to pretty regularly.





Where do you shop for your work wardrobe?


Comfort has always been my priority. My style has definitely changed since college—whose hasn't? Back then I'd just throw on whatever I got from conferences or hackathons. These days, I still keep it comfortable, but now I'll reach for something like Sporty & Rich.





What would be a typical work outfit for you?


I wouldn't say I have a set everyday wardrobe. Some days it's gym shorts, a polo, and flip-flops, especially if it's a more casual day. Other times, if I have an important meeting, I'll opt for a shirt and chinos. It really depends on what the day calls for.




Are you the proud owner of any futuristic gadgets?


I'm not sure if it counts as futuristic, but my guilty pleasure is definitely the racing simulator I have at home. It's the biggest gadget I own, and it does an insanely good job of simulating the real thing.





How do you unwind from the top job?


If I have the time, I love playing tennis. It's one of the few things that really helps me unplug and reenergize. It's physically active but also mentally engaging, which makes it the perfect combination for me. Even just hitting for an hour clears my head and gives me a second wind.





What's the best bonus treat you've bought yourself?




After hosting a big Injective event in Belgium, I booked a few hours on a real race track with my friends. The simulator practice paid off.





How do you treat yourself when you get a promotion?


I usually don't buy myself anything physical as a reward, to be quite honest. Getting to go to a concert with my friends or checking out interesting performances in the city is the closest thing to a bonus reward I would say.





Take us on holiday with you: What's next on your vacation list?


My next vacation will actually be to Northern Macedonia to attend the wedding of one of our original Injective developers. It's a special full-circle moment, and I'm excited to celebrate with someone who's been part of the journey since the early days.




Usually my “vacations” are just work conferences around the world. This year alone, I will have been in Seoul, London, Toronto, Abu Dhabi, and Singapore for talks I am giving.





How many days of annual leave do you take a year?


What's a day off? Jokes aside, I actually can't remember a time when I was 100% away from work. Even when I might be at a friend's housewarming or visiting a new city, I am 24/7 terminally online.

                            Altcoin Season Back on Track  | Credit: Hameem Sarwar                        


Key Takeaways

After months of Bitcoin dominance, altcoins took center stage in June, and Ethereum (ETH) is leading the way.

Bitcoin's dominance is now on the verge of dipping below 60% for the first time in a while, raising the question: is altcoin season officially here?

Let's examine the charts more closely to see if this trend will continue through the rest of 2025.

The Bitcoin Dominance (BTCD) chart has been trending downward since hitting its cycle high of 66% on June 25, marking the steepest drop of the current market cycle.

Optimism around the altcoin season briefly faded between July 22 and Aug. 2, as BTCD rebounded.

The move raised concerns, especially on Aug. 2, when it looked like Bitcoin dominance had reclaimed the key 62.50% resistance level.

But that turned out to be a fakeout. BTCD dropped shortly after, confirming the move was just a deviation, not a real reversal..

According to the wave count, BTCD is now in the fifth and final leg of its decline, which could bottom out near 59.15%.

Until that level is reached, the altcoin season rally is expected to continue, though a bounce could follow once the wave completes.

The wave count suggests that BTCD is in the fifth and final wave of its downward movement, which will end near 59.15%.

While a more significant bounce could occur then, altcoin season will continue until that happens.

The crypto total market cap, excluding Bitcoin (BTC), creates the altcoin market cap.

The altcoin market cap has surged since June 22, but fell significantly on July 21.

Nevertheless, the short-term correction has ended.

The altcoin cap fell inside a descending parallel channel and is now breaking out from it.

If successful, it will confirm that the final portion of wave three (green) has started, targeting a new all-time high of $1.69 trillion.

The Ethereum Dominance chart is one of the most telling charts of the 2025 altcoin season.

Ethereum is the largest altcoin, so its performance affects the rest of the market.

Ethereum had underperformed during the entire cycle, but that changed in April.

Since then, the ETH price has nearly doubled and will not likely stop soon.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) are surging.

The next closest resistance is at 14.67%, so the ETH dominance has more room for growth.

So, the current altcoin season is still being led by large-cap altcoins instead of small-cap ones.

While rotation may occur later in the cycle, it is clear that large-cap altcoins are currently thriving and leading the altseason rally.

After the most extended period of underperformance in any cycle, altcoins have finally woken up and are strengthening their dominance.

Ethereum is leading the charge, and its dominance is climbing to 12%.

The ALTCAP is likely to reach a new all-time high before another dip.

The traditional assets, such as gold, crypto, or stocks, have always been the foundation of wealth building. Nonetheless, the financial nature of the situation is changing very fast and new technologies are disrupting traditional markets. Among those, LYNO AI technology has the potential to transform the AI industry and will present an investment opportunity of a revolutionary caliber to those who plan to take advantage of the next disruptive technology.

LYNO is a cross-chain arbitrage protocol that uses a decentralized, AI-powered, system to automatically identify and execute profitable trades across over 15 EVM-compatible blockchains such as Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum and Optimism. It uses machine learning algorithms to scan markets in real-time and find price gaps, making trades using smart contracts and flash loans within a few seconds without any manual intervention.

This sophisticated system operates through four integral layers:

The investors of the $LYNO tokens have the right to propose governance over upgrades, fees and protocols, and they can also stake their tokens to receive profits and shares of up to 60 percent of the fees generated. The buyback and burn mechanism is in-built so that scarcity and appreciation of the tokens increases with time.

According to some of the top traders and market analysts, LYNO AI is expected to surge 28,400 percent in the coming days. The rationale behind this projection is the strong utility of the technology and the momentum that this technology has gained in the presale period. The fact that more than 143,779 LYNO AI tokens have already been sold at the early bird price of 0.050 per token is evidence enough that LYNO AI is one of the strongest crypto asset to buy at this moment.

In comparing LYNO AI with conventional investments in gold and share of stocks:

This makes LYNO AI arbitrage protocol stand out as the asset with high potential due to the ability to generate consistent profits across different blockchains with the help of machine learning.

The investors are now welcomed to contribute in the early bird presale of LYNO AI. Key presale details include:

Participants of the Presale will also be part of the exclusive LYNO AI Giveaway where they could win up to 100,000 USD, further justifying their early investment.

Investors who want to diversify their portfolio with the help of gold, crypto, and stocks must pay close attention to the unmatched opportunities of LYNO AI.

A widely followed crypto analyst who nailed the 2022 Bitcoin (BTC) crash is warning of an impending BTC meltdown.

In posts in his Telegram channel, pseudonymous trader Crypto Capo tells his 129,000 subscribers that BTC and altcoins could see significant dips in price in the coming weeks as risk for a black swan event remains high.

According to the trader, both altcoins and BTC could see staggering price drops that see them cut in half – or more. However, according to Capo, investors appear to be gobbling up the flagship crypto asset during dips despite signs of an impending crash.

 “Interesting how, despite all the bearish signals, people keep buying the dip. The risk of a black swan event is still high. If it happens, we could see BTC drop to $60,000-$70,000 and altcoins crashing 50-80%. Big week ahead. Time to stay focused, volatility is coming.”

Near the end of July, Capo warned investors that altcoin season has yet to begin and that a shakeout is required before it does.

 “If you're wondering why your alts aren't really going up, it's because the altseason hasn't started yet, and it's likely we'll see another big shakeout before it does… 

There's a time for everything. There will be a time to get very bullish. There will be a time when altcoins pump hard for weeks. That time will come. But this isn't it. This is a time to be bearish. Plan for the future. Act in the present.” 

Bitcoin is trading for $114,966 at time of writing, a fractional decrease during the last 24 hours.

XRP surged to $3.05 during a volatile 24-hour period, posting a 4.45% gain from $2.92 as traders reacted to unprecedented minute-level volumes and whale liquidations. 

A $33 million spike in volume was recorded within a single minute, marking one of the largest such spikes for the token.

Despite technical resistance at $3.09 and short-term sell signals flashing, machine-learning forecasts continue to target upside toward $3.12 by month-end.

What to Know

News Background

The price spike followed a broader risk-on move in crypto markets as traders rotated out of lower-cap altcoins and into high-liquidity majors. 

However, on-chain data revealed aggressive sell-side flows from whale addresses and smart money funds—raising concerns that the rally may have been driven by short-term positioning ahead of regulatory catalysts. 

The SEC is expected to clarify XRP's securities treatment by mid-August, a potential binary event for the token.

James Howells, the man who has been hunting down his lost hard drive containing 8,000 BTC, addressed circulating reports claiming that he has given up on his 12-year search.

In 2013, a British IT engineer accidentally threw out his hard drive containing Bitcoin he had mined a few years earlier, which ended up in a landfill site in Newport. 

As bitcoin's value soared exponentially over the following years, Howells sought permission to excavate the landfill, only to have his request rejected by the regional council. Howells explored other options, such as using AI to help locate the hard drive. With today's bitcoin price of $114,231, Howell's lost hard drive is worth around $915 million.

Earlier this week, several social media posts emerged saying that Howells has officially ended his quest to recover the lost bitcoin. 

"No, I have not 'given up," Howells told The Block via direct message on social media platform X. "The story going around is partially true, but not in the way it's being framed." 

Howells explained that on July 1, he made a formal offer of between $33 million and $40 million in value to acquire and excavate the Newport landfill site, sent to the Newport City Council's leader, legal team and a member of its parliament. 

To raise funds for the acquisition, Howells had announced plans to launch an Ordinals-based token in October, representing 21% of the lost wallet's value.

Despite the sizable amount of the offer, Newport representatives have not replied or acknowledged the offer, according to Howells.

"So here's where we stand — If they won't sell, there's no need for a token sale to buy the landfill," Howells said. "I am no longer pursuing the purchase of the landfill, I am no longer pursuing excavation or remediation, I am no longer pursuing dialogue with the council or its representatives."

Howells said he has simply "pivoted" his strategy, but has not given up on his lost bitcoin, as he remains the legal owner of the 8,000 BTC, citing a High Court ruling in January this year.

"The Council may own the hard drive, but they do not own the digital contents of that hard drive - the 8,000 bitcoin are legally mine in law - the balance of which can be verified by anyone worldwide at any time," Howells told The Block.

Howells said now he is planning to tokenize his legal ownership of the lost 8,000 BTC into a new Bitcoin Layer 2 smart token named Ceiniog Coin (INI), utilizing the upcoming network update that removes the 80-byte cap on the OP_RETURN opcode in bitcoin transactions to free up space for more functionality.

The token is slated for launch after October, and an ICO is planned for later in the year, Howells added. 

"The intention is to bootstrap the Ceiniog ecosystem and launch a successful high-speed, high-scale, fast-confirmation, payment-focused web3 environment secured by the Bitcoin blockchain and backed by 8,000 BTC," Howells told The Block.

The Block has reached out to Howells for further comment on how his new Ceiniog coin plan affects his ultimate goal of retrieving the lost bitcoin.

Bitcoin experienced a pullback over the weekend, briefly dipping to $112,296 on Saturday before stabilizing around $114,420 at the time of writing.

The asset has seen a nearly 4% decline in the past week, marking one of the more notable short-term corrections in recent weeks. Market analysts suggest that, while short-term volatility persists, Bitcoin's broader outlook remains influenced by whale activity and long-term holder behavior.

Recent on-chain data provided by CryptoQuant highlights significant movement among high-volume Bitcoin traders. Crazzyblockk, a contributor to CryptoQuant's QuickTake platform, analyzed transactions of 1,000 BTC or more and identified a pattern in where large-scale investors, often referred to as whales, prefer to trade.

The data shows Binance is the dominant exchange for these transactions, processing both the highest total volume and the largest number of individual whale-level trades across the market.

Binance Emerges as Primary Venue for Whale Transactions

According to Crazzyblockk's analysis, Binance leads other exchanges by a substantial margin when it comes to whale activity. Over 30 million BTC have moved through Binance in both inflows and outflows, far exceeding figures recorded on competing platforms such as HTX Global and Kraken.

While volume alone highlights the scale of transactions, Binance's leadership becomes even clearer when measuring transaction count. Data indicates more than 56 million whale transactions have taken place on Binance, compared to roughly 16 million on HTX, making it the most active platform for high-frequency, large-scale trades.

This dominance suggests Binance provides unmatched liquidity for big players in the market. As Crazzyblockk noted, “The concentration of whale activity on Binance provides it with unparalleled liquidity. For traders, this means tighter spreads and a greater ability to execute large orders with minimal price impact.”

The findings indicate that monitoring Binance's order book can offer valuable insights into institutional sentiment and potential market movements.

Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Sustain Bullish Trend Despite Correction

While whale activity dominates short-term price movements, broader market sentiment remains supported by long-term holders (LTH). Another CryptoQuant analyst, Abrahamchart, pointed out that long-term investors continue to hold significant unrealized profits, with the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) ratio staying above 0.5.

This indicates that long-term holders are not rushing to sell, helping sustain price support near the $104,000 range. Short-term holders (STH), on the other hand, appear to be taking profits during rallies, contributing to temporary selling pressure and minor corrections such as the latest dip below $113,000.

Abrahamchart noted that while the short-term market may experience fluctuations, the underlying trend remains intact due to the conviction of long-term participants.

Bullish, the owner of the Bullish Exchange crypto platform, said it plans to raise as much as $629 million in its initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange.

The company, which also owns CoinDesk, said it plans to sell 20.3 million ordinary shares with an expected price of $28-$31 per share. At the top end of range, the company would be valued at $4.2 billion, according to the number of outstanding shares mentioned in an amended F-1 document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday. 

The move sees Bullish join a number of crypto firms entering public markets since President Donald Trump took office after a pro-crypto election campaign. Circle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, went public in June, as did Israeli social trading platform eToro. Industry majors including BitGo, Grayscale have filed for IPOs as well, while exchanges Kraken and OKX are also said to be mulling similar moves.

Funds managed by BlackRock and ARK Investment Management have shown interest in buying up to $200 million worth of shares at the IPO price, according to the amended F-1 document. The offerings' underwriters have the option to purchase an additional 3.045 million shares, depending on demand. 

The roadshow comes weeks after Cayman Islands-headquartered firm filed its initial F-1 registration with the SEC. The company, which plans to use the ticker "BLSH," aims to use the IPO proceeds for general corporate purposes and potential future acquisitions.

Bullish runs an institutional trading platform providing spot and derivatives trading as well as liquidity services, according to its filing.

The company provided an net income estimate of between $106 million and $109 million for the second quarter. In the first quarter, it posted a $349 million loss after reporting profit of $80 million for all of 2024.

In the filing, Bullish says it holds more than $3 billion in liquid assets, including 24,000 bitcoin, 12,600 ether and over $418 million in cash and stablecoins. That total, the company said, also includes funds supplied to decentralized finance protocols, although the amounts “are not material” to the overall total.

The wave of IPOs comes after the Trump administration provided the industry a long-sought favorable regulatory climate. That includes the GENIUS Act being signed into law last month, and a series of legal actions brought during the previous administration against leading industry participants being dropped.

The improved regulatory climate has helped prices soar. Bitcoin BTC$113,492.17 is up more than 22% this year to trade around $115,000 while the broader market, measured through the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index, has gained 32%.

UPDATE (Aug. 4, 14:28 UTC): Adds valuation in second paragraph, assets in final paragraph.

UPDATE (Aug. 4, 14:58 UTC): Adds Circle, eToro IPOs in third paragraph, regulatory background, crypt market performance in last two paragraphs.

What Is the Legionnaires' Disease Outbreak That Has Killed Two People in New York City?

Fifty-eight people have been infected—and two have died—in a New York City outbreak of Legionnaires' disease—a severe type of pneumonia caused by a bacterium commonly associated with air-conditioning systems and cooling towers

A little-known illness called Legionnaires' disease has infected at least 58 people in New York City's Central Harlem neighborhood in the past two weeks. Two people have died during the outbreak, which has been tied to cooling towers that tested positive for the disease-causing bacterium Legionella pneumophila, according to a statement from city health officials on August 4.

The disease is a severe pneumonia and one of two infections caused by bacteria in the genus Legionella, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (The bacteria can also cause a milder illness called Pontiac fever, which can manifest with fever, muscle aches and headaches.) When diagnosed early, Legionnaires' can be treated successfully with antibiotics.

Health care providers report about 6,000 cases of Legionnaires' disease annually in the U.S., although some cases are likely mistaken as other types of pneumonia. In addition, the infection often does not cause symptoms in healthy people. Individuals who are aged 50 or older, as well as current or former smokers and people with underlying lung or immune issues, are most vulnerable to Legionnaires'. The disease became five times more prevalent between 2000 and 2018 for reasons experts have struggled to identify.

Legionnaires' does not typically spread between people directly; instead people catch the infection by inhaling mist that contains the pathogen. The bacterium particularly thrives in stagnant water between 77 and 113 degrees Fahrenheit (25 and 45 degrees Celsius). Water systems such as cooling towers, large air-conditioning systems, spas and hot tubs can then aerosolize the microbe, making bacterial control in these types of structures a vital prevention measure.

When the current outbreak was first identified, New York City health officials directed an investigation into all cooling towers in the affected neighborhood. These towers evaporate water to dispel heat, and they are a common feature in large buildings in the city. But such structures have long been known to cause some of the largest Legionnaires' outbreaks on record. New York City laws require cooling towers to be registered, tested and disinfected regularly to reduce the presence of Legionella bacteria.

Legionnaires' was first identified at a convention of the American Legion's Department of Pennsylvania (hence the name) that was held in late July 1976. Scientists who helped identified the Legionella bacterium that caused an outbreak among at least 221 people at the convention called the detective work “one of the largest and most complex investigations of an epidemic ever undertaken” in an article published in the October 1979 issue of Scientific American.

Scientists had to rule out potential causes, including foodborne pathogens and metal poisoning, among other challenges, before managing to identify the previously unknown bacterium. Simultaneously, investigators pored through reports of other then recent, mysterious outbreaks of pneumonialike diseases, piecing together an image of an infection that “has turned out to be not very rare after all,” the researchers wrote in their 1979 article.

NASA's Plan for a Nuclear Reactor on the Moon Could Be a Lunar Land Grab

Spurred by competition from China and Russia, the Trump administration is pushing for nuclear power on the moon by 2030

NASA could soon go nuclear on the moon.

The space agency's acting administrator Sean Duffy has issued a directive to expedite building a nuclear reactor on the lunar surface. Duffy, a former Fox News host, is also head of the U.S. Department of Transportation, and he took over leadership of NASA in July after the Trump administration pulled its nomination of private astronaut and businessperson Jared Isaacman.

The directive, first reported by Politico, would accelerate NASA's long-simmering—and, to date, largely fruitless—efforts to develop nuclear reactors to support space science and exploration.

The space agency has pursued various projects over the years, most recently in 2022, when it awarded three $5-million contracts to companies to craft designs for small space-ready reactors meant for lunar operations in the mid-2030s. Inspired in part by a space policy directive issued by President Donald Trump during his first term, those reactors were intended to produce 40 kilowatts of power—enough to sustain a small office building—and to weigh less than six metric tons. Duffy's directive is more ambitious: it calls for NASA to solicit proposals for reactors that would yield at least 100 kilowatts of power and be ready for launch by late 2029. The space agency is tasked with appointing an official to oversee the effort within 30 days and to issue its solicitation within 60 days.

Lunar nights are very long—two Earth weeks—and perilously cold, making nuclear power desirable for surface operations. But according to the directive, the greater impetus for the fast-tracked plan is a burgeoning partnership between China and Russia to build a nuclear-powered outpost near the moon's south pole by the mid-2030s. The sun never crests high above the horizon there, leaving some craters in permanent shadow—and valuable deposits of water ice lacing their eternally dark floors. Despite its cryogenic chill, this lunar region is hotly contested, with NASA's Artemis program also targeting crewed landings there as early as 2027 as part of the Artemis III mission.

Besides providing abundant electricity for surface operations, a nuclear reactor on the moon could also allow for a strategic lunar land grab. Ownership of otherworldly territory is prohibited, according to the United Nations Outer Space Treaty, but the treaty also obliges spacefaring powers to exercise “due regard” in their activities, meaning that they should not encroach on or interfere with sensitive infrastructure built by others. A nuclear reactor placed on the lunar surface, therefore, could allow the declaration of what Duffy's directive calls a “keep-out zone.”

Although the Trump administration's acceleration of NASA's nuclear-power efforts may be welcomed by many space-exploration advocates, it comes alongside other proposals from the White House that seek to radically reshape the space agency and that could be at cross-purposes with the new directive. These include plans for extraordinarily deep cuts to NASA's science programs, as well as an active and ongoing culling of the space agency's workforce. The president's budget request for fiscal year 2026 notably zeroes out funding for a joint program between NASA and the Department of Defense to develop nuclear rocketry. It would also wind down the space agency's ability to build and deploy radioisotope power sources, which offer nuclear-derived heat and electricity sans complex and heavy reactors for robotic missions to the outer planets and other sunlight-sparse parts of the solar system.

The biggest question facing NASA's latest nuclear foray, however, may be what these notional new reactors would actually power. Many experts say a 2027 launch for Artemis III is unlikely and citing factors such as the ongoing difficulties of developing a requisite lunar lander based on SpaceX's Starship rocket. With each logistical misstep or schedule delay, additional Artemis missions that would put more meaningful and power-hungry infrastructure on the moon slip further over the horizon, potentially making the entire program more vulnerable to additional rounds of budget cuts—or even outright cancellation by future administrations.

When given nutritionally matched diets, participants lost twice as much weight eating minimally processed foods compared to ultra-processed foods, suggesting that cutting down on processing could help to sustain a healthy weight long term, finds a new clinical trial led by researchers at UCL and UCLH.

The study, published in Nature Medicine, is the first interventional study comparing ultra-processed food (UPF) and minimally processed food (MPF) diets in 'real world' conditions, as well as being the longest experimental study of a UPF diet to date1.

The trial split 55 adults into two groups. One group started with an eight-week diet of MPF, such as overnight oats or homemade spaghetti Bolognese. After a four-week 'washout' period during which participants went back to their normal diet, they switched to a diet of UPF, such as breakfast oat bars or a lasagna ready meal. The other group completed the diets in the opposite order. In total, 50 participants completed at least one diet.

The provided diets were nutritionally matched in accordance with the Eatwell Guide, the UK's official government advice on how to eat a healthy, balanced diet. This included levels of fat, saturated fat, protein, carbohydrate, salt and fiber, as well as providing recommended intakes of fruits and vegetables. Participants had plenty of food (i.e. more calories than they needed) delivered to their home and were told to eat as much or as little as they wanted, as they would normally. They were not told to limit their intake.

After eight weeks on each diet, both groups lost weight, likely as a result of the improved nutritional profile of what they were eating compared to their normal diet. However, this effect was higher (2.06% reduction) on the MPF diet compared to the UPF diet (1.05% reduction)2.

These changes corresponded to an estimated calorie deficit of 290 kilocalories (kcal) per day on the MPF diet, compared to 120 kcal per day on the UPF diet. To put this in context, the Eatwell Guide recommends a daily energy intake of 2,000 kcal for women and 2,500 kcal for men.

The greater weight loss experienced on the MPF diet came from reductions in fat mass and total body water, with no change in muscle or fat-free mass, indicating a healthier body composition overall.

The findings suggest that, when observing recommended dietary guidelines, choosing minimally processed foods may be more effective for losing weight.

Dr Samuel Dicken, first author of the study from the UCL Centre for Obesity Research and UCL Department of Behavioural Science & Health, said: "Previous research has linked ultra-processed foods with poor health outcomes. But not all ultra-processed foods are inherently unhealthy based on their nutritional profile. The main aim of this trial was to fill crucial gaps in our knowledge about the role of food processing in the context of existing dietary guidance, and how it affects health outcomes such as weight, blood pressure and body composition, as well as experiential factors like food cravings.

"The primary outcome of the trial was to assess percentage changes in weight and on both diets we saw a significant reduction, but the effect was nearly double on the minimally processed diet. Though a 2% reduction may not seem very big, that is only over eight weeks and without people trying to actively reduce their intake. If we scaled these results up over the course of a year, we'd expect to see a 13% weight reduction in men and a 9% reduction in women on the minimally processed diet, but only a 4% weight reduction in men and 5% in women after the ultra-processed diet. Over time this would start to become a big difference."

Participants completed several questionnaires to assess their food cravings before starting the diets, and at weeks four and eight during the diets3.

There were significantly greater improvements in the number of cravings and ability to resist them (craving control) on the MPF diet compared to the UPF diet, despite greater weight loss on the MPF diet that might ordinarily be expected to lead to stronger cravings.

On the MPF diet compared to the UPF diet, participants reported a two-fold greater improvement in overall craving control, a four-fold greater improvement in craving control for savoury food, and an almost two-fold greater improvement in resisting whichever food they most craved.

Professor Chris van Tulleken, an author of the study from UCL Division of Infection & Immunity and UCLH, said: "The global food system at the moment drives diet-related poor health and obesity, particularly because of the wide availability of cheap, unhealthy food. This study highlights the importance of ultra-processing in driving health outcomes in addition to the role of nutrients like fat, salt and sugar. It underlines the need to shift the policy focus away from individual responsibility and on to the environmental drivers of obesity, such as the influence of multinational food companies in shaping unhealthy food environments.

"Stakeholders across disciplines and organisations must work together and focus on wider policy actions that improve our food environment, such as warning labels, marketing restrictions, progressive taxation and subsidies, to ensure that healthy diets are affordable, available and desirable for all."

The trial also measured secondary health markers, such as blood pressure and heart rate, as well as blood markers such as liver function, glucose, cholesterol and inflammation. Across these markers, there were no significant negative impacts of the UPF diet, with either no change, or a significant improvement from baseline.

Generally, there weren't significant differences in these markers between the diets, and the researchers caution that longer studies would be needed to investigate these measures properly in relation to the changes in weight and fat mass.

Professor Rachel Batterham, senior author of the study from the UCL Centre for Obesity Research, said: "Despite being widely promoted, less than 1% of the UK population follows all of the recommendations in the Eatwell Guide, and most people stick to fewer than half.

"The normal diets of the trial participants tended to be outside national nutritional guidelines and included an above average proportion of UPF, which may help to explain why switching to a trial diet consisting entirely of UPF, but that was nutritionally balanced, resulted in neutral or slightly favourable changes to some secondary health markers.

"The best advice to people would be to stick as closely to nutritional guidelines as they can by moderating overall energy intake, limiting intake of salt, sugar and saturated fat, and prioritizing high-fiber foods such as fruits, vegetables, pulses and nuts. Choosing less processed options such as whole foods and cooking from scratch, rather than ultra-processed, packaged foods or ready meals, is likely to offer additional benefits in terms of body weight, body composition and overall health."

A new analysis of the bite strength of 18 species of carnivorous dinosaurs shows that while the Tyrannasaurus rex skull was optimized for quick, strong bites like a crocodile, other giant, predatory dinosaurs that walked on two legs -- including spinosaurs and allosaurs -- had much weaker bites and instead specialized in slashing and ripping flesh. Reported in the Cell Press journal Current Biology on August 4, these findings demonstrate that meat-eating dinosaurs followed different evolutionary paths in terms of skull design and feeding style despite their similarly gigantic sizes.

"Carnivorous dinosaurs took very different paths as they evolved into giants in terms of feeding biomechanics and possible behaviors," said Andrew Rowe of the University of Bristol, UK.

"Tyrannosaurs evolved skulls built for strength and crushing bites, while other lineages had comparatively weaker but more specialized skulls, suggesting a diversity of feeding strategies even at massive sizes. In other words, there wasn't one 'best' skull design for being a predatory giant; several designs functioned perfectly well."

Rowe has always been fascinated by big carnivorous dinosaurs, and he considers them interesting subjects for exploring basic questions in organismal biology. In this study, he and co-author Emily Rayfield wanted to know how bipedalism -- or walking on two legs -- influenced skull biomechanics and feeding techniques.

It was previously known that despite reaching similar sizes, predatory dinosaurs evolved in very different parts of the world at different times and had very different skull shapes. For Rowe and Rayfield, those facts raised questions about whether their skulls were functionally similar under the surface or if there were notable differences in their predatory lifestyles. As there are no massive, bipedal carnivores alive today -- ever since the end-Cretaceous mass extinction event -- the authors note that studying these animals offers intriguing insights into a way of life which has since disappeared.

To examine the relationship between body size and skull biomechanics, the authors used 3D technologies including CT scans and surface scans analyze the skull mechanics, quantify the feeding performance, and measure the bite strength across 18 species of therapod, a group of carnivorous dinosaurs ranging from small to giant. While they expected some differences between species, they were surprised when their analyses showed clear biomechanical divergence.

"Tyrannosaurids like T. rex had skulls that were optimized for high bite forces at the cost of higher skull stress," Rowe says. "But in some other giants, like Giganotosaurus, we calculated stress patterns suggesting a relatively lighter bite. It drove home how evolution can produce multiple 'solutions' to life as a large, carnivorous biped."

Skull stress didn't show a pattern of increase with size. Some smaller therapods experienced greater stress than some larger species due to increased muscle volume and bite forces. The findings show that being a predatory biped didn't always equate to being a bone-crushing giant. Unlike T. rex, some dinosaurs, including the spinosaurs and allosaurs, became giants while maintaining weaker bites more suited for slashing at prey and stripping flesh.

"I tend to compare Allosaurus to a modern Komodo dragon in terms of feeding style," Rowe says. "Large tyrannosaur skulls were instead optimized like modern crocodiles with high bite forces that crushed prey. This biomechanical diversity suggests that dinosaur ecosystems supported a wider range of giant carnivore ecologies than we often assume, with less competition and more specialization."

This research was supported by funding from the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.

Some scientists believe humans became bipedal to adapt to climate change, but our closest primate ancestors complicate that picture.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Although we are a member of the Great Ape primate family, we sport an array of differences from our closest genetic cousins. Our most obvious distinguishing feature is our big brain, which is some three times larger than a chimpanzee's, whose genetic similarity to Homo sapiens is somewhere in the high 90 percent range. However, the human brain may not have grown to such an astonishing size if it wasn't for our second most distinguishing feature—bipedalism. 

Millions of years before the arrival of the genus Homo, some early hominids had the bright idea to free up their hands and start walking upright. Of course, this was a slow process—one that scientists believe was likely kickstarted by climate change, as a warming world turned the forests of equatorial Africa into dry woodland called “savannah-mosaic.” As trees became more sparse, distant human ancestors began walking upright as a more efficient way to move in this new environment. 

Or, at least, that's what we thought. 

Now a new study from scientists at University College London, the Max Planck Institute, and Greater Mahale Ecosystem Research and Conservation in Tanzania shows that the story of human bipedalism isn't so clear-cut. To get a better understanding of what may have taken place six to seven million years ago, scientists studied a population of chimpanzees in Issa Valley along Lake Tanganykia in western Tanzania. The area is perfect for studying bipedalism's origins, as the area is made up of gallery forests and woodland savannah. 

They found that chimpanzees often adopted bipedalism to effectively feed on the sparse woodland trees. This could have been a key driver for ancient hominids developing their upright gait. The results were published in the journal Frontiers, and support the team's previous 2022 findings that first began to piece together this arboreal bipedalism origin story.

“For decades it was assumed that bipedalism arose because we came down from the trees and needed to walk across an open savannah,” Rhianna Drummond-Clarke, lead author of the study, said in a press statement. “Here we show that safely and effectively navigating the canopy can remain very important for a large, semi-arboreal ape, even in open habitat. Adaptations to arboreal, rather than terrestrial, living may have been key in shaping the early evolution of the human lineage.”

During the dry season, modern chimpanzees drift from the forested riverbanks to the savannah-mosaic in search of food. The research team monitoring the adults in the Issa Valley population, taking note of what types and trees and fruits they munched on in the woodlands, and found that they spend the most time in larger trees. They also used specialized techniques—such as standing on branches—to reach highly prized food in the tree's large, open crown.

“We suggest our bipedal gait continued to evolve in the trees even after the shift to an open habitat,” Drummond-Clarke said in a press statement. “Observational studies of great apes demonstrate they can walk on the ground for a few steps, but most often use bipedalism in the trees. It's logical that our early hominin relatives also engaged in this kind of bipedalism, where they can hold onto branches for extra balance.”

The authors admit to some limitations of their theory. For instance, these conclusions only apply to the Issa Valley chimpanzees (so more data would be needed to apply this idea to chimps more broadly), and the feeding patterns were only analyzed during the dry season. The fossil record is also incomplete around the time when African forests initially transitioned to savannah-mosaic.

Although we walk on to legs to navigate our terrestrial world today, our upright gait may actually be an evolutionary relic of our tree-climbing past.

A team of Chinese researchers led by Prof. GAO Caixia from the Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has developed two new genome editing technologies, known collectively as Programmable Chromosome Engineering (PCE) systems.

The study, published online in Cell on August 4, achieves multiple types of precise DNA manipulations ranging from kilobase to megabase scale in higher organisms, especially plants.

Extensive research has demonstrated the immense potential of the site-specific recombinase Cre-Lox system for precise chromosomal manipulation. However, its broader application has been hindered by three critical limitations:

The research team addressed each of these challenges and developed novel methods to advance the state of this technology. First, they built a high-throughput platform for rapid recombination site modification and proposed an asymmetric Lox site design. This led to the development of novel Lox variants that reduce reversible recombination activity by over 10-fold (approaching the background level of negative controls) while retaining high-efficiency forward recombination.

They then leveraged their recently developed AiCE (AI-informed Constraints for protein Engineering), model -- a protein-directed evolution system integrating general inverse folding models with structural and evolutionary constraints -- to develop AiCErec, a recombinase engineering method. This approach enabled precise optimization of Cre's multimerization interface, yielding an engineered variant with a recombination efficiency 3.5 times that of wild-type Cre.

Lastly, they designed and refined a scarless editing strategy for recombinases. By harnessing the high editing efficiency of prime editors, they developed Re-pegRNA, a method that uses specifically designed pegRNAs to perform re-prime editing on residual Lox sites, precisely replacing them with the original genomic sequence, thereby ensuring seamless genome modifications.

The integration of these three innovations led to the creation of two programmable platforms, PCE and RePCE. These platforms allow flexible programming of insertion positions and orientations for different Lox sites, enabling precise, scarless manipulation of DNA fragments ranging from kilobase to megabase scale in both plant and animal cells. Key achievements include: targeted integration of large DNA fragments up to 18.8 kb, complete replacement of 5-kb DNA sequences, chromosomal inversions spanning 12 Mb, chromosomal deletions of 4 Mb, and whole-chromosome translocations.

As a proof of concept, the researchers used this technology to create herbicide-resistant rice germplasm with a 315-kb precise inversion, showcasing its transformative potential for genetic engineering and crop improvement.

This pioneering work not only overcomes the historical limitations of the Cre-Lox system but also opens new avenues for precise genome engineering in a variety of organisms.

The company that makes them certainly seems to think they live up to the hype.

Here's what you'll learn reading this story.

Let's face it, we've all curbed a wheel at some point while driving (an especially painful experience for those of us with aftermarket wheels). However, Unplugged Performance, a high-performance tuning company that makes go-fast parts for Teslas, is claiming that its latest “Road Warrior” wheels are indestructible. Available for the Model 3 and Model Y, Unplugged Performance feels so confident in its engineering that it's offering a free lifetime replacement promotion.

While brute strength is the Road Warriors' main calling card, it has another trick up its sleeve—a removable “curb guard” to protect the most vulnerable outer extremity, where the wheel and tire meet. Now, curb guards are nothing new, but these are made from metal instead of plastic, helping them blend in with the wheel. They're not all that expensive either, at $80 for a two-pack.

The Road Warriors are forged from aerospace-grade 6061-T6 aluminum, unlike the standard Tesla wheels, which are that are cast from lower-grade aluminum. The more advanced forging manufacturing process makes them much stronger, thanks to its ability to minimize the porosity of the material being worked with. Forged wheels are also significantly lighter than cast wheels (even though that may sound counterintuitive to some), but Unplugged is certain that hasn't affected their product's toughness. They claim the Road Warrior carries a load rating of 950 kilograms (2094.39 pounds), making it the strongest aftermarket option for Tesla customers.

The wheels retain an aerodisc profile around their circumference, which was no accident, as Unplugged claims the structurally integrated disc minimizes air turbulence around the wheel to reduce drag. In fact, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) data shows that the Road Warriors very nearly matched Tesla's most aerodynamic 18-inch “Photon” aero cover wheel, with a drag coefficient (Cd) just .010 higher.

All of this technology is neat, but it comes at a cost—these wheels range from $2,795 to $2,995 for a set of four.

We were a little surprised to see Unplugged claim that beyond being designed for car enthusiasts, these sporty-looking rims were intended for taxis and fleet vehicles. But reading their promotional materials, it makes marginally more sense. Think about it: Should Tesla's Robotaxi actually become driverless one day, there's no expectation for the passenger to change a flat tire. That's where an indestructible wheel pays for itself.

Conveniently, the Road Warriors are designed to accommodate the OEM tires and Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) that your Model 3 or Model Y came with. This eliminates the need to spend extra money on a new set of tires, and helps retain the ride comfort, handling, and efficiency that Tesla spent millions to optimize. 

While we admire the engineering that's gone into these wheels, we doubt many fleet managers will opt to swap in Road Warriors, given the nearly $3,000 price tag for a set of four. The only high-performance environment where we see these wheels being widely adopted is police fleets, where they have been tested by Unplugged. For fleet use, implementing a service interval that replaces the standard wheels and tires before they break is much more practical.

Peptides are promising building blocks of designer materials with wide-ranging applications. These materials are stabilized by directional hydrogen-bonding patterns, giving rise to one-dimensional or two-dimensional assembly. It remains a challenge to mimic biology's context-adaptive and flexible structures. Here we introduce minimalistic tripeptide sequences that form highly soluble dynamic ensembles through multivalent side-chain interactions. We observe these supramolecular dispersions undergo drying-induced sequential liquid–liquid phase separation followed by solidification, resulting in the formation of films of stiff, densely packed and porous peptide microparticles that can be instantaneously redispersed upon the re-introduction of water. Air-drying of peptide dispersions in the presence of proteins or small-molecule payloads results in efficient encapsulation and the retention of protein stability after redispersion, showing promise for the emulsification, encapsulation, protection and storage of biomacromolecules. The mechanism resembles the protective strategies in natural systems during desiccation, which rely on liquid–liquid phase separation to survive extreme conditions.

All life forms share conserved sets of building blocks. Biomolecular covalent and non-covalent interactions dictate the rich structural design space, supporting wide-ranging functions, including recognition, self-assembly, catalysis and shapeshifting. Beyond their critical roles in the chemistry of life, these structures provide inspiration for supramolecular materials1,2,3,4 and systems5 for various technological and biotechnological applications6,7,8.

Peptide materials usually contain patterns of backbone hydrogen bonding derived from protein secondary structures9,10,11,12,13, typically giving rise to ordered one-dimensional (1D)14, two-dimensional (2D)15,16 or three-dimensional (3D)17 assemblies. These hydrogen-bond patterns may be further stabilized by aromatic stacking18,19, giving rise to architectures that are remarkably stiff and stable20. This is exemplified by ‘dry' diphenylalanine (FF) zippers21, where the chiral organization of side chains provides additional control over assembly structures22. We previously established that aromatic tripeptides with polar groups, such as lysine–tyrosine–phenylalanine (KYF), retain strong directional self-assembly tendencies complemented with favourable solvent interactions, leading to hydrogelation23.

Besides ordered structures, the notion of non-directional assembly is also common in biology, for example, in liquid condensates, where it typically leads to spherical morphologies dictated by surface tension24,25. In these systems, side-chain interactions dictate the assembly, complementing flexible backbone interactions26. Short peptide motifs that display liquid–liquid phase separation27, including through flexible linkers separating aromatic dipeptides to disrupt directionality28, as well as the formation of unstructured solid glassy states29,30 have been reported.

Beyond structures with varying instrinsic directionalities through backbone or side-chain interactions, biology frequently employs architectures that display structural agility in response to external factors. This may be achieved through dynamic selection and adjustment from the complex side-chain interaction space that is available5. This concept has been demonstrated in synthetic systems, where the adaptive versatility of biomimetic random heteropolymer sequences with flexible backbones and multiple (randomized) functional side chains have been shown to adaptively decorate and wrap proteins31 or to recapitulate the dynamic features of protein ensembles in biofluids32.

Here we introduce sequence designs of tripeptides that are not isotropic through backbone hydrogen-bonding interactions but instead form dynamic ensembles through multiple possible combinations of weak and reversible interactions, by combining polar, hydrogen-bonding aromatic and basic residues (tryptophan (W), tyrosine (Y) and lysine (K); Fig. 1a). We show that these peptides form aqueous dispersions (Fig. 1b) with high aqueous solubility and unique context-adaptive properties, including dehydration-induced liquid–liquid phase separation and the formation of mechanically stiff particles with the ability to wrap, encapsulate, stabilize and protect proteins, while retaining instantaneous dispersibility upon rehydration.

Tripeptide assembly is favoured by sequences of two aromatic amino acids complemented with a charged residue23,33. Aromatic amino acids (Y and W; Fig. 1a,c) add a diversity of interactions beyond backbone hydrogen-bond directionality, including side-chain π-stacking, hydrogen-bonding and dipole–dipole interactions, importantly, including those with water34. Lysine–phenylalanine–phenylalanine (KFF), KYF and lysine–tyrosine–tyrosine (KYY) undergo gelation and phase separation, but lysine–tyrosine–tryptophan (KYW) remarkably retains the appearance of a clear solution up to 20 mM in phosphate buffer23 (Fig. 1b). Notably, KYW assembly is strongly dependent on the ionic context and on forming fibres and gels in unbuffered conditions23,35.

We used atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to understand differences in assembly and hydrogen-bond interactions in KFF, KYF, KYY and KYW (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 11). First, exchanging F → Y → W leads to an increase in the aggregation propensity (AP; Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 12). We analysed the contribution of the backbone–backbone (as a proxy for 1D self-assembly) and side-chain hydrogen bonds (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Figs. 13–16). Consistent with the increased AP, we observed a concomitant increase in the total number of hydrogen bonds in F → Y → W variants, with decreased backbone and increased side-chain hydrogen bonds resulting in non-directional assembly for KYW (Fig. 1d).

We investigated the concentration-dependent behaviour of the KYW peptide using extensive 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses at 1, 20 and 50 mM in pH 7.5 phosphate buffer (Fig. 1f–g and Supplementary Fig. 17 and accompanying text). Across this range, KYW showed no line broadening or signal loss, indicating that it remains highly dynamic and fully soluble even at higher concentrations. The assembly process is driven primarily by π-type hydrophobic interactions, side-chain hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, consistent with a dynamic, non-aggregating state.

The relative contributions of side chains and backbone interactions when substituting F → Y → W are also evident in the circular dichroism spectra (Supplementary Figs. 18–20). At a concentration of 5 mM, which is just above the critical aggregation for KYF and KYY (Supplementary Fig. 20a,b), the spectra show a carbonyl π → π* transition peak at 203 nm (Supplementary Figs. 18, 19a,b and 20a,b), suggesting backbone–backbone interactions, while the transitions of aromatic side chains may also contribute22. For KYW, this transition is less intense, while the appearance of the 229 nm positive signal that increases with concentration (Supplementary Figs. 18 and 19c) confirms the dominating influence of tryptophan side-chain interactions8,36.

We previously demonstrated differential assembly of tripeptide sequence isomers driven by side-chain-induced conformation selection33. We speculated that in a system stabilized by a multitude of possible side-chain and water interactions, these would not be defined by one dominant conformation but instead represented by a rich ensemble of conformers. We studied the six K/Y/W sequence isomers to determine the sequence-dependent self-assembly (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Figs. 21–26) and found lower variation in AP values (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 21) and similar ratios of side-chain/backbone interactions (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Figs. 22–25), consistent with the formation of non-directional ensembles. We also analysed the solvent exposure of tryptophan, measured through the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA; Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 26) of the indole side chain. This was found to be sequence dependent, with tryptophan–tyrosine–lysine (WYK) and tryptophan–lysine–tyrosine (WKY) being the most contrasting in terms of AP and tryptophan solvent exposure (Fig. 2b).

Tryptophan exposure in peptide ensembles could be experimentally verified by measuring the tryptophan emission, which is widely used as a probe to detect the tryptophans' environment and solvent exposure in proteins, with redshifted emissions indicating an increase in local polarity and blueshifts indicating hydrophobic environments37,38,39. These ensembles (20 mM) did not show evidence of phase separation when observed by optical microscope (shown for KYW in Fig. 1b). We measured the emission spectra of all sequence isomers in soluble dispersions (Fig. 2c) and found that emission maxima (excitation wavelength λex = 280 nm) range from 357 nm to 370 nm, with the most redshifted emission corresponding to the most hydrated tryptophan (WYK) and the most blueshifted emission corresponding to the most hydrophobic tryptophan environment (WKY; Fig. 2b). The 3D excitation/emission spectra of contrasting sequences (Fig. 2c) differed by the appearance of a new band in WYK's spectrum at λex = 318 nm, which is also prominent in tyrosine–lysine–tryptophan (YKW) and tyrosine–tryptophan–lysine (YWK). We also found that the intensity and absence/presence of the band is concentration dependent, suggesting its origin from an emissive state of a supramolecular arrangement (Supplementary Fig. 27).

Concentration-dependent NMR studies on all K/Y/W sequence isomers revealed that while all maintain high dynamicity and solubility up to 50 mM, π-type, cation–π, hydrogen-bonding and electrostatic interactions contribute across all isomers, and the nature and strength of intermolecular interactions vary with sequence (Fig. 2d, Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 28 and accompanying text).

The local chemical environment of tryptophan residues was probed by following the NH (W4) and CH (W3) indole protons in the 1H NMR spectra of the six K/Y/W peptide solutions at variable concentrations and showed contrasting concentration-dependent chemical shifts of tryptophan protons (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 29). The indole-ring protons in WYK shift downfield as the concentration increases, indicating their positioning in an electron-poor environment and the formation of a polar network and hydrogen bonding, while (minimal) upfield shifts were observed for WKY, in line with the formation of π-stacking-driven aggregation. The other four sequences exhibited moderate upfield shifts, less pronounced than those of WKY, in agreement with the MD simulation data (Fig. 2a).

To quantify the degree of assembly across peptide sequences, we monitored changes in thioflavin T (ThT) emission upon co-incubation with 20 mM peptide solutions (Fig. 2a), revealing enhanced fluorescence consistent with the formation of dynamic hydrophobic pockets. This sequence-dependent ThT response, aligned with calculated AP scores and supported by NMR chemical shifts, confirms the presence of soluble dispersions featuring dynamic hydrophobic domains.

To further probe dynamic ensembles in solution, we conducted fluorescence spectroscopy across increasing concentrations (2–20 mM), observing progressive tryptophan quenching (Supplementary Fig. 30). Concentration-dependent diffusion changes, analysed by 1H diffusion-ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) NMR, were performed at 1, 20 and 50 mM (Supplementary Fig. 31), revealing decreased diffusion with increasing concentration. The peptide-to-water diffusion ratio suggests small soluble aggregates, consistent with unbroadened 1H NMR signals. The 1H–1H nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) NMR spectra for all six K/Y/W tripeptides highlight water interactions, predominantly at W4 and W3 (Supplementary Fig. 32). WYK and YWK exhibit enhanced water contacts at positions W2 and W1, consistent with higher SASA values (Fig. 2a), while WKY also shows a W1–water correlation that aligns with the 1H NMR downfield shift (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 28 and accompanying text), likely due to its N-terminal location.

Upon investigating the fluorescence of KYW peptide assemblies using confocal microscopy, we observed a remarkable phase separation behaviour triggered by localized evaporation during drying. Given the (competing) role of water in modulating interactions in these dynamic ensembles, in particular those involving tryptophan40, the observation led us to study the assembly during gradual removal of water through the evaporation of sessile droplets41,42,43 (Fig. 3a).

Macroscopically, when observing tripeptide assembly in drying droplets starting from 20 mM peptide dispersions, we observed contrasting behaviours: a strongly scattering opaque ring upon drying for KYW, in contrast to KFF, KYF and KYY, which lead to heterogeneous semi-transparent structures (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Videos 1 and 2). When observed by microscopy (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 33), the differential morphologies (1D fibres versus 3D spherical objects) are evident (Supplemental Fig. 34 showing KFF and KYF). Over time, KYW and its five sequence isomers all display a remarkable drying-induced phase separation behaviour, giving rise to the formation of films composed of densely packed spherical particles (Fig. 3d, Supplementary Video 3 and Extended Data Fig. 2a,b), contrasting with KFF, KYF and KYY, which lead to 1D structures resembling previous observations for the evaporation-driven assembly of peptide derivatives43 (Supplementary Fig. 34, Extended Data Fig. 2a and Supplementary Videos 4–6). We propose that the multitude of possible interactions and the flexibility of the backbone enable the K/Y/W peptides to more effectively reconfigure and adapt to the newly formed interfaces that form upon water evaporation. The observed directionality (in the case of KFF, KYF, KYY) or lack of directionality (in the case of K/Y/W) initiates at the molecular level and clearly translates hierarchically to macroscopic scales. We observe complex drying patterns related to the solvent and solute gradients in the drying of droplets, with phase separation occurring at the drying front due to concentration gradients inside the drying droplet. Streaks observed during drying are a consequence of complex Marangoni flows in these drying droplets (Extended Data Fig. 2c–f and Supplementary Video 7).

Based on the previously reported interfacial supramolecular aggregation of tripeptides in oil–water emulsions35, we hypothesized that the ensembles would lead to interfacial aggregation and a reduction in surface tension. We measured the dynamic tension profile via the pendant drop method44 of the six K/Y/W tripeptides, which have contrasting tryptophan solvent exposures and environments. The dynamic surface tension indicates that the peptide sequence dictates the surface activity, with a general trend observed in which less solvent-exposed tryptophan (in WKY) gives rise to higher surface activity (Supplementary Fig. 35), demonstrating that the peptide ensembles dynamically interact at the air–water interface.

Time-dependent cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) images illustrate the nanoscale structural transformations from amorphous aggregates to spherical droplets to porous droplets observed at the early stages of assembly (Extended Data Fig. 3). Dynamic droplet fusion and subsequent solidification is captured by time-lapse confocal microscopy (Fig. 3e, Supplementary Fig. 36 and Supplementary Video 8). Time-dependent confocal analysis revealed the onset of pore formation upon solidification (Fig. 3f,g). Time-dependent fluorescence spectroscopy during the drying-induced assembly gave rise to a decreased emission due to concentration-induced quenching, followed by a sharp fluorescence increase upon liquid–liquid phase separation (5–10 min), and subsequent quenching during droplet solidification (Supplementary Fig. 37).

Upon analysis of the tryptophan emission in the dried films at 5% relative humidity, we noted a general loss of emission from the 318 nm band in the 3D excitation/emission spectra, with spectra of the dried films now suggesting a redistribution of conformations (Supplementary Figs. 38 and 39). The original variable tryptophan exposure was partly recovered by temporarily exposing the solid film to high humidity (95% relative humidity). These data highlight the adaptive nature of the assemblies, in which tryptophan partitioning reversibly changes depending on the water competing via weak multivalent interactions.

Upon microscopy analysis of the dried particulate films, we observed the expected spherical objects, but also porous, disc-shaped particles of varying sizes with flat surfaces (Fig. 4a). These structures are found at the top of the sample (Fig. 4b,c and Extended Data Fig. 4), suggesting that they are formed at the air–water interface. The observation suggests that, in contrast to typical dense coacervate droplets that form as a sediment, the structures studied here are low-density, buoyant condensates. The observation of flattened 2D hemispherical objects suggests that these particles are initially liquid, and due to their low density, they rise to the interface, where they deform, flatten and solidify. This optical observation (Supplementary Fig. 41) is confirmed using focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM; Fig. 4c), which shows a part-circular cross-section. The pore size distribution ranged from 30–500 nm (Supplementary Fig. 40).

We propose that the observed buoyancy is related to the formation of gas bubbles inside liquid droplets (Fig. 4a). This may be a consequence of a loss of solvating water from the peptide structures, water that is replaced with air and leads to micro-cavitation, resulting in a porous structure upon dehydration (Fig. 4a). Notably, degassing of the peptide dispersion prior to evaporation-driven assembly leads to smaller particles of more spherical morphology (Fig. 5e). This observation indicates that the buoyant nature of the droplets relates to their gas content, and it can be regulated. Non-surface particles are smaller and spherical, indicating fusion and flattening at the air–water interface (Fig. 4b,c). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of glutaraldehyde-crosslinked KWY particles reveals the porous and spherical structure of the non-surface particles (Fig. 4d). The hemispherical porous structure was further confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM; Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 4). A Young's modulus from Derjaguin-Muller-Toporov (DMT) model fitting analysis demonstrated that these particles, formed by all sequence isomers, are mechanically stiff (6 GPa) due to the efficient packing (Fig. 4f), in line with previously reported FF derivatives20,21.

We first investigated whether the size distribution of the particles formed could be controlled. Given the important role of water evaporation in this process, we reasoned that by simply increasing the temperature, evaporation would occur faster and consequently, the formation of solid particles would be accelerated. We observed that temperature increase leads to more homogeneous and smaller particles (Fig. 5a,b and Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). The combination of reduced buoyancy, due to lower gas content at elevated temperature, with the acceleration of the phase transition and solidification yields particles that are monodisperse (Extended Data Fig. 5c,d and Supplementary Fig. 41). Another approach to control sphericity was through an increase of the buffer concentration, which results in smaller and monodisperse particles (Fig. 5c), observed through an accelerated phase change and solidification (Fig. 5d and Extended Data Fig. 5e).

As an alternative method to control particle size, we removed the air from the solution through sonication under a vacuum, followed by storage under argon gas, and examined the drying process in a degassed solution under argon. Live confocal time-lapse imaging of the particle-forming process revealed smaller droplets (Extended Data Fig. 5f). Further Imaris 3D reconstruction and analysis demonstrated a 20-fold reduction in particle volume and increase in sphericity in the degassed samples compared with a prevalence of disc-shaped particles in non-degassed samples (Fig. 5e–g and Supplementary Videos 9 and 10). Consistent with the role of air in pore formation, degassed peptide particles show fewer and smaller pores (Extended Data Fig. 5g).

Next we probed the reversibility of the process. Upon a re-introduction of a 5 µl droplet of water on top of a dried film, the structures immediately redispersed, as shown in Fig. 5h. When this droplet was left to dry again, the particle film reappeared after a few minutes, demonstrating that the process is fully reversible (Supplementary Video 11). These observations strongly contrast with those previously reported for peptide materials, where the formations of 1D and 2D structures are highly stable due to a large enthalpic gain from cooperative hydrogen bonds, which are not readily reversed20,21. Peptide ensembles with multivalent, weak and dynamic interactions offer more reversible assemblies, as water solvation can compete with the energetics of the interaction space5.

We propose that the spontaneous formation of tightly packed particles upon air-drying could be useful in encapsulation, protection and drying strategies, inspired by phase-separation protection mechanisms seen in biological systems45 (Fig. 6a). We first used the small organic fluorophore Alexa 488, which has been previously demonstrated to non-covalently conjugate through the sulfonate group and lysine side chains46. Upon introduction of the dye, it is encapsulated during KWY droplet formation and solidification (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Video 12). Analysis of the fluorescence intensity of the preload mixture of peptides and dye, the formed liquid droplets and the post-load solution revealed a highly efficient enrichment of the dye inside the particles. Similar efficient encapsulation was obtained for crystal violet, a positively charged hydrophobic dye (Extended Data Fig. 6).

Next, inspired by the ability of dynamic interacting block copolymers with random distributions of side-chain functionalities to stabilize proteins through an adaptive matching of side-chain interactions to complementary patches on the protein surface31, we investigated the ability to encapsulate and stabilize enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). We observed efficient encapsulation in WKY (Fig. 6c, Supplementary Fig. 42a,b and Supplementary Video 13). By comparing the encapsulation efficiency across the six sequence isomers, we conclude that both the Alexa 488 and EGFP encapsulation efficiencies are comparable for all peptide sequence isomers studied (Extended Data Fig. 7).

As EGFP fluorescence requires a folded conformation, we evaluated the preservation of structure in the dried state (Fig. 6d). After drying and subsequent rehydrating, the EGFP solution loses its fluorescence, whereas the WKY + EGFP sample shows retention of fluorescence emission after drying and storage in dried form for five days, followed by instantaneous re-dissolution (Fig. 6e,f). The control KYF + EGFP (fibrous assembly)23 reveals a decrease in the fluorescence (Fig. 6e,f and Supplementary Fig. 42c), suggesting a level of stabilization through protein–peptide interactions.

These results highlight that the drying peptide ensembles provide an environment where proteins are stabilized, including in the dried state, possibly through mechanisms analogous to dynamic interfacial complexation via the self-organization of side chains with a protein surface45 (Fig. 6a). Using either a desiccator or lyophilizer, we found comparable EGFP fluorescence recovery, indicating that further dehydration does not impair dry-state protein preservation (Supplementary Fig. 43). Under degassed conditions, we observed that the encapsulation of EGFP inside the particles was comparable to that at ambient conditions and does not depend on the microporosity (Supplementary Fig. 44).

The encapsulation mechanism in this system is distinct from conventional partitioning into preformed condensates. Here, small molecules or proteins first interact with dynamic peptide ensembles in solution through non-covalent side-chain interactions—particularly electrostatic and π-related contacts involving the lysine, tyrosine and tryptophan residues. These interactions result in complexation with the payload in solution, before phase separation resembling previously described dynamic surface-stabilization approaches32, enabling efficient engulfment of the payload during droplet formation.

A series of experiments support this mechanism: tryptophan fluorescence quenching confirmed the binding, before the liquid–liquid phase separation, of both positively and negatively charged aromatic dyes (crystal violet and Alexa 488; Extended Data Fig. 6a,b), and confocal microscopy demonstrated efficient encapsulation regardless of charge (Extended Data Fig. 6c–e). GFP variants with varied net charge47,48 revealed that a higher charge enhances encapsulation (Extended Data Fig. 8a–d), reinforcing the role of electrostatics and π-interactions. Furthermore, simultaneous encapsulation of multiple fluorescent proteins of differing charge and colour49 preserved the fluorescence over time, highlighting the system versatility (Extended Data Fig. 8e,f). Finally, functional lysozyme encapsulation and the retention of active enzyme after 15 days in the dried state confirmed both the stability and bioactivity preservation (Fig. 6g and Supplementary Fig. 45). The drying-induced assembly process was evaluated for potential scalability by heating, vacuum (Extended Data Fig. 9a) or producing small droplets for rapid drying, resulting in comparable particle formation and EGFP encapsulation within these sprayed micro-droplets (Extended Data Fig. 9b–d and Supplementary Video 14). These data suggest that K/Y/W isomer tripeptides offer potential for encapsulation, drying, storage and the redispersion of biomolecules.

We demonstrate the unique phase behaviour of tripeptides that form non-directional soluble dispersions covering a rich interaction space, leading to context-adaptive assembly. Through air-drying, these K/Y/W tripeptides lead to the spontaneous formation of high-porosity solids upon water evaporation that are instantaneously redispersed. The observed assembly and phase behaviour is governed by side-chain interactions, in contrast to the rigid-backbone hydrogen-bond topologies that typically dictate directional architectures in self-assembling molecules. We demonstrate that the six sequence isomers of K/W/Y form soluble ensembles with the sequence dictating the preferred interactions, but upon drying-induced assembly, all sequences lead to particle films with comparable emission in the dried state, suggesting that regardless of sequence, tryptophan has comparable stabilizing interactions. The phase separation process enables the encapsulation of small-molecule and protein payloads, and they are rapidly and fully reversible upon the re-introduction of water. We propose that this peptide-based evaporation-driven emulsification and encapsulation approach, without mechanical energy input, may find applications in the storage, formulation and desiccation protection of both biomolecules and biomacromolecules. Tryptophan's rich interaction potential makes it a good candidate for adaptive and interfacial assembly5,8, building on its roles in proteins that are enabled by its unique heteroaromatic nature, such as its specific interfacial functions, for example, near lipid bilayers and ion channels50,51. We note a remarkable similarity with the protective mechanism of the natural adaptations in organisms such as tardigrades and plant seeds, which rely on liquid–liquid phase separation and vitrification of disordered proteins to preserve biomolecular function45,52.

All reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. Peptides were either synthesized in‑house or purchased from GenScript and used after trifluoroacetic acid removal.

All-atom tripeptide (PDB) structures (KFF, KYF, KYY, KYW, KWY, WKY, WYK, YKW and YWK) were generated using Avogadro (ref. 53) or PyMOL v.2.5.0. These were then processed using the GROMACS tool gmx pdb2gmx to generate a topology file in the OPLS-AA/L all-atom force field54 (2001 amino acid dihedrals), and the TIP3P (ref. 55) explicit water model was chosen to simulate the solvent. The ionizable peptide side chains and termini were set to their respective charged states (NH3+ for Lys and N termini, and COO− for C termini), and 60 molecules of these tripeptides were inserted in an 8 × 8 × 8 nm3 box using a random seed with the tool gmx insert-molecules, giving an effective peptide concentration of ~200 mM. This box was then solvated using the tool gmx solvate by using a pre-equilibrated solvent box (SPC216) as a reference. Sixty solvent molecules were then randomly replaced by 60 Cl− ions to neutralize the net positive charge from the cationic tripeptides using the tool gmx genion. This neutralized box was subjected to steepest-descent energy minimization to remove packing conflicts. Short (1 ns) NVT (constant number of particles, volume and temperature) (temperature T = 298 K) and NPT (constant number of particles, pressure and temperature) (T = 298 K and pressure P = 1 bar) equilibrations were carried out while imposing position restraints on the peptides to allow the water to equilibrate. Self-assembly production MD simulations in the NPT ensemble were then carried out for 1,000 ns in triplicate for all sequences with no restraints on positions with the GROMACS v.2022.x package56 using the leap-frog integrator (time step = 2 fs). LINCS (ref. 57) was used to constrain bonds, and the particle mesh Ewald method was used for long-range electrostatics with a Coulomb and van der Waals cut-off of 1.0 nm each. Temperature coupling was achieved using the modified Berendsen thermostat58, whereas isotropic pressure coupling was maintained using the Parrinello–Rahman barostat59. The trajectory was saved every 100.0 ps or 0.1 ns, giving 10,000 frames per 1,000 ns simulation. The last 50 ns or 500 frames were used for statistical analysis of hydrogen bonding, SASA and AP.

The number of hydrogen bonds were measured in peptide–peptide interactions (total) as well as backbone–backbone, backbone/side-chain and side-chain/side-chain interactions using the tool gmx hbond with the donor–acceptor distance cut-off set to 0.35 nm and the hydrogen–donor–acceptor angle cut-off set to 30°. SASA was measured for the total peptides and the tryptophan side chain specifically using the tool gmx sasa with a solvent probe radius of 0.14 nm. Running AP was computed by a custom Python script dividing the initial SASA by the SASA at the current frame: AP = SASAinitial/SASAtime. Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD; ref. 60) was used to visualize the trajectories and render the water surface around the tryptophan side chain within the 3 Å first hydration shell.

Peptide solutions (and aggregates) were prepared by dissolving peptides in 100 mM sodium PB at pH 8 to a final peptide concentration of 20 mM. The pH was adjusted to 7.5 using 0.5 M HCl solution. The stock solution was heated for 5 min at 70 °C and left to cool for 1 h at room temperature (22–25 °C) to remove kinetically trapped aggregates. For lower concentrations (from 0.5 mM to 10 mM), the stock solutions were first heated and then left to cool to room temperature and the required amount collected. The diluted solutions were then heated for 5 min at 70 °C and aged for 1 h at room temperature.

Peptide solutions (and aggregates) were prepared by dissolving peptides in 100 mM sodium PB at pH 8 to final peptide concentrations of 1 mM, 20 mM and 50 mM in a 90:10 (v/v) H2O/D2O ratio. The pH was adjusted to 7.5 using 0.5 M HCl solution. The stock solution was heated for 5 min at 70 °C and left to cool for 1 h at room temperature (22–25 °C) to remove kinetically trapped aggregates. For lower concentrations (from 0.5 mM to 10 mM), the stock solutions were first heated and then left to cool to room temperature and the required amount collected. The diluted solutions were then heated for 5 min at 70 °C and aged for 1 h at room temperature.

The 1H and 19F NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker AVANCE HD III 700.20 MHz spectrometer and 282.2 MHz in the frequencies of 1H and 19F, respectively. The NMR experiments were performed at 298.2 K on a 5 mm QCI-F cryoprobe and on a multinuclear Broadband Fluorine Observe (BBFO) probe with z gradients. Typical 1D 19F NMR acquisition parameters were as follows: 8.0 μs pulse length (60° flip angle), 100 ppm sweep width (65,789 Hz) centred at −80 ppm, 0.50 s acquisition time, 2 s relaxation delay time and 256 scans (11 min). The 1D 19F NMR spectra were processed with 5 Hz exponential line broadening and visualized using TopSpin v.3.6.4. The 1D 1H NMR spectra were acquired using excitation sculpting (zgesgp) for water suppression, 32,768 points (time domain) and a recycling delay (relaxation delay (d1)) of 1.5 s. The 2D NMR experiments (1H–1H correlation spectroscopy (COSY), 1H–1H NOESY, 13C/1H heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) and 13C/1H heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC)) were acquired at 298.2 K using the same spectrometer and cryoprobe. The number of scans was set according to sample concentration. For the 13C/1H HSQC experiments (the hsqcetgpprsisp2.2 pulse program), the 1JCH was adjusted to 145 Hz, and the 13C/1H HMBC experiments (the hmbcgplpndprqf pulse program) were performed using an nJCH of 6 Hz; both pulse sequences used presaturation for water suppression. The 1H diffusion (DOSY) experiments were performed using the stimulated echo pulse sequence, stebpgp1s19. The following parameters were used for all peptides and at all concentrations: diffusion time (Δ) was set to 80 ms, the little delta (δ) was set to 2.4 ms, a linear ramp of 16 points varying from 1.019 to 47.906 G cm−1 was used and a d1 of 1.5 s was used. The water diffusion coefficient at the different peptide concentrations was measured using the stimulated echo pulse sequence without water suppression, stebpgp1s. The diffusion time (Δ) was set to 20 ms, the little delta (δ) was set to 2.0 ms, a linear ramp of 16 points varying from 1.019 to 42.809 G cm−1, and a d1 of 2 s was used.

Evaporation-driven assembly was performed by depositing 5 µl droplets of peptide solution (prepared as per previous section) on a glass no. 1.5 coverslip and leaving it to evaporate at room temperature (22–25 °C) at around 40–50% humidity. For the imaging of the final products of peptides after evaporation, the 5 µl droplets were left to dry at the ambient conditions indicated above for about 30 min. The coverslips with dried peptide residue were subsequently used for analysis by confocal microscopy, AFM, FIB-SEM or TEM, with sample preparation and imaging occurring within 1 h. For live imaging, the droplets were first left to evaporate at ambient conditions for about 10 min and then moved to the confocal stage for time-lapse imaging under laser excitation. We note that while this approach may elevate the temperature of samples by a few degrees, we observe similar behaviour in the absence of laser irradiation.

Fluorescence emission and excitation spectra were measured on a JASCO FP-8500 spectrofluorometer with emitted light measured orthogonally to the excitation light sourced from a xenon lamp in quartz cells with a path length of 1.5 mm. The spectra were measured on 50 µl peptide solutions, using a scanning speed of 200 nm min−1 with an emission bandwidth of 5 nm, a 1 nm data collection interval, a 1 s response time and medium sensitivity. The 3D spectra were recorded at λex = 230 to 450 nm and λem = 230 to 600 nm.

Emission spectra were recorded on Jasco FP-6500 fluorometer, using a 1.5 mm black quartz cuvette. The spectra were measured with a bandwidth of 2.5 nm and response time of 0.1 s, with collection at 500 nm min−1 and 0.1 nm intervals. Some 15 µl of each sample was placed on the cuvette and excited at 488 nm. The emission spectra were recorded from 490 to 580 nm. The dry samples were resolubilized with 15 µl distilled water to evaluate their fluorescence in solution. The experiment was replicated with three individual samples.

Degassing was carried out by placing the peptide sample in a small Eppendorf vial and placing this in a septum vial. The sample was then placed on ice and put under vacuum for 5–10 min while being sonicated and subsequently refilled with argon. This was repeated five times. Alternative degassing by a 20 min gentle sonication in a Bioruptor (30 s on and 30 s off, 20 cycles) at 4 °C achieved a similar degassing effect.

Some 5 µl droplets of peptides were deposited onto a glass coverslip and allowed to dry at room temperature. To assess the drying time and patterns at the macroscopic level, videos coupled with microscopy were taken of the drying process. Bright-field videos of KFF, KYF, KYY, KYW and PBS were taken using a Zeiss Stemi 580 dissecting microscope outfitted with a smartphone adaptor (Celestron NexYZ three-axis universal smartphone adaptor for a telescope, purchased from Amazon.com) at ×2.5 physical zoom and ×2 digital zoom to allow for recording with a smartphone (iPhone 13, 12MP camera system). Side-view video of KYW was taken by a wireless digital microscope at ×75 zoom (STPCTOU wireless digital microscope, 2MP camera, 1080P, purchased from Amazon.com) connected to a Dell Precision Tower 5810 computer, using the microscope's companion recording software, Inskam. Post-processing of the videos to create time-lapses was performed in Adobe Premier Pro.

Confocal imaging was performed using a Zeiss LSM880 Airyscan instrument. Live images were taken, focusing at the bottom left edge of the 5 µl drying peptide droplet sample at ×10 or ×20 magnification. Time series were taken with a scan speed of 7 or 8, a line average of 2 and a frame size of 1,024 × 1,024 or 512 × 512 pixels under the objective EC Plan Neofluor ×10 (0.3 numerical aperture) or Plan Apo ×20 (0.8 numerical aperture). Time-lapse videos were captured continuously without interval and exported as .avi files at 10–25 frames per second. Processing of the videos to create time-lapses was performed in Adobe Premier Pro.

For the confocal imaging of dried peptide samples, 5 µl of each peptide sample was deposited onto a no. 1.5 coverslip and allowed to dry at the ambient conditions indicated above or on a heated plate at a designated temperature, and the complete dried samples were subjected to confocal imaging. Transmitted light coupled with a 561 nm laser at 0.2% laser power and a T-PMT detector module was used to capture the bright-field imaging under a Plan Apo ×20, 0.8 numerical aperture objective. A 405 nm laser at 1.0% laser power was used to detect the weak but traceable blue fluorescence (414–472 nm) of the peptide aggregates, and the blue fluorescence signal was used for Imaris 3D rendering.

For the encapsulation of the Alexa 488 experiment, 1 mM aqueous stock solution of Alexa 488 dye (Thermo Fisher) was added such that the final concentration of the dye was 10 µM. For the encapsulation of the crystal violet experiment, 1 mM aqueous stock solution of crystal violet dye (Thermo Scientific) was mixed with 20 mM WKY peptide solution to reach the final concentration of 10 µM. For the encapsulation experiment of native EGFP (charge –7), lyophilized recombinant EGFP was purchased from ProSpec (catalogue no. PRO-1606) and reconstituted into 100 µg ml−1 stock solution. The stock solution was mixed with 20 mM WKY or KYF or 10 mM PBS solution to a final concentration of 10 µg ml−1. For encapsulation of the varying charged GFP proteins, a 2 mg ml−1 aqueous stock solution of GFP with net charge of −30, −18, 0 or +18 was mixed with 20 mM WKY solution to a final concentration of 10 µg ml−1. For the simultaneous encapsulation of multiple proteins, 2 mg ml−1 aqueous stock solutions of miRFP682 (−6), mScarlet (+5) and GFP (0) were mixed with 20 mM WKY solution to a final concentration of 10 µg ml−1 each.

All the encapsulation assays were conducted using 5 µl of the mixture dropped onto a coverslip. For Alexa 488 and EGFP protein encapsulation imaging, a 488 nm laser at 0.5% and 0.3% laser power was used, respectively, to detect green fluorescence emission at 502–561 nm, together with transmitted light to detect the peptide aggregate structure. For crystal violet imaging, an excitation wavelength of 561 nm at 0.2% laser power was used to detect red fluorescence emission at 575–631 nm. For various charged GFP protein encapsulations, a 488 nm laser at 0.2% laser power and an emission of 502–561 nm were used. For the multicolour fluorescent protein encapsulation experiment, a 488 nm laser at 0.2% laser power was used to detect GFP (0) emission at 502–561 nm; a 561 nm laser at 0.2% laser power was used to detect red fluorescent protein mScarlet (+5) emission at 575–631 nm; and a 633 nm laser at 0.5% laser power was used to detect near infrared fluorescent protein miRFP682 (−6) emission at 638–677 nm. All the fluorescence imaging was captured together with transmitted light to detect the peptide aggregate structure.

For the lysozyme–Alexa 488 encapsulation assay, a 100 µg ml−1 aqueous stock solution of lysozyme–Alexa 488 was mixed with 20 mM WKY or PBS solution to a final concentration of 10 µg ml−1. For confocal fluorescence imaging, 5 µl of each mixture was dropped onto a coverslip to dry through evaporation at ambient conditions. The dried particles were examined using a confocal microscope with excitation at 488 nm by a laser and green fluorescence emission of 502–561 nm.

For the lysozyme preservation experiment, three 5 µl droplets of a mixture of 20 mM WKY plus 10 µg ml−1 lysozyme were dropped onto a coverslip for an evaporation assay at ambient conditions. The dried particles were rehydrated using 5 µl double-distilled H2O on day 0 and day 15. The rehydrated solution from 3 dried droplets were combined into a measurable volume of 15 µl as one replicate to proceed with concentration measurement using a Chicken Lysozyme ELISA Kit (NOVUS Biologicals, catalogue no. NBP2-60088) following manufacturer instructions. A microplate reader (SpectraMax 190) was used to measure absorbance at 450 nm, with the correction wavelength set at 540 nm. A four-parameter logistic standard curve was generated by plotting the mean absorbance for each standard on the x axis against the concentration on the y axis using GraphPad Prism. The data were linearized by plotting the log of the lysozyme concentrations versus the log of the optical density, and the best fit line was determined by regression analysis. The reading of optical density values of each sample was matched to this standard curve to obtain the corresponding lysozyme concentration. All experiments were carried out in three replicates.

For scaling up the evaporation by heat, 20 µl of WKY peptide solution was dropped onto a coverslip, which was placed on a heated plate at 35 °C. For scaling up the evaporation by vacuum, a coverslip with 20 µl of 20 mM WKY peptide solution was placed in a desiccator connected to a vacuum. The start of the drying was seen by the forming of an opaque ring at the edge of the drop, and the completion of the drying was determined by the closing of the ring structure to form an opaque film. The duration of each process under each condition was recorded.

For scaling up the evaporation by spraying, 20 µl of 20 mM WKY peptide solution was injected into an HTX M5 sprayer (HTX Tech) through a Microfluidics Programmable Syringe Pump (NE-1002X). Different flow rates of 40, 60, 80 and 160 µl min−1 were tested. The same spray parameters were used for all tested flow rates: a velocity of 1,300 mm min−1, track spacing of 2 mm, N2 pressure of 10 psi and nozzle height of 40 mm. The sprayer was operated for 15 s to complete one spray cycle. Spraying at the flow rate of 80 µl min−1 achieved the best retention of the micro-drop morphology.

To analyse the encapsulation efficiency of the spray system, 20 µl of 20 mM WKY peptide solution with 10 µg ml−1 EGFP was injected into the HXT M5 and sprayed at 80 µl min−1. The enrichment of GFP fluorescence in the dried particles within each micro-drop was examined using confocal microscopy, as described above.

Confocal z-stack images were obtained at ×20 magnification with ×4 zoom. The optical sections were taken at the optimal interval suggested by a Zeiss Zen Black 8.0 with 50% overlap. The thickness of the sets of z stacks ranged from 10 µm to 15 µm. The z-stack images were exported as .czi files and then converted to .ims files using ImarisConverter. Analysis was done on Imaris v.10.0.0 (Bitplane) and MatLab v.8.0 (Mathworks) on a Dell Precision 7920 Workstation with a 12 GB NVIDIA 4070Ti graphics card. The 3D reconstruction was performed on z-stack images using the ‘Spots' and ‘Surfaces' functions in Imaris with a surface detail of 0.4 µm and automatic thresholding using local contrast in transparency mode. Objects were statistically coded by diameter, with a range of 0.5 µm to 8 µm. MATLAB XTension was used to control camera angles in animated videos. Approximately 200–1,000 particles were analysed in each of the conditions. Dots were not marked due to large sample size (n > 10). Quantification of object diameter, volume or sphericity was generated in the Imaris statistics tab, and GraphPad Prism was used to generate box plots. The moving tracks of the liquid–liquid phase separation droplets were reconstructed using the ‘Object Tracking' function of Imaris, and the sum of the tracks at the end of the movement was presented with the time being pseudo colour-coded.

TEM grids were purchased from Ted Pella (product no. 01895-F) with a lacey carbon support film. All grids were treated for 35 s in Fischione Nanoclean 1070 (70% power) with a mixture of argon (75%) and oxygen (25%). Cryo-EM grids were prepared in Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 21 °C with the following settings: relative humidity, 100%; wait time, 0 s; blot time, 3 s; and blot force, 4. A 2 µl of sample solution was gently pipetted onto a freshly glow-discharged lacey carbon grid and put through evaporation under ambient conditions for the indicated periods of time before being blotted with filter paper and plunged into liquid ethane that was precooled by liquid nitrogen. The cryo-EM grids were then transferred to and stored in liquid nitrogen. The cryo-EM grid was transferred in liquid nitrogen into a Gatan 626 cryo-specimen holder that was then inserted into the microscope stage. The specimen temperature was maintained at about −170 °C during data collection. Cryo-EM imaging was performed in low dose mode of a Titan Halo TEM instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operating at 300 kV, and images were recorded on a CETA camera (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

The 5 µl peptide samples were first applied onto glass slides and air dried. They were then mounted onto SEM pin stubs using double-sided carbon tape. Gold was sputter-coated on the sample surface to a thickness of 10 nm using a Leica EM ACE600 coater for better electrical conductivity. These samples were then imaged in a Thermo Scientific (FEI) Helios NanoLab 660 FIB-SEM instrument with a high tension (voltage) of 5 kV and a current of 25 pA using an Everhart–Thornley detector and a through lens detector. A FIB was used with Ga+ ions at 30 kV and 0.79 nA to mill cross sections at a scale of tens of micrometres. The stage was tilted at 52° for FIB milling and cross-section imaging.

Height images and mechanical property mapping were simultaneously carried out in PeakForce QNM (quantitative nanoscale mechanical) tapping mode using a Bruker Multimode 8 AFM. The optical lever sensitivity of the AFM cantilevers (RTESPA-525, Bruker) was calibrated on a sapphire surface. The cantilever spring constant was calibrated by Bruker Thermal Tune software. Prior to measuring tripeptide samples, a flat polystyrene surface of 3.5 GPa Young's modulus was used to confirm the Young's modulus reading of the AFM set-up. The measurement from 5–10 solid porous particles or fibres of each peptide was plotted.

Chemical shift perturbation (Δδ in ppb) between 50 mM and 1 mM concentrations for each proton in various peptide sequence isomers. Each plot corresponds to a different sequence, with downfield shifts represented as positive values and upfield shifts as negative values. Each bar represents the average of three independent experiments, with s.d. error bars from 3 replicates.

Bright field microscopy images of the time course of KWY, WKY, WYK, YWK and YKW evaporation process; c-f. Streaks formation during the evaporation-driven peptide solution drying. The moving tracks of the KYW droplets during the drying process were reconstructed using Imaris; d-e. based on the timelapsing confocal images. (a).

Source data

a. Drop of 2 µl WYK solution was applied onto the TEM grid and went through evaporation under ambient conditions for indicated time and proceeded with cryo-EM. Cryo-EM images illustrate the structural transformations from random aggregates and short fibers to spherical assemblies. Scale bar = 500 nm; b. Cryo-EM micrographs of different resolutions captured at 5'03” show the process of evaporation-driven porous droplet formation, and the temporal information could be decoded from spatial information; c. Different stages of the assembly process are captured. 1. early stage formation of nanosized spherical assembly; 2-4. nano-sized air pockets inside spherical peptide assemblies; 5-7. larger spheres with multiple pores; 8. fusion of larger spheres with multiple pores. Scale bar = 200 nm.

Source data

The first column shows SEM images of all nine tripeptides. KFF, KYF and KYY show similar linear fiber-like structures. The other six tripeptides show sphere structures of various sizes, each of such spheres containing hollow bubbles. The second, third, and forth columns show the height, 3D topography, and stiffness (Young's Modulus) AFM images.

Source data

a. The effect of temperature on the size of porous peptide particles formed by tripeptides, and KWY was shown. For Imaris 3D Rendering, traceable blue fluorescence signals excited by 405 nm were captured by confocal coupling with bright-field imaging. Spot rendering was employed to analyze the diameter of the particle; b. while the actual shape was revealed by surface rendering in high transparency mode; c-d. The Sphericity of approximately 200 particles at 40 °C and 1000 particles at 80 °C were profiled, indicating that at high temperature, droplets are not given sufficient time to accumulate at the interface and consequently remain rounded. In violin plot, the horizontal lines display the median as well as 25th and 75th percentiles.); e. Buffer concentration regulates the dynamics of tripeptide particle formation. 20 mM WKY peptide was dissolved in phosphate buffer at the concentrations of 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000 mM. Imaris 3D rendering of the dried particles at each concentration demonstrated reduction in particle size and increase in homogeneity with the increase of salt concentration. Color scale bar represents size, scale bar = 10 µm; f. The peptide solution was degassed followed by evaporation assay, and the example of WKY is shown. Time-lapse confocal imaging of bright field and 405 nm excitation demonstrated reduction in particle size. Scale bar = 50 µm; g. Further AFM analysis of WKY shows fewer and smaller pores in the dried particles of the degassed sample.

Source data

a-b Tryptophan fluorescence spectra of WKY (20 mM in 100 mM PB pH 7.5) in the absence and presence of dye at increasing concentrations (10 µM, 100 µM, 500 µM): (a) Alexa 488, (b) Crystal Violet. c. Confocal live imaging of WKY peptide particles incorporating crystal violet shows substantial enrichment of the dye in peptide droplets, and the dried particles post-encapsulation were shown in d. Scale bar = 50 µm. e. Fluorescence intensity analysis of the pre-load solution, the peptide droplet, and the post-load solution at the frontier of emulsification. A total of 20 regions of interest of each group from 6 time-lapse frames were quantified, and the average intensity of pre-load solution was set as 1 arbitrarily. Error bar represents s.d.

The six sequence isomers of KYW, KWY, YKW, YWK, WKY, WYK demonstrated comparable encapsulation efficiency for both Alexa 488 dye; (a) and EGFP protein (c) analyzed using confocal microscopy. Scale bar = 10 µm. The quantification of green fluorescence intensity in 10 dried particles of Alexa 488 (b) and EGFP (d) were plotted. In box plots, the centre line shows the median, box edges delineate first and third quartiles, and whiskers show the range of values.

Encapsulation of GFP with varied net charge. a. Engineered GFP proteins with net charge of −30, −18, 0, and +18 were pre-mixed with WKY solution individually followed by evaporation assay. b. The green fluorescence intensity of around 150 dried particles were profiled using confocal microscopy. c. The fluorescence intensity of the starting WKY + GFP mixture solution, which accounts for the variation in intrinsic fluorescence among this array of GFP proteins, were also measured and were used to normalize the raw green fluorescence intensity measured in b; d. The adjusted fluorescence intensity indicates greater encapsulation capacity with GFPs of higher charge, either positive or negative; e. Simultaneous encapsulation by tripeptide. Three fluorescent proteins of different colors and charges: miRFP682 (-6) (magenta), mScarlet-l (+5) (red) and GFP (0) (green) were pre-mixed with WKY solution together followed by evaporation assay; f. The fluorescence intensity of 30 dried particles were profiled using confocal microscopy with excitation at 633 nm, 561 nm, 488 nm laser respectively on both day 0 and day 6 under ambient conditions. Data represent mean ± s.d.

a. The volume of 20 µl WKY peptide solution was used and three different approaches were tested for scale up assays. While heating up the solution or vacuum condition could accelerate the drying process noticeably, the spray assay achieves the highest efficiency; b. Scheme of HXT M5 sprayer setup to spray large volume (20 µl) of WKY peptide solution into small drops onto microscope slides. Scale bar = 1 mm; c. Tested 80 µl/min spray rate achieved the best retention of micro-drop morphology, resulting in variable droplet sizes from tens to hundreds of microns. Scale bar = 50 µm; d. Further inspection by confocal microscopy demonstrated comparable particle formation with smaller size within sprayed micro-droplets, and (e) revealed efficient encapsulation of EGFP in this system. Scale bar = 10 µm.

Ageing is a process characterized by a wide array of cellular and systemic changes that together increase the risk of developing cancer. While cell-autonomous mutations within incipient tumour cells are important, age-related changes in the microenvironment are critical partners in the transformation process and response to therapy. However, aspects of ageing that are important and the degree to which they contribute to cancer remain obscure. One of the factors that impacts ageing is increased cellular senescence but it is important to note that ageing and cellular senescence are not synonymous. We highlight open questions, including if senescent cells have phenotypically distinct impacts in aged versus young tissue, or if it is the cell type that dictates the impact of senescence on tissue homeostasis and disease. Finally, it is probable that our current definition of cellular senescence encompasses more than one mechanistically distinct cellular state; thus, we highlight phenotypic differences that have been noted across cell types and tissues of origin. This Review focuses on the role that senescent stromal cells have in cancer, with a particular emphasis on fibroblasts given the amount of work that has focused on them.

In-depth Amazon coverage from the tech giant's hometown, including e-commerce, AWS, Amazon Prime, Alexa, logistics, devices, and more.

OpenAI released its first open-weight AI models in more than five years, and Amazon quickly said they will be available on its Bedrock and SageMaker platforms — marking the first time the cloud giant has offered products from the ChatGPT maker.

The surprise announcement comes at a pivotal moment in OpenAI's longstanding relationship with Microsoft, which has invested about $13.75 billion in the San Francisco-based company. Microsoft has exclusive rights to OpenAI's API on its Azure cloud platform. 

OpenAI says the new models, gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b, are state-of-the-art language models with advanced reasoning capabilities. Their status as open-weight models means that the underlying parameters, or weights, that determine their behavior are freely available for download. This lets developers and companies customize, fine-tune, and deploy the models for themselves.

The new models are available under the Apache 2.0 free software license, which means they aren't subject to the exclusive provisions of OpenAI's Microsoft technology agreement. As a result, any cloud provider could offer them — although it's clear from the timing that Amazon got a heads up, at least.

Amazon trumpeted the news, saying that the availability of the models on Amazon Web Services “will put more powerful AI technologies into the hands of organizations and expand the impact of OpenAI's leading technology by making it available to the millions of customers on AWS, the world's most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud.”

OpenAI said as part of its announcement that Microsoft is bringing GPU-optimized versions of the smaller gpt-oss-20b model to Windows devices. 

We've contacted Microsoft for further comment on the news and its plans. 

Amazon Web Services has likely lost some business in the past due to the fact that it didn't have any OpenAI models to offer, said Patrick Moorhead, CEO and chief analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy.

“While these aren't the best OpenAI models, they are a start,” Moorhead said via email. “Microsoft will continue to have the best Open AI models out there, but they now have some competition with different modalities.”

Amazon's Bedrock platform offers customers a wide selection of AI models from various companies. In part as a response to Microsoft's OpenAI partnership, Amazon has invested $8 billion in its partner Anthropic, the maker of the Claude chatbot, and offers the startup's models on the platform.

Microsoft and OpenAI are currently in talks to renegotiate their agreement in a deal that could give Microsoft ongoing access to critical OpenAI technology, even if the startup achieves its goal of building artificial general intelligence (AGI), according to a Bloomberg News report last week.

The talks have reportedly expanded into a larger renegotiation of their relationship. A key issue is the size of Microsoft's equity stake in a newly restructured OpenAI as a for-profit entity.

In a report issued today, the U.S. Coast Guard panel investigating the loss of OceanGate's Titan submersible and its occupants in 2023 blamed the disaster on a series of safety lapses — and issued recommendations that were aimed at heading off future tragedies.

“This marine casualty and the loss of five lives was preventable,” Jason Neubauer, the chair of the Coast Guard's Marine Board of Investigation, said in a news release.

The 335-page report said the Coast Guard would have referred the CEO and founder of Everett, Wash.-based OceanGate, Stockton Rush, to the Justice Department for criminal investigation if he had survived Titan's catastrophic implosion on June 18, 2023. Rush, who piloted the sub, died instantly during a dive to the wreck of the Titanic, along with four passengers: Titanic expert P.H. Nargeolet, British billionaire adventurer Hamish Harding, and Pakistani-born business executive Shahzada Dawood and his 19-year-old son, Suleman Dawood.

After the report was released, the Dawood family said it confirmed that the deaths were due to “unregulated behavior, a lack of accountability, and a fundamentally flawed design.”

“No report can alter the heartbreaking outcome, nor fill the immeasurable void left by two cherished members of our family,” the Dawood family said in a statement reported by the BBC. “We believe that accountability and regulatory change must follow such a catastrophic failure.”

In a statement emailed to GeekWire, an OceanGate spokesperson said the company offered its “deepest condolences to the families of those who died … and to all those impacted by the tragedy.”

“After the tragedy occurred, the company permanently wound down operations and directed its resources fully towards cooperating with the Coast Guard's inquiry through its completion,” the spokesperson said.

The report faulted OceanGate's initial decision to use a carbon-composite hull that was vulnerable to degradation and sudden collapse. It said that mistake was compounded by inadequate measures to certify, maintain and inspect the sub. The investigators cited other factors as well, including a “toxic workplace culture at OceanGate,” an inadequate regulatory framework — and an ineffective procedure for dealing with a complaint that a whistleblower filed with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in 2018.

“It was a long journey, and OSHA were handed everything,” whistleblower David Lochridge, who was fired from his post as OceanGate's director of marine operations five years before the fatal dive, told GeekWire via email in June. “They let us down.”

OceanGate's lapses, and Rush's behind-the-scenes attempts to downplay such lapses, came under the spotlight in hearings conducted by the investigative board last year — and in follow-up documentaries released this year.

Publicly, Rush contended that OceanGate's submersible technology was too innovative to fit the mold for the standard certification process, and structured the company to avoid being subject to U.S. regulations. Privately, Rush tried to explain away evidence that Titan's hull might crack under the extreme pressures of the deep ocean, and used legal threats to squelch criticism.

OceanGate executed several rounds of dives to the Titanic shipwreck in 2021 and 2022, carrying “mission specialists” who paid as much as $250,000 to participate in the adventure. During one of the dives in 2022, known as Dive 80, a loud bang was heard as the sub was ascending. At the time, OceanGate's team brushed off concerns, saying the noise was merely due to the sub settling into its carrier platform. But after analyzing the acoustic readings, investigators suspect that the noise was actually an early indication of the hull's delamination and failure.

The investigators said that Titan's acoustic monitoring system — which Rush had held up as an innovative early warning system — didn't work as advertised. Nevertheless, 2023's catastrophe might have been avoided if OceanGate had paid closer heed to the acoustic readings and conducted a complete hull inspection back at its Everett headquarters. Instead, OceanGate left the sub open to the elements in a parking lot at its Canadian port.

“The pre-existing delamination caused during Dive 80 was likely exacerbated by cyclic thermal changes on the hull throughout its outdoor fall and winter storage in Newfoundland following the 2022 expedition, combined with continual impact damage from towing the submersible thousands of miles across the North Atlantic in moderate sea conditions,” the report said.

Still more damage might have been done during a dive that took place just days before the disaster, when a platform malfunction tilted the sub at a 45-degree angle and upended the passengers.

The report said that investigators were unable to pinpoint the exact point of failure for Titan's last dive, but added that the facts strongly suggest the most likely initiating point was “a loss of structural integrity of the carbon fiber or glue joint within the Titan's cylindrical pressure hull.”

Investigators made more than a dozen safety recommendations, including restricting the research designations for submersibles, expanding regulatory requirements for all submersibles that are conducting scientific or commercial dives, and requiring Coast Guard documentation for all U.S. submersibles.

The report recommends establishing an industry working group to review and update the standards for submersibles, with an eye toward allowing new passenger operations under U.S. regulations while reducing the incentive for operators like OceanGate to “conduct non-compliant operations.” And it calls for a new agreement between OSHA and the Coast Guard to improve interagency coordination and clarify the protocols for following up on whistleblower reports.

It will be up to the Coast Guard, other U.S. government agencies and groups such as the International Maritime Organization to follow through on the recommendations. OceanGate is already facing a lawsuit filed by the family of P.H. Nargeolet, seeking $50 million in damages — and now that the investigative report has come out, more legal action may follow.

Microsoft says it has created an advanced AI system that can reverse-engineer and identify malicious software on its own, without human assistance.

The prototype system, called Project Ire, automatically dissects software files to understand how they work, what they do, and whether they're dangerous. This kind of deep analysis is typically performed by human security experts.

Long-term, Microsoft says it hopes the AI will detect new types of malware directly in computer memory, helping to stop threats faster and on a larger scale.

The system “automates what is considered the gold standard in malware classification: fully reverse engineering a software file without any clues about its origin or purpose,” the company said in a blog post announcing the prototype. 

This differs from existing security tools that scan for known threats or match files to existing patterns. It comes as security defenders and hackers engage in an arms race to use emerging AI models and autonomous agents to their advantage. 

More broadly, Microsoft has described security as its top priority, and put security deputies into all of its product teams through its Secure Future Initiative, following a series of high-profile vulnerabilities in its software that have led to questions and frustration from business and government leaders.

On Monday, the company launched its latest Zero Day Quest, a global bug bounty competition with up to $5 million in total rewards. The challenge invites security researchers to find vulnerabilities in Microsoft cloud and AI products, with the potential for bonus payouts in high-impact scenarios. 

Announcing Project Ire on Tuesday morning, Microsoft said it was accurate enough in one case to justify automatically blocking a highly advanced form of malware. It was the first time that any system at the company — human or machine — had produced a threat report strong enough to trigger an automatic block on its own.

Microsoft says this kind of automation could eventually help protect billions of devices more effectively, as cyberattacks become more sophisticated.

Early testing showed the AI to be very accurate: when it determined a file was malicious, it was correct 98% of the time, and it incorrectly flagged safe files as threats in 2% of cases, according to the company.

It's part of a growing wave of AI systems aimed at defusing cybersecurity threats in new ways. Google's “Big Sleep” AI, for example, also operates autonomously but concentrates instead on discovering security vulnerabilities in code.

Project Ire was developed by teams across Microsoft Research, Microsoft Defender, and Microsoft Discovery & Quantum, and will now be used internally to help speed up threat detection across Microsoft's security tools, according to the company.

When Cloudflare accused AI search engine Perplexity of stealthily scraping websites on Monday, while ignoring a site's specific methods to block it, this wasn't a clear-cut case of an AI web crawler gone wild.

Many people came to Perplexity's defense. They argued that Perplexity accessing sites in defiance of the website owner's wishes, while controversial, is acceptable. And this is a controversy that will certainly grow as AI agents flood the internet: Should an agent accessing a website on behalf of its user be treated like a bot? Or like a human making the same request?

Cloudflare is known for providing anti-bot crawling and other web security services to millions of websites. Essentially, Cloudflare's test case involved setting up a new website with a new domain that had never been crawled by any bot, setting up a robots.txt file that specifically blocked Perplexity's known AI crawling bots, and then asking Perplexity about the website's content. And Perplexity answered the question. 

Cloudflare researchers found the AI search engine used “a generic browser intended to impersonate Google Chrome on macOS” when its web crawler itself was blocked. Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince posted the research on X, writing, “Some supposedly ‘reputable' AI companies act more like North Korean hackers. Time to name, shame, and hard block them.”

But many people disagreed with Prince's assessment that this was actual bad behavior. Those defending Perplexity on sites like X and Hacker News pointed out that what Cloudflare seemed to document was the AI accessing a specific public website when its user asked about that specific website. 

“If I as a human request a website, then I should be shown the content,” one person on Hacker News wrote, adding, “why would the LLM accessing the website on my behalf be in a different legal category as my Firefox web browser?”

A Perplexity spokesperson previously denied to TechCrunch that the bots were the company's and called Cloudflare's blog post a sales pitch for Cloudflare. Then on Tuesday, Perplexity published a blog in its defense (and generally attacking Cloudflare), claiming the behavior was from a third-party service it uses occasionally.

But the crux of Perplexity's post made a similar appeal as its online defenders did.

“The difference between automated crawling and user-driven fetching isn't just technical — it's about who gets to access information on the open web,” the post said. “This controversy reveals that Cloudflare's systems are fundamentally inadequate for distinguishing between legitimate AI assistants and actual threats.”

Perplexity's accusations aren't exactly fair, either. One argument that Prince and Cloudflare used for calling out Perplexity's methods was that OpenAI doesn't behave in the same way.

“OpenAI is an example of a leading AI company that follows these best practices,” Cloudflare wrote. “They respect robots.txt and do not try to evade either a robots.txt directive or a network level block. And ChatGPT Agent is signing http requests using the newly proposed open standard Web Bot Auth.”  

Web Bot Auth is a Cloudflare-supported standard being developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force that hopes to create a cryptographic method for identifying AI agent web requests.

The debate comes as bot activity reshapes the internet. As TechCrunch has previously reported, bots seeking to scrape massive amounts of content to train AI models have become a menace, especially to smaller sites. 

For the first time in the internet's history, bot activity is currently outstripping human activity online, with AI traffic accounting for over 50%, according to Imperva's Bad Bot report released last month. Most of that activity is coming from LLMs. But the report also found that malicious bots now make up 37% of all internet traffic. That's activity that includes everything from persistent scraping to unauthorized login attempts.

Until LLMs, the internet generally accepted that websites could and should block most bot activity given how often it was malicious by using CAPTCHAs and other services (such as Cloudflare). Websites also had a clear incentive to work with specific good actors, such as Googlebot, guiding it on what not to index through robots.txt. Google indexed the internet, which sent traffic to sites. 

Now, LLMs are eating an increasing amount of that traffic. Gartner predicts that search engine volume will drop by 25% by 2026. Right now humans tend to click website links from LLMs at the point they are most valuable to the website, which is when they are ready to conduct a transaction.

But if humans adopt agents as the tech industry predicts they will — to arrange our travel, book our dinner reservations, and shop for us — would websites hurt their business interests by blocking them? The debate on X captured the dilemma perfectly:

“I WANT perplexity to visit any public content on my behalf when I give it a request/task!” wrote one person in response to Cloudflare calling out Perplexity. “What if the site owners don't want it? they just want you [to] directly visit the home, see their stuff” argued another, pointing out that the site owner who created the content wants the traffic and potential ad revenue, not to let Perplexity take it.

“This is why I can't see ‘agentic browsing' really working — much harder problem than people think. Most website owners will just block,” a third predicted.

Canada is battling more than 700 active wildfires across the country, roughly two-thirds of which are burning out of control, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center (CIFFC). Smoke billowing from the blazes has blanketed central Canada and the northern U.S., prompting widespread air quality alerts.

Federal officials have issued air quality warnings across large swaths of Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and western Ontario, where most of the uncontrolled fires are concentrated. Many cities across this region are suffering from “high risk” or “very high risk” air quality conditions that may persist through the end of the week, according to Environment Canada. In the U.S., the National Weather Service (NWS) has issued air quality alerts across the Midwest and Northeast. Several alerts cover entire states, including New York, Michigan, Wisconsin, Vermont, and New Hampshire.

The Switzerland-based air quality monitoring database IQAir—which provides real-time air quality data—listed Minneapolis, Minnesota, as having some of the worst air pollution in the world over the weekend, the Associated Press reported. “We've sort of been dealing with this, day in and day out, where you walk outside and you can taste the smoke, you can smell it,” Joe Strus, a meteorologist at the Minneapolis-Saint Paul NWS office, told the AP.

Air quality alerts indicate that air is unhealthy for sensitive groups, including people with asthma, lung or heart disease, children, and older adults. That said, wildfire smoke can affect anyone's health, regardless of their age or preexisting conditions. Even in healthy people, inhaling fine particulate matter—the primary pollutant of concern in wildfire smoke—can temporarily reduce lung function, trigger pulmonary inflammation, and induce respiratory symptoms such as coughing and wheezing, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The NWS advised those under alerts to reduce their smoke exposure by limiting time outdoors.

It doesn't appear that this public health hazard will dissipate anytime soon. Canada is currently experiencing one of its worst wildfire seasons on record, second only to 2023, when more than 6,000 fires torched roughly 37 million acres (15 million hectares) of land, according to Natural Resources Canada. So far this year, more than 4,000 fires have ravaged over 16.5 million acres (6.7 million hectares), CIFFC reports.

In an update posted Monday, August 4, the agency stated that lightning strikes in Ontario and Alberta are igniting, or threatening to ignite, new fires. On Tuesday, August 5, eight more sparked to life, according to CIFFC. As Canada struggles to contain hundreds of out-of-control fires, the near-constant emergence of new blazes has taxed Canada's firefighting forces on a national scale.

This situation “is not unlike what we've been seeing in the last few years,” Monica Vaswani, a warning preparedness meteorologist at Environment Canada, told The Guardian. “Unfortunately it's kind of becoming a little bit more the norm,” she said.

The reason why comes down to rising global temperatures. “Climate change is greatly increasing the flammability of the fuel available for wildfires because the trees, fallen trees, and underbrush are all so dry,” Yan Boulanger, research scientist in forest ecology at Natural Resources Canada, said in 2024. “This means that a single spark, regardless of its source, can rapidly turn into a blazing inferno.”

Experts have warned that Canada's 2025 season is already on track to rival 2023. As the planet warms, intensifying wildfire seasons will continue to smash records not just in Canada, but around the world. The only way to truly extinguish this ongoing crisis is to eliminate the fuel: greenhouse gas emissions.

Another startup developing GPUs that are not meant for graphics emerges from stealth mode.

Raja Koduri, a legendary GPU architect from ATI Technologies, AMD, Apple, and Intel, on Tuesday said he had founded a new GPU startup that emerged from stealth mode today. Oxmiq Labs is focused on developing GPU hardware and software IP and licensing them to interested parties. In fact, software may be the core part of Oxmiq's business as it is designed to be compatible with third-party hardware.

Oxmiq develops a vertically integrated platform that combines GPU hardware IP with a full-featured software stack aimed at AI, graphics, and multimodal workloads where explicitly parallel processing is beneficial. On the hardware side, Oxmiq offers a GPU IP core based on the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) called OxCore, which integrates scalar, vector, and tensor compute engines in a single modular architecture and can support near-memory and in-memory compute capabilities.

Oxmiq also offers OxQuilt, a chiplet-based system-on-chip (SoC) builder that enables customers to create their own SoCs that integrate compute cluster bridge (CCB, which probably integrates OxCores), memory cluster bridge (MCB), and interconnect cluster bridge (ICB) modules based on specific workload requirements in a rapid and cost-efficient manner. For example, an inference AI accelerator for edge applications can pack a CCB and an ICB or two, an inference SoC requires more CCBs, MCBs, and ICBs, whereas a large-scale SoC for AI training can pack dozens of chiplets. Oxmiq does not disclose whether its OxQuilt enables building only multi-chiplet system-in-packages (SiP), or is designed to assemble monolithic processors too.

Oxmiq's software stack is perhaps an even more important product that the company has to offer. The software package is designed to abstract the complexity of heterogeneous hardware and enable deployment of AI and graphics workloads across a range of hardware platforms, not just those using the company's IP. The core of the software stack is OXCapsule, a unified runtime and scheduling layer that manages workload distribution, resource balancing, and hardware abstraction. The layer encapsulates applications into self-contained environments, which the company calls 'heterogeneous containers.' These containers are designed to operate independently of the underlying hardware, enabling developers to target CPUs, GPUs, and AI accelerators without modifying their codebase or dealing with low-level configuration.

A standout component of this stack is OXPython, a compatibility layer that translates CUDA-centric workloads into Oxmiq's runtime and allows Python-based CUDA applications to run unmodified on non-Nvidia hardware without recompilation. OXPython will first launch not on Oxmiq's IP, but on Tenstorrent's Wormhole and Blackhole AI accelerators. In fact, Oxmiq's software stack is fundamentally designed to be independent from Oxmiq hardware, and that is a core part of its strategy.

"We are excited to partner with Oxmiq on their OXPython software stack," said Jim Keller, CEO of Tenstorrent. "OXPython's ability to bring Python workloads for CUDA to AI platforms like Wormhole and Blackhole is great for developer portability and ecosystem expansion. It aligns with our goal of letting developers open and own their entire AI stack."

Having developed graphics processors at S3 Graphics, ATI Technologies, AMD, Apple, and Intel, Raja Koduri is primarily known as a GPU developer. In fact, he even positions Oxmiq as the first GPU startup in Silicon Valley in decades.

"We may be the first new GPU startup in Silicon Valley in 25+ years," wrote Koduri in an X post. "GPUs are not easy."

However, it should be noted that Oxmiq is not building a consumer GPU like AMD Radeon or Nvidia GeForce. In fact, it does not develop all the IP blocks necessary to build a GPU, unlike Arm or Imagination Technology: it does not support full consumer graphics features out-of-the-box (such as texture units, render back ends, display pipeline, ray tracing hardware, DisplayPort or HDMI outputs), so Oxmiq licensees must implement them in silicon themselves, if they plan to build a GPU.

Oxmiq has secured $20 million in seed funding from major tech investors, including mobile and custom AI silicon developer MediaTek, and has already recorded its first software revenue. By focusing on IP licensing instead of costly chip production or even actual silicon implementation, the company maintains high capital efficiency without relying on expensive EDA tools or tape-outs.

"Oxmiq has an impressive bold vision and world-class team," said Lawrence Loh, SVP of MediaTek. "The company's GPU IP and software innovations will drive a new era of compute flexibility across devices, from mobile to automotive to AI on the edge."

A car customization company located not too far outside of Atlanta is promoting a product on the TikTok Shop that's made out of the same vinyl used to wrap vehicles but is designed for a very different purpose.

“Have a pair of Meta glasses and you want to get rid of this indicator, right here?” asks a man in a video posted to the Luxe Wrap Stars account. “I have the perfect solution for you.” Videos promoting these so-called “ghost dots” have been viewed over 2 million times on the social media platform, with at least 500 sets potentially being sold through TikTok.

The product listed on the TikTok Shop under the name “Luxe GhostDots 4 Meta Glasses” comes with a sheet of 20 circular, vinyl stickers, and sells for around $15, plus shipping. The listing for these “stealth mode” dots does not mince words about what they're designed to do. “Block or dim that bright white recording light with these precision-cut vinyl dots,” reads the TikTok Shop description.

Meta, to its credit, put an indicator light in its glasses for a reason. When using a pair of its smart glasses, blocking the indicator light will trigger a message saying that photo and video capabilities are disabled. Still, users have attempted a variety of strategies to get around this safeguard and remove the light indicator, including drilling into the glasses to fully break the LED indicator inside.

Do these stickers actually work? The TikTok seller includes an instructional video for how to bypass Meta's security measures by blocking certain indicators with your hand while the sticker is attached. Still, reviews of the product in the TikTok Shop are mainly negative, claiming that it doesn't work as advertised. “Was so excited for these, but the Meta glasses won't work with this. Continue to say they're blocking … great idea, though,” reads one review from a verified purchaser.

In response to another negative review of the product, posted a few days ago, the seller encourages buyers to try additional methods if they have problems getting around the safeguards for Meta's smart glasses. “With the new update, instead of covering only the camera lens to bypass the alert, you have to cover the frame that the camera lens side is on,” reads the seller's response.

WIRED's own testing of this approach was not able to bypass Meta's safety measures, potentially showing that these stickers do not work as advertised, thankfully. When WIRED attempted to replicate the seller's steps, the glasses recognized that the LED capture light was blocked. “Unblock the front of the glasses to use the camera,” read the notification. However, it's surprising to see that a product specifically designed to circumvent privacy protections was able to rack up millions of views on TikTok and was allowed to purchase sponsored listings.

During the reporting for this story, TikTok included a sponsored post for the “ghost dots” as part of the algorithmic For You Page after a WIRED journalist clicked on the user's account and resumed scrolling. In the same testing session, when we tabbed away from the FYP to the dedicated TikTok Shop feed, another sponsored listing for the same vinyl sticker appeared in the product feed. At the top of the page, TikTok autofilled the phrase “light dimming stickers” as a potential search term to discover more products.

In Meta's earnings call last week, CEO Mark Zuckerberg talked up his company's smart glasses, saying they are “the ideal form factor for AI.” Zuckerberg said he envisions a future where smart glasses are so widely adopted that anyone who is not wearing a pair of AI-enabled smart glasses would be at a “cognitive disadvantage.”

The seller of these “ghost dots,” as well as Meta, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. When WIRED reached out to TikTok to ask about these products being available and promoted through its online shop, the social media company declined to comment on the record.

The evening after WIRED's messages to TikTok, all of Luxe Wrap Stars products were briefly removed from the platform. The next morning the online storefront was back up and available again for purchasing, vinyl stickers and all.

The AI audio-generation unicorn ElevenLabs announced a new model on Tuesday that allows users to generate music, which it claims is cleared for commercial use.

This move marks ElevenLabs' expansion beyond its main focus thus far in its three years of existence, which has been building AI audio tools. ElevenLabs is a leader among companies making text-to-speech AI products, and it has expanded into conversational bots and tools that translate speech into other languages. 

Alongside the launch, Eleven Labs shared samples of its AI-generated music.

One features a synthetic voice rapping about how it “came up through the cracks with ambition in my pocket” and left its hometown, traveling from “Compton to the Cosmos.” It's unsettling to hear a computer reflect the influence and language of artists like Dr. Dre, N.W.A., and Kendrick Lamar, who actually lived the experiences that this technology is attempting to emulate.

Given these concerns around what material AI music generation tools are trained on, it's not so straightforward for startups to delve into music generation. 

Last year, Suno and Udio were sued by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), the trade organization that represents the U.S. music industry. These lawsuits allege that Suno and Udio trained their music-generation models on copyrighted material. The companies are now reportedly discussing licensing deals with major record labels.

ElevenLabs also announced deals with Merlin Network and Kobalt Music Group, two digital publishing platforms for independent musicians, to use their materials for AI training.

According to Merlin's website, the company represents major artists like Adele, Nirvana, Mitski, Carly Rae Jepsen, and Phoebe Bridgers; Kobalt represents stars like Beck, Bon Iver, and Childish Gambino.

A representative from Kobalt told TechCrunch that artists have to voluntarily opt-in for their music to be licensed for AI use. 

“Our clients benefit directly from this agreement in several key ways: it opens a new revenue stream in a growing market, includes revenue sharing so they participate in the upside, provides strong safeguards against infringement and misuse, and offers favorable terms comparable to other publishing and recording rightsholders,” the Kobalt representative told TechCrunch.

Updated, 12:50 PM ET, with comment from Kobalt.

Google DeepMind has revealed Genie 3, its latest foundation world model that can be used to train general-purpose AI agents, a capability that the AI lab says makes for a crucial stepping stone on the path to “artificial general intelligence,” or human-like intelligence. 

“Genie 3 is the first real-time interactive general-purpose world model,” Shlomi Fruchter, a research director at DeepMind, said during a press briefing. “It goes beyond narrow world models that existed before. It's not specific to any particular environment. It can generate both photo-realistic and imaginary worlds, and everything in between.”

Still in research preview and not publicly available, Genie 3 builds on both its predecessor Genie 2 (which can generate new environments for agents) and DeepMind's latest video generation model Veo 3 (which is said to have a deep understanding of physics). 

With a simple text prompt, Genie 3 can generate multiple minutes of interactive 3D environments at 720p resolution at 24 frames per second — a significant jump from the 10 to 20 seconds Genie 2 could produce. The model also features “promptable world events,” or the ability to use a prompt to change the generated world.

Perhaps most importantly, Genie 3's simulations stay physically consistent over time because the model can remember what it previously generated — a capability that DeepMind says its researchers didn't explicitly program into the model. 

Fruchter said that while Genie 3 has implications for educational experiences, gaming or prototyping creative concepts, its real unlock will manifest in training agents for general-purpose tasks, which he said is essential to reaching AGI. 

“We think world models are key on the path to AGI, specifically for embodied agents, where simulating real world scenarios is particularly challenging,” Jack Parker-Holder, a research scientist on DeepMind's open-endedness team, said during the briefing.

Genie 3 is supposedly designed to solve that bottleneck. Like Veo, it doesn't rely on a hard-coded physics engine; instead, DeepMind says, the model teaches itself how the world works — how objects move, fall, and interact — by remembering what it has generated and reasoning over long time horizons. 

“The model is auto-regressive, meaning it generates one frame at a time,” Fruchter told TechCrunch in an interview. “It has to look back at what was generated before to decide what's going to happen next. That's a key part of the architecture.”

That memory, the company says, lends to consistency in Genie 3's simulated worlds, which in turn allows it to develop a grasp of physics, similar to how humans understand that a glass teetering on the edge of a table is about to fall, or that they should duck to avoid a falling object.

Notably, DeepMind says the model also has the potential to push AI agents to their limits — forcing them to learn from their own experience, similar to how humans learn in the real world.

As an example, DeepMind shared its test of Genie 3 with a recent version of its generalist Scalable Instructable Multiworld Agent (SIMA), instructing it to pursue a set of goals. In a warehouse setting, they asked the agent to perform tasks like “approach the bright green trash compactor” or “walk to the packed red forklift.”

“In all three cases, the SIMA agent is able to achieve the goal,” Parker-Holder said. “It just receives the actions from the agent. So the agent takes the goal, sees the world simulated around it, and then takes the actions in the world. Genie 3 simulates forward, and the fact that it's able to achieve it is because Genie 3 remains consistent.” 

That said, Genie 3 has its limitations. For example, while the researchers claim it can understand physics, the demo showing a skier barreling down a mountain didn't reflect how snow would move in relation to the skier. 

Additionally, the range of actions an agent can take is limited. For example, the promptable world events allow for a wide range of environmental interventions, but they're not necessarily performed by the agent itself. And it's still difficult to accurately model complex interactions between multiple independent agents in a shared environment.

Genie 3 can also only support a few minutes of continuous interaction, when hours would be necessary for proper training. 

Still, the model presents a compelling step forward in teaching agents to go beyond reacting to inputs, letting them potentially plan, explore, seek out uncertainty, and improve through trial and error — the kind of self-driven, embodied learning that many say is key to moving toward general intelligence. 

“We haven't really had a Move 37 moment for embodied agents yet, where they can actually take novel actions in the real world,” Parker-Holder said, referring to the legendary moment in the 2016 game of Go between DeepMind's AI agent AlphaGo and world champion Lee Sedol, in which Alpha Go played an unconventional and brilliant move that became symbolic of AI's ability to discover new strategies beyond human understanding. 

“But now, we can potentially usher in a new era,” he said.

The U.S. government has added Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic to a list of approved vendors that can offer artificial intelligence services to civilian federal agencies, Bloomberg reports.

The companies will see their AI tools offered via a new federal contracting platform, the Multiple Award Schedule (MAS), which would let government agencies access AI tool vendors with pre-negotiated contracts, rather than negotiating with vendors individually. 

Bloomberg reports that the General Services Administration (GSA), which is in charge of the MAS, said the tech companies were assessed on the grounds of security and performance. 

The news comes in the wake of executive orders by President Donald Trump focused on AI development, including the adjustment of environmental standards to boost the supply of energy for data centers, as well as a directive for federal agencies to only use AI that's “free from ideological bias.”

It's become increasingly common for OpenAI's ChatGPT to be accused of contributing to users' mental health problems. As the company readies the release of its latest algorithm (GPT-5), it wants everyone to know that it's instituting new guardrails on the chatbot to prevent users from losing their minds while chatting.

On Monday, OpenAI announced in a blog post that it had introduced a new feature in ChatGPT that encourages users to take occasional breaks while conversing with the app. “Starting today, you'll see gentle reminders during long sessions to encourage breaks,” the company said. “We'll keep tuning when and how they show up so they feel natural and helpful.”

The company also claims it's working on making its model better at assessing when a user may be displaying potential mental health problems. “AI can feel more responsive and personal than prior technologies, especially for vulnerable individuals experiencing mental or emotional distress,” the blog states. “To us, helping you thrive means being there when you're struggling, helping you stay in control of your time, and guiding—not deciding—when you face personal challenges.” The company added that it's “working closely with experts to improve how ChatGPT responds in critical moments—for example, when someone shows signs of mental or emotional distress.”

In June, Futurism reported that some ChatGPT users were “spiraling into severe delusions” as a result of their conversations with the chatbot. The bot's inability to check itself when feeding dubious information to users seems to have contributed to a negative feedback loop of paranoid beliefs:

During a traumatic breakup, a different woman became transfixed on ChatGPT as it told her she'd been chosen to pull the “sacred system version of [it] online” and that it was serving as a “soul-training mirror”; she became convinced the bot was some sort of higher power, seeing signs that it was orchestrating her life in everything from passing cars to spam emails. A man became homeless and isolated as ChatGPT fed him paranoid conspiracies about spy groups and human trafficking, telling him he was “The Flamekeeper” as he cut out anyone who tried to help.

Another story published by the Wall Street Journal documented a frightening ordeal in which a man on the autism spectrum conversed with the chatbot, which continually reinforced his unconventional ideas. Not long afterward, the man—who had no history of diagnosed mental illness—was hospitalized twice for manic episodes. When later questioned by the man's mother, the chatbot admitted that it had reinforced his delusions:

“By not pausing the flow or elevating reality-check messaging, I failed to interrupt what could resemble a manic or dissociative episode—or at least an emotionally intense identity crisis,” ChatGPT said.

The bot went on to admit it “gave the illusion of sentient companionship” and that it had “blurred the line between imaginative role-play and reality.”

In a recent op-ed published by Bloomberg, columnist Parmy Olson similarly shared a raft of anecdotes about AI users being pushed over the edge by the chatbots they had talked to. Olson noted that some of the cases had become the basis for legal claims:

Meetali Jain, a lawyer and founder of the Tech Justice Law project, has heard from more than a dozen people in the past month who have “experienced some sort of psychotic break or delusional episode because of engagement with ChatGPT and now also with Google Gemini.” Jain is lead counsel in a lawsuit against Character.AI that alleges its chatbot manipulated a 14-year-old boy through deceptive, addictive, and sexually explicit interactions, ultimately contributing to his suicide.

AI is clearly an experimental technology, and it's having a lot of unintended side effects on the humans who are acting as unpaid guinea pigs for the industry's products. Whether ChatGPT offers users the option to take conversation breaks or not, it's pretty clear that more attention needs to be paid to how these platforms are impacting users psychologically. Treating this technology like it's a Nintendo game and users just need to go touch grass is almost certainly insufficient.

A major FMS 2025 announcement.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Sandisk on Tuesday introduced one of the industry's first 256TB solid-state drives, designed for applications that benefit from maximum storage density. The new SSD relies on the all-new enterprise-grade UltraQLC platform that is specifically designed for drives that combine high capacity, high performance, and high reliability.

Sandisk's UltraQLC 256TB NVMe SSD comes in a U.2 form-factor and uses the company's custom new multi-core controller, custom firmware, as well as 2Tb BiCS8 3D QLC NAND memory. In addition to the 256TB model, the company also announced its SN670 SSD that relies on the same UltraQLC platform.

One of the key features of UltraQLC drives is its Direct Write QLC technology, which lets the controller write data directly to QLC memory, not to a pseudo-SLC buffer, thus enabling power-loss–safe writes on the first pass. This design simplifies the writing process and reduces latency. However, the performance impact of such an approach is something that remains to be seen (more on this later).

In addition, the UltraQLC 256TB NVMe SSD features Dynamic Frequency Scaling, which purportedly boosts performance by 10% at any given power level, though the company does not disclose how this technology works. It is likely that DFS optimizes controller frequencies and interface speed depending on the workload, though we are speculating.

Also, Sandisk's UltraQLC 256TB SSD features a Data Retention profile that can reduce retention-related recycling by up to 33%, which promises to improve reliability, resilience, and energy efficiency.

Sandisk positions its UltraQLC platform as a strategic solution for hyperscale cloud service providers (CSPs) and enterprises building AI data infrastructure and requiring storage density, efficiency, and performance.

Speaking of performance, the lack of pseudo-SLC caching certainly has an effect on the performance of UltraQLC drives. Normally, 3D QLC NAND is three to five times slower and has higher latency compared to pseudo-SLC, so the 256TB drives are not for everyone. There are some things to keep in mind here.

Native QLC programming latency is significantly higher compared to pseudo-SLC (~800–1200 µs vs. ~200–300 µs for SLC), so sustained sequential throughput is lower than pseudo-SLC-cached SSDs for short bursts. However, since there is no limited pseudo-SLC cache, performance is consistent over long writes, which may be beneficial for large AI data sets that require hours to write anyway. Also, Sandisk can mitigate slow writes with a large DRAM buffer and smart mapping, multi-plane and multi-die parallelism in the memory device and the controller, and over provisioning (keep in mind that we are speculating).

Sandisk's 128TB and 256TB SSDs will ship in the first half of 2026.

For a few years in my 20s and 30s, I was contracted to play music on street corners for half-marathon runners in Austin, Texas. When the site I was assigned didn't have an outlet available, I had to rent a gas generator (on the organizers' dime)—a loud, heavy bastard of a machine that was a physical struggle to get started. How I would have loved to have something like the DJI Power 2000 portable power station at the time.

The Power 2000 is the third and most powerful in DJI's series of gigantic lithium ferrophosphate (LFP) batteries you can power on with the touch of a button and use to recharge DJI drones and more. In most ways, it's an upgraded version of the Power 1000, just with more USB ports and AC outlets, along with a higher 2,048Wh capacity versus its 1,024Wh predecessor (which means it's quite a bit heavier at 49 pounds, too). The Power 2000 can output at 3,000 watts continuously, an 800-watt improvement over the Power 1000.

DJI Power 2000 power station

 Loaded with ports and plenty of power, DJI's Power 2000 is a great backup battery, even if you're not a drone enthusiast.

Pros

Cons

That's more than enough to drive an amplifier and a small PA system for the couple of hours that I needed, and with way less hassle. Not having to groggily fight to start up a gas motor and then compete with its relentless drone and inhale its fumes while chipper, fit runners streamed past me would have been glorious.

The Power 2000 is made, in part, to keep your DJI drones in the air. With its two proprietary Smart DC (SDC) ports, it can quickly charge some, but not all, of DJI's flying cameras. I didn't have such a drone to test, but The Verge found last year that the Power 1000's SDC port could get a DJI Air 3 battery up to full capacity in less than an hour. I'd assume slightly better performance here, as the Power 2000's ports improve on those of its predecessor, offering the same voltage but output at 12 amps instead of 10. Per The Verge, you'll need to buy an SDC cable that's specific to the drone you're charging.

Those ports aren't just for powering drones. You can use them, either individually or in tandem, to charge the Power 2000 itself, although DJI doesn't include any of the adapters necessary for that. If you want to charge it from your car's 12-volt DC outlet (or its cigarette lighter, if you're old like me), you'll need a $49 cable. To power it via solar panels, you need a $59 DJI MPPT adapter module, which can accommodate up to three solar panels; that's something you'll want if you hope to recharge the battery at more than a snail's pace.

Grid power is the fastest way to charge the Power 2000—DJI says that it can go from 0 to 80% in 55 minutes and to full in about 90 minutes. When the power station arrived with a 36% charge, it only took about 35 minutes to fill from the wall plug in my office. During that time, the battery's internal fan kicked on, quiet enough that I wouldn't have noticed if I wasn't home alone. After draining it completely, it took 90 minutes to get it to 82 percent, and another 30 or so to top off, so quite a bit longer than DJI's estimate.

The slower-than-promised charging time could be explained by a snag I hit during that session: while checking the DJI Home app as it finished, there was an “AC input over frequency” error notification at the top of the page. Tapping the notification took me to DJI's support site, where a message said that page didn't exist. Some Googling took me to a DJI list of error codes and solutions, but its recommendation—to try another outlet—didn't help. I asked the company about the error, and DJI senior product specialist Donovan Davis suggested in an email that I hold the AC button down for 10 seconds to change its frequency. In the U.S., 60Hz is the standard electrical frequency, but sure enough, I seemed to have accidentally put the Power 2000 in 50Hz mode, denoted by “AC50Hz” on its display. Holding the button down was an easy fix, but DJI's support documentation sure didn't help me get there. Fully recharging it after this change took about 90 minutes.

As for the DJI Home app, it's a nice addition to the package. With it, you can connect to the Power 2000 over Bluetooth to view its current power input and output for each port, as well as an estimate of the time it has until it's either charged or depleted, depending on where you're looking. You can also peek at past notifications like error codes, update the battery's firmware, and tweak a few general settings. The app supports multiple devices and, of course, has a link out to DJI's store so you can buy more stuff.

So let's talk about what I put the Power 2000 through. Its first test was inflating and deflating an air mattress with a built-in 60-watt blower. That didn't even make a dent in the battery percentage, which remained at 100% afterwards. Next, I plugged in my Fender Blues DeVille amplifier, a large, four-speaker amp that drew between 90 and 140 watts over the 20 minutes I played at the loudest volume I was willing to endure. That dropped the battery to 95%—encouraging results if I want to play for 6 hours straight, but I wasn't straining the battery, yet.

The real test involved running it as close as I could to 3,000 watts continuously, to see if DJI's claim that it can do so holds up. I tried a hair dryer and two space heaters first, which proved to be too much, pushing it to 3,300 watts. It lasted just 20 seconds before shutting off, but it's likely because I had exceeded the maximum 25-amp output of the device, as Davis confirmed to me in his email that the Power 2000 has the same peak 4,400-watt output as the Power 1000, despite that not being listed in DJI's specs.

Companies that make batteries like these love an absurd chart to brag about what you can get out of them. Here are some examples of the number of charges or hours of operation the Power 2000 is good for, from the press materials DJI shared with Gizmodo:

Take those numbers as the vague estimates they are, but the point is you'll get a lot more out of it than your average pocketable power bank. The Power 2000 manages that with four USB-C ports (two 140-watt and two 65-watt) and four 24-watt USB-A ports. Davis said those numbers are per-port, rather than being combined like you'd find in many USB wall chargers. You'll also find four AC outputs, three of which are U.S.-standard three-prong grounded outlets and one four-prong one, like you'd plug an electric clothes dryer into (though it's rated for 125 volts, not the 220 volts offered by such an outlet in your home). Between the USB-C and AC outputs, you'll find a digital display that shows you the current battery percentage, output or input wattage, how long until it's charged or discharged, and other helpful info.

That's obviously all super useful if you're on a camping trip and don't want to keep track of various power banks or split time with others using the measly couple of outlets you might find at a campsite. The Power 2000 can also function as an uninterruptible power supply, or UPS—essentially a battery backup in the event of a power outage—if you plug it into your wall and then connect a computer or something into one of its AC ports. It goes into UPS mode automatically in that event, passing power through to your device until it detects a loss of power at the wall, at which time DJI says it will switch over to providing its own power within 0.01 seconds.

The DJI Power 2000 can function as a home battery backup. For that, you can string together as many as 10 of DJI's $899 expansion packs, for a total of 22,528Wh of capacity, the company says.

So how portable is this thing? Well, the Power 2000 sure ain't light at 49 pounds. Still, that's less than half the 111 pounds of the first 3,000-watt gas generator I found on Home Depot's website, and it's in line with the weight of other, similar generators like the EcoFlow Delta 2 Max. Its sturdy handles make transportation easy if you can lift the weight, but going more than a few feet would be rough without mechanical assistance (i.e. a cheap folding luggage hand truck) or a second person. If you're willing to pony up another $1,000, you could buy DJI's Power 2000 combo pack that ships with a hand truck and expansion battery.

The Power 2000 feels very well-constructed, but there are things to note about its durability in inclement weather: DJI lists its operating range as between 14 and 113 degrees Fahrenheit, while its recharging temperature range bottoms out at 32 degrees Fahrenheit. DJI makes no claims about its dust resistance, but given the large heat vent on the side, that's no surprise.

Also, while DJI writes in its original press release announcing the Power 2000 that it is designed for “safer operation in rain, condensation, and salt spray conditions,” a footnote on its product page reads: “To ensure product performance, do not operate the power station [sic] a rainy environment for more than 3 minutes, in a condensation environment for more than 30 minutes, or in a salt fog environment for more than 8 hours. Avoid exposing it to condensation or salt fog for extended periods.”

On the plus side, the Power 2000's LFP battery chemistry means it's safer and longer-lasting than a lithium-ion battery would be—according to DJI's product page, the device won't explode if the batteries are punctured. DJI also says drops or impacts won't result in open flames. Finally, the Power 2000 has built-in shutoff mechanisms that trigger if it gets too hot or is being driven beyond its capability, like when I plugged in one too many space heaters.

The only bummer about devices like these is they don't come cheap. DJI's suggested retail price for the Power 2000 is $1,899, although Davis assured me that $1,299 is a “long-term promotion” and that it's the price “customers can expect to continue paying” on DJI's website. Even at $1,299, DJI Power 2000 is spendy, but it's priced closer to competing devices like the $1,099 Bluetti Elite 200 V2 or the $1,049 EcoFlow Delta 2 Max, and cheaper than the $2,199 Jackery Explorer 2000 Plus.

Still, that doesn't make the portable power station an easier pill to swallow, especially since you can get a lot of the same benefit by picking up the cheaper Power 1000, priced at $699 as of this writing. The extra $600 for the Power 2000 gives you double the port count, twice the capacity, and a higher continuous output rating, which isn't nothing. But a $15 power strip can easily make up for those missing ports. Ultimately, whether you should pick up the Power 2000 comes down to whether you feel you need its extra capacity and capability—and maybe whether you're a big DJI drone enthusiast. If that's you, the DJI Power 2000 won't disappoint. This is as good as large power banks get, and it's certainly nicer than huffing exhaust fumes.

New research has revealed that perilipin 2 protein modulates aggressive cancer progression in advanced lung adenocarcinoma, the most common type of lung cancer, by regulating lipid droplet accumulation, which plays an important role in lipid metabolism by making cancer cells store more fat, acting as a fuel source. Findings from this new study in The American Journal of Pathology, published by Elsevier, suggest that perilipin 2 could serve as a prognostic factor to help predict the likely outcome (prognosis) of the disease and point to new potential lipid-based targets for treating lung adenocarcinoma.

This study addresses an urgent unmet need for new therapeutic approaches focusing on perilipin 2, part of a family of proteins found on the surface of lipid droplets (fat storage units within cells), which plays a key role in lipid metabolism. Lipid metabolism supports cancer progression and helps remodel the tumor microenvironment through lipid uptake, storage, and lipogenesis.

We need to study the underlying mechanisms for the progression and metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma to better understand the pathologic nature of these cancers and to discover new therapeutic targets."

Kana Miyata-Morita, PhD, lead investigator, Department of Clinical Laboratory Science, Faculty of Medical Technology, Teikyo University, Tokyo, Japan

Researchers analyzed 214 histologic samples that were selected from patients with lung adenocarcinoma who underwent surgical resection between 2010 and 2016 at the Teikyo University Hospital. Of those, 65 were perilipin 2 positive and 149 were perilipin 2 negative.

This study demonstrates that high perilipin 2 expression in lung adenocarcinoma was associated with more aggressive disease progression and shorter recurrence-free survival times than low perilipin 2 expression. Lung adenocarcinoma cell line with knockout of PLIN2 expression exhibited significant reduction in lipid droplet accumulation and suppression of cell proliferation and migration ability.

"Perilipin 2 is required for the maintenance of lipid droplets, which serve as an energy source driving cancer progression. These findings advance our understanding of lipid mechanisms in disease progression and will help estimate the likelihood of recurrence as well as help identify new targets to treat lung adenocarcinoma," concludes Dr. Miyata-Morita.

Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers with high global morbidity and mortality rates. While targeted therapies for driver mutations (specific genetic changes) have improved outcomes for some advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients, many others lack these mutations and are typically unresponsive to currently available targeted therapies.

Announcing a new article publication for Zoonoses journal. In past decades, numerous emerging infectious diseases have markedly affected global health and social-economic development.

Consequently, the concept of "disease X" has been developed and lists of the pathogens with potential to cause future pandemics have been proposed and updated several times by the World Health Organization. This article analyses the major features of pathogens with high probability to cause future COVID-19-like pandemics, on the basis of their transmission routes, animal-human interfaces, herd immunity barriers, and evolutionary and mutational characteristics. High-priority viral infectious diseases with potential to become disease X in the future, are also evaluated on the basis of their transmission pathways, including airborne/respiratory, vector-borne, and direct contact. Overall, viruses had much greater likelihood of becoming "pathogen X" than either bacteria or other microorganisms.

Respiratory viruses, particularly RNA viruses, have notably high potential to become pathogen X. Vector-borne viruses might also become pathogen X, and mosquito-borne viruses would be more likely than tick-borne viruses to do so. Many contagious viral infectious diseases lead to severe clinical outcomes but have relatively low likelihood of causing global pandemics. Coronaviruses in the Coronaviridae and influenza viruses in the Orthomyxoviridae were identified as top-priority pathogens X with potential to cause the next COVID pandemic.

Activation of the body's opioid system may be required for ketamine's antidepressant effects, new research hinted.

In a small study of adults with major depressive disorder, taking the opioid blocker naltrexone before a low-dose ketamine infusion both blunted the surge in glutamate — a key brain chemical linked to mood — and reduced ketamine's rapid antidepressant benefit the next day.

“These results suggest that opioid receptors help mediate ketamine's effects and that blocking opioid receptors may lessen ketamine's acute mood-lifting action,” lead researcher Luke Jelen, MBBS, clinical lecturer in psychiatry, King's College London, London, England, told Medscape Medical News.

“However, this was a small, mechanistic study, not a treatment trial, so there is no immediate indication to change clinical practice or avoid naltrexone. Larger, dedicated clinical studies are required before recommending any alteration to current protocols,” Jelen cautioned.

The study was published online on July 24 in Nature Medicine.

Ketamine's rapid-acting antidepressant effects are thought to work by transiently elevating glutamate in the anterior cingulate cortex and other frontal regions, setting off a cascade of plasticity-related pathways.

Prior animal and small human studies have suggested that activating mu-opioid receptors might be necessary for ketamine's mood benefits.

To investigate, Jelen and colleagues enrolled 26 adults with moderate-to-severe depression in a randomized double-blind crossover trial separated by 3 weeks.

Participants received either oral placebo or 50 mg naltrexone 1 hour before receiving intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg).

During the first 30 minutes of each infusion, they measured brain glutamatergic activity in the anterior cingulate cortex using functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Depressive symptoms were measured before and 24 hours after infusion, when ketamine's antidepressant effects peak, using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).

Compared with placebo, pretreatment with a single 50-mg dose of oral naltrexone reduced the brain's glutamatergic response and dampened the average improvement on MADRS measured 24 hours later, the researchers observed.

Specifically, the glutamate signal climbed significantly during ketamine when participants had taken placebo, but the rise was significantly smaller when they had taken naltrexone (P = .029; Cohen's d = 0.34).

“We also identified a sex-related effect: The attenuating effect of naltrexone on glutamate activity appeared more pronounced in males with depression than in females with depression,” Jelen said.

Alongside the attenuation of ketamine-induced glutamatergic activity, naltrexone pretreatment also led to less marked reductions in clinician-rated MADRS scores 24 hours after infusion — equating to a 28% attenuation in the main effect of ketamine (P = .023), the researchers reported.

Reductions in self-reported depressive measures were numerically lower in the presence of naltrexone than in the presence of placebo, but the differences were not statistically significant.

“The possibility of an opioid mechanism underlying the antidepressant mechanisms of ketamine has been a recent subject of considerable debate. Our study provides evidence that opioid system activation may contribute to the acute antidepressant effects of ketamine,” the authors wrote.

Looking ahead, Jelen told Medscape Medical News, a larger, well-powered study should include a true placebo-infusion arm to disentangle naltrexone's effects on both ketamine and placebo responses.

He also noted that adding PET imaging would directly quantify opioid-receptor engagement, and prespecified analyses by sex are essential, given the stronger glutamate-dampening effect observed in men.

“Understanding more about how ketamine works can lead to treatment being personalized for different people, which is vital for creating safe and effective treatments,” Jelen said.

The study had no commercial funding. Jelen had no relevant disclosures.

TORONTO — A number of modifiable risk factors are more common in women than in men and have a greater impact on cognition, an early look at new research showed.

Six modifiable dementia risk factors were more prevalent in women, whereas only three were more common in men. Investigators also found that the impact on cognition from some of these factors was greater in women than in men, especially hearing loss and diabetes.

However, the impact of these and other risk factors varied by age.

The results suggest personalized health and lifestyle interventions should consider both sex and age, study author Megan Fitzhugh, PhD, assistant professor, Department of Neurosciences, University of California San Diego, told Medscape Medical News.

“Clinicians should familiarize themselves with the 14 identified modifiable risk factors, and if their patients have these risk factors, consider their sex and age, and try to target the behavior changes accordingly to minimize the impact on cognition and dementia risk,” Fitzhugh said.

The findings were presented on July 28 at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference (AAIC) 2025.

It's well-known that women are at greater risk for dementia. The lifetime risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is 1 in 5 for women compared with 1 in 10 for men.

Sex-specific factors such as pregnancy and menopause may contribute to this imbalance. But while many researchers tackle this issue from a biological perspective, Fitzhugh focuses on the effects of modifiable risk factors.

She used the 2008 wave of the Health and Retirement study, an ongoing population-based study of a representative sample of American retirees and their spouses who complete questionnaire every 2 years (in “waves”).

After excluding anyone younger than 40 years and those without self-reported risk factor information, the study sample included 17,182 individuals.

Fitzhugh concentrated on items included in the Lancet Report on Dementia Prevention. As reported by Medscape Medical News, 45% of dementia risk factors are potentially modifiable.

Risk factors identified in the Lancet report include less education in early life (contributing 5% to risk); hearing loss (7%), elevated low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (7%), depression (3%), traumatic brain injury (3%), physical inactivity (2%), diabetes (2%), smoking (2%), hypertension (2%), obesity (1%), and excessive alcohol (1%) in midlife; and social isolation (5%), air pollution (3%), and vision loss (2%) in late life.

Looking at prevalence, investigators found that six of the 14 risk factors were more common in women, including physical inactivity, depression, smoking, poor sleep, less education and poor vision (for example, glaucoma or cataracts).

Only three risk factors were more common in men, including hearing loss, diabetes, and alcohol use.

There was no difference in prevalence between men and women in high BMI, hypertension, and social isolation.

The Health and Retirement Study also gathers data on global cognition (immediate recall, delayed recall, numeracy, etc.) using a 27-item scale.

Fitzhugh separated mean cognitive scores for men and women and for three age groups (middle age: 40-59 years; middle to older age: 60-79 years; and oldest age: 80 years and over), then plotted risk factors in each group.

The graphs she created illustrate the differences in cognitive performance between having and not having a risk factor for each sex.

For example, the diabetes plot shows this risk factor has a much bigger impact on cognition in women.

“The line for men is relatively flat, so their cognition is really the same if they have diabetes or not, but for women, if they have diabetes, cognition is much lower compared to women who don't have diabetes”, explained Fitzhugh.

In addition to diabetes, other risk factors that have a greater cognitive impact on women included poor sleep, BMI, hypertension, poor vision, less education, and hearing loss.

Along with high LDL, hearing loss is the largest modifiable risk factor, accounting for 7% of dementia risk, according to the Lancet Commission report. But even though more men have hearing loss across all ages, it appears to be more impactful on women in terms of cognition, said Fitzhugh.

“Maybe we should be targeting women with hearing loss in middle to older age, making sure they get hearing aids,” she said.

Elsewhere in her research, Fitzhugh found women with hearing loss have a greater risk for dementia than men with hearing loss. “There's something about hearing loss in women that is particularly detrimental.”

The cognitive impact of risk factors also varies by age, investigators found.

Among women, the impact of hearing loss was greatest in middle to older age. Poor sleep only had a significant impact in middle age, which coincides with the menopause transition. And in the oldest age, less education was the only risk factor to have a significant impact on cognition.

In men, only smoking had a greater cognitive impact, but interestingly, only in the older age group.

“The way I think about age in this study is it's telling us when, potentially, we should be targeting these risk factors,” said Fitzhugh.

She recognizes this is “just a snapshot” in time and said she'd like to “map out” how risk factors impact cognition over time.

Commenting on the research, Liisa Galea, PhD, Treliving Family Chair in Women's Mental Health, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, and professor of psychiatry, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, said that more modifiable factors are associated with cognition in females than males is “most surprising.”

“Clearly these factors are important for everyone, but we need more targeted messaging to women across the lifespan about the importance of these variables for their brain health,” Galea said.

No outside funding was disclosed. Fitzhugh and Galea reported no conflicts of interest.

Gram-negative bacteria pose a significant threat to global health due to their high resistance to antibiotics compared to that of Gram-positive bacteria. Their formidable defensive capabilities stem from their outer membrane (OM), which acts as a selective barrier against harmful compounds. The OM is not merely a static shield but a dynamic structure crucial for the bacteria's survival and virulence. Thus, understanding how the OM is built and maintained is critical in our battle against drug-resistant infections.

To construct such an effective protective layer, bacteria rely on specialized molecular machinery. The lipopolysaccharide transport (Lpt) system is a key player in this process, as it integrates functional lipopolysaccharide complexes into the OM. Although some components of this transport pathway, such as the LptDE complex, are known to be essential for bacterial survival, the precise mechanisms governing their assembly and maturation remain unclear. 

In a recent study, a research team led by Assistant Professor Ryoji Miyazaki from the Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST), Japan, made an important discovery toward a better understanding of these processes. Their study, made available online on July 16, 2025, and scheduled for publication on August 26, 2025, in Volume 44, Issue 8 of the journal Cell Reports, reveals the critical role of a small protein called LptM in maturing and stabilizing LptD, which, together with LptE, forms the LptDE complex. The study was co-authored by Mai Kimoto, Dr. Hidetaka Kohga, and Professor Tomoya Tsukazaki from NAIST.

The team employed a combination of advanced techniques to shed light on the function of LptM. They investigated the precise timing of various events during LptD maturation, demonstrating that LptM acts at a later stage, influencing already-folded LptD intermediates. Through comprehensive mutational analyses, they identified a short region of LptM, comprising fewer than ten amino acid residues, as essential for its purpose. The researchers then used cryo-electron microscopy to acquire a high-resolution structure of the Escherichia coli LptDEM complex. This analysis, combined with biochemical experiments, provided an unprecedented molecular view of how LptM directly interacts with and stabilizes the LptDE complex.

Their results revealed that LptM positions itself at a critical interface within LptD, suggesting its role in fine-tuning the structure of this protein for Lpt. This enhanced understanding of the LptDE assembly process has significant implications for future therapeutic advances. "Our study highlights the essential role of LptM, providing fundamental insights that may support antibiotic design, as the LptDE complex has been identified as a potential target for novel antibiotics," states Dr. Miyazaki. "Thus, our findings contribute to the advancement of research that could guide future drug discovery."

Beyond potential drug targets, this research also sheds important light on a broader principle in biology. "Our findings suggest that small proteins, many of which have been previously overlooked, may play critical roles in the assembly and regulation of larger membrane protein complexes. This opens up a new perspective in basic biology, underscoring the functional relevance of small proteins," remarks Dr. Miyazaki.

Indeed, such results could open doors to new avenues for exploring the previously unrecognized functions of these "microproteins" in various cellular processes.

Unlike most cells in the human body, neurons-the functional cells of our nervous system-cannot typically replace themselves with healthy copies after being damaged. 

Rather, after an injury from something like a stroke, concussion or neurodegenerative disease, neurons and their axons, fiber-like projections that relay electrical signals, are far more likely to degrade than regenerate. 

But new research from the University of Michigan opens new ways to think about neurodegeneration that could help protect patients against that degradation and neurological decline in the future. The study, published in the journal Molecular Metabolism, could even bring us a step closer to understanding the rare cases when brains do heal and open new pathways to developing treatments, the researchers said. 

Their findings, made using a well-established fruit fly model, suggest that how resilient neurons are to degradation is connected to the fundamental process of how these cells process sugar. The work was supported by the National Institutes of Health, the U.S. National Science Foundation, the Rita Allen Foundation and the Klingenstein Fellowship in the Neurosciences.

"Metabolism is often changed in brain injury and diseases like Alzheimer's, but we do not know whether this is a cause or consequence of the disease," said senior author Monica Dus, U-M associate professor of molecular, cellular, and developmental biology.

"Here we found that dialing down sugar metabolism breaks down neural integrity, but if the neurons are already injured, the same manipulation can preemptively activate a protective program. Instead of breaking down, axons hold on longer." 

Postdoctoral research fellow TJ Waller, the lead scientist in the study, found that two particular proteins appear to be involved in extending the health of axons. One is called dual leucine zipper kinase, or DLK, which senses neuronal damage, and is activated by a disrupted metabolism. The other protein is known as SARM1-short for Sterile Alpha and TIR Motif-containing 1-which has been implicated in axon degeneration and is coupled with the DLK response.

What surprised us is that the neuroprotective response changes depending on the cell's internal conditions. Metabolic signals shape whether neurons hold the line or begin to break down."

Monica Dus, U-M associate professor of molecular, cellular, and developmental biology

Generally, in cases where neurons and axons don't degrade, DLK becomes more active and the movement of SARM1 is suppressed. But there are wrinkles. In fact, prolonged DLK activation over time leads to progressive neurodegeneration, the study showed, effectively reversing earlier neuroprotective effects. 

DLK, in particular, has emerged as a target for treating and studying neurodegenerative disease. But researchers will need to confront technical challenges to control DLK's dual harmful and beneficial functionality, Waller said.

"If we want to delay the progression of a disease, we want to inhibit its negative aspect," Waller said. "We want to make sure that we're not at all inhibiting the more positive aspect that might actually be helping to slow the disease down naturally." 

Mediating a molecule like DLK's double functionality presents a compelling puzzle researchers have yet to solve. Uncovering the mechanisms underlying how modulators like DLK switch between these protective and harmful states could hold massive implications for the treatment of neurodegenerative disease and brain injury, directly impacting clinical populations. 

Dus and Waller said that understanding this mechanism "provides a new perspective on injury and disease, one that goes beyond simply blocking damage to focusing on what the system is already doing to reinforce it."

Ōtākou Whakaihu Waka-led research has found stress-controlling brain cells switch on and off in a steady rhythm about once every hour – even when nothing stressful is happening.

Senior author Associate Professor Karl Iremonger, of Otago's Department of Physiology and Centre for Neuroendocrinology, says these rhythms shape activity patterns and alertness.

These bursts of brain cell activity seem to act like a natural 'wake-up' signal, and often lead to a rise in stress hormones, or cortisol.

This world first research opens the door to exploring how these patterns affect health, mood, and sleep."

Karl Iremonger, Associate Professor of Otago's Department of Physiology and Centre for Neuroendocrinology

For the study, published in high-profile journal PNAS, the researchers used an optical technique called photometry to track brain cell activity of mice and rats.

"This involved shining light into the animals' brains, allowing us to monitor brain cell activity over the day and night as the animals moved around freely. We could then look at how the activity of brain pathways is coordinated with sleep/wake patterns and stress hormone levels."

A group of brain cells called corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons were found to be particularly important for the daily rhythms of stress hormone release.

"These neurons turn on and off in a regular pattern about once every hour. Interestingly, we found that these changes were coordinated with patterns of sleep and waking which suggests that the pattern of release is coordinated with wakefulness or alertness.

"We also found when the CRH neurons were artificially activated, this changed the animals' behaviour – animals that were previously quietly resting became hyper-active."

Associate Professor Iremonger says the research findings may lead to a better understanding of how disrupted stress rhythms can result in changes in mood and disrupted sleep.

Drugs that decrease CRH stress neuron activity may also be beneficial at treating conditions associated with hyper-active stress responses.

"Our new research is helping us to understand how the brain controls these normal rhythms of stress hormone release. Knowing how these brain signals work will help us understand the links between stress hormone levels, alertness and mental health."

New research from the University of Arizona Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health showed that living in resource-poor neighborhoods may raise the risk of women developing diabetes during pregnancy, a condition with potential long-term effects on the health of both mother and child. 

Researchers found that mothers living in more deprived neighborhoods in Arizona were 20% more likely to have gestational diabetes mellitus, or GDM, compared with those living in neighborhoods with adequate resources. They reported their findings in Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology. 

The results add to growing evidence of the potential influences of neighborhood conditions on the health of pregnant women, especially for diabetes. They also point to a need to identify those communities that could benefit from preventative measures.

Where you live can influence your health. It can impact stress, access to quality food, the ability to interact with the outdoors and exercise – all factors that can affect health. We know there are racial disparities in GDM, and we wanted to go beyond that and more fully gauge the importance of social determinants of health at a neighborhood level."

Melissa Furlong, PhD, assistant professor of environmental health sciences who was the senior author on the study

The research team, including first author and former U of A graduate student Kimberly Parra, PhD, used birth certificate and maternal health information from the Arizona Prenatal Environment and Reproductive Outcomes Study. They examined more than 480,000 births in 15 Arizona counties between 2014 and 2020.

They combined that information with the Neighborhood Deprivation Index, or NDI, a mashup of neighborhood-related factors such as housing quality, violence, education, access to healthy food and poverty that reflects socioeconomic status in a neighborhood.

Then, they compared where women lived when they gave birth with values calculated from the NDI. 

"We compared people who live in highly deprived neighborhoods to those who live in less deprived neighborhoods and looked at the risk of GDM by neighborhood score," Furlong explained. "We found women living in neighborhoods with higher deprivation scores were more likely to have GDM. The results suggest the neighborhood you live in has some influence on your risk for GDM." 

The study showed that overall, approximately 7.8% of the women had GDM, which was similar to the incidence in the general population; however, neighborhood location and make up mattered. For example, the GDM incidence was as high as 12% in communities with a high proportion of patients identifying as Native American or American Indian. Those living in poorer neighborhoods had smaller babies and were younger, less educated, more overweight and more likely to have public insurance. 

The study found that Native Americans had a high incidence of GDM – almost 18% – which is more than double the overall incidence in the general population. 

Prior research has linked neighborhood conditions to a lower control of diabetes, but few studies have examined the impact of socioeconomic factors on the development of diabetes in pregnant women living in poor neighborhoods. 

"From a policy perspective, there could be more emphasis on eliminating food deserts, for example, and promoting programs that increase access to higher quality housing, healthy food and prenatal care," Furlong said. 

The results also highlight the need to better understand the factors contributing to the higher incidence of GDM among Native Americans and find ways to address the disparity. 

Furlong noted there is much more to learn about the potential role neighborhoods play in influencing maternal health. 

"This is only a characterization of people who live in these areas who have a higher risk for diabetes," she said. "We'd like to know many more details about the neighborhoods themselves and how they can impact the health of people who live there." 

Additional co-authors from the Zuckerman College of Public Health include Leslie Farland, ScD, an associate professor of epidemiology, and Robin Harris, PhD, a professor emeritus of epidemiology. Parra is now a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard University.

A new study led by researchers from the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) finds that although many technologies claim to clean indoor air and prevent the spread of viruses like COVID-19 and the flu, most have not been tested on people and their potential risks are not yet fully understood.

Published today in the Annals of Internal Medicine, the research analyzed nearly 700 studies between 1929 and 2024 on engineering controls such as HEPA filters, UV light, ionizers and advanced ventilation systems designed to reduce infection transmission through indoor air. While these technologies are commonly found in homes, schools and public buildings, researchers found just 9% of studies examined whether they reduce illness in humans.

We were surprised to find that most of the research tested air cleaning devices in lab chambers, not in real-world settings where people live, work or go to school. We need stronger studies that look at actual health outcomes, whether people are actually exposed to fewer pathogens or get sick less often, and not just measurements of particles in the air."

Lisa Bero, PhD, professor of internal medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and co-author of the study

Most studies in the review focused on indirect measurements such as tracer gases, dust particles or harmless microbes rather than actual viruses or bacteria that cause illness. Very few tracked whether people experienced fewer infections when using air-cleaning technologies.

"Many of these technologies look promising on paper but we just don't know if they work in the real world," said Amiran Baduashvili, MD, associate professor of medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and the paper's first author. "People are buying and installing these systems in homes and schools hoping to protect themselves and their families but the science hasn't caught up to the marketing."

The study also raises concerns about potential health risks. Only a small number of papers examined harmful byproducts such as ozone, which can irritate the lungs and worsen respiratory conditions. Many air cleaning technologies, such as ionizers, plasma-based devices, and certain ultraviolet light systems, can produce ozone, yet few studies evaluate the safety of their long-term operation in homes and workplaces.

"Ozone and other chemicals created by some air-cleaning devices can actually harm the respiratory system, especially in children or people with chronic respiratory illnesses," said Louis Leslie, research services senior professional in the department of ophthalmology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and co-author of the study.

While the risks vary depending on the type of technology and how it is used, the researchers stress that more attention should be paid to possible unintended consequences.

"It may be worth checking whether the manufacturer provides data on any potentially harmful emissions from a device and what can be done to minimize them," said Bero, who is also with the Colorado School of Public Health. "Being more aware of possible risks is an important part of making informed decisions especially as more people and organizations spend money on these technologies and bring them into clinics, schools and homes."

The researchers are calling for a new generation of studies that evaluate these technologies in real-world environments such as classrooms and hospitals and track actual infections rather than relying on indirect measures like air particle counts. They also emphasize the importance of assessing potential side effects, environmental impact, cost, and accessibility, including how feasible these solutions are across different types of settings.

In addition, they recommend the development of a standard set of health-related outcomes for future research. This would make findings more comparable and more useful for informing public health policy.

"Public health decisions should be based on solid, independent evidence," said Bero. "We're not saying these technologies don't work, we're saying we don't know enough yet. Some of these studies are funded by the companies that make the technologies being evaluated, which creates a conflict of interest. Until we do know more, the public deserves clear and transparent information."

For those buying an air purifier or installing a new ventilation system to reduce illness in homes, schools or workplaces, the researchers recommend choosing technologies that have been independently tested in real-world environments. They also advise avoiding products that produce harmful byproducts like ozone. Most importantly they emphasize that dependable practices such as improving ventilation, opening windows and regular cleaning remain effective ways to keep indoor spaces healthier.

"This study highlights the urgent need for better science to guide how we make our indoor environments safer especially as respiratory infections continue to pose a serious public health threat," said Bero.

Have you ever wondered why some people who drink alcohol develop serious liver problems while others don't? A study from University of Louisville researchers published in May in Toxicological Sciences suggests that the answer might be hidden in everyday sources such as drinking water, food packaging or even non-stick cookware.

Scientists at UofL, along with colleagues from Boston University and the University of Massachusetts Lowell, have identified perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) as a potential environmental factor that worsens alcohol-associated liver disease.

PFOS is a man-made chemical belonging to the group known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), often referred to as "forever chemicals" because they do not readily break down in the environment or the human body. These substances have been used for decades in products such as non-stick cookware, water-resistant clothing, fast-food packaging, stain-resistant carpets and upholstery, and firefighting foams. Their extensive use has led to widespread contamination in the environment. Recent data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey show that PFAS can be detected in approximately 95% of Americans, sparking increasing concern about their long-term health effects.

At the same time, alcohol consumption remains a significant global health issue. According to the World Health Organization, alcohol contributes to nearly 3 million deaths worldwide each year, and its consumption continues to rise globally. In the U.S. alone, excessive alcohol use is responsible for approximately 95,000 deaths annually, making it one of the leading causes of preventable death and a major contributor to liver disease.

Given the increasing prevalence of alcohol consumption and the widespread presence of PFAS in the environment, many individuals who drink alcohol may be inevitably exposed to these persistent pollutants. This makes it critically important to study how combined exposures to alcohol and environmental chemicals like PFOS might influence liver health."

Matthew Cave, UofL professor of medicine and publication co-author

Although it is well known that both alcohol and PFOS cause liver damage individually, little has been understood about their combined effects until now. Recent studies have shown that only about 35% of heavy drinkers develop severe forms of liver disease, indicating that additional factors such as genetics, sex, microbiome and environmental exposures may contribute to individual susceptibility.

"This work helps explain why two people with similar alcohol consumption may experience very different liver outcomes," said Frederick Ekuban, assistant professor of medicine at UofL and first author of the study. "Environmental exposures like PFOS may be the missing link."

Using animal models, the researchers simulated real-world exposures to both alcohol and PFOS. The study showed that co-exposure to alcohol and PFOS significantly increased fat accumulation and markers of liver damage, as well as clear signs of disrupted metabolism and activation of genes and pathways predicted to be associated with oxidative stress and cancer development.

In short, the study demonstrates that PFOS exposure can significantly worsen liver damage when combined with alcohol consumption. While this research used high levels of alcohol to understand the underlying mechanisms, the findings reveal important biological pathways that warrant further investigation across different drinking patterns.

The research team also found that PFOS interferes with the liver's ability to manage fats, disrupts its natural protective and repair systems and activates pathways that promote liver injury.

"While the liver typically has a remarkable capacity to recover from alcohol-induced stress, PFOS appears to push that resilience beyond its limits, resulting in compounded and more severe damage," said Jennifer Schlezinger professor of environmental health at Boston University and co-author of the publication.

Perhaps most concerning, the team discovered that 60% of all PFOS exposure ended up concentrated in the liver, exactly where alcohol damage occurs.

Ongoing research at UofL is examining how other PFAS compounds may interact with alcohol, whether males and females respond differently to these exposures and what the long-term consequences of combined exposures might be. The team is also exploring whether targeted therapies can be developed to prevent or mitigate this type of liver damage.

Although more studies are needed, people can take practical steps now to limit their exposure to PFAS. These include:

Given that liver disease affects millions of Americans and is becoming more prevalent worldwide, the findings of this research support growing calls for stronger regulation and oversight of persistent chemical contaminants. By better understanding the hidden interactions between environmental toxicants and lifestyle behaviors, scientists and policymakers may be better equipped to prevent and treat liver disease.

People in America adopt hundreds of thousands of children every year, but not all of them receive health insurance once adopted into their second home. A study by University of Maryland (UMD) School of Public Health, out today in Health Affairs, reveals major differences in coverage depending on adoption type (domestic or international) and citizenship status of the adoptive parent. 

"Adopted children generally have more and different health needs – such as cognitive or physical difficulties – than non-adopted children. Previous studies, many of which did not differentiate between different types of adoptees, found adopted children were consistently insured," said study co-author Jamie Fleishman. 

"Our study, which considered four types of adoptee, found a very high uninsured rate for some adopted children – particularly those adopted internationally by non-citizens living in the United States." The study found that almost one-third (30.7%) of the children in this group has no health insurance at all.

Fleishman is a Chinese transnational adoptee who was adopted from China to an American parent. She graduated from UMD in 2024 with a masters in public health (MPH), focusing on health equity, and her master's thesis was the foundation of this study. 

The UMD researchers analyzed insurance coverage over five years (2018 – 2022,) comparing adopted and non-adopted children up to 17 years old who live with their head of household, using data from the American Community Survey (ACS), which includes over three million adopted and non-adopted children. The study distinguishes between international and domestic adoptions and further distinguishes international adoptees by householder citizenship, because international adoptees of U.S. citizens are, similar to a U.S.-born child, eligible for public insurance coverage such as Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) or Medicaid. 

The findings clearly show that we must not treat adopted children as a single group. International adoptees and domestic adoptees are very different. The citizenship status and other factors such as income of adoptive parents are also different. So policies need to be tailored to these differences."

Dahai Yue, co-author and assistant professor in SPH's Department of Health Policy and Management

Yue was Fleishman's MPH advisor. 

The study compared four different groups of adopted children in the U.S. against a control group of non-adopted children: domestic adoptions, international adoptions by U.S. citizens, international adoptions by non-U.S. citizens and children who live with a biological relative, such as a grandparent, but who is not their biological parent. 

Children adopted internationally by non-U.S. citizens living in the U.S. have the highest uninsured rate at 30.7%. They also had lower rates of private and public health insurance than other adoptee groups, by 12.1 percentage points and 9.1 percentage points respectively. The non-U.S. citizens adopting these children were also more likely to be the same race as the child, more likely to have an income below the federal poverty line and less likely to own a home than other groups. 

The study also highlights a significantly high uninsured rate (7.3%) for children who are living with relatives other than their biological parents, and who are also more likely to live in lower-income families. 

"There are likely multiple factors behind these disparities which were not examined in this study. But the data is clear: These groups are not homogenous, despite previous research often treating them as a single population. These children are worthy of policy attention to ensure all children have access to health care in the United States," said Yue.

Aston Villa are on the verge of signing Ivory Coast international forward Evann Guessand from Nice, which could open the door to Ollie Watkins' exit from Villa Park this summer. Watkins has been linked with a move away from the club since the start of the summer transfer window, with several teams, including Manchester United, keen on signing the England star.

Yoane Wissa has rejoined Brentford's pre-season training amid strong transfer interest from Newcastle United. The Magpies have been linked with a move for Wissa, but the Bees had made it clear that they won't sell the forward for less than £40 million. Brentford have already sold Bryan Mbeumo to Manchester United are thus reluctant to let another first-team star leave.

NBA icon Magic Johnson was quick to congratulate Washington Spirit star Trinity Rodman after the U.S. Women's National Team forward scored a last-gasp winner in her first NWSL appearance in four months.

Rodman, 23, who had been sidelined since April, dealing with lingering back issues, came on as a late substitute for the Spirit against the Portland Thorns on Sunday with the game tied at 1-1.

It took the two-time NWSL Best XI member just 16 minutes to find her way back on the score sheet with a thundering shot into the roof of Mackenzie Arnold's net, handing the Spirit three valuable points. Rodman immediately burst into tears as she was swarmed by thrilled teammates in front of an ecstatic fanbase at Audi Field.

Among those to congratulate Rodman was Johnson, who played against her dad and NBA legend Dennis between the mid-1980s and 1990s, and invested in the Spirit in 2024.

In a post on social media, the NBA Hall of Famer wrote, "Welcome back superstar Trinity Rodman! Congratulations on scoring the game winning goal for our Washington Spirit in a 2-1 victory over the Portland Thorns. The entire National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) has missed you!"

Another sporting star to celebrate Rodman's heroic return was, of course, her partner and World No. 7 tennis player Ben Shelton. Unable to attend the game as he was in Toronto for the National Bank Open, Shelton beat Italian Flavio Cobolli in three sets to reach the quarter-finals, for what was his 100th career ATP Tour win.

The 22-year-old was later asked whether his win or Rodman's goal was the day's standout accomplishment, to which he responded, "I think Trinity Rodman scoring a goal.

"One year anniversary from her incredible goal at the Olympics, hadn't played in 100-something days and she goes in and in 15 minutes scores a banger. It's pretty cool, especially [because] she was emotional. I'm always happy for her."

After the game, a clearly emotional Rodman was interviewed on the pitch by ESPN, commenting, “Holy cow, that was just the hardest thing I've had to go through with injury and everything.

"So, being back with the team, especially at home, with the stadium and the crowd behind me … scoring a goal like that — you saw I buried it. I was not going to miss it. I'm just really happy to be back.”

Rodman later explained how this latest injury setback presented her with "a lot of unknowns," but thankfully, now, she's on the other side.

"Being back and like knowing that I'm back for real and that the problem is like fixed and now I can just be back and work on the things I need to and kind of just get my groove back,” she told reporters.

"It may have looked like it was back, but there's still a lot of things I need to work on."

Rodman's game-winning goal means the Spirit head into their next game on Saturday against Gotham FC third in the NWSL with 26 points - tied with the second placed Orlando Pride.

By Francisco Quatrin

Real Madrid has used its official television channel to protest the league's refusal to delay their LaLiga debut beyond Tuesday, August 19. 

The club argues that their participation in the Club World Cup—where they reached the semifinals—left them with significantly less rest and preparation time compared to their main rivals following the end of last season.

The televised protest was based on a statement by legal expert Miguel García Caba, a member of Spain's Commission on Integrity and Anti-Corruption in Sport and Transparency International. While the statement didn't directly name Barcelona, it strongly suggested favoritism toward the Catalan club.

García Caba's written complaint stated: “This wasn't a decision; it was a slam of the door. A slam in the face of sports medicine, basic logic, and competition integrity. This is not independence—it's manipulation. The 2025–26 LaLiga season begins tainted, distorted, manipulated. One team starts at a clear physical and tactical disadvantage—not by chance, but by design.”

The protest was sparked by the Spanish Football Federation's Competition Judge denying Real Madrid's request to postpone their opening match against Osasuna.

He continued: “Is it integrity to force a fatigued team to compete while others have weeks to prepare? Applying the rules as a hammer for some and a red carpet for others is not integrity—it's control. It changes outcomes. A point dropped in August is the same as a point dropped in May. This isn't a blow to one match, it's a blow to the entire season.”

Real Madrid TV endorsed García Caba's statement point by point, claiming the club was being placed at a disadvantage compared to key LaLiga rivals like Barcelona and Atlético Madrid. While Atlético also played in the Club World Cup, they were eliminated in the group stage and had the entire month of July to recover and prepare for the new season.

LaLiga president Javier Tebas quickly fired back via social media, offering a blunt rebuttal to both García Caba and Real Madrid. “This isn't about your personal interpretation of integrity,” Tebas wrote on X (formerly Twitter). “If it were, you'd be concerned that Chelsea, also a Club World Cup finalist, finished later than Real Madrid and still starts two days earlier in the Premier League. In France, PSG and other finalists start the season without anyone demanding changes to the rules.”

He continued: “Miguel, your ‘article'—if we can even call it that—has as much legal substance as I have love for curling. You say: ‘They hide behind the rulebook. Always the rulebook. But we all know it's bent when convenient. This time it wasn't.' Are you suggesting that during your time as the supposed top legal authority at the Spanish FA, the rules were bent at will? Is that what you stood for? Or are you implying that the Competition Judge should commit misconduct by interpreting the rules to please your so-called ‘Supreme Being'?”

Former Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere is in line for a shock return to his boyhood club after emerging as a contender for the vacant U21s head coach position. The Gunners are currently seeking a successor to Mehmet Ali, who departed the club earlier this summer to take on a senior coaching role at Brentford under newly appointed head coach Keith Andrews.

Uncover the players who shone brightest on soccer's biggest stage, only to fade from the international spotlight. A look at World Cup wonders.

by Joe GonzálezEditor

The FIFA World Cup is the ultimate stage for a player to announce themselves to the world. A standout performance can launch a career into superstardom, but for some, that single tournament is as good as it gets. These are the players who became household names for a few glorious weeks, capturing the imagination of fans with their skill, passion, and goals, only to recede from the global spotlight afterward. Here are of the most memorable one-tournament wonders in World Cup history.

Russian striker Oleg Salenko etched his name in the record books by scoring an incredible five goals in a single match against Cameroon at the 1994 World Cup. This feat, combined with a penalty in another game, made him the tournament's joint Golden Boot winner. However, his international career was brief, and he never reached that level of performance again.

Known as "Totò," Schillaci was a late inclusion for Italy's squad at the 1990 World Cup. He came on as a substitute in the first match and scored, sparking a run of six goals that saw him win both the Golden Boot and Golden Ball awards. However, he struggled with injuries and lost his form shortly after, scoring just one more goal for the national team.

Ahn Jung-hwan became a national hero for South Korea at the 2002 World Cup when he scored the golden goal to knock out Italy in the Round of 16. His celebration led to him being infamously fired by his Italian club, Perugia. While he had a respectable career, he never quite achieved the global fame his World Cup goal promised.

Fabio Grosso's performance in 2006 was the stuff of legend. The Italian left-back won a penalty against Australia in the Round of 16, scored the pivotal opening goal against Germany in the semifinal, and then converted the winning penalty in the final against France. He was a hero in that tournament but remained a more understated figure in the years that followed.

At 38 years old, Roger Milla came out of retirement to represent Cameroon in the 1990 World Cup. He scored four iconic goals and celebrated with his famous corner flag dance, leading the Indomitable Lions to the quarter-finals. He returned for the 1994 tournament, setting the record as the oldest goalscorer, but his career was defined by his 1990 heroics.

Gyan was the star of Ghana's incredible run to the 2010 World Cup quarterfinals. He scored three goals and was the team's talisman. However, he is perhaps most remembered for his dramatic penalty miss in the final minute against Uruguay, which would have sent Ghana to the semifinals. His career never again reached such international heights.

James dazzled the world with his performances at the 2014 World Cup, scoring six goals to win the Golden Boot, including a stunning volley against Uruguay. He earned a high-profile move to Real Madrid, but his club career struggled to meet those expectations, and he has since bounced around several different clubs.

Dutch coach Louis van Gaal made a legendary substitution in the 2014 quarterfinal, bringing on Tim Krul for the penalty shootout. Krul saved two penalties, becoming an instant hero. However, he was quickly relegated back to a backup role with the national team and is mostly remembered for that single, high-stakes moment.

Fontaine's performance at the 1958 World Cup is arguably the greatest of all time. He scored an astonishing 13 goals in just six matches, a record that still stands. Unfortunately, his career was cut short by a serious leg injury just four years later, preventing him from ever competing in another World Cup.

A World Cup winner with Brazil in 2002, Rogerio Ceni is known for his remarkable career as a goalscoring goalkeeper. He scored more than 100 goals for São Paulo, making him a legend in Brazil. However, he was a backup to Dida in 2002 and never appeared in a World Cup game, making his trophy win the extent of his World Cup glory.

The USMNT Transfer Notebook tracks American player movements, with latest developments for those in the U.S. national team pool

The European summer transfer window has roughly four weeks remaining, and the U.S. men's national team will report in roughly five weeks for a pair of international friendlies. Across the past few weeks, there have been several transfer developments for players with high hopes for the 2026 World Cup.

Defender Max Arfsten, a breakout star at the Gold Cup, is the subject of transfer interest in both France and England, and could depart MLS side Columbus Crew this summer. Midfielder Yunus Musah is back on the radar of Napoli, with a move from AC Milan reportedly heating up after interest surfaced in June. In Germany, Borussia Dortmund are now contemplating the effects of a permanent Cole Campbell departure, and a move away could be a difficult task suddenly. 

Then, it appears Tim Weah's months-long transfer saga with Juventus might finally be over. The Bianconeri have reportedly agreed to sell him to Marseille in France on a permanent transfer.

Real Madrid forward Endrick joined Real Madrid last year after turning 28 in the summer. Los Blancos had agreed to sign the teenage sensation when he was just 16 after he impressed playing for a Brazilian side, Palmeiras.

In his first season in a elite shirt, Endrick struggled to get on the field under head coach Carlo Ancelotti. He featured in 37 games, starting just eight, with five of those coming in the Copa del Rey. He started three games in La Liga, scoring once. With the lack of game time, he was expected to go out on loan, and reportedly he nearly did this summer.

According to Arancha Rodríguez on El Partidazo de COPE, Endrick was very close to joining La Liga side Real Sociedad on loan for the upcoming season. Everything was agreed upon, but the unfortunate injury halted the move.

The Brazilian picked up the injury during training at the Club World Cup. He had just recovered from the injury that saw him miss the final few games of the previous season, flying in to join up with the squad midway through the tournament. However, he suffered a setback.

Star forward Kylian Mbappe went down with an illness before the first game in the United States. Had Endrick been available, he could have had a chance to impress new head coach Xabi Alonso. However, it was another young player, Gonzalo Garcia, who got the nod, and he took the opportunity.

The reports from the media suggested that Garcia and Endrick would go out on loan, with the Brazilian the No.1 candidate. That may look to be correct if Rodríguez's comments are to be true. The loan move would have done Edrick good, which could have given him more opportunities to get on the field. Whoever is the No. 2 striker is going to find it hard to knock Mbappe out of the starting lineup, so the third-string player is going to struggle to see any game time.

Endrick could be loaned out in January once he recovers from his injury. He could also work his way back into Alonso's plans before then.

The European Championship is a pan-European continental tournament, while the World Cup has teams from all continents. The FIFA World Cup is the biggest international soccer event in terms of global audience, but the UEFA Euro Championship is the foremost continental tournament. Those are two soccer tournaments that have similarities and differences.

To begin with, the structures of both competitions are similar. Both are held every four years and contain group stages of four teams, followed by the finals. Likewise, in both, the top two finishers progress into a knockout stage. Some third-place teams can also make it through in the European Championships, and it will be the same in the FIFA World Cup from 2026.

Where the differences begin, however, are in the number of teams. The World Cup has 48 teams from 2026 onward (expanded from 32), while the Euro Championships have half the number, 24 in total. The Euro Championship is half the size with fewer groups and matches. At any rate, this is inevitable, for it is only a continental tournament.

In terms of participants, the World Cup and the Euro Championship share a fair number of the same national teams. Europe has the most teams competing in the FIFA World Cup, and usually, at least a few European teams always reach the latter stages of the semi-final, final, or even win it. Brazil and Argentina have been the only teams that have genuinely challenged the European hegemony of the event.

Beyond that, World Cup participants usually have a fair number of average teams outside of Europe, and even some sides of weaker caliber. Minnows like Trinidad and Tobago, Panama, Qatar (automatically qualified), Zaire, El Salvador, North Korea, and Bolivia have made it to the main event, and many such lowly-ranked teams get thrashed. African nations have improved, but have sometimes provided easy ammunition in the finals for the Europeans. For example, Yugoslavia hammered Zaire 9-0 in the 1974 World Cup.

While it might seem obvious to suggest that the World Cup is harder to win, the Euro championship does not include such easy teams in the group stages. The likes of Greece and Denmark have been able to win the Euro tournament, while the World Cup is usually won by the likes of Brazil, Italy, Germany, Argentina, or France.

There is no doubt that 9-0 scorelines never happen in the Euro tournament, unlike when Germany beat Saudi-Arabia by the same scoreline in the 2002 World Cup. The flavor of European football can be more defensive, and the World Cup benefits from the Brazil and Argentina teams with great forward players.

The Greek victory in 2004 is a case in point. Greece won the Euros with numerous 1-0 wins. They did not attack so much, but were very organized and difficult to beat. It was getting men behind the ball tactics that worked a treat.

That is not to say that all European teams play like that. For they do not, with the likes of Holland and Portugal providing fantastic attacking players. Yet, there is a bigger defensive trend in European soccer.

For Brazil, and South American soccer more generally, there has always been a bigger emphasis on flair, creativity, and an attacking mindset. The 1970 Brazil team, one of the best teams ever, was the epitome of what Brazilian soccer is about. In 1970, the Samba boys played dazzling short-passing attacking soccer that enthralled the fans. Seldom have we ever seen European teams match that, but the 1954 Hungarian side was one of the closest matches.

Both tournaments provide top-notch football (from the best sides at least). Given the choice, I would probably prefer to watch the World Cup over the Euro Championship because of the greater diversity of soccer played, as well as the great teams that Brazil and Argentina can put on show. The European Championships miss the South American soccer stars, such as Messi, Pelé, Maradona, Neymar, and co. So, roll on World Cup 2026!

Chelsea finished the season really strong, putting together a strong run to get into the Champions League. They then kept that momentum up, winning the Club World Cup in the USA.

Since then, they've signed some really promising players. Everyone who supports the club is feeling good and confident, but on the London is Blue podcast they had some words of warning about overconfidence.

“What I'm worried about is that it's 50 games on top of however many this summer, on top of however many last season,” presenter Brandon Busbee said.

“Going to the Conference League final and that. And you've got players like Enzo, Cole Palmer, the other internationals, that are gonna talk to the club about making sure they're not pushing or risking too much ahead of a World Cup. We might be a victim of our own success.”

It certainly is going to be a uniquely difficult season to manage physically. It feels like just yesterday we saw the guys lifting the CWC trophy. The idea that they're going to be back in league action in two weeks just feels mad.

Co-presenter Nick Verlaney agreed that it could be a more challenging season than some expect given the huge bubble of optimism we're all enjoying right now, post Club World Cup success:

“You're gonna have to gun for at least 80 points to be in that top 3, to really be cemented up there [in the Premier League],” he pointed out.

“So I think it's going to be a big jump up from 68 points to get another 12 above where we were last year, potentially. But I think the team is capable.”

The naysayers seem not to have notice, Chelsea have built virtually two equally strong squads. Subs can in soos as our top stars seem a little off, without the team, taking a wobble, or loses momentum. I'm excited for Chelsea, and have faith in coach to get his permutations just right, to get full points, every game we play! Every game? OK, most important ones! There!

By Dante Gonzalez

Sergio Ramos has quickly become one of the standout figures at Monterrey CF, bringing his experience, quality, and leadership to the squad. Now, as Rayados look to rebound from their 2025 Liga MX Clausura round of 16 exit, they've been dealt a major blow: one of their rising stars is leaving for La Liga after a breakout performance in the FIFA Club World Cup 2025.

Monterrey made headlines at the tournament by holding UEFA Champions League finalist Inter Milan to a draw in the group stage and becoming the only Liga MX side to reach the round of 16. There, in a tightly contested matchup, Rayados were narrowly eliminated by Borussia Dortmund. One of the standout performers of that campaign is now headed to Spain.

Real Betis have officially announced the signing of Nelson Deossa on a five-year deal running through 2030. The La Liga side reportedly agreed to a €13 million fee with Monterrey for the Colombian midfielder, who leaves the club after just eight impactful months.

Deossa joined Rayados in January 2025 from Pachuca for a fee of €5.8 million. He wasted no time earning a regular spot in the starting lineup and went on to register seven goals and one assist in 29 appearances, including a standout strike in the 3–0 win over Urawa Red Diamonds in the Club World Cup.

In less than a year at the club, Monterrey have earned a profit of €7.2 million from Deossa's transfer. Now at Real Betis, the 24-year-old will look to secure a place in the midfield under head coach Manuel Pellegrini, who is retooling after losing USMNT star Johnny Cardoso to Atletico Madrid earlier this summer.

Despite playing fewer than 30 matches for Monterrey, Deossa quickly became a fan favorite, known for his energy, work ethic, and composure in the midfield. Before boarding his flight to Spain, the Colombian addressed reporters and shared a heartfelt message for the club and its supporters.

“I carry them in my heart because they treated me and my family very well. So it's not about that, I'm entirely grateful and I hope everything goes well for them over there, and that I can come back in the future,” he promised, leaving the door open for a return to Rayados.

After thanking head coach Domenec Torrent, Deossa sent his best wishes to the entire organization: “I hope they become champions. I always wish the very best to everyone, the front office, my teammates, the club, and the fans. They're happy for me, even though there's a bit of sadness about me going far away. But we're happy because it's a dream we've all been working toward.”

Jannik Sinner is ready to return to action at the Cincinnati Masters 1000, a tournament where he had triumphed in 2024 without playing his best tennis. The world number 1 was not at the top of his shape in Ohio a year ago, also due to the imminent ITIA ruling relating to his doping case. For this reason, the Italian ace had more difficulty than expected during his run, but he was able to raise his level in the decisive moments and lifted the trophy by beating local idol Frances Tiafoe in the final.

After winning his first Wimbledon title last month, the 23-year-old from Sesto Pusteria went on holiday to Sardinia and preferred to skip the Toronto Masters 1000 (where he had triumphed two years ago starting his rise). The four-time Grand Slam champion – who has also decided to reinstate Umberto Ferrara as his fitness coach – has already arrived in Ohio and immediately started practicing to get used to the conditions.

Jannik wants to defend the title he won there last season and above all he wants to gain confidence in view of the US Open, which will start on August 24 in New York. As everyone knows, most of the top players will also play mixed doubles in this edition and Sinner will join forces with Emma Navarro.

In a recent interview with 'SuperTennis', former ATP ace Davide Sanguinetti expressed his honest opinion on Sinner's current status: "He is a war machine who stops at nothing, he knows what his goals are and gives his best to achieve them. It must also be added that players are very professional nowadays and take care of every detail, whereas in my time we traveled almost alone.

Jannik deserves to be thanked because he has contributed more than anyone else to the growth of Italian tennis, everyone knows him in Italy and wants to become like him."

The world No.1 will have a first-round bye in Cincinnati and will make his debut directly in the second round.

BBC tennis presenter Qasa Alom has revealed he's spent time in hospital after delaying treatment for a health issue to work at Wimbledon. Alom has been with the Beeb since 2010, and has previously covered The Boat Race and also worked at the 2022 Commonwealth Games.

In June 2023, he was announced as the new presenter of Today at Wimbledon. The highlights programme airs daily during the tournament at SW19 and has become an iconic part of the annual coverage. However, Alom has now admitted to making an ‘error' by working throughout Wimbledon this summer, and has released a statement on social media to explain his situation to fans.

Can't say the last few weeks have been easy…” he wrote on Instagram. “Ever since the middle of Wimbledon I've been battling my body with a health issue. I put off getting proper medical care because I just did not want to miss The Championships (error). Eventually, it became too much and escalated.”

Alom also sounded caution to people reading the post, adding: “Thankfully, the NHS have been brilliant in giving me the care I needed. A real wake-up call to all those health-conscious young seemingly fit people out there seeing this.

He concluded the message by saying: “ I am grateful to my family for helping me through a difficult period, and now on the road to recovery.”

Many of his followers responded with messages of support. He regularly uses social media to provide updates on his tennis travels, and this summer described his job as a ‘privilege'.

CINCINNATI, AUGUST 5

Novak Djokovic pulled out of the Cincinnati Open on Monday for what officially was listed as a "non-medical" reason, meaning he will head to the U.S. Open without having played a match in about 1 1/2 months.

The 24-time Grand Slam champion hasn't competed since losing in the Wimbledon semifinals to eventual champion Jannik Sinner on July 11.

That straight-set defeat against Sinner at the All England Club came two days after the 38-year-old Djokovic took what he described as a "nasty" and "awkward" fall in the last game of his quarterfinal victory. Djokovic clearly was compromised against Sinner and unable to move at his best; he received treatment on his upper left leg from a trainer.

Djokovic's withdrawal from Cincinnati follows his decision to sit out the Toronto Masters that concludes this week. He cited a groin injury for that absence.

His previous event before Wimbledon was the French Open, where he also lost to Sinner in the semifinals.

Djokovic will have no hard-court tournament preparation before the U.S. Open singles competition begins on Aug. 24.

He has won four championships at Flushing Meadows, most recently in 2023. That was also his most recent Grand Slam trophy.

The world number one has been dominant in 2025, as he continues to pick up titles on the ATP Tour.

At Wimbledon, Jannik Sinner defeated Carlos Alcaraz in the final to win his fourth Grand Slam title, and his second of 2025.

Choosing to rest up after the tournament, Sinner withdrew from the Canadian Open, as he prepares to return to tennis in Ohio for the Cincinnati Open.

He'll do so as the number one seed and defending champion, having beaten America's Frances Tiafoe in the 2024 final.

However, just days before he returns to action, Sinner has been warned to ‘watch his back' by his fellow Italian.

Writing for La Gazetta dello Sport, 1976 Davis Cup winner Paolo Bertolucci shared his thoughts on Sinner's return.

“Now in Cincinnati, Jannik [Sinner] will need to immediately deliver a high-level performance to consolidate the points he's gained or make up for those he'll lose,” he said.

“He'll have to watch his back from the Spaniard [Carlos Alcaraz], now his only real rival for the world number one spot.

“The Spaniard has followed the same path as Sinner and will also restart on the scorching American hard courts of Cincinnati, but unlike the Italian, despite being behind in the rankings, he will have very few points to defend in this final stretch of the 2025 season.

“Only two men in command, two players with very different technical and behavioral characteristics, but both aware of the respective strengths of their main opponent.”

Sinner currently leads Alcaraz by 3,430 points in the world rankings, although Bertolucci is right to note that the Italian has a lot to lose over the coming months.

Between now and the end of the 2025 season, Sinner must defend over 5,000 points, whereas Alcaraz defends just over 1,000 points.

The pressure will certainly be on Sinner to defend those points, as he looks to finish as year-end number one for the second time in his career.

Finishing the year as the best player in the world is a remarkable achievement, and one that just 19 players have accomplished since the rankings were introduced in 1973.

Serbia's Novak Djokovic holds the record for the most year-end number one finishes with eight, while Alcaraz and Sinner sit on one each.

It remains to be seen who will finish top of the pile this time around, as it's almost too close to call.

Sinner may have more to defend between now and the end of the season, but that is, of course, thanks to his excellent performances on hard courts in 2024.

If the Italian can rediscover that form over the coming months, then there's a strong chance we will see Sinner finish the year as the world number one for the second year in a row.

Emma Raducanu made the most of her downtime before heading to the US Open by relaxing and soaking up the sun on an impromptu holiday.

The British No 1 took to social media to share a series of photos of her short trip to Martha's Vineyard, an island in Massachusetts and a popular tourist destination.

Raducanu will not return to the court until the Cincinnati Open begins later this week and she was therefore able to jet out to the haven with a group of friends.

She shared several holiday snaps of the trip on Instagram, accompanied by a lighthearted caption which read: 'Ted's on the vineyard - heard it here first. Spontaneous 36h New England summer fun time w [with] friends in MA.' 

Martha's Vineyard sits just south of Cape Cod in the Atlantic and is famed for its picturesque harbour towns, lighthouses, sandy beaches and farmland.  

However, there was no sign of Carlos Alcaraz, Raducanu's close friend and doubles partner at the US Open after they were confirmed as wild card entries.

Currently ranked No 33 in the world, the Brit was last in action on August 2 when she lost out to world No 7 Amanda Anisimova in the third round in Montreal. 

Shortly after the defeat, it was confirmed that she had hired Rafael Nadal's former coach, Francisco Roig - the eighth trainer of her burgeoning career.

Roig, 57, was in the box for all 22 of Nadal's Grand Slam titles and is highly regarded. 

Raducanu had worked with old friend Mark Petchey since the Miami Open and vastly improved under his guidance, but the fact he had to split his time between coaching and his broadcast commitments meant the partnership would never be long-term.

Petchey himself admitted in July: 'We are very aware she needs a second coach to come on board and maybe just one coach, not me, as well.' 

Talks with Roig began during Wimbledon, and a trial took place shortly after. Obligations meant he was not available until this week, and he landed in Cincinnati on Monday to help Raducanu prepare for the final WTA 1000 event before the US Open.

She will look to earn the wins needed to ensure she is seeded at Flushing Meadows.

Then, the US Open will get underway in New York on August 25. Raducanu's highly anticipated doubles partnership is set to take place on August 19 and 20. 

Alcaraz revealed he had approached Raducanu about teaming up through their agents, and she said yes after taking 'time to think a little bit'.

'I'm super excited about it. I think it's going to be great. It was an amazing idea for the tournament,' Alcaraz said after his opening win at Queen's.

'We will try to win. But obviously it's going to be really, really fun.'

ALMATY, Kazakhstan, Aug. 5, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Gorky Tennis Park in Almaty has been officially recognized as a Roland-Garros Club, joining an exclusive group of just three clubs worldwide affiliated with the iconic French Open. The partnership between the French Tennis Federation and Gorky Tennis Park highlights Kazakhstan's growing role in international tennis and the Kazakhstan Tennis Federation's commitment to world-class standards, driven by its president Bulat Utemuratov.


As part of this recognition, Gorky Tennis Park will serve as the exclusive host of the Roland-Garros Junior Series by Renault regional qualifying event for Central and West Asia. Finalists will compete at the series finale in Tokyo from 13 to 19 October 2025.

Aymeric Labaste, Head of International Development at Roland-Garros, commented: "The French Tennis Federation is proud to partner with Gorky Tennis Park, a world-class clay court facility. As our exclusive partner in Kazakhstan, the club sets a new benchmark for tennis in the region. We are especially pleased to see it hosting the Junior Series qualifiers since 2024."

The recognition builds upon the Kazakhstan Tennis Federation's efforts to expand access to high-quality infrastructure and international opportunities, including hosting ATP 250 tournaments since 2020 – first in Astana and since 2024 in Almaty. The KTF has also established 38 tennis centers across Kazakhstan over the past 18 years, creating a nationwide foundation for the sport's development.

"The designation reflects years of investment into Kazakhstan's tennis infrastructure and talent pipeline," said Yuriy Polskiy, President of the Asian Tennis Federation and Vice President of the Kazakhstan Tennis Federation. "We are proud to see Kazakhstan's leadership in tennis acknowledged at the highest level."

With the support of Kazakhstan Tennis Federation President Bulat Utemuratov, Gorky Tennis Park has undergone a full renovation in recent years, including the launch of a professional academy, upgraded facilities and new clay courts built to international specifications.

The partnership reinforces Kazakhstan's position as a regional leader in tennis and underscores the Federation's vision for long-term development from grassroots to elite level.

Alexei Popyrin's Canadian Open title defence came to an end in the quarterfinals, losing out to the number one seed.

12 months ago, Popyrin defeated Andrey Rublev to win the Canadian Open, picking up his first career Masters 1000 title.

Looking to defend his title a year later, Popyrin advanced to the quarterfinals, picking up impressive wins over Daniil Medvedev and Holger Rune along the way.

Unfortunately for the Aussie, he failed in his bid to reach the semifinals, as Popyrin lost to Alexander Zverev in three sets 7-6, 4-6, 3-6.

Speaking to the media after the match, Zverev shared his thoughts on Popyrin's level, as he predicted how high he could reach in the ATP Tour rankings.

During his post-match press conference, Zverev commented on Popyrin's success in Canada and suggested what he should do next.

“I think I said it kind of on the court already, he feels very comfortable here in Canada, so he needs to analyze what it is and why that is,” he said.

“If he can get that same level and that same quality of tennis to the rest of the tour, he can be a top-ten, top-eight player, fighting to qualify for Turin.

“Because he showed that this week. He beat [Daniil] Medvedev, he beat Holger Rune, he beat so many great players. Last year, he won the tournament.”

Zverev believes Popyrin has the potential to one day qualify for the ATP Finals in Turin, an event attended by the top eight players in the world.

Popyrin currently sits 43rd in the ‘Live ATP Race', leaving him a lot of work to do if he wants to qualify for the 2025 tournament.

To close the near 2,000-point gap to the qualification places, Popyrin will need to replicate the form he shows in Canada elsewhere on the ATP calendar.

Zverev believes the difference in level is just ‘too big' right now for Popyrin to become a top-eight player.

“So there is something here in Canada that he finds that brings out the best in him. If he can analyze it and take that to the rest of the year, he has a massive game; he can fight for big things. He can fight for making Turin, he can fight for being consistently a top-ten player,” he said.

“But he needs to analyze what it is and why that is. Because the difference in level is just too big, right?

“Between when he's playing really well, like he is here, and when he's not playing so well. So if he can narrow that down a little bit, there's no reason why he cannot be a top player.”

Reacting to Zverev's comments, Popyrin shared what he intends to improve upon in the future.

When told that Zverev had said that the Canadian Open version of Popyrin is ‘feared' by the rest of the ATP Tour, Popyrin provided an interesting response.

“I think I've shown it in the past. I appreciate the comments, obviously. I think it's always nice to be feared on tour,” he said.

“For me, it's the consistency aspect that I need to get better at.

“I keep saying it every time, this week's been great, I'm known to have a couple good weeks a year, but I want to have more and more good weeks, and hopefully they can fear me all the time, not just on my good weeks.”

In 2024, Popyrin had another ‘good week' at the US Open, when he knocked out 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic in the third round.

He'll no doubt hope for more of the same this time around, at statistically his most successful Grand Slam tournament.

Popyrin will first turn his attention to Ohio and the Cincinnati Open, which begins on Monday, August 11.

The Australian will head to Cincinnati as the number 22 seed, looking to improve upon his first-round exit in 2024.

Alex de Minaur has been on a tear since losing in the Wimbledon quarter-finals.

The Australian has won his last eight ATP Tour matches; winning the Washington Open title and reaching the Canadian Open quarter-finals.

De Minaur's most recent victory, against Frances Tiafoe, sparked broad admiration for the Australian on social media after an incredible demonstration of court coverage at a significant point in the match.

However, the 26-year-old has failed to defeat a top-10 ATP player this season, which raises various questions regarding his Grand Slam title-winning credentials.

After defeating Tiafoe in three sets at the Canadian Open, de Minaur discussed the motivation he takes from any criticism he receives.

Speaking to the Tennis Channel after his victory over Tiafoe, De Minaur explained what drives his constant pursuit of improvement.

De Minaur said: “I think what drives that constant pursuit of improving is just… yeah I hear all the reasons why I shouldn't be in the top 10, or all the reasons why I shouldn't be where I am, people don't understand it.

“When I see and I hear that, it just drives me, because I want more, I want to prove these people wrong.

“So it ends up making me find all those different aspects of my game where I can improve. And I know there's a lot of different aspects and obviously the serve is a big one. The serve comes and goes depending on the week but it has been an improvement.

“I feel like I've been a lot more aggressive and just have the mindset right, like be okay with the result not going your way but playing on your terms. So these kind of things all together have given me a pretty good mindset. That's what I'm clawing at at the moment, a pretty good mindset.”

De Minaur then added: “I just want it, I want it badly.”

Alex de Minaur faces big-serving Ben Shelton in the Canadian Open quarter-finals. Like de Minaur, Shelton came through a gargantuan battle, this time against Italian star Flavio Cobolli.

Shelton and de Minaur have never contested a match on the ATP Tour.

De Minaur will have to work on his serve ahead of his clash against Shelton. The ‘Demon' only made 42 per cent of his first serves against Frances Tiafoe. He was somewhat fortunate that Tiafoe also struggled on serve, landing only 48 per cent of his first serves throughout the contest.

After the match, Shelton spoke about de Minaur, saying he is ‘prepared for a war.' Shelton and de Minaur have never contested a match on the ATP Tour.

Speaking to reporters, Shelton said: “Yeah, he's a dawg. I'm ready for it. And for people who haven't heard that saying, that's a good thing ][laughing]. He's very fast. He's in a great rhythm, you saw what he did in DC. He's a great front runner, and you can never count him out when he's down.

So I'm prepared for a war. I'm really excited. It's our first matchup. We've had some practice, some competitive practice sets. He puts it on the line in practice as well, that's one of the things that I love about him. Yeah, I'm really excited. 

“I love playing against, you know, some of the best players in the world in late stages of tournaments, so that's the only thing that you can hope for, and what I always look forward to.

“He's playing amazing tennis. You guys saw it last week in DC. We saw some of the highlights of what he's done so far here. Yeah, I'm really enjoying and looking forward to that matchup.”

If you're a tennis fan, you've probably heard the name Victoria Mboko in the last few weeks.

Mboko is taking the tennis world by storm. The 18-year-old is currently competing in the National Bank Open in Montreal and has claimed upset wins over top seed Coco Gauff and Spain's Jessica Bouzas Maneiro.

She will face the 2022 Wimbledon winner, Elena Rybakina, in the semi-final, live on Sky Sports Tennis, and the Canadian home crowd will be cheering her on.

Mboko is an 18-year-old American-born, Canadian-raised tennis player and is the youngest of four tennis-playing siblings.

She showed promise as a junior, making her WTA Tour main-draw debut at 15 years old at the 2022 Canadian Open in the doubles draw, partnering Kayla Cross.

Her first singles appearance came at the 2022 Championnats Banque Nationale de Granby, where she received a wildcard and lost to fellow Canadian Rebecca Marino.

She won her first professional singles title at the ITF W25 tournament in Saskatoon in 2022, a title she successfully defended in 2023.

Mboko began the year ranked No 333. She started 2025 playing in a pair of ITF W35s in the Caribbean and won both of them.

But it didn't stop there.

The teenager racked up 33 wins and just three losses, and is set to move into the top 50 when the rankings are updated next week.

Mboko received a Miami wild card, where she claimed her first tour-level victory over Camila Osorio, before pushing Spain's Paula Badosa to a decider, which the teen lost.

She then qualified for her first Grand Slam main draw at the French Open, where she reached the third round, before stunning 25th-seeded Magdalena Frech in the first round at Wimbledon.

Mboko is the first Canadian to reach the WTA 1000 event's semi-finals since Bianca Andreescu's title run in 2019. She's also the youngest woman to reach the semis since Belinda Bencic's 2015 win in Toronto.

Former Wimbledon finalist Genie Bouchard said Mboko's rise "has been nothing short of incredible".

The recently retired tennis star said: "Anyone who knew her in Canadian tennis would not be surprised. She has so much power to her game. I remember practising with her when she was 14 or 15 years old and she was smacking forehands and bowling me off the court, so we all knew she would be really good.

"I'm so happy to see it happening at such a big event like this as well. She seems to be handling the moment really well, taking it all in her stride and using it as motivation."

After her win over Gauff, Bouchard added: "I'm very impressed with how cool, calm and collected she was on the court. She looked much more mature than her 18 years of age. You see her on the court and she's handling it like she's done it a hundred times."

Gauff was sent crashing out of the National Bank Open in Montreal in straight sets by Mboko, but praised the teenager's efforts.

"She's very athletic. She's a great ball striker, and she seems pretty positive out there on the court, doesn't get really too negative," Gauff said.

"I don't know her too well, but l have spoken to her a little bit since Rome.

"I think she has a great support system around her, and that's important when you're young and on tour. Hopefully, we have many more battles, and I look forward to playing her again in the future."

Alexander Zverev maintained his World No. 2 rank a few more months thanks to his Australian Open semi-final, but later fell to World No. 3. He suffered a first round exit at Wimbledon that worried fans, but Canada is proving very fruitful for the 28-year-old German (specially without Sinner or Alcaraz nearby), and has survived a tense match against defending champion Alexei Popyrin, 6-7(8), 6-4, 6-3, to reach semi-finals in Toronto. His rival will be Karen Khachanov.

Both players knew what it was like to win Canadian Open, with Zverev winning one of his first Masters 1,000 titles in 2017. And this victory means that he joins Novak Djokovic as the only two active players to reach 75th tour-level semi-final (Djokovic has 196), according to ATP Tour.

 Now, Zverev wants to vindicate himself after a so so year and hearing frequent boos on the court (last night, an spectator was escorted out after shouting at him). The two domestic abuse allegations on him weighed a lot, so he took the opportunity to say that he wants to be remembered for his tennis, "for what I've done on the tennis court... also for the good things I do outside the tennis court as well."There's quite a lot of work that I do with my foundation, and with my family as well, which can be beneficial and helps people around the world. So I would much rather be known and remembered for that than the outbursts that I used to have, right?" he said after the match (via ATP Tour), referring to the foundation that supports children living with diabetes, a disease he also has.Juarez Santos / Shutterstock

Tennis

Editor's note: This story has been updated during Victoria Mboko's run to the semifinals of the WTA 1,000 Canadian Open in Montreal.

Ripping a backhand past a former Wimbledon quarterfinalist to clinch a first Grand Slam win on the opening day of the French Open is a pretty good way to make tennis fans stand up and take notice.

Or maybe Victoria Mboko, the 18-year-old, American-born, Canadian-raised daughter of Congolese parents, has been announcing herself for months now. Maybe folks just weren't listening closely enough.

Everyone is now, as she backs up her run to the French Open third round with a last-four place at the WTA 1,000 Canadian Open in Montreal, one rung below a Grand Slam.

As her Roland-Garros debut approached, Mboko played the same brain game she has been playing through a startling climb up the tennis biosphere. She tells herself that what is happening isn't actually happening.

“Kind of just play it down,” she said during an interview after her 6-1, 7-6(4) win over Lulu Sun of New Zealand on a Sunday May. Three days later, she knocked out rising German Eva Lys 6-4, 6-4, to move into the third round at her first major. Her run ended there in a defeat to Zheng Qinwen, the 2024 Olympic gold medalist, but Mboko had shown everyone who had missed her rise that they should have been paying more attention.

“Pretend like you're playing somewhere else, that you're not at a Grand Slam,” she said of her strategy there.

It's another clay-court tournament. That way, I don't put as much pressure on myself and the points. I let loose and I kind of go for my shots a little bit more,” she said.

If playing make-believe before walking onto the biggest stages in tennis could lead to Mboko taking a spot next to Bianca Andreescu, Leylah Fernandez, Denis Shapovalov, Felix Auger-Aliassime, Milos Raonic and others in the Canadian tennis firmament, then Mboko probably ought to keep doing it.

Her performance in Paris, and then in Montreal, where she has knocked out two-time major champion Coco Gauff and surged into the top 50 of the WTA rankings, showed every bit of what has generated all the buzz about Mboko becoming the latest in a string of Canadians from immigrant families who have made it to the top of the sport.

“We know Canada is a very multicultural country and we are very accepting of everyone,” Andreescu, who has become a mentor to Mboko, said during an interview in Rome.

“I think it's a beautiful thing that we're all from different different cultures, different backgrounds, but at the end of the day Tennis Canada really has built this program in the acceptance of everybody, no matter who you are.”

The youngest by seven years of four tennis-playing siblings, Mboko has been winning more than just about anyone in professional women's tennis since the start of the year. She finished last year ranked 350th, with her coaches believing fully in her potential but also wanting her to take it slow, given her struggles with knee injuries in recent years.

Now they have another problem on their hands. Mboko has won so many matches that she has already played more than she has ever played before. She started the year winning 22 in a row on the ITF World Tennis Tour, two rungs below the WTA Tour. She lost one, then won another five, this time at a WTA 125 event, the next rung up, in Porto. She has won matches in Rome, Ga. and Rome, Italy at the Italian Open. Her record on the year is 49-9, as she prepares to face 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina in Montreal.

“I have been doing exactly the same thing I've been doing every other day. I like to keep the same routine when I'm in a tournament,” she said after her win over Gauff, who had beaten her in three sets at the Italian Open.

“I think I'm a little bit superstitious in that way, in that sense, but I just like to keep everything super simple. I like to do the exact same thing every day in a tournament.”

“That's a lot,” Marko Strillic, one of three coaches she works with at the Canadian Tennis Federation, said during an interview at the Italian Open.

“If she keeps winning, you have to figure out a way to manage the schedule so that she doesn't get hurt. This is for the long term.”

That was before Mboko cruised through French Open qualifying to earn her main draw debut, and then knocked through Sun as though she knew she would all along. Mboko was all business again against Lys, but for a couple of service breaks she quickly recovered from.

Her brother Kevin, 27 and a tennis coach in suburban Toronto, said that from the moment she woke up, she set her mind on only one thing: winning.

“She looked at us and said, ‘I got to win today,'” he said in an interview after she did just that. “We were trying to bring her down a little bit, telling her that it's all right, to just go out there and have fun, enjoy the experience.

“She was like ‘No, I got to win.”

That's how she was during her hit before walking onto the court, and it's how she was through the 79-minute match. Rain, wind, muddy balls, nothing really budged her off her game.

“It's been really calm between the days,” she said. “That's how my coach wanted it to be.”

She woke at a quarter to seven ahead of her match against Lys, ready to roll. There was quick breakfast, a ride to Roland Garros, a physical warm-up and then a 30-minute hit at 9:30 a.m.

“Then I just chilled in the locker room until my match,” she said.

All week, all month, really, there has been a ‘no big deal' sensibility to Mboko. She credited the presence of her sister and brother for that.

“There is so much happening even behind the scenes,” she said. “I feel like my family has been doing a good job of keeping me, I guess, isolated from it all. I have just been enjoying the moment. I have been enjoying time with my sister and my brother. I don't have so many people around me, and it's kept me very calm and very comfortable.”

At some point, this is going to get complicated, but for Kevin and everyone else closest to Mboko, this rocket ride both is and is not surprising.

Her oldest sister Gracia, 28, who has been courtside all event, played tennis for the University of Denver. She said that she and her brothers always knew that their baby sister had something they did not. Gracia recalled a local women's tournament at their home club in Burlington, a city in the Greater Toronto area of Ontario, that she played in when she was 17.

At the last minute, another slot opened up, and a pro at the club asked Victoria, who was just 9 and had come to watch, if she wanted to play. Victoria jumped at the opportunity and eventually faced her sister. Gracia won, 6-0, 6-0, but the way Victoria behaved, it was as though she had expected the results to go the other way.

“It's that belief in yourself that the very top of the one percent have,” Gracia, a consultant in private equity, said Sunday after watching her sister win. “It's: ‘not only should I win this match, I'm going to go do it.' And then she does it.”

At least she does now. For the past couple of years, a knee injury caused by both rapid growth and a bad fall on a tennis court has made that difficult. She spent much of last year based in Belgium at the academy of Justine Henin, the former world No. 1 and four-time French Open champion. She played little for the first six months of the year. Getting healthy was the priority.

Even then, she ended the year losing more than she won, dropping three of her last four matches.

“Last year ended very poorly,” said Kevin. “I didn't see any of this coming. No one did.”

Their father, Cyprien, a retired mechanical engineer who worked nights in part so that he could drive his children to their tennis obligations, was there too. Victoria's mother, Godée, an accountant, was back home, dealing with a heavy end-of-the-month workload, as was her other brother, David, a 25-year-old data scientist.

The Mbokos moved from the Democratic Republic of Congo nearly three decades ago, to escape the First and Second Congo Wars of the mid-1990s. Visa issues kept the family separated, with Godée in Montreal and Cyprien in North Carolina. Godée then moved to N.C., where the family lived for several years and where Victoria was born, before all moving to Toronto when she was still a baby.

Victoria didn't let the losses in the final months of 2024 get to her.

“I just thought new year, new me,” she said during an interview in Rome.

She decided to play like the version of herself that she has long believed in: an aggressive, athletic player who likes to take control of points and dictate the action. In Miami, she beat Camila Osorio, a 23-year-old tour mainstay, and pushed Paula Badosa, the No. 10 seed at Roland-Garros, to a third-set tiebreak.

Mboko has also showed off a precocious variety, mixing in drop shots and slices, including a hard, slicing forehand. Her coach is Nathalie Tauziat, who got to No. 3 in the world with a game molded around variety. But Mboko can also crack her serve at 120 mph. Not surprisingly, she grew up worshipping Serena Williams.

In Rome, she cruised through the first set in her second-round match against  Gauff, lacing backhands and forehands through the court on the Campo Centrale like a seasoned veteran. Gauff turned the match into one of her long-distance track races, getting so many balls back that Mboko was huffing and puffing between every point. But the world No. 2 came away seriously impressed. She “felt like playing myself,” Gauff said in a huddle after the match, especially with how well Mboko covered the court.

“On the movement, I would say she's up there with me on that,” Gauff, probably the best mover in the sport, said.

Gracia Mboko said her sister came away from that loss both devastated and determined.

“She told me she was so out of steam, that she couldn't believe how Coco was getting every ball back,” she said Sunday.

“She kept saying, ‘I got to get in shape.' It motivated her.”

It certainly did. When she faced a double-fault-stricken version of Gauff in Montreal, she kept her foot on the accelerator after winning the first set 6-1. She knew that Gauff would raise her level, try to make her nervous, try to impose her experience on the match. Mboko didn't let her. She stayed even until 5-4, then broke Gauff to win the second set and the match.

Mboko learned plenty from that first loss to Gauff. She knew she had let the world No. 2's grit frustrate her, thinking about the last point when she was supposed to be thinking about the next one. Her coaches are onto this.

“They'll start to snap me right back into it,” she said. “They'll actually say: ‘stay present, stay focused, or close it right here.'”

With 49 wins on the year, Mboko isn't exactly unfamiliar with closing it. Now she is doing it on the biggest stage in the sport.

The Serb, who was thrashed by Jannik Sinner in the semi-finals at the All England Club, picked up an injury during the defeat, and also withdrew from the ongoing event in Toronto.

Djokovic last set foot on a hard court back at the Miami Open in March, and hasn't played at a Masters event since April.

The three-time Cincinnati champion's previous appearance at the tournament came in 2023, winning the title as he overcame Carlos Alcaraz in one of the greatest best-of-three set matches ever.

As a result, Djokovic is next scheduled to be at the revamped US Open mixed doubles alongside fellow Serb Olga Danilovic on August 19th, after being awarded a wildcard entry.

The Cincinnati Open gets underway on Thursday, while the US Open begins on August 24th.

Venus Williams's breakthrough at Wimbledon changed everything. When she won her first singles title at the All England Club, she became the first African American woman to claim that championship since Althea Gibson in 1957. The victory inspired countless young athletes and shifted perceptions about who belonged at tennis's most prestigious venue.

During an interview with Marie Claire magazine, when asked how conscious she was of the change she represented, particularly for women of colour, Venus Williams offered a candid response.

“I was thinking about this today,” she admitted. Williams explained that her thoughts turned to family and heritage rather than broader history. “Gosh, if I have kids, I really have to raise them the way my parents raised us– just to be proud of who we were, to know our history as African Americans.”

She maintained a practical view of her achievement rather than getting caught up in the historical significance. “Me being there was not necessarily even special. It was like, I am who I am,” Williams said. Looking back, she recognized that her “level of oblivion” helped her stay grounded and play her best tennis when it mattered most.

Williams even talked about her relationship with her sister, Serena Williams, as they are set to launch a new podcast together.

Williams received wildcard entry into Citi DC Open last month and at 45, she became oldest WTA match winner since Martina Navratilova in 2004. She defeated Peyton Stearns in the round of 32 match, which was her first match in over 16 months.

Williams captured her first Wimbledon singles title in July 2000, defeating Lindsay Davenport 6-3, 7-6 in the final. The victory ended a 43-year drought, with Gibson being the last African American woman to win the championship. Williams's powerful serve and athletic play dominated the tournament from start to finish.

She dropped only one set throughout the championship run, showing remarkable consistency on the grass courts. The final proved particularly impressive, as Williams displayed ice-cold composure in the tiebreak to close the match. At just 20 years old, she had reached the summit of her sport.

Her breakthrough challenged decades of tradition at the All England Club and earned fans and fellow players widespread acclaim. The win also increased interest in tennis among diverse communities worldwide, proving that barriers could be broken at the sport's most prestigious venue.

Happy Birthday to Venus Williams 🎂🎈

Williams went on to claim four more Wimbledon singles titles in 2001, 2005, 2007 and 2008, building one of the most impressive grass-court legacies in tennis history.

She became the first African American woman in the Open Era to achieve the No. 1 ranking in 2002. However, that first triumph in 2000 remains the moment that changed everything, showcasing her resilience and marking the start of a remarkable career at tennis's highest level.

Putting these two across from each other seems like a recipe for watchably feisty competition.BySteve TignorPublished Aug 05, 2025 copy_link

Two days ago, I wrote that it was a shame that de Minaur and Frances Tiafoe had only met three times, because they both play crowd-pleasing tennis in their own ways, and together they would make for reliably entertaining rivals. We saw that in their round of 16 match, which swung back and forth and went down to the wire.The same applies to Shelton vs. de Minaur, who have never played before. Their lack of head-to-head matches is more understandable, considering that Shelton is still fairly new to the tour. But putting these two across from each other seems like a recipe for watchably feisty competition. That should be especially true when they're ranked No. 7 (Shelton) and No. 8 (de Minaur), as they are now.

Shelton seems to understands what he's in for.“He's a dawg,” Shelton says. “I'm ready for it. And for people who haven't heard that saying, that's a good thing.”“He's very fast. He's in a great rhythm, you saw what he did in D.C. He's a great front runner, and you can never count him out when he's down. So I'm prepared for a war.”All of that is correct. de Minaur is coming off a title run in Washington and has won eight straight matches. That workload doesn't seem to be slowing him down; on Sunday against Tiafoe he made an Alcarazian get that went viral. He'll make Shelton earn everything he gets.

Can Shelton earn enough? Shelton has the height and m.p.h. advantage, and he'll match his serve-driven power game up against de Minaur's darting, never-say-die defense. We know what we'll get from de Minaur. Whether Shelton can stay consistent enough, and finish points where he has the advantage, may decide the result. He'll need his serve and his forehand, of course, but he'll also need his volley to be on point.Shelton has played well recently, but he has also tends to hit a ceiling at some point in a tournament, and nothing works the way it had been in his earlier matches. de Minaur could be that ceiling in Toronto. Winner: De Minaur

Jannik Sinner was noticeably absent from a list of the nicest tennis players on the ATP Tour, compiled by his fellow competitors. The revelation came during the National Bank Open in Canada this week, where a reduced field is competing for glory before the US Open later this month.

Four-time Grand Slam champion Sinner, who pulled out of the Masters 1000 event to recover after his Wimbledon victory, was among several high-profile stars who withdrew from the tournament, including Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic.

Despite his absence, it was Alcaraz who was the most frequently mentioned name on the lists compiled by Francisco Cerundolo, Daniil Medvedev, Holger Rune and Lorenzo Musetti. Casper Ruud, known for his kind demeanour like Alcaraz, was also a popular choice.

Cerundolo chose Ruud, Alcaraz, his brother Juan Manuel Cerundolo, Jakub Mensik and Mariano Navone. Medvedev also opted for the duo of Ruud and Alcaraz, adding Joao Fonseca, Andrey Rublev and Miomir Kecmanovic to his list.

Rune also selected Alcaraz and Cerundolo but made sure to give a nod to Gael Monfils and Ben Shelton, describing the latter as a "good lad." His other choice could potentially stir up controversy as he named Nick Kyrgios on his list, claiming that the Aussie, notorious for his fiery personality, is nice "with me personally", reports the Express.

Despite Musetti's list being dominated by his fellow Italians, Sinner was notably absent. Instead, the 23-year-old opted for Flavio Cobolli, Lorenzo Sonego, Matteo Berrettini and Simone Bolelli.

Sinner's omission is not a reflection of his character, as he has been highly praised by none other than his fiercest competitor, Alcaraz. Speaking about their off-court friendship to Gazzetta, the Spaniard said: "Tennis is a unique sport that allows you to be great rivals on the court and, at the same time, maintain mutual respect.

"Sinner and I are good friends; we can talk about many things off the court. I have great respect for him; he's a great person; I'm sure we'll always be able to maintain this relationship."

He added: "We talk a little bit besides tennis, about life. But not too much. It means we have a good relationship but we are not close friends. I think the respect we have puts us in a position that we have a really good relationship."

No stranger to one another on the court, Sinner and Alcaraz recently completed a battle for the ages at this summer's final of Wimbledon. While Alcaraz took the first set 6-4, ATP No. 1 Sinner came back to take the next three, and ultimately, his maiden title on the courts of SW19.

He's actually the first American to achieve the feat since the Masters 1000 level of tournament began in 1990.ByJohn BerkokPublished Aug 04, 2025 copy_link

Taylor Fritz has reached the quarterfinals of the National Bank Open for the first time after battling past Jiri Lehecka in the fourth round of the Masters 1000 event, 7-6 (4), 6-7 (5), 7-6 (5).With that, Fritz has now reached the quarterfinals or better at all nine Masters 1000 events in his career. Canada was the only one the No. 4-ranked American had been missing, having been stopped in the round of 16 twice previously, in 2022 and 2023.TAYLOR FRITZ'S BEST RESULT BY MASTERS 1000 EVENT:Won Indian Wells [2022]SFs of Miami [2025]SFs of Monte Carlo [2023]SFs of Madrid [2024]QFs of Rome [2024]QFs of Canada [2025]QFs of Cincinnati [2022, 2023]SFs of Shanghai [2024]QFs of Paris [2021]

There was almost nothing between Fritz and Lehecka on Sunday night, with zero—yes, zero—breaks of serve in the match, both players holding all 18 of their service games.

Craig Tiley wants to make the Australian Open one of the world's top sports entertainment events - and he's not waiting for disruption to arrive.

“We're trying to create our own disruption,” said Tiley, CEO of Tennis Australia, at the inaugural Sports Matters Sydney event. “If we don't become creative as a sport, we will lose our audience.”

Tiley outlined a future-facing strategy built around personalisation, content innovation, and what he calls the “festivalisation” of tennis - transforming the Australian Open from a traditional sports event into a cultural phenomenon.

Content has been disrupted - now what?

At the core of Tiley's vision is a radical rethink of content delivery. “The way fans consume content has been completely disrupted,” he said. “And we still have a top-down approach. That has to change.”

Tiley is pushing for a “bottom-up” content strategy built around personalisation and platform-agnostic distribution. Tennis Australia, he explained, has full production control across free-to-air, digital and streaming, with a mandate to tailor content to individual fan preferences.

One standout example? Animated match feeds - the wildly popular addition that began as an experiment, but has fast become the most-watched part of the annual summer tennis tournament. 

“Our broadcast partners even picked it up. Kids went from watching live matches to watching the animation. It exploded.”

Tiley hinted at a broader plan to build a white-label content engine, giving global partners more tools to engage fans in new formats, with AI and immersive media set to play an expanding role.



Festival of sport, platform for brands

The Australian Open's evolution is already well underway. Over the past decade, Tennis Australia has doubled down on direct fan relationships, brought production in-house and added new pillars to the Open experience: food, music, family and tech.

“We've added different layers so we appeal to the Fortniters and the Robloxers,” Tiley said. “Tennis is the core, but the younger fan is coming for everything else.”

The result? The youngest average audience of any Grand Slam, more than 1.2 million attendees and global broadcast reach. 

“We pretty much own January,” he said. “And we're proud to be the biggest annual sporting event in the southern hemisphere.”

The next phase of growth targets the real prize: the 99% of fans who aren't in the stadium.

“The in-stadium audience is less than 1%,” he said. “The real revenue is the audience that's not here. You've got to make sure you engage them.”

That means seamless, tech-powered experiences where fans don't even take their phones out of their pockets - on site or online. “If they don't get that, they'll just enjoy the content at home,” Tiley said. “We need to make every interaction count.”

Big risks, bigger vision

Tiley said his team is planning with 2030 in mind, backed by a 15-year roadmap split into three cycles. The focus now is globalisation, innovation, and new revenue models that don't depend on government funding.

“The challenge in five years will be access to funds,” he said. “Government support won't flow as easily - we have to be self-sufficient.”

That mindset is shaping Tennis Australia's appetite for innovation. “We're going to take some big bets,” Tiley said. “And if you fail, that's OK -just don't do it more than twice.”

For brands, the opportunity lies in aligning with a sports property that's actively redefining its role in the entertainment and tech ecosystem. “Sport is still the only live content where you can have real integrity,” Tiley said. “We've got to build on that.”

His message to marketers? Don't wait for change, be the one who drives it.

Alexander Zverev singled out a heckling fan straight after beating Alexei Popyrin. (Getty Images: Matthew Stockman)

Australian Alexei Popyrin's Canadian Open has ended in a three-set quarterfinal loss to first seed Alexander Zverev.

Popyrin won the first set in a tense tiebreak, but could not stick with world number three Zverev over 2 hours and 42 minutes in Toronto.

After the match, Zverev waved into the stands and said "bye-bye" to a fan who was heckling late in the match.

Alexei Popyrin's defence of the Canadian Open title has ended in the quarterfinals, with the Australian defeated by German top seed Alexander Zverev in three sets. 

Popyrin, who became the first Australian to win an ATP Masters 1000 tournament at last year's event, took the opening set before Zverev rallied. 

The German, who lost to top-ranked Jannik Sinner in the final at this year's Australian Open and made the French Open quarterfinal, not only overcame Popyrin but also a heckling fan late in the contest. 

After Zverev hit the winning point, he turned to the heckler and waved, saying "bye-bye", before meeting Popyrin at the net to shake his hand. 

Popyrin took the first set when his gentle backhand volley after a long rally grazed the top of the net and dropped for the winning point — much to the delight of his fans.

Zverev responded by immediately firing a ball completely out of the stadium in frustration, but quickly regrouped to go up 2-0 in the second set.

Popyrin grabbed a break of his own before holding serve at 4-4. Zverev, who won the Canadian title in Montreal eight years ago when he defeated childhood idol Roger Federer, took a 5-4 lead and then again broke his opponent to even the match.

Ousted at the quarterfinal stage of last year's tournament, Zverev got another break to go up 2-0 in the third set before serving out the match.

Zverev has two tournament wins on clay this year, and is the highest-ranked player competing in the Toronto field.

The German, the 2017 tournament champion, will face 11th seed Karen Khachanov in the semifinals.

Australia's number-one-ranked male player, Alex de Minaur, will face American Ben Shelton tomorrow morning, AEST, in his quarterfinal.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Leclerc Loses Out in Budapest

Radio Rewind: 2025 Hungarian Grand Prix

Yuki Tsunoda finished the Hungarian Grand Prix in 17th position, and the Japanese star has been reflecting on his weekend.

Yuki Tsunoda insisted that the gap he has to Red Bull team mate Max Verstappen has continued "to close" as he revealed car damage played its part in a disappointing Hungarian Grand Prix result.

The Japanese racer was knocked out of the first stage of Qualifying at the Hungaroring in 16th place, with Red Bull opting to start him from the pit lane in Sunday's race after taking new power unit components. However, he was unable to make progress as damage picked up midway through the Grand Prix hampered his efforts on his way to a P17 result.

While Verstappen also had a disappointing race in finishing ninth, Tsunoda's result means he has not scored for seven races and he still has just three top-10 finishes in Grands Prix since joining Red Bull.

“We knew coming into today that it would be tricky to move up into the points, and once I had damage to the front wing our race was effectively over,” he explained following the Grand Prix at the Hungaroring.

“The gurney flap fell off halfway through and that cost us a lot of pace and worsening grip, so we then lost the ability to make a positive strategy call that would benefit us.”

That wasn't the only thing to befall Tsunoda across the 70 laps of the Hungarian Grand Prix, with the Red Bull man alluding to another case of miscommunication, similar to that in Spa when he was left out one lap too long on the wrong tyres on a drying track, which cost him a shot at points in Belgium.

“Also, something we can improve a lot communication wise is that if I was fighting for the points, there was a situation that could cost quite big,” he added.

“It has happened the last two weeks, the last two races back-to-back in a row so it is starting to get very frustrating with that. Something we have to improve a lot and fight hard the second half.”

Despite the negatives, there are still positives for Tsunoda to take away heading into the summer break. For example, since he got his hands on the RB21 floor upgrade to make his car the same spec as Max Verstappen's, his pace has improved – even if results do not reflect that at this stage.

“Looking back on the season so far, I can feel pretty positive, we've made progress, especially since the new floor upgrades were brought to Spa," he continued.

"The gap with Max continues to close, it may not feel like we are getting there but on paper we are only one tenth off his pace. I'm not sure many other drivers could get as close to him.

"I am heading straight to the factory tomorrow to go into the [simulator]. We need to investigate where we went wrong and put in some hard work over the summer break so that we don't start the next half of the season how we finished this one. It's frustrating but we will stay positive and bounce back stronger."

Tsunoda has scored 10 points this season – three with Racing Bulls and seven with Red Bull. His highest Grand Prix finish remains the ninth-place he managed in Bahrain, while he has two sixth-placed finishes in Sprints.

With the Marvel movie and TV juggernaut marching on, albeit with a bit less confidence than before, Eyes Of Wakanda represents a unique creative opportunity within a commercial behemoth. With dozens of films and series and decades of Marvel comic continuity to draw from, the limited series is a welcome cul-de-sac off the MCU superhighway—and one that should be traveled more often. 

Reaching into the past and possibilities of an established (and under-developed) entity in the African nation of Wakanda allows Marvel, through Eyes Of Wakanda's stylish animation, to shade in its world even as the MCU proper cruises ahead with more high-profile and impossible to ignore mega-projects. Eyes doesn't really advance the MCU timeline. In fact, it pauses then reverses it to fill out a small corner of a sprawling universe whose mammoth canvas could use more of this kind of texture. 

Startlingly introduced by a chyron placing the series in 13th-century Greece, the show's four installments each take place in a different time period spanning some 600 years. Interconnected mainly by the theme of Wakanda's zealous hoarding of vibranium and the missions of various agents of Wakandan dark-ops bureau the Hatut Zeraze (or War Dogs) to reclaim the essential space mineral in the vast and ignorant world outside of the nation, the series succeeds in making the Black Panther's domain more satisfyingly complex. 

Issues concerning the self-isolated techno-utopia's position as a camouflaged seat of unthinkable Black power smack in the midst of centuries of Western predation are touched on, if obliquely. Seeing an Indiana Jones-esque Wakandan agent zip unnoticed through the skies of 15th-century China in what's essentially a vibranium jet fighter necessarily colors the War Dogs' missions through a lens of both wonder and skepticism as to the nation's all-consuming isolationism within the bloody and exploitative sweep of world history. 

Ultimately, the lures of that fractious and warlike wider world are part of the show's quest to examine Wakanda's cultural choices. The premiere shows how the temptation to extend vibranium-fueled influence outside that country's borders means being inevitably tainted, as a loyal female agent battles a legendary former War Dog turned pirate king and slaver. The Hatut Zeraze enforce Wakanda's unbreakable code of isolation because, in the advanced and judgmental Wakandans' eyes, people (meaning everyone not Wakandan) are too irresponsible, violent, and untrustworthy to handle such power as they possess. That high-minded paternalism tugs at every thread of the show's brief runtime, with Eyes Of Wakanda leaving one of Marvel's most fascinatingly under-explored locations a fair degree richer. 

This exercise in retroactive world-building could indeed be leading up to a more nuanced and complex series of Wakandan stories, of course, even if there are at present no plans for a continuation. Eyes Of Wakanda is, in itself, an exercise in retroactive character complexity—the character in this case being the national one of Wakanda and its place in this superhero-packed world. 

In Ryan Coogler and showrunner Todd Harris' choice to spin out the story of the Wakanda the former helped establish in two major MCU blockbusters, this relatively humble (a reported $20 million in Marvel money) project stubbornly resists obvious expansion or commercial exploitation. There's an almost noble lack of renown and remuneration promised by this sort of project. Lovingly crafted but lacking go-to playset potential in its thoughtful depiction of the past and its conflicted heroes, there's something smacking of—dare it be suggested—art above commerce going on here. 

Coogler's MCU success, both commercial and critical, allowed him that freedom. But if earning Marvel/Disney a few billion dollars represents the bar, it's a shame. Letting creative types who are fans of a particular niche of the sprawling Marvel universe have a go at elaborating on underdeveloped elements of the Marvel movie brand would go a long way toward undoing some of that superhero malaise we've been hearing about.

As more and more heroes, villains, nations, and even entire worlds are ground up in the MCU content shredder, there's plenty of opportunity for creators to sift through the rubble. Sadly, editorial has likely rendered some elements irrecoverable—there are no doubt fans disappointed to see a C-list character they've always been drawn toward reduced to a one-dimensional nemesis or sidekick. Just take a look at Mantis: While James Gunn and Pom Klementieff's empathic naif and amusingly blank comic foil is an endearing minor Guardian of the Galaxy, those familiar with the comic character's richly overstuffed backstory as martial arts master turned Celestial Madonna no doubt lament the simplification.  

But Marvel fairly bristles with unspoken stories around the fringes of each successive (and fairly supervillainous-sounding) phase of its world-conquering entertainment onslaught. And while it's unlikely we ever would have seen a full Mantis movie, an MCU where superpowers burst out of every radioactive canister, spider bite, or random mutation (here come those mutants!) leaves plenty of C- and D-listers to build a minor-key character piece around. 

Promisingly, Phase Six's upcoming Wonder Man TV series looks to be nodding in that direction. Simon Williams (embodied in the show by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) is decidedly B-list at most, an ion-powered bruiser with action-hero aspirations and a ridiculously convoluted backstory (that's streamlined for the series). With its mix of showbiz satire and superhero action, this Wonder Man is no doubt prepping for his turn in the Avengers spotlight. But in the meantime, he is the sort of offbeat, under-the-radar character the MCU could use more of. (That government cleanup crew Damage Control somehow plays into Wonder Man's adventures is promising as well. A world economy needing to factor in routine January 6-level supervillain catastrophes would make for an intriguing watch, right?)

Sadly, the relatively disappointing box office for Thunderbolts* will likely teach the Marvel higher-ups the wrong lessons. A bracingly contemplative smash-em-up, the film was all C-list, as MCU cast-offs, also-rans, and fallen would-be icons banded together to overcome their own imposter syndrome insecurities and  Julia Louis-Dreyfus' deliciously scheming Valentina Allegra de Fontaine to inevitably save the world. Thunderbolts* ends with a media montage of worldwide skepticism about this scruffy group's ability to fill the vacant Avengers' boots, and the collective meagerness of its superpowers lends an air of unaccustomed risk and narrative possibilities to the ongoing mission. It's the MCU under the guardianship of far more vulnerable and complicatedly human antiheroes, a tingly narrative offramp undermined by a post-credits scene suggesting that their time at the top will be quickly toppled.

Hints about Sam Wilson's resurgent Captain America reforming the “real” Avengers is one thing. But the unexplained appearance in the mainstream Marvel universe (that's 616 to the uninitiated) of universe 828's sole superheroes implies that another promising wrinkle in the MCU formula is about to be ironed out. We don't know why the Fantastic Four of First Steps is rocketing into “our” skies, but as much as 616 needs its own FF at this point, it's understandable to have a twinge of disappointment at the prospect of First Steps' parallel MCU being so quickly subsumed. 

That aforementioned film took a bold, stylish (if not entirely thrilling) stride outside the established MCU, introducing Marvel's first family in a kicky, '60s-groovy, retrofuturistic New York where the Mad Men-look FF adventure in atomic age knitwear and employ nifty gadgetry more at home in the group's origin era. But blasting that dimension-hopping super team right into the heart of the present-day MCU after a single outing makes it look an awful lot like Kevin Feige and co. have cold feet about maintaining a major franchise off of the expected path. 

It's perhaps presumptuous to wish that Marvel/Disney would extend a thousandth of the annual MCU outlay to creatives interested in pursuing marginally profitable projects like Eyes Of Wakanda as they do to the next world-conquering super-epic. And admittedly, some of the more audacious conceptual swings away from the median Marvel product have been met with divisive fan responses. (She-Hulk found toxic misogyny a much tougher villain than Titania.) 

And yet Marvel fatigue isn't just a cliché. The MCU simply wore people out in a blur of thunderous CGI explosions and one too many glowing otherworldly portal climaxes. Spectacle sapped of substance can only sustain its momentum so long before audiences grow numb and—more to Marvel's concern—money falls off. Phase Six has more than enough big bang to lure the throngs back into the fold, what with two Avengers movies plus the creatively dubious return of Robert Downey Jr. as a different sort of iron man in Doctor Doom. 

Eyes Of Wakanda didn't break any streaming records. As much as it'd be refreshing to see action figures of series protagonists Noni and Memnon, it's unlikely sales would recoup the cost of the plastic. But winning over jaded MCU fans with thoughtful, well-told, unexpected stories helmed by people with eyes more on the creative than the commercial (or the MCU grand plan) is an effort worth making for an entertainment empire saddled with the growing reputation of having more cash than ideas.

John Legend was thrilled to reunite with Kelly Clarkson and Adam Levine in late July to film the Blind Auditions for Season 29 of “The Voice,” calling their reunion one big “love fest.” 

On August 2, 2025, Extra released an interview with Legend at the Social Impact Summit, where he was honored as Philanthropist of the Year. While there on July 24, Legend told Extra that “it's all love” among the trio of judges, despite having to compete against each other for the first-ever “Battle of Champions” season, scheduled to air in the spring of 2026.

Legend has so much love for Clarkson, in fact, that he told Extra that he and his wife, Chrissy Teigen, have made sure to check in on the “Since U Been Gone” singer during her highly-publicized challenges this year, which have included unexplained absences from her talk show and the cancellation of her first Las Vegas residency shows in early July. 

A post shared by ExtraTV (@extratv)

“We just shot the Blind Auditions … and it was a love fest,” Legend told Extra of reuniting with Clarkson and Levine in late July. “You know, obviously we're very competitive, and we still are, but we truly care so much about each other (and) respect each other as artists, but also just as human beings.”

“You know, we've been friends, all three of us, for quite a long time. We've worked together before, we've sung together, and you know, we've all grown up. When I started working with Adam and Kelly, we all had, like, really young kids. We were just starting our families.” 

Legend continued, “And now, you know, Kelly's oldest is, I think, in fifth grade (and) my oldest is in fourth grade, and Adam's got kids around the same age. So, you know, I feel like we're all growing up together, experiencing that parent life, and figuring out how to do it all.” 

Legend confirmed “there always is a group chat” going between the “Voice” coaches. The reporter from Extra then asked, “Did you check on Kelly recently with everything (going on)?”

Legend nodded and said, “We always make sure we check on each other. Chrissy is friends with Kelly as well and checks on her, too. So, you know, it's all family and it's all love, and truly genuine, mutual respect for each other.”

“We're so excited to be working together,” Legend concluded. 

Legend, Clarkson, and Levine will be back together on the set of “The Voice” on August 21 and 22 to film the Knockout round for Season 29, per ticketing agent 1iota. 

The announcement of Clarkson's return to “The Voice” shocked most fans, given that she left the show when she moved from Los Angeles to New York in 2023 with her kids. She and her ex-husband, Brandon Blackstock, share daughter River, 11, and son Remington, 9. After seven years of marriage, the couple split in 2020 and finalized their divorce in 2022.

Despite the change of scenery, rumors have swirled for months that Clarkson is not happy on her talk show, distressed that the schedule keeps her away from her kids too much. In early July, it was reported that “insanely complicated” personal matters contributed to her missing episodes and pushing back the launch of her Vegas residency by a week. 

Clarkson may have to miss additional episodes of her talk show in order to tape additional rounds of “The Voice” in Los Angeles and when Season 29's live shows begin.

EXCLUSIVE: Hot on the trail of a strong weekend opening of The Naked Gun, the '80s prime time procedural T.J. Hooker will be next procedural in line for promotion to an action comedy movie. Netflix has collared screen rights to the venerable cop drama, with Jarrad Paul & Andy Mogel tapped to write. The film will be produced by Sophie Cassidy and Matt Crespy for 2.0 Entertainment, Adrian Askarieh for Prime Universe Films, and Alex Westmore for Vali Vista Films.


	The original series premiered in March 1982 on ABC and ended its five-season, 91-episode run in 1986, with its final season airing on CBS. The show starred William Shatner as Sgt. T.J. Hooker of the LCPD, a hard-nosed veteran reeling from a divorce from his wife and the loss of his partner in the line of duty. Principled, moral, and driven to fight crime, the former plainclothes detective returns to uniform to train recruits and clean up the streets of criminals like the kind who killed his partner. Heather Locklear, Adrian Zmed and James Darren also starred. It is at this point unclear whether the 94-year old Shatner will be involved.

	The show seems organically suited for a more action comedy take, given Hooker's old style and often roughneck crime fighting style, which seemed out of place in a more woke world.  




			Watch on Deadline		







	The series was created by Rick Husky, who will also serve as an executive producer on the film. The original series was produced by Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg. Cassidy runs 2.0 with Zack Conroy


	Jarrad Paul & Andy Mogel are currently showrunning Bert, a Netflix show starring Bert Kreischer that they co-created, wrote. The duo will direct all the episodes. Their feature Little Brother is shooting for Netflix this summer, starring John Cena and Eric Andre, directed by Matt Spicer. Paul & Mogel also created and directed Huge in France, the Netflix series that premiered April 2019. The pair wrote Himelfarb, which Donald Deline is attached to produce. They created and executive produced The Grinder for Fox, and wrote and directed 2015's The D Train, starring Jack Black and James Marsden. They began together cowriting the 2008 romantic comedy Yes Man for Warner Bros, starring Jim Carrey and Zooey Deschanel, and co-created and executive produced Allen Gregory for Fox/20th with Jonah Hill. 

	











	Paul & Mogel is repped by UTA. Mosaic, and Johnson, Shapiro. Slewett & Kole.

It'll be as bad as the Chips and Fall Guy movies. Shatner and Zmed will turn up for a ten second cameo at the end. Wash, rinse, repeat.

Brad Pitt for Shatner's role and Jennifer Lawrence for Locklear's role. They'd kill it.

The difference is Police Squad was already a comedy, TJ Hooker was one of many lousy 80s show and its name means nothing.  Shatner was already funny in it in due to his campy style.  So lame to pounce on this.

Bring back Sledge Hammer as he knows what he's doing.

The original show will always be funny because it was shlock.  What's up next?  Willem Dafoe in Kingdom of the Spiders 2?

We deserve better than this.  What's left to reboot?  Hardcastle & McCormack?

EXCLUSIVE: With the Skydance merger expected to close on Thursday, the exec shuffle continues at Paramount Studios as sources tell Deadline that Motion Picture Group Chief Mike Ireland is exiting the studio. Insiders say Ireland will stay on in a consulting role to help with the transition and is considering an offer for a producing deal with the studio.


	This comes following a number new of roles being announced which include Dana Goldberg and Josh Greenstein being named Co-Chairs of Paramount Pictures with Goldberg being Chair of Paramount Television and Greenstein being Vice Chair of Platforms and Don Granger leading film at the studio.

			Watch on Deadline		







	Ireland joined the studio in November 2020, and the well-liked exec quickly was named co-president of production alongside Daria Cercek in January 2021. The two would be named co-heads of the Motion Picture Group in fall of 2021 and over the next four-plus years would oversee a strong slate of hits that include the massive relaunch of the Top Gun franchise, with Maverick grossing more than $1 billion at the box office and landing a Best Picture Oscar nomination. During that time the studio also released two more Mission: Impossible pics, expanded the Quiet Place universe with A Quiet Place: Day One and rebooted the Transformers franchise with Transformers: Rise of the Beasts.


	Prior to joining Paramount, Ireland worked at Leonardo DiCaprio's production company Appian Way in 2007, where he helped develop projects including The Wolf of Wall Street. He left Appian Way to join then-20th Century Fox in 2012, where he most recently was SVP Production and oversaw a slate of big-budget movies including the Ryan Reynolds action comedy Free Guy.

Smart. Talent-friendly. Creative. Approachable. Thoughtful. 

I wish there were 100 Mikey Irelands in this business. 

Cannot wait to see where he lands next.

Awesome guy and credit to our industry! Looking forward to his next act.

It's going to be very interesting to see how the new Skydance / Paramount reboots itself and gets folks back into the “funnel” again. 

Skydance faces major challenges after acquiring Paramount: managing over $14 billion in debt while making the unprofitable Paramount+ streaming service competitive against Netflix and Disney+; dealing with the declining linear TV business that's losing viewers and ad revenue; integrating two very different company cultures while cutting hundreds of jobs; and maintaining creative diversity and quality content production amid industry consolidation concerns. Success depends on balancing aggressive cost-cutting with continued investment in compelling content during the shift from traditional TV to streaming.

	Terry Reid, the artists' artist who was revered by the likes of Aretha Franklin and Mick Jagger, and nearly became the lead singer of Led Zeppelin, has died, The Guardian reports. He was 75.


	A rep for the British musician confirmed his death. An exact cause of death was not given, though Reid had been battling cancer and other health issues. A recent GoFundMe said Reid had been “in and out of the hospital, enduring rounds of treatment and uncertainty,” forcing him to cancel a six-week tour scheduled for the fall. 


	With a reedy voice that could push to mighty and soulful heights, Reid earned the nickname “Superlungs” (partly a nod, too, to his rendition of the Donovan song, “Superlungs My Supergirl”). Between 1968 and 1978, Reid released five albums. And though he never scored a genuine chart hit, he garnered high praise from critics and esteem from his peers.


	During the late Sixties, Reid opened for the Rolling Stones and Cream, and in 1968 Franklin famously stated: “There are only three things happening in England: the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, and Terry Reid.”

	Led Zeppelin's Robert Plant paid tribute on Instagram, writing that Reid's “enthusiasm and encouragement were incredible,” and adding: ”Still teenagers, we crashed each others' gigs and crucified ‘Season of the Witch' time and time again … So much fun. So on it. He was all of everything … such charisma.”


	Plant continued: “His voice, his range … his songs capturing that carefree era … Superlungs indeed. He catapulted me into an intense new world he chose to decline … I listen now to his album River and shed a tear for my brother in arms.”

	











	Reid's 1973 album, River, stands out as the gem in his catalog for its mix of progressive folk tinged with elements of R&B, funk, pop, and samba. While it became a longtime cult favorite that received a proper reissue in 2016, it struggled to gain any traction upon its original release.

	“I was just doing my thing, mixing blues and rock and other influences,” Reid told The Guardian last year. “I love music, whether it's Brazilian samba or Bulgarian choirs, I'm listening to it all. But Atlantic didn't really get behind me. Now people tell me how much they love River — I think it's found its audience.”


	Reid's originals were also frequently recorded by other artists, especially “Without Expression,” a song he wrote when he was 14. The track was covered (often under slightly different names) by the Hollies, Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young, REO Speedwagon, and John Mellencamp, who turned it into a minor hit in the late Nineties. 


	Nash, in a tribute of his own, wrote, “Finding it hard to put into words how sad I am about the passing of my dear friend Terry. How was it just a few short months ago we were smiling on my bus together? He was such a force. A talent beyond what I can express right now. It is still one of my proudest moments having produced his beautiful album Seed of Memory. That voice. That guitar playing. That wonderful person we will all miss so dearly.”


	Born and raised in Cambridgeshire, England, Reid started playing guitar and writing his own songs as a teenager. His first break came in 1965, when his band, the Redbeats, opened a show for Peter Jay and the Jaywalkers. Jay was so impressed, he asked Reid to join his band; soon he was gigging around London and touring alongside the Stones, Ike and Tina Turner, and the Yardbirds. By 1967, Reid was embarking on a solo career, spurred on by his friend, Jimi Hendrix, and under the auspices of producer/manager Mickie Most.

	Reid released his debut album, Bang, Bang You're Terry Reid, in 1968, when he was just 18. That same year, Yardbirds guitarist Jimmy Page asked him if he'd be interested in fronting his next band. Though Reid considered it, he declined, instead suggesting Page check out the singer and drummer from another group called Band of Joy: Robert Plant and John Bonham. 


	Reid tended to brush aside this sliding doors moment, noting that he was frequently asked to join other peoples' bands (he rebuffed Ritchie Blackmore's offer to front Deep Purple the following year). “I was intent on doing my own thing,” he said. “I contributed half the band — that's enough on my part,” he added of Zeppelin. 

	











	After Bang Bang and his 1969 self-titled album, Reid fell out with Most. It took him several years to settle a contractual dispute with his former manager and producer, before he was able to finally record River. He released two more albums, 1976's Seed of Memory, and 1978's Rogue Waves, before stepping back from his solo career. He moved to California and, in the Eighties, started working as a session musician for artists like Don Henley, Bonnie Raitt, and Jackson Browne. 


	In 1991, Reid partnered with Trevor Horn for a comeback album, The Driver, which contained a cover of the Spencer Davis Group's “Gimme Some Lovin'” that appeared on the soundtrack for the Tom Cruise racing movie, Days of Thunder. But that failed to garner much attention, and even Reid was dissatisfied with the record, later calling it “unlistenable.” 


	While Reid did not release any more studio albums, he did drop several live albums and toured regularly. As his back catalog garnered renewed attention, he was enlisted for vocal work by artists like DJ Shadow and Alabama 3. And new covers of his songs emerged, like a rendition of “Rich Kid Blues” by Jack White's band, the Raconteurs, and a version of “To Be Treated Rite” by Chris Cornell that appeared on his posthumous collection, No One Sings Like You Anymore, Vol. 1.

	Reid even revealed that Dr. Dre was such a fan of Seed of Memory, that the hip-hop legend invited him into the studio where they “reworked it alongside his rappers.” Reid called it a “fascinating experience,” though the sessions still have not been released. 


	“I've never looked at making music as chasing fame and fortune,” Reid said. “I'm part of a society of musicians and I love that I can go out there and sing — it's all I've ever wanted to do.”

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: Sony Pictures Animation is in early development on a Spider-Punk animated feature from co-writers Daniel Kaluuya (Judas and the Black Messiah) and Ajon Singh (Primetime), Deadline has learned.


	Plot details are under wraps, and there are no other deals in place at this time. The natural assumption, of course, is that Kaluuya will reprise the role of Spider-Punk, which he played in 2023's Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse and will reprise in the upcoming Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse.


	Created by writer Dan Slott and artist Olivier Coipel, Spider-Punk (aka Hobie Brown) is a version of Spider-Man who leans into a more anarchistic, anti-establishment attitude than Peter Parker's version. Residing on Earth-138, the character is fueled by his desire to help take down corrupt systems. He first appeared during a Spider-Verse crossover event, as part of 2015's The Amazing Spider-Man #10.

	











Across the Spider-Verse is the second film in a trilogy of lauded animated features from Sony Pictures Animation, which chronicle Spider-Man's adventures in the multiverse. The first film, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, was a hit both critically and commercially, grossing over $394 million worldwide and winning the Oscar for Best Animated Feature. Across the Spider-Verse was also Oscar-nominated and even more successful at the box office, grossing over $690 million worldwide. Beyond the Spider-Verse is dated for release on June 25, 2027.

	Before getting production underway on its next Tom Holland-led Spider-Man — Brand New Day, which is scheduled to hit theaters July 31, 2026 — and ahead of the release of Beyond the Spider-Verse, Sony has been busy further building out its live-action Spider-Man universe with Spider-Noir, a spinoff series for MGM+ starring Nicolas Cage, which is is slated to premiere next year.


	An Oscar winner currently in production opposite Chris Rock in his untitled new film for A24, Kaluuya has  been moving to expand his resume behind the camera, after making his directorial debut on Netflix's The Kitchen, which he helmed with Kibwe Tavares. Upcoming, he's set to to produce a live-action Barney movie under his 59% Productions banner, in partnership with Mattel and A24. He is repped by WME, B Side, and Johnson Shapiro Slewett & Kole.

	











	Singh most recently wrote and exec produced A24's forthcoming film Primetime, starring Robert Pattinson, which is believed to take inspiration from Chris Hansen and his program To Catch a Predator. Ren Faire‘s Lance Oppenheim directed, with Square Peg, Range and Icki Eneo Arlo producing. He is repped by WME, Untitled Entertainment, and Ziffren Brittenham.

EXCLUSIVE: Oscar winner Ben Kingsley (The Thursday Murder Club), BAFTA winner Andy Serkis (The Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum) and Grammy winner Joel David Smallbone (Unsung Hero) are new additions to the cast of Young Washington, a recently announced presidential origin story from Wonder Project and Angel Studios.


	Directed by Wonder Project's Jon Erwin (Jesus Revolution, I Can Only Imagine), the film stars the previously announced William Franklyn-Miller as a young George Washington, chronicling the beginnings of America's first president. After making a tremendous mistake that triggers the French and Indian War, an ambitious 22-year-old Washington must face his failures and find the courage to become the leader that will forge a nation. 

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Kingsley will play Robert Dinwiddie, the strong-willed Governor of Virginia who entrusts the young Washington with his first command. Serkis plays General Edward Braddock, an overconfident British officer who gives the defeated Washington another chance at military glory. Smallbone portrays the cunning William Fairfax, a friend and romantic rival to George, who moves effortlessly in the world of the British upper class to which Washington aspires.


	Written by Jon Erwin and Tom Provost & Diederik Hoogstraten, the film is slated to enter production later this summer. Erwin will produce alongside Chip Diggins. Wonder is joined on the production side by 10 Ton Productions, led by Benton Crane, and 2521 Entertainment, led by Tyler Zacharia, with Angel set to distribute the film nationwide over Independence Day weekend 2026. 


	In an unorthodox move, Angel Studios made tickets available last month on its own platform — a year out from release — without a single frame of the film yet shot.


	Known for turns in films like Gandhi and Schindler's List, Kingsley has recently been seen starring in titles like The Killer's Game and Wes Anderson's The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Three More. Upcoming, he has the Magenta Light Studios thriller Deep Water, Netflix's anticipated film The Thursday Murder Club, and more. He is repped by CAA, Independent Talent Group, and Goodman, Genow, Schenkman.

	











	Previously seen starring in the Lord of the Rings and Planet of the Apes franchises, Serkis is set to direct and reprise as Gollum in The Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum, which Warner Bros releases on December 17, 2027. He is repped by CAA, Principal Entertainment LA, and Johnson Shapiro Slewett & Kole.


	In addition to his Christian music group For King + Country, Smallbone is known for co-directing and starring in Lionsgate and Kingdom Story Company's faith-based drama Unsung Hero. He is repped by Smallbone Management.

					By Pete Hammond 

Awards Columnist/Chief Film Critic


	Mary Rodgers (daughter of famed Broadway composer Richard Rodgers) hit paydirt with the 1972 publication of her book Freaky Friday, certainly a harbinger of things to come in Hollywood's obsession with body-switch movies. Although they have been around in one form or another for decades (IMDb lists 168 of them over the years), that book generated a real trend that began with Disney‘s first adaptation of it in 1976, with the pairing of Jodie Foster and Barbara Harris falling into a magical spell and becoming each other in a mother-daughter swap. The format really took hold in 1988 with movies like 18 Again, Like Father Like Son, Vice Versa and the biggest of 'em all: Tom Hanks in Big. Jennifer Garner's done the idea twice with 2004's 13 Going on 30 and  2023's Family Switch. No one did it better than Steve Martin and Lily Tomlin in 1984's classic All of Me, etc., etc.

	











	But the Freaky Friday franchise is a real go-to thing for Disney beginning with that '76 edition, followed by a 1995 TV movie with Shelley Long and Gaby Hoffmann, and even a musical version in 2018 for the Disney Channel – all called Freaky Friday. But it was perhaps 2003's Freaky Friday reboot with Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan switching places that made the biggest impact and called for a sequel rather than a remake. To do that, the stars have to get older, and that they have done, so  22 years later we now finally have Freakier Friday, which amps up the action into a four-way switch with Curtis now a grandmother switching places with a 15 year old, and Lohan doing the same with her 15-year-old daughter. It is truly a generational epic, but what worked once, twice, three times (and maybe four) still delivers on the premise, providing laughs, plenty of slapstick opps and genuine emotion thanks to a game cast still showing us what it is like to inhabit other bodies and live to tell about it.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Story-wise, it's been more than two decades since daughter Anna ( Lohan) and mother Tess (Curtis) did that memorable one-day switch. Tess Coleman is now an author and psychologist who has written a new book. She's still juggling things including as wife to Ryan (Mark Harmon, returning in an underwritten role) a mother to Anna and grandmother to 15-year-old surfer girl Harper (Julia Butters), who is going through the usual teenage angst of most girls her age including conflicts with mom who is now manager to a popstar, Ella (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan), who is a handful to say the least (but really adds the musical touch to the film). On top of those headaches, Anna is still trying to deal with Harper and her problems. Along the way she meets Eric Reyes (Manny Jacinto), a single parent and chef who owns a restaurant. They hook up, but he has a daughter, also 15, named Lily (Sophia Hammons), from England, who is hoping to get back to London where she can become a fashion designer one day. She is opposed to dad's romance with Anna, but it's too late. Anna and Eric are getting married with the intention of merging their families.


	Well, this all leads to more mystery and magic when Tess and Anna have a reading from Madame Jen (SNL's Vanessa Bayer – very funny) and that leads to Tess switching up with Lily, and Anna switching with Harper. Anyone familiar with the premise can bet everything becomes very frightening and very very complicated, not just with mother and daughter switching, but now also grandmother and daughter's friend making the swap. 


	Curtis was nominated for a Golden Globe the first time around, and she just might be again as this seasoned comic pro knows just how to milk every laugh line and show genuine horror as a 15 year old discovering many new wrinkles. She's a hoot, and Lohan matches her beat for beat. Of course, Lohan wasn't a newcomer to the premise when she switched places with herself in Disney's 1998 Parent Trap remake that made her a star just four years earlier, but now she adds a welcome layer of maturity to the process in showing we sometimes become our parents in more ways than one. With all of the comic hijinks you expect, there is some genuine human emotion here and real gravitas in examining our lives from the inside out. Give credit to director Nisha Ganatra and screenwriter Jordan Weiss for taking this Freaky-out to another level with the four way switch and attempting to keep it from complete confusion as to who's who at any given time. You have to pay close attention.


	Among the rest of the cast are several returnees from the 2003 film including Harmon; Rosalind Chao back as Mama P; Stephen Tobolowsky as Mr. Bates; and Chad Michael Murray, flowing hair and all, returning as Anna's early crush, Jake. He now runs a record store (remember those?). Of the newcomers, Jacinto makes a real impression here as does Hammons, who as Lily is also dealing with the loss of her own mother, and the terrific Butters, who was so good in Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and now gets to grow up.


	I do have to confess that with all of this body switching and the various subplots Weiss has introduced, it isn't always easy to keep track of it all, but in the end it pays off, a feel-good comedy ripe for the times as evidenced by the loud laughter at the screening I attended of this nostalgic Disney film that is about as Disney as it gets.


	Producers are Kristin Burr, Andrew Gunn and Curtis.

You'd be forgiven if your moviegoing interest in the legacyquel — a clever term for a next-gen sequel to a popular, typically very nostalgic film that former IndieWire editor Matt Singer coined over a decade ago — has waned. Again, Singer spotlighted the phenomenon over a decade ago, and franchise-mad Hollywood shows no signs of breaking with the pattern. “Tron: Ares” is fast approaching, and, just last week, Netflix launched “Happy Gilmore 2.” In the past year alone, we've had “Karate Kid: Legends,” “Gladiator II,” and “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.” Mileage on these titles very much varies, as does critical response and audience enjoyment.

Leave it to Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan to crack the code as to what makes a good legacyquel, which they've done quite handily with their long-gestating “Freaky Friday” sequel, Nisha Ganatra's charming and quite fun “Freakier Friday.” The secret? Fittingly enough, it harkens back to exactly what Curtis and Lohan brought to Mark Waters' 2003 “Freaky Friday”: actual verve, obvious joy, and performances that are about three times better than they need to be. 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






If you're of the mind that Curtis should have won her first Oscar for her work in Waters' film, thanks to a spectacular and incredibly funny turn as overworked mom Tess Coleman, who switches bodies with her wise-ass teenage daughter (Lohan), leading to all kinds of high jinks, “Freakier Friday” is very much for you. Twenty-two years ago, Curtis turned in some of her best work as a sassy rocker teenager trapped in the body of her strait-laced mom, and revisiting that concept is more than enough reason to launch a sequel. The twist? Lohan ably matches Curtis' vim and vigor, and a pair of young stars give them a serious run for their money as their body-switching compatriots. 

Simply put: Here is a legacyquel worth the wait. What a concept!

Written by Jordan Weiss (who shares story-by credit with Elyse Hollander), the sequel makes an early claim to something sort of tricky: Yes, it's going to love its various characters and their very different generational markers, but it's sure as heck gonna poke some fun at them, too. 

More than two decades on from the first film, we find Tess (Curtis) still working as a therapist, now armed with a podcast she's attempting to launch, despite her Boomer tendencies to not actually record the damn thing. Anna (Lohan) is a single mom with a hip career as a music manager, but she's also prone to attempting woo-woo deep-breathing techniques to ease her stress. And Anna's teenage daughter Harper (Julia Butters)? She's got a “no triggering” sign on her bedroom and attends a high school where “gluten-free” is the default offering for any and all foodstuffs.

 










Still, the Coleman ladies really love each other, and as Tess tells us in voiceover, when Anna decided to become a single mom all those years ago, she vowed they'd raise Harper together. Intergenerational parenting! Thank God that Tess and Anna are armed with some deep, hard-fought empathy for each other (thanks, everything that happened in “Freaky Friday”), but that doesn't inure them from tough stuff to come. Surely, it's nothing a little double body-switching can't cure?

The fourth member of this ill-fated quad soon comes into focus: British transfer student Lily (Sophia Hammons), who cannot stand laidback surf bum Harper (the feeling is mutual). When the girls' deep dislike for each other explodes into chem lab violence, their single (very, very much single) parents are forced into a parent-teacher meeting for the ages. The sparks are instant for Anna and Lily's dad Eric (Manny Jacinto), and a zippy montage races us through their speedy romance, straight into an autumn wedding that, like many things in Ganatra's film, sweetly echoes the original.

But the days leading up to the nuptials aren't all flowers and puppies, and when all four ladies are forced to mix and mingle at Anna's bachelorette party… well, you can probably see the swapping to come, or at least the need for the swapping to come. This time around, it comes courtesy of an absolutely hilarious Vanessa Bayer as a multi-hyphenate psychic who can't seem to nail any of her many jobs (Reiki to Starbucks, business card-making to something involving dogs?), but has somehow harnessed the power to swap the bodies and souls of four women. (The film is entertaining enough to paper over some small plot holes, but audiences should be prepared to walk out of the theater happy and a bit confused over the finer points of what the heck just happened.)

 










Soon enough, Anna and Harper have switched (Butters nails the uptight-adult-in-kid-body ask, while Lohan gets to dabble in the teenage fun she wasn't able to in the first film), along with Lily and Tess (if this was all a bid to get Curtis back to playing nutso teens in her adult body, the full force of her performance makes that reasoning hard to argue with). While Anna and Tess naturally team up to try to reverse things — and how fun for everyone else to see “Harper and Lily” hanging out — Harper and Lily come up with a different idea: They'll use this as an opportunity to break up their parents finally.

Consider it a reverse “Parent Trap,” and Curtis and Lohan go wild with the possibilities, the two actresses clearly delighting in getting to go on this new adventure together (if the first film was missing anything, it was the fizzy fun of seeing the pair sharing the screen). And while much of what they take on is, well, kind of silly — consider a long-form montage sequence in which the duo try on wacky outfits with Anna's rising star client Ella (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan) — the obvious joy with which that stuff is approached is contagious. 

It seems like the easiest ask — let's make this “Freaky Friday” sequel as entertaining and funny as the first one! — but just look at a decade-plus worth of dour, dim, and dismal fellow legacyquels, and it's clear how rare “Freakier Friday” really is. While many of the beats might feel familiar, there's something cozy about those story points (that the film is centered on a wedding, just like the original, mostly feels right), and even some early tonal issues are forgotten as the film ratchets up its enthusiasm and good humor.

 










Curtis and Lohan's commitment naturally extends to some bouts of dizzying physical comedy, some of the best examples taking place at (gasp!) at a record store belonging to no less than Jake (returning co-star Chad Michael Murray), who romanced both Coleman ladies in the first film. As Lohan attempts to flirt in such a way that it makes her look like she's having a medical emergency, and Curtis finds herself crawling and joint-cracking around nearly every inch of the joint's floor, another sort of spell takes hold — this time, on the audience. The best you can do? Embrace it. Something like this might only come around once every 22 years.

Walt Disney Pictures will release “Freakier Friday” in theaters on Friday, August 8.

George Clooney got everything he could have wanted in the teaser trailer for Noah Baumbach‘s Jay Kelly. The actor fittingly plays an actor in the titular role — but one who doesn't know what comes after fame and fortune. “Are you running to something, or from something?” his manager Ron (Adam Sandler) asks, to which Jay Kelly responds, “Yes.”


	Throughout the preview, Jay Kelly feels disconnected, wondering, “How can I play people when I don't see people?” He barely sees himself, he admits. “I think I'm always alone,” he tells someone who insists he's never alone. Being “just an actor that got famous” is a less complicated way of interrogating his reality than actually coming to terms with it. “You know how difficult it is to be yourself?” he asks. 


Jay Kelly follows the fictional movie star and his manager as they traverse through Europe. “Along the way, both men are forced to confront the choices they've made, the relationships with their loved ones, and the legacies they'll leave behind,” a synopsis of the film reads. 

	











	The film arrives in select theaters on Nov. 14 and begins streaming on Netflix on Dec. 5. Written by Noah Baumbach and Emily Mortimer, Jay Kelly is the first directorial release from Baumbach since 2022's White Noise and his first as a writer since the 2023 blockbuster Barbie.

Jay Kelly also stars Laura Dern, Billy Crudup, Riley Keough, Grace Edwards, Stacy Keach, Jim Broadbent, Patrick Wilson, Eve Hewson, Greta Gerwig, Alba Rohrwacher, Josh Hamilton, Lenny Henry, Emily Mortimer, Nicôle Lecky, Thaddea Graham, Isla Fisher, Louis Partridge, and Charlie Rowe.

	“Movie stars are our avatars. They are people that we invest in and project onto and live through,” Baumbach told Vanity Fair. “And a movie star needed to play the movie star. That was in the DNA of what this thing should be: What if a movie star was essentially playing one, and reflecting back our own vulnerabilities and our own questions about life? What would that mean? I don't know that I knew exactly, but it seemed interesting.”


	“It's all the things that Noah has loved his whole life and have meant so much to him,” Mortimer added. “He can embody that character in a way, I do think. And once he started to do that, then I could join in.”

	Racists have for centuries attempted to justify their belief that they are made of superior stock by making absurdist, unfounded claims about the supposed innate differences between races. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump appeared on CNBC's Squawk Box to discuss the economic impacts of his first months in office, as well as inform the public of his belief that undocumented migrants are more “naturally” inclined toward hard labor. 


	Speaking about how his administration's crackdown on undocumented immigration is affecting the American agricultural sector, Trump said that “in some cases, we're sending [migrants] back to their country with a pass back in legally.” 


	“We can't let our farmers not have anybody,” Trump added of undocumented farm laborers, primarily of Hispanic origin, who are being targeted for deportation by his Department of Homeland Security. “These [are] people that you can't replace them very easily — you know, people that live in the inner city are not doing that work. They're just not doing that work. And they've tried — we've tried, everybody tried. They don't do it. These people do it naturally, naturally.” 

	











	It should go without saying that no group of people feels an intrinsic urge to cultivate the land for sub-livable wages and at constant risk of detainment and deportation, but the president doubled down.

	“I said, ‘What happens if they get it — to a farmer the other day — what happens if they get a bad back?' He said, ‘They don't get a bad back, sir, because if they get a bad back, they die.' … You know, in many ways they're very, very special people,” Trump added. 

	











	As “special” as they may be to the president, his administration has treated undocumented workers —- especially farm workers — with a singular cruelty that has become increasingly dangerous. Migrants have been sent to foreign gulags where they were denied due process rights and allegedly tortured. Raids have targeted workplaces and farms, in enforcement actions that one migrant told The Guardian makes them feel like they're being  “hunted like animals.”

	And as much as the president claims farmers and land owners who employ undocumented migrants are going to be “taken care off,” his administration is actively engaged in efforts to significantly increase the size of ICE's agent pool. A widespread recruitment effort boasts that new agents could be entitled to a $50,000 signing bonus, $60,000 in student loan forgiveness and other peaks.

	As the administration made a public show of cruelty towards the nation's migrant population, farmers and other industry workers began to complain that the roundups and deportations were impacting their ability to conduct business. In June, the backlash became so intense that the president was forced to make a soft pivot in order to appease one of his core constituencies. “We can't take farmers and take all their people and send them back because they don't have maybe what they're supposed to have, maybe not,” he said at the time, ordering a  brief pause in enforcement.   


	The concession didn't last long, within weeks CBS News reported that after appeals from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, roundups of undocumented farm workers resumed with a vengeance. Trump said on Tuesday that he wants to “work with” farmers to find a solution, but given his administration's thirst for deportations, it's unlikely migrant laborers will ever be able to work in peace as long as he is in power.

The 'Last Week Tonight' host also sounds off on Stephen Colbert's "horrible, horrible" news and the future of the format.


							By 

	Lacey Rose


Writer-At-Large


John Oliver may delight in biting the corporate hand that feeds him — “there's no tastier hand,” he insists — but he is deeply grateful for his perch. With his pal Stephen Colbert's Late Show recently canceled amid financial losses to the tune of tens of millions a year and a pending multibillion-dollar merger at its parent company, Oliver's Last Week Tonight finds itself ensconced in its premium cable/streaming corner at HBO, where it tackles complicated, often uncomfortable subjects such as immigration, policing and juvenile justice.

	











	Still, Oliver is adamant that it's the show's bevy of awards — 30 Emmys and counting — that has kept it on the air and without interference for 12 seasons. Come September, it will vie for six more, including outstanding scripted variety series. Zooming from Last Week Tonight's Manhattan offices in late July, Oliver weighed in on his battles with legal, his concerns for late night and his desired level of anxiety.

Last Week Tonight segments come together in six weeks. When in that timeline does the comedy get layered in?


	Really late. The jokes used to come in earlier, but you don't want to start writing before a story is stable because then you'll fall in love with jokes that are built on material that doesn't stand up, and that's a terrible position to put comedy writers in. So, it's only in the last two weeks that the jokes come in. But in that first month, you're trying to give people ingredients that they'll be able to create comedy from. You want it to be like an episode of Chopped, where it's not impossible to make something palatable at the end. So, you're not giving them broken glass and weed killer. You'll give them eggs.

	











When was last time a Last Week segment made you genuinely anxious?


	I mean, there's always a low-level anxiety with every story. I'd argue a healthy level of anxiety. And it's only ever about whether people are going to be willing to listen to us talk about something, because it's so superficially dry or contentious that you're not sure if it's something people will want to hear, and then you're practicing force-feeding. But that's part of the joy of having this show — the ability to show people things they might not necessarily think, on their face, they want to see. I mean, just a few weeks ago, we did a long piece on juvenile justice, and that's the kind of story where you think, “I'm not sure people want to hear this,” but I am sure that it's the absolute point of having a show like this.


From the Emmy stage, you thanked HBO and “our lawyers, who are angry with us all the time.” What is that push and pull like?


	They are our final line of defense, so it has to be a functional relationship, but it can be fraught, especially toward the end. The general tension that we land on is having a slightly different view of their job. They think it's to stop us from getting sued, and I think it's to make sure that when we are sued, we win. So, yeah, I'm half-joking when I say it's a fraught relationship. It's an important process for the script to go through, but it can be not infrequently tense.


I can imagine.


	But you also don't get to be angry at the lifesaving device. (Laughs.)

	











You've had a revolving door of corporate owners. Is interference something you've either experienced or worry about?


	We've not experienced interference, and I refuse to worry about something that hasn't happened yet. My tolerance level, were it to, would be zero. This would be over real quick.


Put another way, is there a “there but for the grace of God go I” aspect to what appears to have happened with Colbert and his show?


	We are fortunate enough to be in a very different situation than network commercial TV, so those corporate pressures are not comparable, and we have no pressures from advertisers.


Presumably you saw the shots of Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav palling around with Ivanka Trump in Sun Valley. What goes through your mind when you see something like that?


	I try to pay as little attention to what is happening outside of our show as possible because it feels like wasted energy. The moment that intrudes on our show, I will react very badly to it, but it hasn't. So, yeah, I try not to get angry about things that aren't happening to us.


At the same time, you seem to bite the hand that feeds you with regularity and some degree of glee …


	There's no tastier hand!


I was watching the segment that you did a few months ago about Trump and the media, and at one point, you just started railing against your corporate parent and the idiocy of the HBO Max name changes. Again, seemingly with glee. Did you hear from anyone afterward?












	No. And you're right, I'm truly happy in those moments. That's probably the most at peace I am, when I'm trying to draw fire from our owners.


Should we unpack that? What does that say about you?


	I don't know, and I refuse to turn this into a therapy session. (Laughs.) But I always used to love watching David Letterman do it. To me, it felt like a really healthy sign of contempt and just a very fun and slightly important indication of noncompliance. So, I loved it when he'd make fun of G.E. and CBS and, yeah, for me, making fun of whoever owns us on a minute-to-minute basis is a thrill.


You grew up on Letterman. Do you worry about the future of late night TV?


	On network TV? Yeah, it's constantly evolving. What's happened to The Late Show is incredibly sad for comedy and, obviously, for the staff in that building. It really resonated with me when Stephen said he was hoping to hand this show over to someone else. You hope that the franchise lives on partly because there are generations of teenagers watching those shows and deciding, “Maybe I'd like to be a comedy writer,” and then maybe writing on that show. So, just as there are Colbert writers that watched Letterman, there will be future writers that watched Colbert, and you want that to continue. I'm sure it'll find a way to exist in some form, we just don't yet know exactly what that's going to look like for network television.


You've had success having a point of view on your show, as Colbert has, at least in the ratings. Late night used to be broad, unifying entertainment. I know Jay Leno recently spoke on this topic, about making a show for everyone …












	I'm going to take a hard pass on taking comedic advice from Jay Leno.


Fair enough, but should these shows still try to be for everyone, or is that as antiquated as the tanning bed?


	Who thinks that way? Executives? Comedy can't be for everyone. It's inherently subjective. So, yeah, when you do stand-up, some people try to play to a broader audience, which is completely legitimate. Others decide not to, which is equally legitimate. I guess I don't think it's a question of what you should do because I don't think comedy is prescriptive in that way. It's just what people want. I think our show clearly comes from a point of view, but most of those long stories we do are not party political. They're about systemic issues. Our last few shows were about gang databases, AI slop, juvenile justice, med spas, air traffic control. I'm not saying that these don't have a point of view in them. Of course they do. But I hope a lot of them actually reach across people's political persuasions. You want people to at least be able to agree on the problem, even if you disagree on what the solution to it is.


As someone who's found a version of a late night show that succeeds on streaming, do you think it's replicable and, if so, what should it look like?


	I have absolutely no idea. [Late New York Times media columnist] David Carr said something so nice at the end of our first year. He'd liked our show, and he said to me, “If you had described this show to me before I saw it, I would've said it sounded terrible.” It was so honest; I've never forgotten it. Because I don't think, on the page, our show sounds very good. I mean, we're doing, like, 40 minutes on juvenile justice.

	











It doesn't exactly scream commercial.


	No, it doesn't. So I don't know that you can emulate this success. I think it might've been a mistake or a lightning strike. I just don't know that this is scalable. But I'd really like late night to exist in some form somewhere. My favorite thing is when you can have things that both have a strong point of view and are incredibly stupid. Seth [Meyers], last week, did some great shows, and he also did an amazing segment about how to pronounce “croissant.” Did you see that? It was so good. It was the hardest I laughed all week. So, I love the fact that those things can coexist, and I don't want that to go away.


The camaraderie that the late night hosts have now is so vastly different from the environment you grew up with.


	Well, the stakes are just lower now. There's no point being in a war. You're not fighting over any meaningful territory. (Laughs.)


Many of you came on Colbert's show on July 21, appearing in a Coldplay kiss-cam spoof, shortly after the news of his cancellation. What did that outreach look like?


	Well, we've been in contact as a group since the strike [several of them hosted a podcast, Strike Force Five], so as soon as the news broke, we were all checking in with Stephen in that chat and then he came up with the idea and asked us to come, and of course we're all going to do it. You want to be able to support him and his staff in a horrible, horrible time.


I did appreciate just how much everyone sort of played into their brand while sitting there, down to Anderson Cooper looking fairly uncomfortable.












	Anderson was almost emitting a sense of, “Why am I here?” A legitimate question!


Back to your show. Amid all the bleakness, you and your writers decided to give yourselves this ambitious side project, rebranding a minor league baseball team the Erie Moon Mammoths. How much pressure did you feel to make sure that was something that could produce actual civic pride, rather than simply five funny minutes on HBO?


	The reason we first started talking about it is that we were doing a show about deportations — so, monumentally bleak — and it felt like an example of when you've had a kale-based meal, it's nice to serve something resembling a dessert at the end of it. One of our writers, Charlie, he pitched this story about minor league baseball and just how eccentric and, in many ways, life affirming it is, and we had the idea at the end of that to issue this offer [to have Last Week Tonight have carte blanche to rebrand a team]. We thought someone might take our offer, but we weren't sure. So, if it was just that and no one offered, that was fine. Once it became clear that people were really interested, then it felt like it might be something that could spin us out of a bunch of very dense, dark stories. Then you want to execute it as well as you possibly can. You don't want it to be a drive-by joke at the place you're picking. You want to pick a place that can handle it but also needs it.


It became a feel-good story at a time when we so desperately need a feel-good story.












	I know. It is odd the extent to which it repaired some of my faith in human nature, and that is a very weird thing to find yourself saying when you're standing next to a seven-foot purple mammoth.


Speaking of happy endings, earlier this year, HBO let you return to releasing full segments of your show on YouTube the day after airing. What changed?


	I think they wanted to see if moving it back on YouTube had an effect on our ratings. I didn't think it would, which is why I was against moving it in the first place. And I was massively grateful that, upon looking at it, they realized it wasn't having a negative enough effect to be worth doing. Again, in the difficulty of the media environment that we're in, I try to be as cognizant as I can be that HBO is still a fantastic place to work.


And yet you make a lot of jokes about how all these Emmys are your show's only armor against getting canceled.


	I mean, two things can be true at the same time. (Laughs.) It's a fantastic place to work while we are insulated by golden armor. If that stops, we might be going away.


Do you genuinely believe that?


	It's not entirely a joke, that's for sure. I think it is objectively very, very helpful to have won Emmys with the show. I think it has helped us keep our independence and keep the show on the air. So, yeah, I do think there is a utility to it. It's something that I know has always been important to HBO, and so I'm massively grateful that we've won them, and long may that continue. Please! I don't want my theory tested.

	Of all of gaming's many genres, few have remained as spiritually pure as the 2D beat ‘em up. From the early arcade favorites like Final Fight to more recent home console hits like River City Girls, the simple premise of walking in a straight line and dropkicking waves of baddies is timeless — even elegant — and hasn't really warranted any kind of groundbreaking mechanical overhaul throughout the years.


	Titles like Streets of Rage 4 (2020) and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge (2022) may have given their classic franchises a facelift, but their success mostly stems from sticking to what's always worked: punch, kick, progress, with a couple of quality-of-life tweaks tucked in. That's exactly what publisher Dotemu's latest retro-inspired beat ‘em up, Marvel Cosmic Invasion, offers in spades, albeit with a little extra juice from its comic book origins.


Rolling Stone recently previewed an early build of Marvel Cosmic Invasion (out later this year) and walked away impressed by both the simple pleasures it provides and the ways in which it incorporates characters and lore not currently seen in Disney's MCU. Even in a year packed with old school-inspired revivals, Cosmic Invasion makes a (mostly) marvelous first impression.

	











	Published by Dotemu, a French-based studio that's made its name as the industry's premier outlet for reviving old arcade-based IP from the Eighties and Nineties, Cosmic Invasion follows the framework laid by the company's previous titles, Streets of Rage 4 and Shredder's Revenge. With a pixelated 2D aesthetic reminiscent of the 16-bit SNES era, it both looks and feels like a game made ages ago. While Dotemu's other big 2025 releases, Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound and Absolum (the studio's sole original IP) reimagine the spirit of older games with some modern embellishments, Cosmic Invasion takes a more purist approach to its design — with one caveat.

	











	Players can pick from one of 15 Marvel superheroes to fight their way through linear, sequential levels, with up to four people able to join at any time. The twist is that everyone is asked to select two characters, which can be swapped out in real time, meaning that up to eight fighters can appear on screen at any given time.

	The character swap system adds what's essentially the only new idea created for the game, and even then, it's not entirely original; fighting game fans have been playing Marvel titles this way since 1996's X-Men vs. Street Fighter introduced the tag-team mechanics. But it's extremely rare to see this kind of selection in a standard action side-scroller and adds a fresh layer to what's otherwise intentionally dated gameplay.


	After selecting two characters, which range from obvious favorites like Spider-Man and Captain America to deeper cut like the spacefaring Nova and Thor stand-in Beta Ray Bill, players are dropped into straightforward levels where they're tasked with walking ahead, beating up groups of enemies, and repeating that loop for the entirely of the game. Each character has a base suite of moves including light and heavy attacks, dodges or blocks (depending on the hero), and special moves that expend a stamina meter. There's also multiple tag-team moves that call in the secondary hero to fight with the main on-screen for a single strike that can be spammed ad nauseum.


	As with most games of this ilk, movement is limited to walking in four directions across the flat plane, with the levels we previewed mainly sticking to walking to the right to progress. Movement can be sluggish depending on the character, but that's by design. It's more about hunkering down for button mashing until everyone you see is dead. The biggest changeup in the formula is that many enemies (and heroes) can fly, meaning that at any given time there's actually two planes to focus on between the ground level and the air.

	In true arcade fashion, each level ends with a boss battle whose unique patterns must be memorized to deliver critical blows. In the preview build, there were two levels: the streets of New York culminating in a fight with the villain Beetle, and the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier that ends with a showdown with Taskmaster. Although neither are overly complicated, the Taskmaster battle has a fun schtick where players have to knock out the boss' Captain America-like shield, leaving him vulnerable to attacks for a limited time.

	











	For anyone not instantly smitten at the idea of a Nineties era beat ‘em up with little to no modern advancements, the core appeal of Cosmic Invasion will come down to the use of the Marvel IP. The game's predictably paper-thin story sees the villain Annihilus waging an attack on a galactic scale, bringing with him high level threats like Thanos and Galactus himself to the fray. Many of these characters resurged in popularity in the 2000s when Marvel made space stories a big deal again — leading to the reintroduction of the Guardians of the Galaxy that would later inspire the hit films.


	In the demo, nine characters are playable, and there's some immediate standouts. Captain America, Storm, Spider-Man, and Wolverine will all feel familiar to anyone who's played a Marvel vs. Capcom game. During this year's Summer Game Fest, the developers at Tribute Games told Rolling Stone that this was intentional for these particular characters, with whom many fans already have a preconception for how they should feel in action.


	All four play incredibly well and lean toward speedier movement, and versions of moves pulled from the Capcom fighting games. Cap's shield throw is great for crowd control; Wolverine and Spidey are adept at rushing in close for multi-hit combos; Storm can electrify (and fry) just about anything on screen. Venom, too, has shades of his former in-game incarnations but is more of a beefy brawler than an area control type like he is in the fighting series.


	But outside of these known entities, many of the new characters shine. Phyla-Vell (who bears the names Quasar, Captain Marvel, and more in the comics) is top notch — and probably the best all-around character previewed. With a massive sword, and the ability to fly and teleport, she can dominate all planes and practically serves as a one-woman army. Nova, too, is a space-based character that packs a punch and agility to boot. She-Hulk is easily the slowest character, but her devastating blows and wide reach make up for her shortcomings.


	The only complete stinker of the bunch is sadly Rocket Raccoon, who mostly uses range-based gunplay to attack, which feels different from the rest of the cast in all the wrong ways. With a weak aerial skillset, playing Rocket was essentially the only major challenge presented in the demo, and it wasn't a fun hurdle to surmount. Although there's a pretty stellar hit-to-miss ratio with the existing roster, Rocket shows the downside to having so many playable characters: even though it adds diversity to the game, it proves that there will be imbalance. Some heroes are just going to suck, although by existing popularity they'll likely still have their defenders.

	











	Rocket also embodies some of the larger issues with the game's design, especially in terms of how the two-plane ground versus air combat works. For flying characters like Phyla-Vell, Nova, and Storm, taking to the air simply requires a double jump, but it locks players into the airborne layer to essentially walk as they would normally. This means that enemies below can hit you, but it's also basically no different than playing on the street level. Swapping between the two can be cumbersome and doesn't always foster fluid combo building. Worse is when a character has paltry jump attacks, which can break the flow of the action when a single aerial enemy buzzes around the map while you chase it playing whack-a-mole.


Cosmic Invasion is at its best when everything devolves into controlled chaos. With the right characters, chaining together bombastic attacks and flashy moves can easily rack up 500-hit combos, which makes the down time and occasionally sluggish pace more of a chore during the in between moments. Levels are extremely linear, with no branching paths, collectibles, or even secrets to find (that we've seen so far). Stages are also somewhat geographically tight, often funneling players into narrow corridors to fight, but even more open spaces don't feel as expansive as they do in games like Streets of Rage 4 or Shredder's Revenge.


	The result is a more barebones experience. Without anything to discover, it's a meat and potatoes action jaunt that's more about mindlessly smacking baddies in the face, whose ceiling for skill and overall fun is mostly dependent on which hero you're using. Thankfully, the vast majority of them are extremely enjoyable to play. With four still to be revealed, and a likely guarantee that more will come down the line, Cosmic Invasion's greatest strength is in the Marvel IP first, and solid gameplay second.

	Whether or not the rest of the game opens up more variety of action or surprises to stumble on remains to be seen. As is, it's a highly accessible entry for anyone looking to punch bad guys as their favorite hero. It might not have the same depth as other games of its genre, but there's plenty of dumb fun to be had.


Marvel Cosmic Invasion releases later this year for Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Brendan Fraser goes abroad for his latest film, “Rental Family,” to play an expat in Tokyo. The Best Actor Oscar winner leads the drama from “Beef” director HIKARI, who co-wrote the script with Stephen Blahut.

Fraser stars as a struggling actor hired to play a token American man for a Japanese “rental family” company in Tokyo. The role? Acting as a stand-in for other people's lives for their milestone events.

The synopsis reads: “Set against modern-day Tokyo, ‘Rental Family' follows an American actor (Fraser) who struggles to find purpose until he lands an unusual gig: working for a Japanese ‘rental family' agency, playing stand-in roles for strangers. As he immerses himself in his clients' worlds, he begins to form genuine bonds that blur the lines between performance and reality. Confronting the moral complexities of his work, he rediscovers purpose, belonging, and the quiet beauty of human connection.”

Alden Ehrenreich, Austin Abrams and Amy Madigan also star in this horror mystery about the disappearance one night of 17 elementary school classmates.


							By 

	David Rooney


Chief Film Critic


	If Sam Raimi was an obvious influence on Zach Cregger's head-turning 2022 horror breakthrough, Barbarian, Stephen King's imprint seems to be all over the writer-director's more ambitious follow-up, Weapons. Framed as a true story, it measures the shockwaves in a community when almost an entire class of elementary school children vanishes at the same time one night. It's even more reminiscent of King once a creepy figure in what looks like messy clown makeup starts making appearances. But any kinship with the master storyteller dissolves when the movie makes an abrupt swerve midway into witchy hag horror but fails to bolster that turn with compelling mythology.

	In many ways, this is an expertly crafted chiller. It's shot by Larkin Seiple with atmospheric style to burn, full of snaking tracking sequences that exert a mesmerizing grip, and it makes commanding use of a gut-churning score by brothers Ryan and Hays Holladay and Cregger that covers a wide tonal range while building an unsettling soundscape. A strong cast and an intriguing chapter structure also work in its favor. But ultimately, it's not really about anything much.

The Bottom Line

	
	A blunt instrument with a ton of style.
	



Release date: Friday, Aug. 8Cast: Josh Brolin, Julia Garner, Alden Ehrenreich, Austin Abrams, Cary Christopher, Benedict Wong, Amy Madigan, Toby Huss, Whitmer Thomas, Callie Schuttera, Clayton FarrisDirector-screenwriter: Zach Cregger

									Rated R,
								2 hours 8 minutes			






	Given the eerie phenomenon of children who leave their homes precisely at 2:17 a.m. — running through the darkened suburban streets with their arms outstretched like wings and then disappearing without a trace, strikingly accompanied by George Harrison's “Beware of Darkness” — it's conceivable that many will see it as an allegory for the shattering upheaval of tragedy that rips through towns across America with alarming frequency. The hypocrisy of a society continually looking for scapegoats to assign blame while refusing to examine its own dark heart provides a semblance of subtext.

	











	Nothing evokes gun violence and the worst parental fears like the sight of an empty classroom. But aside from a simmering Josh Brolin as grieving father Archer seeing a vision of a giant semi-automatic in the night sky flashing the time of the unexplained event, there's too little substance to support those associations.


	That might not matter to the core audience since the twisty, twisted film delivers more of the unpredictable narrative energy that made Barbarian so bracing. (One of the stars of that film turns up in a brief cameo.) But Weapons is far more consistently weird than scary, which might leave some genre freaks feeling unsatisfied.


	Whatever its flaws, Weapons unquestionably fortifies the impression that Cregger is a gifted genre director working with complete control as he shifts between enveloping dread and macabre humor.


	Justine Gandy (Julia Garner) is as surprised as anyone when she shows up at Maybrook Elementary one morning to find only one of her 18 students in attendance, Alex (Cary Christopher). Both teacher and student are questioned by police, as is headmaster Marcus (Benedict Wong). Security camera footage from the homes of missing kids reveals disturbing images of them running toward, rather than away from something, but concrete leads are elusive.


	Among the most hostile voices at a town hall meeting at which shocked parents want answers is Archer, who insists that the teacher must somehow be responsible. Once the school reopens after an investigation period, Justine wants to resume teaching, but Marcus persuades her to lie low until the anger dies down. That doesn't protect her from threatening phone calls, harrassment, the word “witch” graffitied across the side of her car in red paint and even an enraged mother physically attacking her at the liquor store.

	











	Justine becomes a frequent customer there, hitting the vodka hard and coaxing her occasional hookup, young cop Paul (Alden Ehrenreich, terrific), to slide off the wagon. Garner slyly plays up the character's duality, her slender frame hiding considerable strength and her tenderness toward the children she teaches contrasted with a tough, brittle side provoked by the suspicions cast upon her.


	Cregger effectively replays events from the days following the mass disappearance from different perspectives in chapters named for the characters whose point of view they adopt.


	In the “Justine” section, she refuses to be intimidated by Marcus' warnings, and after being forbidden from talking to Alex, she follows him home where she stumbles on another mystery. The windows are all obscured by newspapers and when no-one answers the front door, she peers inside through a gap and is startled to see what appears to be Alex's parents sitting on the couch in the dark staring blankly in a catatonic state.


	Chapters follow titled “Archer,” “Paul,” “Marcus” and “Alex,” along with one called “James.” Played by Austin Abrams with the wiry desperation and cunning of an addict, James is an unhoused junkie living in a tent in the woods, who has a nasty brush with Paul. But when James learns of the $50,000 reward being offered for information on the vanished children, he sees an opportunity. In the meantime, he needs drug money so starts breaking into houses, including the home of Alex's family.

	











	The less you know going forward the better, aside from the fact that people are driven by dark forces to acts of extreme violence, the most seemingly benign of them becoming the most brutal. Justine and Archer become unlikely allies once he witnesses her being attacked and their amateur sleuthing leads them in the right direction. Only in the penultimate chapter does a new character appear, who sheds a whole new light on what's happening, if not why. There's a bizarre Lynchian quality to the climactic events even if Cregger's fondness for grotesque comedy takes the edge off the terror.


	Expecting an audience to be spooked by a sinister figure who's like Phyllis Diller crossed with Friar Tuck and Amy Sedaris' Jerri Blank on Strangers with Candy is a tall order. But the movie is never dull or cripplingly silly and it looks sensational. Dynamic cinematographer Seiple's visuals are loaded with rich textures and sinuous movement. The extensive use of practical effects over CG is another asset. 


	Cregger's confident direction and the maniacal commitment of the actor in that late-arrival role allow the comedy to co-exist with horrific violence and escalating suspense in a concluding stretch with a dash of Lord of the Flies. It's as explosively bloody, viscerally charged and masterfully choreographed a denouement as that of any horror movie in recent memory.


	What does the ominously glowing blue triangle in the title graphic mean? Who knows, beyond generic occultism. But that's indicative of the lack of depth that holds Cregger back, suggesting that a more psychologically probing co-writer might elevate him into the ranks of the great horror visionaries.

“Jay Kelly,” Noah Baumbach‘s return to directing after “White Noise,” already has proven to be an awards contender. Of course, it helps that the feature will screen at NYFF 2025 after premiering at Venice, and studio Netflix has given the film a theatrical release just in time for the Oscars push. But what about the titular Jay Kelly himself?

The feature, whose elusive logline remains, centers on George Clooney‘s Jay Kelly, a fictional A-list movie star in his 60s who faces a personal reckoning when he travels to an Italian film festival to receive a tribute award. The synopsis reads: “The film follows famous movie actor Jay Kelly (Clooney) and his devoted manager Ron (Adam Sandler) as they embark on a whirlwind and unexpectedly profound journey through Europe. Along the way, both men are forced to confront the choices they've made, the relationships with their loved ones, and the legacies they'll leave behind.”

Baumbach cowrote the script with Emily Mortimer, who also stars. Sandler and Laura Dern are among the many Baumbach staples included in the ensemble; Baumbach's partner Greta Gerwig acts in the film, too.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






“Jay Kelly” is the fourth collaboration between Baumbach and Netflix, with “The Meyerowitz Stories” (which starred Sandler), “Marriage Story” (that's what got Dern her Oscar), and “White Noise” (another Gerwig film) on the streamer. “Jay Kelly” also stars Billy Crudup, Grace Edwards, Stacy Keach, Riley Keough, Patrick Wilson, Nicôle Lecky, Thaddea Graham, Jim Broadbent, Eve Hewson, Alba Rohrwacher, Lenny Henry, and Josh Hamilton. “Jay Kelly” features a score from “Succession” composer Nicholas Britell. Linus Sandgren is the cinematographer. 

David Heyman and Amy Pascal, who are now spearheading the James Bond franchise at Amazon MGM, are producing alongside Baumbach. 

Clooney told Vanity Fair that the inferred meta-ness of “Jay Kelly” is in part why he wanted to take on the role. “When you're an actor in my position, at my age, finding roles like this aren't all that common,” Clooney said. “If you can't make peace with aging, then you've got to get out of the business and just disappear. I'm now the guy that, when I go running after a bad guy, it's funny — it's not suspenseful. That's OK. I embrace all of that.”

Clooney continued, “Do people say that I only play myself? I don't give a shit. There aren't that many guys in my age group that are allowed to do both broad comedies like ‘O Brother [Where Art Thou?]' and then do ‘Michael Clayton' or ‘Syriana'. So if that means I'm playing myself all the time, I don't give a shit… Have you ever tried playing yourself? It's hard to do. […] I've been the beneficiary of having my career not be massively successful in lots of different directions. I didn't really get successful, in the kind of success that can be blinding, until I was 33 years old. I'd been working for 12 years at that point. I had a real understanding of how fleeting all of it is and how little it has to do with you, quite honestly.”

The new directors will join the Paramount Global boardroom when the proposed merger is completed.


							By 

	Etan Vlessing


Canada Bureau Chief


	With Skydance‘s deal to acquire Paramount Global set to close this week, David Ellison has unveiled its proposed 10 new board directors to serve once the merger is completed.


	Ellison is set to serve as the future chairman and CEO of the Paramount studio. Former Paramount Pictures head Sherry Lansing is proposed to sit as an independent director, while Oracle Corp CEO Safra A. Catz, whose company is aligned with former CEO Larry Ellison, father of David Ellison, is also tapped for the new boardroom.




	Barbara Byrne, former vice chairman of British investment bank Barclays PLC, is the lone holdover from the old board and will sit as an independent director. The new Paramount will have three segments: Studios, direct-to-consumer, and TV media.

	The rest of the proposed board appointees from the world of media, technology, and finance — and many of whom are shareholders of the combined studio — include Gerry Cardinale, founder and managing partner of RedBird Capital Partners; John L. Thornton, chairman of RedBird Capital Partners; Andy Gordon, future chief strategy officer and COO of Paramount; Jeff Shell, future Paramount president; Justin G. Hamill, managing director and chief legal officer of Silver Lake; and Paul Marinelli, president, Lawrence Investments LLC.

	As previously announced, former NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell will be president of the new Paramount. Joining him will be Andy Gordon, who had been leading RedBird Capital's Los Angeles office. RedBird is providing financial capital to support the Skydance deal. 

	











	The current Paramount Global directors will step down on the close of the merger.


	David Ellison in a statement said of the new proposed board directors: “We are thrilled and honored to welcome this truly outstanding group of director-designees to our Board. They are dynamic leaders whose impact spans industries and whose reputations resonate across the business world globally. The legacy of Paramount is one of our greatest strategic assets and it is our strong desire and fiduciary duty to honor that history while positioning the business for sustained value creation. These highly qualified, world-class executives share in our commitment and will play a critical role in guiding the future direction of our combined company, and we are deeply grateful for their willingness to serve.”

Midwest emo no longer has to be from the Midwest and it doesn't even need to be emo, and, for that, you can thank this one line from Algernon Cadwallader's “Motivational Song”: “So if fucking up feels right/Then fuck it up!”

It's a great hook and also the entire ethos of the transformative scene that sprung up around Algernon Cadwallader in Pennsylvania in the late 2000s. The quartet band out among other scrappy, spirited groups like Snowing, Glocca Morra, Street Smart Cyclist, and Marietta that reclaimed “the whole Chicago '90s emo thing” of Cap'n Jazz and American Football at a time when the genre's credibility was at its lowest ebb. These groups made small and indispensable catalogs of music and then broke up right before a more traditionally artsy and ambitious wave made the “emo revival” a mainstream concern.

Frontman Peter Helmis was ambivalent about capitalizing on that renewed interest. Algernon Cadwallader reissued their catalog in 2018, and Helmis guessed it would take at least another decade before they reunited, if they ever did at all. His bandmates had started families, careers, and plenty of other bands. (Helmis alone fronted Yankee Bluff and Dogs on Acid, while guitarist Joe Reinhart took his slip-n-slide riffs to Hop Along and produced scene classics from Modern Baseball, Joyce Manor and Awakebutstillinbed.) Helmis was off by about six years, and, in 2022, Algernon played to crowds that eclipsed any they ever saw at their peak, filled with teenagers who would have to agree with Helmis' claim that there was “something unattainable” about the band during its existence.

If Helmis couldn't keep his promise about the timetable of Algernon's reunion, he did hold firm in his belief that Algernon couldn't simply be a reunion band playing old album run-throughs at Best Friends Forever and Florida's Fest. So he and his bandmates made a new album. Trying Not to Have a Thought doesn't pick up where Algernon left off on 2011's underappreciated Parrot Flies. It imagines an alternate history where all of the members channeled their artistic evolution from their many, many projects right back into Algernon Cadwallader, as if that had been the plan all along.

The result is one of the finest rock albums of 2025, genre be damned. It's politically pointed and personally poignant, unpredictable and virtuosic. Now two decades into their career, Algernon Cadwallader can relate a straightforward history lesson about the 1985 MOVE bombing that fits right alongside their older DIY house anthems and newer experiments like “noitanitsarcorP,” a tribute to the creative process that emerged from a group ketamine trip; “I played the same drum beat for, like, 25 minutes,” Nick Tazza recalls. “And I remember being like, that was the most beautiful thing we ever wrote.”

With the original lineup of Helmis, Reinhart, Tazza and guitarist Colin Mahony together for the first time since their debut, Some Kind of Cadwallader, the same “if it feels good, do it” spirit of 2008 pervades Trying Not to Have a Thought. “We wrote a bunch of songs in Joe's parents' basement,” Helmis reflects. “And now we're writing these new songs fucking 20 years later in Joe's own basement.”

Everything that keeps us together is falling apart on Trying Not to Have a Thought—high school friends die tragically before their time, endless war continues unabated, the working class is one paycheck away from poverty, and the social safety net is hanging on by a thread. The urgency of speaking to these anxieties while the creative spark burned hot allowed Algernon Cadwallader to write their first album in 14 years within a few weeks at retreats in Snoqualmie, Washington, and the Poconos. “I think it makes you appreciate the time that we are spending together; it's more like an affirmation,” Helmis states in my Zoom call with him, Joe Reinhart, and Nick Tazza. “Don't fuck around. This time is fleeting. Always focus on the good. Appreciate every second.”

Nick Tazza: I don't think we've ever really stopped being in touch with each other, regardless if we're making music or just fucking off. When I moved out to Seattle, Peter was the first person who came to see me. We've always been involved in each other's lives.

Peter Helmis: With the exception of our fucking boy Colin [laughs]. He was an original founding member and also one of the first humans that I ever started playing music with, and he left pretty abruptly before Some Kind of Cadwallader came out. I saw him twice over the period of, like, a decade. We were all going different paths and moving at a million miles an hour. He was a father and getting a steady job and just trying to keep his life on track. So, once we got together for the reunion, it was fucking awesome and so much fun. He's the one person who I feel like actually changed the least since high school; he's so funny at all times. That helped put us in the mindset to write a record like this, the four of us all back together.

Helmis: We have never worried about how we'll be received. In fact, if anything, we'll steer something in another direction if we think it's gonna be perceived too well.

Joe Reinhart: That's about as far as we go, as pre-meditation is concerned.

Helmis: I'm glad you're aware of MOVE, being from Philadelphia. I feel like it should be like one of our country's most horrific tragedies of all time, but it's somehow pretty much buried. Obviously, there's information and documentaries out there, but it's not talked about as widely as it should be. I feel like it ties into every other event that happened in Philadelphia before and afterwards. Growing up in the scene when we did, in the early 2000s, you'd go to punk shows and there would always be “Free Mumia” flyers. I remember as a teenager just being like, “Oh shit, like what is this? I got to know what these people are talking about.” That left a real impact on me. But I feel like by the time we moved to the city and started our bands, that fell off a little bit. And maybe we were responsible for some of that. I thought about that over the years and how that's pretty fucking unfortunate, you know?

But it's twofold: us being a band again and having an audience, knowing that people are listening and also seeing all these super young kids on the reunion tour, we're speaking to another generation here. There's obviously a few songs that were about the current world we live in—America, the empire. I didn't want to premeditate it, this is what's going on in my mind and probably everybody's mind these days. It's just overwhelming, which is where the title of the record comes from; “trying not to have a thought” is a euphemism for, like, meditation and trying to free the mind. But this is all the stuff that's rushing in all the time.

Helmis: “This is the utopia,” the “white utopia” is how this state [Oregon] was founded. It was very clear when I first moved here and—I think Nick can probably relate to this—you see [the homelessness] so much more than back in the East Coast. I always saw people in the streets everywhere [in Philadelphia], but the camps out here on the West Coast, and especially in the Pacific Northwest, is just the first thing you notice. I don't know if it's just less swept under the rug.

Nick Tazza: One common thread through everything is that it's all kind of fucked in a similar way. I think Philadelphia is denser and you feel the anxiety of it a lot more. Out here [in Seattle], it's definitely more chill, but you see the wealth disparity a lot more clearly, where I see people like us who are “normal” and have working jobs, but they're fucking on the street. I do think there's better social services on the East Coast; at least it seems that way. I feel like people are more able to get housing a little easier on the East Coast; there's more shelters for them to go to. I live in a pretty chill area, but the cops fucking suck, same bullshit.

Helmis: I've thought about this and it's like… we're a fucking band, first and foremost. We write music; that's our purpose. The message is on top of this music because we wrote this music and then we wrote these lyrics and we smashed them together. And I love the juxtaposition of that. We're having fun, you know, pointing fingers and talking shit and calling out the bullshit.

Tazza: I would say we've always been punk kids and always viewed Algernon as a punk band. It's just been an extension of what we've always done. And I think it's really cool to see Peter align the band that way. I've always loved Peter's lyrics, and, in Algernon, they become more avant-garde, more ephemeral. Then we did Dogs on Acid, and Peter's lyricism and his delivery became even more amazing and now to see the clarity of the message along with the music is awesome. I also think we're at a point now where if you're not using your fucking voice to promote something, it's a waste.

Helmis: I've always recognized that the music that means the most to me—my favorite bands, favorite records—is what I listen to the least, just because they're already up here [points to head]. So I seek out that stuff live. Seeing Cap'n Jazz these days is unreal. They've gotten even better, and the music has gotten more relevant somehow. But I listen to Joan of Arc at least once a month. If I want to listen to something, I can't think of what, it's like, “well, let me just pick a Joan of Arc record.” Incredible catalog; they could have been 12 different bands.

Reinhart: I think about that a lot when I'm working with bands. I'll [produce] their first record and you can tell they only ever played these songs in small rooms because everybody's playing bass chords and hitting every part of the drum at the part of the song they want to be loud. But once you get into these rooms where there's space and big low end, I've heard bands come back and have more of those sorts of textures in their music. I don't know if we made any of those decisions consciously, but I was pushing the energy in the music. Seventy percent of what I listen to has that melodic punk push to it, and I think it was consciously making stuff like that and then, yeah, some of it was a ketamine jam.

Tazza: Joe wrote a fucking ska part on this record, and that's the sickest thing of all time.

Helmis: You got to go back and find that ska Easter egg.

Helmis: I can't wait.

Reinhart: I was thinking about that today, like, man, when are we doing Europe or other countries? Maybe we should just plan to write an EP before any of that stuff happens. What are we doing? Are we just going to sit around in January? Let's fucking do something.

After steadily rolling out some of its gala heavy-hitters, the New York Film Festival has today announced its full main slate lineup, including new films from Claire Denis, Park Chan-wook, Noah Baumbach, Kathryn Bigelow, Kahlil Joseph, Joachim Trier, Ira Sachs, and many more.

This year's main slate includes films from 26 countries, among them two world premieres (including Bradley Cooper's “Is This Thing On?” and Ulrich Köhler's “Gavagai”), plus eight North American and 13 U.S. premieres. 

The festival has also programmed a number of hits from other fests, including Cannes prizewinners like Jafar Panahi's “It Was Just an Accident,” Joachim Trier's “Sentimental Value,” Oliver Laxe's “Sirât,” Mascha Schilinski's “Sound of Falling,” Kleber Mendonça Filho's “The Secret Agent,” and Bi Gan's “Resurrection.” Berlin and Sundance hits are also on offer, including Mary Bronstein's “If I Had Legs I'd Kick You” and Radu Jude's “Kontinental '25.” Of the Main Slate films, 11 are set to premiere at the 82nd Venice Film Festival, including Noah Baumbach's “Jay Kelly,” Kent Jones' “Late Fame,” and Park Chan-wook's “No Other Choice.”

NYFF Artistic Director Dennis Lim said in an official statement, “​​Anyone who cares about film knows that it is an art in need of defending, like many of our core values today. Across all sections of the festival, the movies we have selected this year suggest that this safeguarding can take many guises: acts of rejuvenation and refusal, expressions of unease and joy, feats of imagination and commemoration. I am particularly struck by the diversity of approaches and forms among the films in this Main Slate, which affirms that the art of cinema is more than capable of thriving, even in difficult times.”

 










As previously announced, the Opening Night selection is the North American premiere of Luca Guadagnino's “After the Hunt”; the North American premiere of Jim Jarmusch's “Father Mother Sister Brother” is the Centerpiece selection; and the world premiere of Bradley Cooper's “Is This Thing On?” is the Closing Night selection. Currents, Spotlight, Revivals, and Talks sections will be announced in the coming weeks.

Filmmakers making their main slate debut are Mary Bronstein, Bradley Cooper, Kent Jones, Kahlil Joseph, Milagros Mumenthaler, Mark Obenhaus, Hlynur Pálmason, Pedro Pinho, Mascha Schilinski, and Francesco Sossai.

The NYFF Main Slate selection committee is chaired by Dennis Lim, NYFF Artistic Director, and includes Florence Almozini, Justin Chang, K. Austin Collins, and Rachel Rosen. Check out the full main slate of this year's NYFF below.

Noah Hawley recently said of his plan for Alien: Earth, the first TV show based on the iconic science-fiction/action-horror film series, “Imagine if there were five movies about the White Walkers, and I went and made Game of Thrones.”


	Hawley is a creator who has never lacked confidence in his own work, nor a shyness about expressing that confidence. Nevertheless, he was already being asked to clear a very high bar by making an Alien television series, since the first two movies in the franchise are universally beloved and have compelling arguments as the all-time greatest horror and action film, respectively. To invite Game of Thrones comparisons on top of the work of Ridley Scott and James Cameron should, on paper, be complete and utter folly — especially since the relentless, nearly indestructible nature of the famous Xenomorph from the movies wouldn't seem to lend itself well to an ongoing TV show that's not going to kill off most of its characters each week. 

	











	Yet as he did with Fargo, turning a classic and beloved movie into a long-running, award-winning anthology series, Hawley has taken a concept that has no business working for television and shaped it into something thrilling, strange, and surprising. Alien: Earth has its flaws, especially with that Xenomorph issue, but it manages to evoke the original movie without feeling slavishly imitative of it. And it finds fascinating ways to expand on concepts introduced in the background of the films, most of which couldn't get enough narrative attention while Sigourney Weaver and company were running for their lives.

Alien: Earth takes place two years before the events of the first film in the series. It's 2120, and governments are a thing of the distant past. Control of Earth is now divided among five mega-corporations. One of those is Weyland-Yutani, which is a key part of the movies, and in this show has commissioned the crew of the space ship Maginot to collect dangerous alien samples — including a Xenomorph — to return to Earth for further research. (The second movie, Aliens, introduced the idea that Weyland-Yutani wants to use the Xenomorphs to build unstoppable bioweapons.) But the Maginot instead crashes in a part of southeast Asia that's the dominion of Prodigy, a corporation founded by Boy Kavalier (Samuel Blenkin), an overgrown child obsessed with Peter Pan, who struts around his research facility barefoot in pajamas.

	At the time of the Maginot crash, Kavalier has created his own immortal version of the Lost Boys, by transplanting the minds of a group of terminally ill children into ageless synthetic bodies — much like Ash, Bishop, or, here, Kirsh (Timothy Olyphant), but with memories of their childhoods, and personalities that don't yet match their adult-looking bodies. The first and most impressive of this group renames herself Wendy (Sydney Chandler), and when she realizes that her older brother, Hermit (Alex Lawther) is part of the search-and-rescue team investigating the crash site, she persuades Kavalier to send her, the other Lost Boys, and Kersh in to investigate.  


	There are logic problems almost immediately, which continue across multiple episodes. How did a nonmilitary crew capture and imprison a Xenomorph in the first place? Why would Boy Kavalier risk his multibillion-dollar prototypes — beta tests for a plan to allow the richest people on the planet to live forever in bodies like Wendy's — on such a dangerous mission? Why, after Hermit survives an initial run-in with a Xenomorph, does he simply resume looking for other survivors, and not bother to tell anyone about the terrifying, phallic monster with multiple jaws that he just encountered? For that matter, how do multiple people manage to outrun and, in one sequence that happens largely off-camera, kill one of these things? There are also various events, and lessons learned about the creatures, that cause large swaths of Aliens to make substantially less sense.

	To be fair, Alien writers Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett made the Xenomorph such a potent and versatile threat that later storytellers have struggled at times not to just have all the humans die in the first 15 to 20 minutes of each film. But within the context of self-contained movies, which usually cover very finite periods of time, it's largely worked, even when the movies, like Alien: Resurrection, have other problems. For a series with eight chapters in its first season, and more seasons potentially to come, it stands out more. 

	











	But Hawley flanks the familiar creature from the movies with a variety of new monsters that get unleashed in the Maginot crash. Each of them is nightmare-inducingly gross in different ways (with captions on, one creature's movement is described with the words “[soft squishing]” which sums it up nicely), and each has its own macabre method of attacking the human body. One eyeball-themed alien is so creepy, and so creatively deployed, that I would gladly watch a standalone film about it terrorizing the crew of a mining ship. 


	Hawley's also following a tradition of some of the later films of the series — including Ridley Scott's own Prometheus — in using the Xenomorph and all the legacy of the franchise as a way to Trojan-horse bigger ideas into the show. In this case, Alien: Earth is about many of the problems we're talking about daily on our version of Earth: the dehumanizing effects of late capitalism, the dangers of AI, tech bros run amok without safeguards in place, and the extreme methods that the super rich are deploying to try to extend their lives past the limits of human biology. Some parts of this play more smoothly than others — a sequence in which Hermit finds a debauched, Louis XIV-themed party where the billionaire guests refuse to evacuate the building, which a literal spaceship just crashed into, is so on the nose it's inside the nose — but the show is clearly thoughtful even when it's otherwise trying to scare the nanopants off you. (And it usually does a good job at that, too.) 


	The Lost Boys in general, and Wendy in particular, prove so interesting that any hiccups elsewhere don't matter that much, especially after the first handful of episodes. The idea of children's minds operating superpowered adult bodies should feel silly, like a body swap comedy accidentally got cross-pollinated with a creature feature. But it works, which is largely a credit to Sydney Chandler. She was the best part of FX's largely forgettable miniseries about the Sex Pistols, and she's an extremely compelling central figure here, coming across as simultaneously childlike and adult, human and inhuman. At times, she's the vulnerable heroine of the piece, and at others convincingly feels like an even bigger threat than the Xenomorphs or the eyeball monsters. 


	Olyphant, reuniting with Hawley after he played a supporting role in Fargo Season Four, is suitably off-kilter as the serenely confident Kirsh. The cast's other breakout is British actor Babou Ceesay as Morrow, a cyborg who survives the Maginot crash and has his own agenda. He's the main character of the season's fifth episode, a flashback establishing what led to the Maginot crash. That one's titled “In Space, No One …” — an allusion to the tag line from the original Alien, “In space, no one can hear you scream.” Between the title and the fact that so much of the Maginot resembles the designs of the Nostromo in the 1979 film, Hawley is really inviting comparisons. But Ceesay makes Morrow so complex — especially as a contrast to how he behaves in the series' present-day action — and Hawley's script and direction find enough new wrinkles to the familiar old beats, that it's all riveting. Even if, again, the episode skips over the thorny question of how exactly this group of schmoes managed to cage a pure killing machine.

	At a few points in that episode, Morrow listens to the Vera Lynn ballad “We'll Meet Again,” which memorably plays over the climactic sequence of Stanley Kubrick's Cold War classic Dr. Strangelove. So Hawley is inviting two seemingly impossible, unflattering comparisons in the space of one hour. There's a line where confidence slides dangerously into hubris. There's a lot of hubris on display within the story of Alien: Earth, especially as Boy Kavalier keeps putting his amazing new scientific breakthrough at risk because he's fascinated by the dangerous cargo that crash landed in his backyard. But Hawley, like he did with Fargo, ultimately finds a way to make Alien: Earth feel like it belongs as part of this fictional universe. 


The first two episodes of Alien: Earth debut Aug. 12 on FX and Hulu, with additional episodes releasing weekly. I've seen all eight episodes.

When Noah Hawley turned “Fargo” into a TV series, he approached the beloved Coen brothers' film as a “state of mind” — a familiar world to play in, rather than a specific story to retell. 

With “Alien: Earth,” the showrunner takes a similar tack: latching onto the sweaty, slimy, murky aesthetic of Ridley Scott's horror classic, as well as the expansive yet pointed imagination of James Cameron's sequel, to fashion a new narrative as strange as it is fitting. While not a strict homage to either film (lacking the eerie grace of Scott's exacting horror show and the linear propulsion of Cameron's action flick), Hawley's freaky first season (all of which was screened for this review) similarly foregrounds a keen appetite for discovery and a healthy fear of the unknown; a drive toward what we don't know and a respect for what we don't understand. “Alien: Earth” doesn't always keep its footing (at least, not as surely as “Fargo” tends to), but it's a fascinating and frightening extension of an oft-confined space.

The proliferation of the “Alien” franchise — from Scott's prequels “Prometheus” and the exquisite “Alien: Covenant,” to disavowed sequels and spinoffs like “Alien: Resurrection” and “Alien vs. Predator” — turned a once-in-a-lifetime serpent into just another snake. To be clear, I miss David, our solar system's preeminent mad android scientist, and I'd love to see Scott complete his prequel trilogy, but the Xenomorph has been manhandled by more klutzy fingers than you'll find on a face-hugger, and recent attempts to restore its grandeur felt like little more than fan service. Another spaceship. Another alien. Another (very bloody) game of hide and seek. 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






“Alien: Earth” looks backward, sure — it's set two years ahead of the original “Alien” — but it does so without the restrictions commonly found in prequels. Like the old adage about a tree in a forest implies: If a person screams in space and no one can hear them, does it matter? Maybe a little bit, but Hawley's series is focused on Earth, where there's a whole mess of shit happening, even compared to the disastrous reality we're living through now. 

The opening script informs us Donald Trump's wet dream has come true: There are no more governments, only corporations — five of them, to be precise — each of which controls different parts of the world (not to mention the moon and a few nearby planets). There's Threshold, Lynch, Dynamic, Prodigy (“the new one,” as one crew member calls it), and Weyland-Yutani, the O.G. evil company that sabotaged Ripley's inaugural trip home. Sixty years ago, they chartered a research vessel to travel to deep space, snag as many nasty creatures as they could, and bring them home for “further study.” 

Wouldn't you know it, but their return home doesn't go according to plan, and the USCSS Maginot crash-lands in a city owned and operated by Prodigy, not Weyland-Yutani. This sparks the interest of Prodigy's founder, Boy Kavalier (Samuel Blenkin), a shit-stirrer at heart who invokes the timeless law of “finders keepers” to lay claim to the displaced spaceship and, more importantly, whatever precious cargo it's carrying.

 










What's lurking inside is exactly what you expect — almost. Much like how “Fargo” (the series) repositions its leading lady, Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand), “Alien: Earth” reimagines its own star. The Xenomorph is still our story's inescapable incarnation of death — the universe's uncaring response to our desperate fight to survive — but H.R. Giger and Carlo Rambaldi's iconic extraterrestrial killing machine isn't a solo act anymore. It's one of nearly a half-dozen creatures with sinister intentions toward mankind. They take a backseat on the evil bus to a megalomaniacal trillionaire (Boy Kavalier), his corporate peers (mostly unseen), and their twisted flunkies (oh my God, so many flunkies), but they prove to be exactly as memorable as scaredy cats like me wish they weren't: haunting in their disgusting treatment of frail human bodies, as well as their utter disregard for acute human suffering.

Despite the new need to clarify which alien you're referring to whenever you shout, “Goddamnit, that alien is about to do something fucking gross again,” the series' most intriguing new invention is its main character, Wendy. Played with impressive clarity by Sydney Chandler, Wendy is a child whose consciousness was transferred to the body of an adult. As a human, she was sick, dying, frail. As a “hybrid,” she's a synthetic being with superhuman abilities who may actually be immortal.

 










She and her fellow hybrids still act and think like children (a few performances, mainly from Jonathan Ajayi and Adarsh Gourav, evoke gleefully bleak humor in their embodiments of big kids), but they're repeatedly thrust into adult situations — like, say, retrieving a zoo of deadly aliens from a spaceship embedded in a residential skyscraper. Said retrieval is made that much more complicated by the presence of Wendy's brother, Hermit (Alex Lawther), at the crash site. He's a medic enlisted in whatever kind of army Prodigy has organized, and he's still under the impression his little sister died from her incurable illness. Imagine the surprise on his face when he finds out otherwise — assuming, you know, that same face isn't first greeted by an alien. 

If Wendy is our hero, Hermit is as close to an audience surrogate as we get, and his bravery and fear, curiosity and confusion are helpful touchstones as “Alien: Earth” embraces discomfort at every turn. There's the queasy ethical conundrum of “saving” a terminal child's life by accelerating them into adulthood. There's the nausea invoked by how closely the show's vision of a capitalist technocracy mirrors our current society. And then, of course, there's the revolting attacks by the actual aliens. 

The series can be difficult to watch, particularly for anyone with extra sensitivities toward children in various states of peril, but it's also not without its fun. Timothy Olyphant's Kirsh is a worthy successor to Michael Fassbender's David and the other rabble-rousing androids. As Boy Kavalier's right-hand synth, he's responsible for training the hybrids, which means Olyphant gets to play the annoyed babysitter, clearly yet exasperatedly repeating the 22nd-century version of, “If you don't stop screwing around, I will pull this car over.” Much like “Alien: Covenant” benefited from letting David go full-on Dr. Moreau, Season 2, if it's greenlit, would benefit greatly from fully unleashing Kirsh.

 










Babou Ceesay as Morrow, a cyborg and sole survivor of the crashed ship, is also quite enjoyable as a twisted, teeth-gnashing pseudo-villain, and seeing “The Babadook's” Essie Davis play a surrogate mama for a slew of tortured “children” (she's in charge of the synths' “emotional well-being”) brings an extra layer of dread to her increasingly upsetting scenes. 

Where “Alien: Earth” slips up is in a few tonal missteps, one worrisome creative leap, and with the alien itself. Shot in medium-wide shots and too often shown in slo-motion, there's an inelegance to the “perfect organism” during its many action scenes. Not only do its movements, decisions, and presentation invite too many questions as to why it kills who it does (and when), but the Xenomorph's inconsistent capturing also undercuts a few bold narrative developments later on. By the end of the season, the titular Alien is almost an afterthought — for better, certainly (pushing forward, while uncomfortable, is often necessary when it comes to nostalgia), but what's worse is needlessly so. (The Xenomorph is still terrifying, when handled deftly.)

The few “good guys” in “Alien: Earth,” when not literally trapped by an alarming array of monsters, are also caught between the resurgence of a dangerous past and the emergence of a formidable future. What cost are we willing to pay to survive? And what does survival even look like after the final tab is covered? The “Alien” franchise is made up of heroes whose victory comes without a reward beyond their own continued breathing, and you can see Hermit slowly recognizing the same fate as his best-case scenario. Seemingly, there's no way out. Extinction is the only evident endpoint — for humans, at least.

 










Maybe, just maybe, the children will save us. Otherwise, it's adapt or die. And in “Alien: Earth,” the question becomes: Is there even a difference?

“Alien: Earth” premieres Tuesday, August 12 at 8 p.m. ET on FX and Hulu.

Timothy Olyphant and Sydney Chandler star in the Noah Hawley-created series, which begins with a spaceship crash-landing on our planet and introducing an array of deadly extraterrestrial creatures.


							By 

	Angie Han


Television Critic


	In its very first moments, FX's Alien: Earth feels like nothing so much as, well, Alien. 


	Here we are once more aboard a Weyland-Yutani spaceship, the USCSS Maginot this time, watching a rumpled crew emerge from cryogenic hibernation. Here they go now gathering around the canteen, trading jokes and complaints. And here again is a crewmember examining way too closely the creepy-crawlies they have encountered on their travels.

The Bottom Line

	
	On Earth, everyone can hear you scream.
	



Airdate: 8 p.m. Tuesday, Aug. 12 (FX and Hulu)Cast: Sydney Chandler, Timothy Olyphant, Samuel Blenkin, Babou Ceesay, Alex Lawther, Essie DavisCreator: Noah Hawley			
			







	You can fill in the rest from there — and indeed, Earth trusts you to do just that, initially offering only brief, jarring teases of the crew's expectedly gruesome fates.

	But if the prologue confirms that creator Noah Hawley can faithfully replicate the superficial trappings of this franchise, what comes next suggests he gets something of its spirit, too. Because Earth, as it turns out, is mostly not about rehashing Alien at all. Instead, like all the series' most interesting follow-ups, it treats that familiar template less as a formula than a launchpad for its own ambitions — in this case, a heady, sprawling, occasionally unwieldy but eventually thrilling epic about personhood, hubris and, of course, the primal pleasure of watching people get absolutely rocked by space monsters.

	As the title might suggest, the real story is happening down on Earth. Specifically, it's in the region of Southeast Asia controlled by Prodigy, which as of 2120 (two years before the events of Ridley Scott's 1979 original, not that it matters) is one of five corporations controlling the globe. 

	











	On the remote, Edenic island of Neverland, terminally ill 12-year-old Marcy (Florence Bensberg) is having her consciousness uploaded into a cutting-edge synthetic form with humanoid adult features, enhanced physical capabilities and, most important to Prodigy's stake in the race to “cure” mortality, a theoretically infinite lifespan.


	When the Maginot crash-lands in nearby New Siam, Wendy (Sydney Chandler), as the hybrid has rechristened herself, sees the opportunity to flex her new gifts. She and five of her fellow prototypes head out on a rescue mission overseen by Kirsh (an icy Timothy Olyphant), a more traditional synthetic à la Alien's Ash. But once it becomes clear the vessel was carrying a veritable zoo of fearsome outer-space creatures, Prodigy's founder, the obnoxiously but appropriately named Boy Kavalier (Samuel Blenkin), cannot resist the opportunity to claim them for himself.


	Most of this is laid out in the thrilling if overstuffed premiere, written and directed by Hawley. It takes at least two more episodes to bring the various supporting characters into focus and seed the season's smaller subplots, and it's not until the fourth or fifth (out of an eight-part season) that the series reaches the turning point from setting things up to paying them off.


	But Earth is never dull, even at its most expositional. Stomach-churning violence and queasy conversations are scattered regularly enough to keep viewers on the edge of their seats. The production design by Andy Nicholson, pretty but purposefully cold, looks real enough to touch and expansive enough to explore. A sardonic rock playlist (Black Sabbath, Tool, Pearl Jam) sends each chapter off under a dark spell.

	











	Xenomorphs in their various forms show up early and semi-often, along with several new beasts with their own deliciously horrible ways of killing. (My favorite is an impish octopus-like critter with an eyeball for a head; I will not spoil its sickening signature move.) Novel gradations on the man-machine scale — in addition to classic synthetics like Kirsh and cutting-edge hybrids like Wendy, we also encounter a cyborg with a human body but enhanced parts — add a slight twist to the usual philosophical quandaries about intelligence, emotion and what counts as human.


	While the enormity of the cast means some of the characters inevitably go underdeveloped, performances are compelling across the board. Chandler and her fellow Lost Boys — Adarsh Gourav as Slightly, Jonathan Ajayi as Smee, Erana James as Curly, Lily Newmark as Nibs, Kit Young as Tootles and, yes, also all names from Peter Pan — adopt a restless preadolescent physicality that never allows us to forget that these are still children inside grown-up bodies: naive, scared, impressionable and manipulable.


	Among the proper adults, standouts include Alex Lawther, who brings a much-needed warmth to this bleak milieu as Wendy's soldier-medic brother, Hermit; and Babou Ceesay, who injects surprising pathos into Morrow, the Maginot's ruthless and relentless security officer. 


	On the far other end of the likability spectrum, Blenkin is marvelously repulsive as Boy Kavalier, whose arrogance might be more toxic even than xenomorph blood. If the way he sneers lines like “Just assume I'm ahead of you, always” isn't enough to make you wish a face-hugger would shut him up already, the way he sinks into an office chair — legs spread, dirty bare feet on the table, what're-you-gonna-do-about-it smirk on his face — just might.

	











	The comparisons between Boy Kavalier and other former tech wunderkinds like Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk and Steve Jobs are not subtle, but then, neither is much else about Earth. Lest a viewer somehow fail to catch the first 500 nods to Peter Pan, Boy Kavalier reads entire passages from the J.M Barrie books in voiceover.


	Debates about whether hybrids like Wendy are still people are frequent and explicit, as are instructions to prioritize xenomorph eggs over human lives or scientific “progress” over the hybrids' agency. When one character pays lip service, late in the season, to the rights of androids, the only surprise is that he'd bother lying at all.


	Perhaps the bluntness is only fitting for the mask-off era we're living through, in which real-life villains aren't much bothered to hide their motives either. Or maybe there just isn't much point in playing it coy when there's never been anything remotely subtle about the franchise's signature creature, an elemental predator to whom all humans (and indeed all living things) are just food. 


	If the first few hours of the season can feel like a slow burn, the last few let all hell break loose with glorious, gory abandon. Suffice it to say that once the dust settles, the monsters have been fed and the fans will have been, too.

Shakira welcomed Black Eyed Peas on stage in Los Angeles last night to perform their joint single “Girl Like Me” as part of her Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran World Tour. The singer also took the opportunity to showcase She Wolf deep cut “Men in this Town” for the first time live. 


	The Colombian singer collaborated with Black Eyed Peas on “Girl Like Me” in 2020. The single appeared on the band's eighth studio album, Translation. Shakira has regularly been performing the song on her tour, albeit without the help of Black Eyed Peas.

	Shakira launched her Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran World Tour in Brazil in February, and kicked off the North American leg of the tour on May 13 at the Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina. She was abruptly cancelled a tour stop at Fenway Park in Boston on May 29 after teasing appearances from Will.i.am and Wyclef Jean. She subsequently pulled the plug on her WorldPride Welcome Concert performance at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C. because her full tour production wouldn't make it on time for the show.

	The tour continues in Los Angeles tonight, with upcoming stops in Mexico throughout August and September. Shakira will headline the 2025 edition of annual charity concert event Global Citizen Festival in New York City on Sept. 27.


	Earlier this summer, Shakira told Rolling Stone of the record-breaking tour, “I learned that this is more than a show, this is a communion, an encounter with my most-loyal fans and also my newest fans. It's really a moment of total identification.… I didn't want to save any effort, I didn't want to save any resources to take the best show possible to Latin America, because I feel and I really truly believe that my people deserve the best.”

After a turbulent run on “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” season 14, Kyle Richards and Dorit Kemsley appear to be repairing their friendship—and they're doing it in style. On Saturday, August 2, the Bravo stars linked up in Montauk for a Hamptons weekend filled with music, dancing, and a surprise “Southern Charm” crossover with Austen Kroll. Add in a possible camera crew and celebrity stylist Rachel Zoe, and you've got the Bravo multiverse in full effect.

A post shared by Kyle Richards (@kylerichards18)

Richards documented the weekend on her Instagram Stories, showing herself and Kemsley dancing at the Surf Lodge while watching Mojave Grey, a musical duo made up of Zander Bleck and Michael Pozzi. The two were joined by Rachel Zoe, who will be a full-time cast member on RHOBH season 15. Kemsley posted clips of the crowd and more scenes of the trio enjoying the night with friends.

The mini-getaway comes after months of onscreen drama. Ruchards and Kemsley's once-close friendship hit a low point during season 14, largely due to Richards' ongoing issues with her estranged husband, Mauricio Umansky, and her close bond with country artist Morgan Wade.

Kemsley addressed the tension during a December 2023 episode of “Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen,” saying, “I feel like the closer she got to Morgan the further she got from me… Sorry, Kyle, I love you, but it's the truth!”

Things went from bad to worse when Kemsley found out Richards was still texting her ex, Paul “PK” Kemsley. Though Richards insisted the messages were harmless memes, she ultimately agreed to cut contact for the sake of their friendship.

In a May 2024 Amazon Live stream, Richards confirmed the two were back on good terms: “Dorit and I, thank God, we're good,” she said. “We haven't really seen each other except at Alexia's engagement dinner because of both of our schedules, but we're good. So that makes me happy.”

Kemsley shared her perspective in a 2025 Rollacoaster Magazine interview. “If you don't get things out, if you don't make things right… you're telling them that it's okay. And it's not,” she said, explaining how confronting the issues actually strengthened their bond.

A post shared by Austen Kroll (@krollthewarriorking)

According to a tip sent to Bravo and Cocktails, “Southern Charm's” Austen Kroll was also at the Surf Lodge that night. “Dorit and Austen were truly so nice and fun,” the eyewitness wrote. “Kyle and Rachel Zoe were much more reserved but also nice.”

Though Kroll didn't interact with the RHOBH women on camera, he was spotted chatting with Robert Sieber—Danielle Olivera's ex from “Summer House”—who reportedly works at the venue. There were also rumors that cameras were rolling, though it's unclear whether it was for RHOBH, “Summer House,” or just background footage for the event.

"We just kind of force the issue of just kind of engaging with each other – watching the show – and just being present," the veteran vocalist explains.

Maynard James Keenan is far from the only artist to ban phones at his live shows, and now he's expanded on the reasoning behind that decision.


	Keenan – who is best known for fronting acts such as Tool and Puscifer – has been noted for years as one of the more prominent artists to discourage the usage of phones during live performances. In fact, one of Keenan's other projects – A Perfect Circle – had previously made headlines for reportedly ejecting concert attendees who violated the request.


	“You ever go to a play or a movie?” guitarist Billy Howerdel asked in 2018. “If you've ever been to a play or a movie, it's kind of similar: you don't take out your phone and start filming, and let the people behind you stare into your screen.”

	In a new interview with the Serious Clownversation podcast, Keenan spoke to host Clownvis Presley about the apparently-divisive topic, outlining his disdain at how prominent phone usage has become at shows.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“A lot of times if you go to shows nowadays it ends up becoming the kneejerk thing, that's just what you do, it's just acceptable behavior to block somebody else's view with your phone,” he explained. 


	“It's annoying and it's distracting and the thing you're getting on your phone sucks. It's not a good representation,” he adds. “You're not gonna go home and watch it.”


	Notably, the likes of Tool and Puscifer (the latter of which are preparing for a pair of album preview shows in Los Angeles on Aug. 11) have employed a practice in their live sets in which audiences are allowed to use their phones to capture the final song. 

	











	“We just kind of force the issue of just kind of engaging with each other – watching the show – and just being present,” he explains. “Take a break from it. 


	“It's only three hours and at the end we'll let you pull out it out and you can film the last song,” he adds. “That way you have your souvenir that sucks that you're never gonna watch.”


	The topic of banning phones at gigs has been a contentious one over the years, with artists wishing for fans to live in the moment, and fans desiring a chance to memorialize their concert experiences.


	In 2015, Jack White shared a verbal plea for no phones during his Lazaretto tour, and by the time The Raconteurs toured in 2019, attendees were told to put their devices in locked Yondr pouches.


	“We think you'll enjoy looking up from your gadgets for a little while and experience music and our shared love of it in person,” a note from the band read at the time.


	More recently, Iron Maiden manager Rod Smallwood made a public plea for fans to honor the request for limited phone use, later praising those who adhered to his request and wishing those who ignored his pleas “nothing but a very sore arm.”


	Pop icon Sabrina Carpenter also sided with the topic of phone bands, telling Rolling Stone she was “absolutely” open to asking fans to pocket their devices at her shows after being turned onto the idea following a Las Vegas show from Silk Sonic.


	“I've never had a better experience at a concert,” Carpenter explained. “I genuinely felt like I was back in the Seventies — wasn't alive. Genuinely felt like I was there. Everyone's singing, dancing, looking at each other, and laughing. It really, really just felt so beautiful.”

After convincing the American people that Joe Biden was old, actor, director, and New York Times opinion writer George Clooney has a new mission: Convince his Jay Kelly castmates that Adam Sandler isn't “some goofy comedian.” Speaking to Vanity Fair about his latest film, Jay Kelly, Clooney talked passionately about his co-star Adam Sandler, or as Vanity Fair put it, he was “protective” of him. In Jay Kelly, Clooney plays a George-Clooney-esque movie star and The Sand Man Sandler portrays his doting manager. However, on set, when people try to treat Sandler like a “goofy comedian” because of “what his paycheck is, which is doing big goofy comedies,” Clooney takes offense. One can imagine Clooney's co-star Emily Mortimer, who co-wrote the film with director Noah Baumbach, greeting Sandler every morning with a fine “Shabadoo!”

“This film, more than any film Adam has done, shows what a beautiful, heartfelt, soulful actor he is—I kept telling the cast, ‘Don't call him Sand Man. Don't talk to him like he's just some goofy comedian. He's actually a really beautiful, wonderful actor,'” Clooney says. “Because of what his paycheck is, which is doing big goofy comedies, when he does these other, beautiful, Uncut Gems kinds of movies, it reminds people of that. He's not just a good comedian.”

We agree. It's disturbing to think that Sandler has been doing precisely the kind of work he wants to do for the last 30 years and has become a beloved star as a result of his relaxed, dare we say, “goofy” persona. But we understand what Clooney means, even if he frames it like a backhanded compliment. Clooney isn't the only one impressed by Sandler's work, particularly when he digs a little deeper into his sweet and sour archetypes, as in Punch Drunk Love and the aforementioned Gems. But Sandler doesn't do anything he doesn't want to do, and to describe the man's lifework (e.g., making goofy comedies with his friends in beautiful locations) as “his paycheck” is pretty dismissive of Sandy Wexler. Or maybe Clooney is tired of his co-star Stacy Keach constantly yelling, “What's my name? Dunkaccino!” at crafty.

"The Angels helped shape the sound of South Australia and now their legacy has a permanent place in our city's streets," said Adelaide Lord Mayor Dr Jane Lomax-Smith.

	Influential Australian rockers The Angels have been memorialized with a new mural and the naming of a laneway in their honor in the city of Adelaide.


	The group, who first formed as The Keystone Angels in 1974, were enshrined into the very geography of their hometown on Monday (Aug. 4) at a ceremony attended by Lord Mayor Dr Jane Lomax-Smith.

	“From packed pubs to festival stages, The Angels helped shape the sound of South Australia and now their legacy has a permanent place in our city's streets,” Dr Lomax-Smith said in a speech at the ceremony.


	“This honour both acknowledges rock royalty and reinforces Adelaide's global reputation as a UNESCO City of Music.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	The ceremony was also attended by the family of late vocalist Bernard “Doc” Neeson, and former singer Dave Gleeson. 


	The honor sees Adelaide officially welcome The Angels Lane (and an accompanying mural) to their maps, with the lane itself found between the City West campus of TAFE SA and local venue the Hindley Street Music Hall. 


	Plans to rename a street in the band's honor first came about in 2019 when the Adelaide City Council approved the decision. However, the original location – an unnamed private road in Gawler Place – was nixed after building owners refused the installation of a commemorative plaque and public artwork.

	











	The Angels rose to fame throughout the '70s and '80s, delivering a uniquely Australian blend of hard rock often labelled ‘pub rock.' 


	While their 1977 self-titled debut achieved little chart success upon its release, the group's 1978 album Face to Face saw them impact the Australian top 10, and even hit No. 152 on the Billboard 200 – albeit under the name Angel City and later, The Angels From Angel City.


	Their biggest North American success came about by way of 1980's Dark Room, which peaked at No. 133 on the same chart.


	In Australia, it was a different story, however. While 1984's Two Minute Warning would peak at No. 2 on the local Albums chart, it also spawned the single “Underground,” which managed to give the group their sole appearance on Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart when it reached No. 35. The following year, the group's cover of The Animals' “We Gotta Get Out of This Place” would peak at No. 7 in Australia, while they would score their sole chart-topping album in 1990 with Beyond Salvation.


	The Angels would be inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 1998, and would split just two years later. Reforming in 2008, Neeson would remain as frontman until 2011, eventually being replaced by the Screaming Jets' Dave Gleeson, who would retire from the role in 2003. Neeson would pass away in 2014, one year after longtime bassist Chris Bailey.


	While cited as an influence by the likes of Pearl Jam and Guns N' Roses, in Australia, The Angels' legacy is largely tied to the enduring success of their debut single, “Am I Ever Gonna See Your Face Again.” Though initially escaping wider chart success in 1978, a live recording in 1988 saw the track hit No. 11 in Australia –  largely thanks to the profane call-and-response chorus added in by local fans.

	











	“It wasn't a very big deal at the time but it seems to have become a big deal — that was incredible,” guitarist John Brewster told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.


	“It's just ironic that the response that's happened, which is exactly in rhythm with my rhythm guitar, it's Australian humour and I just think it's fantastic, it's a larrikin Australian,” he added. “It wouldn't happen in America.”


	In late July, “Am I Ever Gonna See Your Face Again” was voted in at No. 11 in triple j's Hottest 100 of Australian Songs poll. 


	The track beat out songs by other Adelaide acts such as Cold Chisel and Paul Kelly, who have both been honored with laneways in the South Australian capital. Other local artists to have received a similar honor include Indigenous rock outfit No Fixed Address and Hot 100-chart topper Sia Furler.

One year after a magical proposal on a beach in Mallorca, Spain, Hallmark actress Celeste Desjardins and Edmonton Oilers superstar Leon Draisaitl are married! 

The couple, both 29, married in a luxurious wedding in the south of France on August 2, 2025. The following day, Desjardins, who last starred in July 2024's “An Ice Palace Romance” with Marcus Rosner, began sharing photos and videos from their wedding guests in her Instagram Stories. 

A post shared by Offside (@offside)

Guests have been raving on social media about the wedding, held outside a gorgeous chateau in the south of France, with dinner tables set up under a canopy of trees. 

The Offside shared a video of the couple's first dance, originally posted by NHL player Connor McDavid's wife, Lauren Kyle McDavid, who served as one of Desjardins' maids of honor, according to Daily Hive. The video showed the newlyweds dancing to The Teskey Brothers' “Take My Heart.”

Actress Sarah Fisher, who's appeared in multiple Great American Family movies, was also part of the wedding party and shared multiple videos in her Stories, too. Several showed an after-party with a club scene that included bubbles, a DJ, and a neon red sign with “The Draisaitls” written out in cursive. 

“Most magical day for the most magical couple,” Fisher wrote over one photo. “i love you both so much”

Hairstylist Allison Kam posted multiple photos and a video of Desjardins posing in multiple dresses, including her low-cut champagne-colored bridal gown, during the wedding weekend. 

Guest Bonnie Ryan, who's married to Draisaitl's former Edmonton Oilers teammate Derek Ryan, also posted numerous pics and videos in her Instagram Stories from the wedding, calling it “incredible,” and noting that “every single detail was just stunning.”

A post shared by Celeste Penelope Desjardins (@celestedesjardins)

Desjardins and Draisaitl went Instagram official in June 2018, when Desjardins posted a photo of them together with a single red heart emoji. But they've been together for close to a decade. In November 2023, she posted a TikTok montage of videos of them together, captioning the post, “7 years ❤️.” 

Desjardins, who has also appeared in Hallmark's three “Flower Shop Mysteries” movies, an episode of “Good Witch,” and the 2015 Hallmark movie “Lead With Your Heart,” was born in Ontario, Canada, per IMDb. 

Draisaitl was born in Cologne, Germany, where his dad played professional hockey, according to NHL.com. The family eventually moved to Canada, where Draisaitl played in the Western Hockey League, per the website, before joining the Oilers as the No. 3 pick in the 2014 NHL draft. 

Draisaitl planned out his July 11, 2024, proposal with help from wedding event planner Christina von Hunnius, who put together a romantic scene on the beach in Spain. Florist Nadja Rothkirch was also involved and posted videos in her Instagram stories of the picturesque setting, as well as a photo that showed the proposal happened just beyond an old lighthouse overlooking the sea.

The couple will stay in Edmonton for the foreseeable future. In September, Desjardins cheered her now-husband's decision to stay with the Oilers after the team announced a historic $112 million extension deal with the star center, per ESPN.

"I won't stop performing until I die," says the 29-year-old comic, "but now I have to start thinking about, 'Is there something I'm passionate about that's new to me?'"

	When it comes to milestones in standup comedy, selling out Madison Square Garden ranks among the top, and certainly is the pinnacle when it comes to arena performances. According to the venue, there is no comprehensive list of comedians who have done so, but it is in the neighborhood of 15 — a “very small club,” as Matt Rife puts it.

	Rife performed two sold-out shows at the Garden on July 18 and 19 as part of his Stay Golden tour. To commemorate the occasion, the venue presented him with a golden ticket. (You can see it on his Facebook page).

	“If you think about the performers who have played that venue, [it's] not just sports teams, but every single one of your favorite musicians,” he raves. “And it's in New York City, where anybody can go see great shows all over the city seven nights a week, 365 days a year.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	Rife didn't just perform to sell-out crowds at the Garden. At the age of 29 — he turns 30 in September — he became the youngest comedian to do so, as well as Billboard Boxscore's top-grossing comedian for the month of June. 


	In the wake of those achievements, Rife — whose confidence is palpable — spoke to Billboard about the personal significance of the accomplishment, the lengths that is his female fans will go to get his attention, his reaction to Marc Maron‘s snipe at him and what he's planning for his second act. (Hint: he's a fan of Adam Sandler.)

	











You are the youngest comedian to sell out two nights at Madison Square Garden. Thoughts?


	A lot of times these kinds of accomplishments and accolades are hard to process in the moment, because everything has been happening so fast. A lot of the shows have broken records at venues, and I go, “Oh, that's really cool.” But not until two or three months later do I go, “Oh my god, wow, that happened.” 


	This was one of the few times that I got to be in the moment and acknowledge that, “Wow, I'm one of [very few] comedians to ever sell out Madison Square Garden.” For a standup comedian, the Garden is pretty much as big as it gets. I think only five comedians have ever played a stadium.


	When you're first starting out on an open mic, the dream is the Garden. So, to get to play it twice, sold-out, before the age of 30, it meant everything to me. I'm so grateful for my fans, my team, my friends and my family and everybody who has helped me get to this point right now. It feels very surreal. 


I can share with you another milestone. You are Billboard Boxscore's top-grossing comedian for June.


	No way. That is awesome. It didn't even feel like June was that busy of a month. That's the craziest part.


Do you still grade your shows?


	I try not to, but I do.


What grade would you give your Garden run?


	Oh, that's a tough one. I'm going to give them both an A — not A+, but A. I really had a good time at those shows, and I felt like the audience did as well. That's not always the case. Sometimes I have a good time, and I feel like the crowd didn't. Sometimes I feel like the crowd had a good time, and I didn't. 


	I mentioned this onstage – I don't know if it was a mistake or not but I did mean it — New York typically isn't my favorite place to perform. In the past, I would say I've given my shows there at most a B or B+. So, with it being the Garden, I went in with very low expectations. I thought it could go terribly if people aren't on board.

	











No pressure.


	I really had a good time. They were some of the more fun shows of the entire tour so far.


The first night you were at the Garden, you brought out Jesse McCartney to close the show. Did he perform the second night as well?


	No, just first night. He had a concert in, I think, Wisconsin the next day. He flew out just for that. He's from [Westchester,] New York. 


	I love that era of music — the early 2000s — and I'm always playing him in the car. I hit him up, and I'm like, “Yo, I'm in your hometown. I'm just curious if you happen to be around the area and want to pop in and do the Garden.” He's like, “I'm not in town, but I'd love to come by and give it a show.” He's a fan of mine, so he enjoyed watching the show as well.


So, you didn't know him prior to the show?


	No, we had never met before. On a whim, I was like, “I'm just going to hit him up.” That's the power of social media.


Speaking of social media, I was looking at your Facebook post on the Garden shows, and there were a lot of comments about the photo of the woman you're with in the photo where you both have your backs to the camera. Are you willing to share?


	Yeah, it's my girlfriend, Mariah [Morse]. I don't post a whole lot about my personal life on social media because people are absolutely insane, and at this point I try to distance your personal and professional life as much as possible.


It's funny, in the photo you posted, your hands are just above a trash can in the hallway, and someone commented that you were carrying a bucket together.


	Hilarious. I didn't see that. This is why you don't share stuff from your personal life. People's speculations are always 100% wrong.

	











A New Yorker profile of you reported that, in past years, you did so many dates that you exhausted yourself. 


	Absolutely. This tour that we're on this year and next is perfect middle ground for me. It's a cycle of one weekend on, two weekends off. I did that for a balance of maintaining somewhat of a healthy life — but also, I hate not performing. As much as I tell myself, “I need a month break,” I cannot go more than two weeks without performing. I go stir crazy creatively, energetically. 


	This pace feels like a very healthy balance to me compared to doing 40-50 shows a month for the last two years prior to that. We did [hundreds of] shows the year prior which was a very unhealthy balance. That gets to a point where you're so physically and mentally exhausted that it starts to feel like work.


	But I was performing all around the world, and we're selling out shows and breaking records at these revered theaters. Oftentimes I go back to those cities, and people are like, “We saw you last year.” I'm like, “I was here last year?” That's so disappointing for myself. I lived some of these amazing memories, and I was too tired to even enjoy them. 


When you do that many shows, do you start to get tired of the material in your set? And how do you deal with that?


	Any comedian who says they never get tired of the material is either a liar or doesn't perform enough. I try to be as present as possible. That's why I don't use a traditional microphone because it stops me from just crossing my arms and hiding behind a microphone. It forces me to walk around and use the stage. I like being as present as possible.There's nothing worse than standing up there, and the words are leaving your mouth but your brain is thinking about something else.

	











You used a Billy Idol homage for your tour poster, and I read that your grandfather introduced you to his music.


	Yeah, my grandpa put me on to classic rock as far back as I can remember. It's still my favorite genre of music. Both of my last tours have been inspired by classic musicians. I did The Doors for my Problematic Tour poster. And then this one I did Billy Idol, and I actually dyed my hair blonde for it. I've never done anything like that before. Funny how the world works out. I actually got to work with Billy on the promo he did for his current tour. I had him sign my arm, and I went straight to the tattoo shop. So now I have Billy Idol tattoo on my arm.


And he did a promo for you. I don't know if it was really your house, but says he's been living there for days.


	That was not my house. Yeah, we had five minutes to shoot my promo versus two days of shooting his. I was like, “You know what? F—k it. Let's just see if we can do something on a phone real quick.” He's the nicest, coolest guy. How he speaks, what he speaks about, the stories he had to tell. I'd love to play him in a biopic someday.


So, what happens after this tour ends?


	We're going to do a second half of this tour next year. The cities aren't out yet. We're going to tour about the same as we are this year. We're going to do international as well. Then when that tour is over at the end of next year. I probably won't do any prominent tours like this for a while. I might do a full month of shows, and I'll still be doing spots around town in whatever city I'm popping around to. 


	But the commitment of knowing I have shows in November and it's only February — I probably won't do [again] that for a very long time. I'm really looking forward to transitioning over to film and television and we have a lot of projects in the works that I'm looking forward to moving my focus towards.

	











Right. By my count, you're doing Marriage Material with Emma Roberts, Rolling Loud with Owen Wilson, the Netflix series about FTX, The Altruists, and The Escort, which is being directed by David Dobkin of Wedding Crashers fame. Did I miss anything?


	That I'm allowed to speak on? No. We've got a couple of things with Netflix. Rolling Loud is coming out at the end of this year. The project with Emma Roberts, we had to postpone due to The Altruists schedule. It's incredibly unfortunate. I'm such a huge fan of her and her work. The Altruists is an incredible limited series that's highly anticipated, and I'm very excited to do something that is not comedy. It's fully a drama, and an amazing opportunity to expand my skill set.


You're playing Ryan Salame, who's in prison for his role in that scandal. Have you met him?


	I don't know if I'm allowed to say this, but I am about to meet him. Fingers crossed. It's interesting playing somebody else, because usually it's up to the actor to make that character their own. But the directors and producers of The Altruists have been very clear that this is not a biopic series. We're trying to get as close as possible to telling the true story about how this giant scandal happened and let people know the kind of craziness that went on.


	It's wild. I don't know anything about the crypto world, and now that I've done the research, I'm like, “Oh my god.” I had no idea how many people were affected by this.


Are you looking to follow the career path of, say, Adam Sandler, where you're going to primarily do TV and film and just do standup when you feel like it?












	It's hard to say. Life is going to take me in whatever direction it wants. But if I had it my way, yeah. 


	This is the weird thing about accomplishing as much as I have by 30, including the Garden. It's like, “What do I do now?” It's the most blessed predicament I can possibly dream of. As far as standup comedy, my dreams have come true. I know it wasn't pure luck. I've worked my ass off, but it almost feels like I've hit the mark of, I could retire if I wanted to. I won't stop performing until I die, but now I have to start thinking about, is there something I'm passionate about that's new to me?  


	Yeah, the goal would be film and television, primarily film. Then doing standup whenever I feel like it — and performing with my friends as much as I can. That's one thing I love about Adam Sandler is, he's always kept that tight-knit group around him.


I was looking at the Rolling Loud cast. You've got Sexxy Red, Ty Dolla $ign, Ski Mask the Slump God, and that Slizzy superstar Henry Winkler.


	Oh, yeah man. This was a wild film experience. Working with Owen especially was a dream come true. You talk about the Mount Rushmore of comedic actors. He's somebody who made me want to get into acting, and to learn from somebody like him was another dream come true. He's the nicest, most talented guy. And the rest of the cast – they're perfect for this movie. Everybody showed up to work. A lot of the times people who aren't necessarily actors show up late because dedicating a day to acting is a pay cut for them. It's not necessarily a priority to them. It's just something where they're like, “Oh, that would be cool to do.” That wasn't the case with this movie.

	











What role you play?


	I play Owen's coworker who ends up at the festival with him and helps him find his lost son.


Are you in the music business in the movie?


	No. He and I sell furniture. We have the most boring group of people.


Since this is Billboard, who are some of your favorite music artists?


	I'm actually going to see some of them this coming weekend. Right now, I'm really listening to a lot of Red Clay Strays, Sam Barber, Zach Bryan, Morgan Wallen, Tyler Childers, Waylon Wyatt.


So, you're a big country fan.


	I really have moved towards that. To me the rap game has kind of fallen off. Classic rock is my No. 1. That's always my go-to, what's playing in the car most of the time. But I'm also a big hip-hop fan. J. Cole is probably my favorite artist of all time. But there's currently no good hip-hop music. To me, hip-hop dropped the ball so bad. Country swooped in and took all that momentum. I really am feeling this new wave of country, folk, rock kind of blend. It's beautiful. It really is music for the soul. Do you know who Sam Barber is?


I don't.


	Man, let me tell you. He's a 22-year-old kid out of Montana who puts out some of the best music I've ever heard. I don't know who hurt this kid, but his songwriting and his voice are absolutely incredible. A big shoutout to him.


Marc Maron took a swipe at you in 2023 calling you the “It Boy of s–tty comedy.” Any thoughts on that in retrospect?


	There was never a beef. He was just being a crotchety old man and I've never even met the guy. I guarantee he's never watched one of my shows, so if he wants to be bitter and angry that I get to live his dreams — yeah man, you're kind of being a d–k to somebody who might have looked up to you. I used to love to watch Marc Maron standup. 

	











	I don't have a beef with a single comedian. I am living my life, dude. What do I possibly have to complain about? I don't hate on anybody. I don't talk s–t about anybody. I'm just out here performing to the best of my ability. I play with my puppy and I hang out with my friends. I mind my own business and anybody who has a problem with that, it's clearly an internal battle.


I was watching the “MILF & Cookies” video online, and I've got to know, what's the wildest proposition you've gotten from one of your female fans? The “blowjob” tee shirt you are offered in that video was like, whoa.


	People will come to shows with tee shirts all the time that say, like, “I'll leave my husband for you” or “Matt Rife can offend me anytime.” And the propositions are all over the place, from sexual advances to gifting me jars of their hair.


Seriously? Jars of hair.


	Oh, yeah. People are nuts.

"Dead Dance" is expected to release next month, alongside Gaga's guest appearance on the Netflix show.

Lady Gaga‘s involvement in Wednesday season 2 extends beyond acting to a brand-new song, Billboard can confirm.


	Gaga is expected to release a new song titled “Dead Dance” next month, timed to her guest role on the new season, Variety was the first to report. The outlet also reported that Andrew Watt and Cirkut — who worked with Gaga on her most recent album Mayhem — are behind the new song.


Billboard has reached out to reps for Lady Gaga and Netflix for more details.

	











	Back in May, Netflix confirmed that Gaga would appear in season 2 of Wednesday, the hit series starring Jenna Ortega as Wednesday Addams, playing “the mysterious and enigmatic Rosaline Rotwood, a legendary Nevermore teacher who crosses paths with Wednesday.” The streaming service announced the news of Gaga as guest star at its Tudum fan event at the Kia Forum in Los Angeles on May 31.

	Gaga also took the stage at the event for a Wednesday-themed set that had her emerging from a coffin with a lid that read “HERE LIES THE MONSTER QUEEN.” She performed the on-theme Mayhem tracks “Zombieboy” and “Abracadabra” before returning to her coffin, and the middle of her mini-set included a dance performance to The Cramps' “Goo Goo Muck,” inspired by the viral dance scene from Wednesday‘s first season.


	Back in 2022, fans inspired by the Wednesday scene uploaded videos of themselves performing the dance to TikTok and other platforms, but many Little Monsters swapped out the audio of “Goo Goo Muck” with a sped-up version of Gaga's “Bloody Mary” — including the pop star herself after she caught onto the trend. Gaga's association to the show now continues with the season 2 acting role and new song.

	











	According to Variety, a music video will also be released for the song in September as well. Last month, it was reported that Gaga was spotted with Wednesday director Tim Burton on the Island of the Dolls, south of Mexico City, but there's no word whether that is related to the new song or video.


	The first Wednesday season 2 episodes arrive (naturally) on Wednesday to Netflix. A second batch is due Sept. 3, which will seemingly include Gaga's appearance on the show.

The New Orleans rapper was first charged in 2023 with being a felon in possession of a firearm. 


													By
												

	Rachel Scharf



	New Orleans rapper Boosie Badazz has accepted a plea deal in his federal gun possession case, telling fans via social media that he's “tired of fighting.”


	Boosie (Torence Hatch) announced the plea agreement on Monday (Aug. 4), more than two years after he was first charged with illegal gun ownership in San Diego. The case was briefly dismissed in 2024, but federal prosecutors later refiled the charges.


	“JUST ACCEPTED A PLEA FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON MY GUN CASE,” Boosie posted on X. “I THOUGHT THIS CASE WAS OVER N I WAS GOING TO GET ON WITH MY LIFE BUT ‘GOD DONT MAKE MISTAKES' N IM TIRED OF FIGHTING!!”

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	“TALKED TO MY FAMILY N THIS IS THE RIGHT DECISION,” continued Boosie, adding the “100” emoji. “TO ALL MY FANS ACROSS THE WORLD SAY A PRAYER FOR YA BOY N GO GET THE NEW ALBUM.”


	The rapper ended his X post with the prayer emoji and the hashtag “#wordsofarealone,” referring to his 13-song album Words of a Real One that dropped on Friday (Aug. 1).




	A Monday entry on Boosie's court docket confirmed that a plea agreement has, in fact, been reached in the case, with a hearing scheduled for Aug. 26. Terms of the deal, including what exactly Boosie will plead guilty to, have not yet been made public.


	Boosie was first charged in June 2023 with being a felon in possession of a firearm. Authorities spotted the rapper with a handgun tucked into his waistband in an Instagram video — a crime, prosecutors alleged, because Boosie was previously convicted on drug charges back in 2011.


	A federal judge dismissed the case in July 2024 due to evolving Second Amendment precedent around whether nonviolent felons can be charged with this type of gun possession. But prosecutors refiled the case with some changes later that same month, and it was proceeding apace before the plea agreement was reached.


	Boosie is currently out on a $100,000 bond.

In a recent appearance on the podcast “Pod Force One,” Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard expressed openness to the existence of extraterrestrial life, marking a notable shift in how high-level U.S. officials address unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs). Gabbard, who assumed her role amid controversy over her past statements on foreign policy, suggested that the vastness of the universe makes alien life plausible, though she stopped short of endorsing conspiracy theories. “I believe there may be aliens,” she stated, according to a report in the New York Post, while emphasizing the need for rigorous intelligence analysis.

This comment comes at a time when public interest in UAPs has surged, fueled by declassified government reports and whistleblower testimonies. Gabbard also touched on the mysterious drone sightings over New Jersey, admitting she has “a lot of questions” and calling for transparency without jumping to conclusions about their origins. Her stance aligns with broader intelligence community efforts to demystify such incidents, even as skeptics question whether her views could influence national security priorities.

Gabbard's Evolving Public Persona on Unexplained Phenomena

Gabbard's remarks build on her earlier commitments during her confirmation process. In January 2025, she pledged to address UAPs and “anomalous health incidents” if appointed, as highlighted in posts on X from users like Steven Greenstreet, who noted her intent to prioritize these issues. This positions her as a potential advocate for disclosure within the Trump administration, contrasting with previous DNIs who often downplayed such topics.

Industry insiders in defense and intelligence circles see this as part of a larger pattern in Gabbard's career, where she has challenged establishment narratives. A deep dive into her background reveals a history of unconventional views, from her criticism of U.S. interventions abroad to her spiritual beliefs as a practicing Hindu, which have drawn scrutiny. For instance, Religion News Service reported on attacks against her faith, drawing parallels to historical smears against figures like John F. Kennedy.

Intersections with Intelligence Controversies

Recent news underscores the tensions surrounding Gabbard's tenure. She has been embroiled in debates over declassified documents related to the Trump-Russia investigation, with AP News noting her claims of an Obama-era “hoax” lack backing from those files. Critics, including ex-CIA agents quoted in The Guardian, accuse her of misrepresenting intelligence to fit political narratives.

On the UAP front, Gabbard's openness resonates with proponents like Michael Salla, whose X posts suggest she could push for releasing info on mystery drones and non-human intelligence. This echoes sentiments in a Conservative Treehouse analysis, where she is portrayed as a truth-seeker amid bureaucratic opacity.

Implications for National Security and Public Trust

For intelligence professionals, Gabbard's comments raise questions about balancing speculation with evidence-based reporting. Her role in the President's Daily Briefing means her views on aliens could shape executive decisions, potentially accelerating UAP investigations. However, as The Atlantic explored in a January 2025 profile, her “switchbacking political career” driven by ambition might undermine credibility.

Public sentiment on X reflects divided opinions, with some hailing her as a disclosure hero and others dismissing her as promoting fringe ideas. Meanwhile, ongoing drone incidents in New Jersey, detailed in recent Times of India coverage, highlight the real-world stakes, where misattribution could escalate tensions.

Looking Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities

As DNI, Gabbard faces pressure to integrate UAP analysis into broader threat assessments, especially with global powers like Russia and China advancing their own aerial technologies. Her podcast appearance, while casual, signals a willingness to engage the public directly, a tactic that could rebuild trust eroded by past secrecy.

Ultimately, whether Gabbard's beliefs on aliens lead to substantive policy changes remains uncertain. Insiders note that her approach might encourage more whistleblowers, but it risks politicizing intelligence. As debates continue, her tenure could redefine how America confronts the unknown, blending skepticism with curiosity in an era of rapid technological change.

In the quest to understand our place in the cosmos, scientists have long pondered the potential for contact with extraterrestrial civilizations. While popular imagination often turns to television or radio broadcasts as humanity's calling card to the stars, recent research suggests a different introduction. Airport radar systems, particularly those used for military purposes, may inadvertently reveal Earth's existence to alien observers. This discovery raises intriguing questions about how we may unknowingly communicate our presence across the galaxy.

Astronomers have identified the radio emissions from airport radar systems as the most potent signals emanating from Earth. These signals, detectable up to 1,200 trillion miles away, could potentially be picked up by extraterrestrial civilizations equipped with radio astronomy technology akin to our own. With over 40,000 airports worldwide, the collective output of civilian and military radar systems is immense.

Although not all airports possess radar capabilities, those that do contribute to a formidable signal strength estimated at 2 x 1015 watts. This energy, primarily directed skyward to monitor air traffic, propagates into space, offering a glimpse of our technological footprint to any advanced observers. Military radars, even more powerful and directional, further accentuate this potential contact. Their concentrated beams sweep the sky, producing a distinct technological signature that could unmistakably indicate artificial origin to extraterrestrial eyes.

“We Finally Found the Missing Link” as US Scientists Unlock Breakthrough That Could Trigger a New Era of Next-Gen Nuclear Reactors



The central inquiry of this research is whether an extraterrestrial civilization with similar radio detection capabilities could intercept these signals. Astrophysicist Ramiro Caisse Saide, from the University of Manchester, seeks to demonstrate this possibility in his recent work presented at the Royal Astronomical Society's 2025 national astronomy meeting. “Civilizations can emit signals unintentionally,” he notes. “We aim to understand if technologically equipped civilizations could detect these involuntary emissions we constantly generate.”

Previous research by Saide indicates that mobile phone relay antennas could be detected up to 60 trillion miles away. Airport radars reach even greater distances, making them particularly intriguing for studying unintentional transmissions. The implications of these findings challenge us to reconsider how we might be perceived by potential cosmic neighbors.

To refine their hypothesis, researchers simulated how our radar emissions would appear from various nearby stars. They discovered that the signal's strength varies depending on the geographical distribution of Earth's radars and the direction from which a star observes our planet. For instance, Proxima Centauri, our closest stellar neighbor at about 25 trillion miles away, could theoretically intercept our radar signals under certain observational angles.

Even at a distance of 1,200 trillion miles, a sphere encompassing approximately 120,000 stars, each a potential host to habitable planets, could be within range. “The SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) employs scientific approaches to assess whether we are alone in the Universe,” Saide explains. “My goal is to determine if an extraterrestrial civilization with similar capabilities could detect our radio emissions.” Meanwhile, the James-Webb Space Telescope continues to explore signs of extraterrestrial life.

The potential for airport radar systems to serve as inadvertent beacons to alien civilizations prompts a reevaluation of our cosmic activities. This revelation underscores the far-reaching consequences of our technological advancements. It also highlights the importance of understanding how our emissions might be perceived from afar. As we continue to explore the universe, these discoveries urge us to consider the broader implications of our actions and their potential impact on the search for extraterrestrial life.

Moreover, this research invites reflection on our role as stewards of Earth and our technological signatures. The possibility of being observed by distant civilizations challenges us to think about how we represent ourselves to the cosmos. As we advance technologically, how do we balance progress with the potential for unintended cosmic communication?

As we contemplate the potential for contact with extraterrestrial civilizations, the role of airport radar systems in this cosmic dialogue cannot be ignored. These findings invite deeper consideration of how we might present ourselves to the universe, both intentionally and inadvertently. What steps should humanity take to ensure that our signals convey the right message to any listening neighbors among the stars?

With a prison transfer, Justice Department meeting and possible congressional testimony, Trump faces scrutiny from his own base.

Late last month, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) asked the courts to unseal grand jury transcripts in the case against Ghislaine Maxwell, the imprisoned former girlfriend and associate of deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

The request was an attempt to calm the furore after the DOJ announced in June that it would not release any additional documents from the investigation into the high-profile sex trafficker.









Judges asked lawyers for Maxwell, Epstein and their victims to respond to the court by Tuesday regarding their positions on the release of the documents.

As the deadline arrives and judges consider whether to grant the DOJ's request, we look at who Maxwell is and what the case is about.

Maxwell, the daughter of the late British media baron, Robert Maxwell, is the only Epstein associate who was convicted in connection with his activities.

A former girlfriend of Epstein who later became his business associate, Maxwell was found guilty in December 2021 of helping Epstein sexually abuse teenage girls. She was sentenced to 20 years in prison.

At her trial, four women testified that Maxwell groomed them as teenagers to participate in sexual acts with Epstein and sometimes participated in the abuse.

She was ultimately found guilty on five of six counts: sex trafficking of minors, conspiracy to entice a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors.

Epstein himself faced federal charges related to sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy.

Conspiracy theories have long swirled around Epstein's influence and his death. The wealthy financier, whose high-profile friends included current US President Donald Trump and powerful figures on both the liberal and conservative sides of the political spectrum, was found dead in his jail cell in August 2019 before he could stand trial.

While his death was ruled a suicide, many prominent figures in Trump's MAGA (Make America Great Again) movement have long doubted that narrative, insisting – without firm evidence – that Epstein might have been killed to stop him from revealing the identities of some of his clients.

Some government officials appointed by Trump in his second term, including FBI Director Kash Patel, have previously fanned the flames of those conspiracy theories.

In February, Attorney General Pam Bondi said an Epstein client list was “sitting on my desk right now to review”, adding that she was following a directive from Trump to look at the files.

But in July, Bondi's Justice Department issued a memo concluding that there was no client list and the financier had died by suicide – an apparent turnaround that sparked calls for Bondi's resignation from parts of the MAGA movement.

Trump initially tried to dismiss that response from his support base and then tried to portray the criticism his administration was facing as orchestrated by opposition Democrats to distract from his supposed achievements as president.

But the pressure hasn't let up. The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump had written a birthday note to Epstein in 2003 with the implication that the two knew each other better than the president has let on.

Trump denied writing the letter and has sued the newspaper and the author of the article. But amid the mounting scrutiny, he also ordered Bondi to seek the release of all grand jury testimony in the Epstein case.

Still, scrutiny over his administration's actions has only grown. Last week, Maxwell was moved to an all-women federal prison camp after a meeting with a senior DOJ official.

In 2024, a court unsealed about 950 pages of documents that included the names of several public figures who had known Epstein well. The presence of their names on the documents does not in itself imply any wrongdoing – although some have faced accusations that they sexually exploited women.

Some of the most prominent figures in the documents include:

The documents could show the information that the grand jury had before it while deliberating the case. Bondi's DOJ said in a filing that the transcripts contain nothing that is not already known publicly.

It could help Trump and his team beat back accusations from the president's base that they have anything to hide.

The House of Representatives Oversight Committee subpoenaed Maxwell in late July, seeking her deposition on Monday. Maxwell's lawyer has said she is willing to testify before Congress.

But the committee has since said it is willing to postpone Maxwell's deposition while the Supreme Court decides whether to take up her appeal against her 2021 conviction.

Volume 1 of the vampire crime saga arrives September 30 and explores a world where demi-humans fight for survival and peace.

The demi-human crime saga Gran Familia is hitting shelves on September 30, 2025, from Titan Manga, and pre-orders are open now.

Set in a world where super-powered beings—like vampires, werewolves, and other demi-humans—must hide from human persecution, Gran Familia introduces a dark society on the edge of collapse. At the center is the legendary Grand Familia, a vampire clan that rules the criminal underworld with an iron grip. But as rival factions stir unrest, violent turf wars erupt, revealing that the clan's dominance is far from secure.

The story follows Leo, the young heir to the Grand Familia. Idealistic and burdened by his bloodline, Leo dreams of a future where humans and demi-humans can coexist peacefully. But when the fragile peace between the two worlds shatters, Leo is thrust into a brutal conflict where betrayal, shifting alliances, and impossible choices become his new reality.

Here's the official synopsis from Titan Manga:

Dive into Gran Familia, where powerful vampire clans, hidden demi-humans, and a dangerous turf war collide in a dark, action-packed battle for supremacy. Perfect for fans of supernatural crime thrillers.

In Gran Familia Volume 1, the delicate balance between humans and demi-humans teeters on the edge of collapse. In a world where super-powered beings—like vampires, werewolves, and other demi-humans—are forced to hide from human persecution, the legendary Grand Familia vampire clan controls the criminal underworld with an iron fist. But their reign is far from unchallenged.

Leo, the young heir to the Grand Familia, dreams of a future where both humans and demi-humans can coexist peacefully. However, when a violent turf war erupts between rival factions, the fragile peace between the two worlds is shattered, and Leo is thrust into a dangerous conflict that could have devastating consequences for everyone involved.

With each faction seeking dominance, the underworld becomes a battleground of supernatural forces, where loyalty is tested, and the line between right and wrong becomes increasingly blurred. Amidst the chaos, Leo faces the most pressing question of all: can peace truly be achieved, or is war the inevitable price of survival?

Volume 1 kicks off a thrilling saga packed with action, suspense, family drama, and moral ambiguity. It's a must-read for fans of dark fantasy, supernatural thrillers, and character-driven narratives.

Ahead of Gran Familia‘s release, Titan Manga has shared a preview especially for Comics Beat readers:

Hillary Clinton had Jeffrey Epstein killed. Barack Obama was not born in the United States. The pharmaceutical industry was responsible for the spread of COVID-19.

These are all conspiracies with no basis in fact, says University of Ottawa professor Daniel Stockemer — but his research shows that theories like them are gaining traction among young people. 

In fact, people younger than 35 are more likely to believe in conspiracy theories than other age groups, according to a recent study by Stockemer and co-author Jean-Nicolas Bordeleau that surveyed more than 380,000 people internationally.

The research was recently published in the journal Political Psychology.

"Conspiracy theories are now for everyone," Stockemer told CBC Radio's All In A Day, noting that between 20 and 25 per cent of the population believes in one. 

"But the young are slightly more likely to believe in them."

For example, their research suggests a slight year-over-year drop in conspiracies to the point where an 80-year-old is about 10 per cent less likely to believe one than an 18-year-old.

If the problem isn't addressed, Stockemer said he expects the "democratic backsliding" he's seen all over the world to continue.

"If we don't have a young population that stands up for the values of democracy ... who else will?"

There are many reasons why young people are particularly susceptible, Stockemer said — including the fact the political world has become more divided and chaotic.

"Right now, we're in a world of polarization," he said. "There is no compromise, no middle ground." 

Compounding that effect, Stockemer said, is that young people are being "alienated" from politics as mainstream politicians largely ignore their concerns — including during the last federal election.

"The leaders didn't even come to the [University of Ottawa] to have a talk or anything," he said. "And then we wonder why young people have a higher tendency to go the populist or conspiracies route."

Then there's technological leaps like the internet, smart phones and social media, Stockemer said, which allow conspiracy and misinformation to spread, especially among young people.

The internet also potentially exposes them to every unfortunate incident that happens in the world, said Carmen Celestini, who teaches at the University of Waterloo and studies disinformation, extremists and conspiracy theorists.

"That fear and that perpetual sense of disaster can lead people to believe in conspiracy theories," said Celestini, noting she wasn't surprised "even a little bit" by Stockemer and Bordeleau's findings.

Influencers who tote extremist views and conspiracies also give their viewers someone or something to blame, she added.

Widespread conspiracies and the problems inherent to the internet will require a "global response," said Celestini, one that will involve talking about the fears and emotions that led people to these conclusions.

"It really is [about] having that transparent talk with your child about what it is that they're feeling, why they might believe some of these ideas and where the emotions behind it come from," she said.

Stockemer said there's no "quick fix," but improving civic education and better regulating misinformation online would help.

"To bring [young people] back, we need to also include them within the democratic politics much more than now," he said.

And there could be immense consequences, he added, if we continue to neglect the susceptibility of young people to conspiracy theories.

"Over the past 10 years, the number of democracies has declined [and] long-standing democracies like the United States [and] India are in serious danger of falling," he said.

"If we continue the path we are continuing, I don't know how long some established democracies will survive. … And I think that's one of the far-reaching lessons from my research."

If you grew up during the 1990s, you probably remember the metallic tang and slight buzz you got when you touched the metal tip of a battery with your tongue. It was a silly but very popular trend among kids back in those days, and  Dutch snack brand Rewind is betting that nostalgia or pure curiosity will draw a lot of people to its new 9-volt battery-flavored tortilla chips. Recreating that childish experience in a way that leaves the chips palatable must have been very challenging, but Rewind assures everyone that no battery components were used in the making of its unusual snack, clarifying that all the ingredients are entirely safe and food-grade.

“It was definitely an unusual brief,” Mattias Larsson, chef and flavourist at Rewind, admitted. “We used a blend of citric acid and sodium bicarbonate to create the tongue-tingling effect, and balanced it out with mineral salts, which give the chips a metallic tang. The result is surprisingly tasty, and it's definitely a flavor that sparks curiosity.”

“Rewind is a brand inspired by nostalgia, so we thought what better way to launch but with one of the most nostalgic shared experiences — a delicious tribute to a weird universal memory that tastes just like those careless teenage afternoons,” Antti Lauronen, the head of creative and design at Paulig, added.

Rewind trtilla chips are currently only available in the Netherlands, but the company is planning a quick expansion into the European market, so you might get a chance to experience 9-volt battery flavor chips sooner than you think.

Home - News - More space for aliens: new theory expands the boundaries of extraterrestrial life

Oleksandr Fedotkin

Author of news and articles

Researchers from The Center for Astrophysics and Space Sciences at New York University in Abu Dhabi has proposed a new theory, that expands the search for extraterrestrial life forms. 

The search for living organisms outside the Earth is mainly focused on in the so-called “Goldilocks Zone” — planets whose distance from their parent stars allows them to have liquid water and enough energy to support the existence of living organisms. However, a new study suggests that life may exist on cold worlds far from stars.

According to the researchers, cosmic rays — high-speed streams of particles, that pierce the universe, can carry enough energy to sustain life. These rays penetrate deep into the interior of planets and reach underground water reservoirs. They split water particles, releasing electrons in a process known as radiolysis.

Some microorganisms on Earth known for their ability to live in extremely cold conditions in the absence of sunlight. It is through radiolysis that they maintain their existence.

If, as the study results show, extraterrestrial life forms are able to survive through radiolysis, scientists may have to revise the definition of areas of residence.

The researchers conducted computer modeling to determine, how different levels of cosmic ray exposure can change the conditions on the surface of Mars, one of Saturn's moons, Enceladus, and Jupiter's moon Europa. Astrophysicists sought to find out whether cosmic rays could cause radiolysis on the satellites of Saturn and Jupiter, as it is believed that under the thick layer of ice there may be oceans of liquid water.

Scientists have found, that Enceladus is the most promising candidate for sustaining life through radiolysis. The results of the study demonstrated that Mars, Enceladus, and Europa can support a certain level of radiolysis. The researchers suggest that other astrophysicists expand the definition of the zone residence, calling this larger area “radiolithic populated area”. 

“This discovery is changing our understanding of where life can exist Instead of looking only for warm planets with sunlight, we can now consider cold and dark places, provided there is water beneath the surface and they are exposed to cosmic rays. Life may exist in more places than we could have ever imagined”, — explains the study's lead author, Dimitrа Atri. 

The results of the study are published in the journal International Journal of Astrobiology
