                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NBA icon Magic Johnson was quick to congratulate Washington Spirit star Trinity Rodman after the U.S. Women's National Team forward scored a last-gasp winner in her first NWSL appearance in four months. Rodman, 23, who had been sidelined since April, dealing with lingering back issues, came on as a late substitute for the Spirit against the Portland Thorns on Sunday with the game tied at 1-1. Rodman immediately burst into tears as she was swarmed by thrilled teammates in front of an ecstatic fanbase at Audi Field. In a post on social media, the NBA Hall of Famer wrote, "Welcome back superstar Trinity Rodman! Congratulations on scoring the game winning goal for our Washington Spirit in a 2-1 victory over the Portland Thorns. The entire National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) has missed you!" Another sporting star to celebrate Rodman's heroic return was, of course, her partner and World No. Unable to attend the game as he was in Toronto for the National Bank Open, Shelton beat Italian Flavio Cobolli in three sets to reach the quarter-finals, for what was his 100th career ATP Tour win. The 22-year-old was later asked whether his win or Rodman's goal was the day's standout accomplishment, to which he responded, "I think Trinity Rodman scoring a goal. It's pretty cool, especially [because] she was emotional. After the game, a clearly emotional Rodman was interviewed on the pitch by ESPN, commenting, “Holy cow, that was just the hardest thing I've had to go through with injury and everything. I'm just really happy to be back.” Rodman later explained how this latest injury setback presented her with "a lot of unknowns," but thankfully, now, she's on the other side. "It may have looked like it was back, but there's still a lot of things I need to work on." Rodman's game-winning goal means the Spirit head into their next game on Saturday against Gotham FC third in the NWSL with 26 points - tied with the second placed Orlando Pride.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid has used its official television channel to protest the league's refusal to delay their LaLiga debut beyond Tuesday, August 19. The televised protest was based on a statement by legal expert Miguel García Caba, a member of Spain's Commission on Integrity and Anti-Corruption in Sport and Transparency International. García Caba's written complaint stated: “This wasn't a decision; it was a slam of the door. A slam in the face of sports medicine, basic logic, and competition integrity. The protest was sparked by the Spanish Football Federation's Competition Judge denying Real Madrid's request to postpone their opening match against Osasuna. Applying the rules as a hammer for some and a red carpet for others is not integrity—it's control. Real Madrid TV endorsed García Caba's statement point by point, claiming the club was being placed at a disadvantage compared to key LaLiga rivals like Barcelona and Atlético Madrid. LaLiga president Javier Tebas quickly fired back via social media, offering a blunt rebuttal to both García Caba and Real Madrid. “This isn't about your personal interpretation of integrity,” Tebas wrote on X (formerly Twitter). “If it were, you'd be concerned that Chelsea, also a Club World Cup finalist, finished later than Real Madrid and still starts two days earlier in the Premier League. Arne Slot identifies Trent Alexander-Arnold replacement at Liverpool after Real Madrid move He continued: “Miguel, your ‘article'—if we can even call it that—has as much legal substance as I have love for curling. But we all know it's bent when convenient. Or are you implying that the Competition Judge should commit misconduct by interpreting the rules to please your so-called ‘Supreme Being'?” Includes: every MLS game and Leagues Cup Even though he's on loan from Manchester United, Rashford is embracing the challenge of playing at Barcelona. His mindset is centered on giving everything this season and helping the team aim for the UEFA Champions League. As Real Madrid enters a new era stacked with elite talents like Kylian Mbappe, Vinicius Junior, and Jude Bellingham, it might surprise some to learn that the player tipped to succeed Lionel Messi as Argentina's next great No. 10 is not one of the club's global superstars. Santos star Neymar has made headlines again, not just for his two-goal performance in a 3-1 win over Juventude, but also for completing an elusive and symbolic milestone.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A standout performance can launch a career into superstardom, but for some, that single tournament is as good as it gets. These are the players who became household names for a few glorious weeks, capturing the imagination of fans with their skill, passion, and goals, only to recede from the global spotlight afterward. Here are of the most memorable one-tournament wonders in World Cup history. Russian striker Oleg Salenko etched his name in the record books by scoring an incredible five goals in a single match against Cameroon at the 1994 World Cup. This feat, combined with a penalty in another game, made him the tournament's joint Golden Boot winner. However, his international career was brief, and he never reached that level of performance again. Known as "Totò," Schillaci was a late inclusion for Italy's squad at the 1990 World Cup. He came on as a substitute in the first match and scored, sparking a run of six goals that saw him win both the Golden Boot and Golden Ball awards. However, he struggled with injuries and lost his form shortly after, scoring just one more goal for the national team. Fabio Grosso's performance in 2006 was the stuff of legend. He was a hero in that tournament but remained a more understated figure in the years that followed. At 38 years old, Roger Milla came out of retirement to represent Cameroon in the 1990 World Cup. He scored four iconic goals and celebrated with his famous corner flag dance, leading the Indomitable Lions to the quarter-finals. He scored three goals and was the team's talisman. However, he is perhaps most remembered for his dramatic penalty miss in the final minute against Uruguay, which would have sent Ghana to the semifinals. His career never again reached such international heights. He earned a high-profile move to Real Madrid, but his club career struggled to meet those expectations, and he has since bounced around several different clubs. Dutch coach Louis van Gaal made a legendary substitution in the 2014 quarterfinal, bringing on Tim Krul for the penalty shootout. Krul saved two penalties, becoming an instant hero. However, he was quickly relegated back to a backup role with the national team and is mostly remembered for that single, high-stakes moment. He scored an astonishing 13 goals in just six matches, a record that still stands. Unfortunately, his career was cut short by a serious leg injury just four years later, preventing him from ever competing in another World Cup. A World Cup winner with Brazil in 2002, Rogerio Ceni is known for his remarkable career as a goalscoring goalkeeper. He scored more than 100 goals for São Paulo, making him a legend in Brazil. However, he was a backup to Dida in 2002 and never appeared in a World Cup game, making his trophy win the extent of his World Cup glory.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Los Blancos had agreed to sign the teenage sensation when he was just 16 after he impressed playing for a Brazilian side, Palmeiras. In his first season in a elite shirt, Endrick struggled to get on the field under head coach Carlo Ancelotti. He featured in 37 games, starting just eight, with five of those coming in the Copa del Rey. He started three games in La Liga, scoring once. With the lack of game time, he was expected to go out on loan, and reportedly he nearly did this summer. According to Arancha Rodríguez on El Partidazo de COPE, Endrick was very close to joining La Liga side Real Sociedad on loan for the upcoming season. Star forward Kylian Mbappe went down with an illness before the first game in the United States. However, it was another young player, Gonzalo Garcia, who got the nod, and he took the opportunity. The loan move would have done Edrick good, which could have given him more opportunities to get on the field. Endrick could be loaned out in January once he recovers from his injury. He could also work his way back into Alonso's plans before then. Will Real Madrid Sign Any More Players in the Summer Transfer Window?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The European Championship is a pan-European continental tournament, while the World Cup has teams from all continents. Those are two soccer tournaments that have similarities and differences. To begin with, the structures of both competitions are similar. Both are held every four years and contain group stages of four teams, followed by the finals. Likewise, in both, the top two finishers progress into a knockout stage. Some third-place teams can also make it through in the European Championships, and it will be the same in the FIFA World Cup from 2026. Minnows like Trinidad and Tobago, Panama, Qatar (automatically qualified), Zaire, El Salvador, North Korea, and Bolivia have made it to the main event, and many such lowly-ranked teams get thrashed. African nations have improved, but have sometimes provided easy ammunition in the finals for the Europeans. For example, Yugoslavia hammered Zaire 9-0 in the 1974 World Cup. While it might seem obvious to suggest that the World Cup is harder to win, the Euro championship does not include such easy teams in the group stages. There is no doubt that 9-0 scorelines never happen in the Euro tournament, unlike when Germany beat Saudi-Arabia by the same scoreline in the 2002 World Cup. The flavor of European football can be more defensive, and the World Cup benefits from the Brazil and Argentina teams with great forward players. Greece won the Euros with numerous 1-0 wins. They did not attack so much, but were very organized and difficult to beat. It was getting men behind the ball tactics that worked a treat. For they do not, with the likes of Holland and Portugal providing fantastic attacking players. Yet, there is a bigger defensive trend in European soccer. For Brazil, and South American soccer more generally, there has always been a bigger emphasis on flair, creativity, and an attacking mindset. Seldom have we ever seen European teams match that, but the 1954 Hungarian side was one of the closest matches. Both tournaments provide top-notch football (from the best sides at least). The European Championships miss the South American soccer stars, such as Messi, Pelé, Maradona, Neymar, and co. If you enjoyed this article, subscribe to our newsletter here.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea finished the season really strong, putting together a strong run to get into the Champions League. Since then, they've signed some really promising players. Everyone who supports the club is feeling good and confident, but on the London is Blue podcast they had some words of warning about overconfidence. “What I'm worried about is that it's 50 games on top of however many this summer, on top of however many last season,” presenter Brandon Busbee said. “Going to the Conference League final and that. And you've got players like Enzo, Cole Palmer, the other internationals, that are gonna talk to the club about making sure they're not pushing or risking too much ahead of a World Cup. We might be a victim of our own success.” Co-presenter Nick Verlaney agreed that it could be a more challenging season than some expect given the huge bubble of optimism we're all enjoying right now, post Club World Cup success: “You're gonna have to gun for at least 80 points to be in that top 3, to really be cemented up there [in the Premier League],” he pointed out. “So I think it's going to be a big jump up from 68 points to get another 12 above where we were last year, potentially. Subs can in soos as our top stars seem a little off, without the team, taking a wobble, or loses momentum. I'm excited for Chelsea, and have faith in coach to get his permutations just right, to get full points, every game we play! Your email address will not be published.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sergio Ramos has quickly become one of the standout figures at Monterrey CF, bringing his experience, quality, and leadership to the squad. Now, as Rayados look to rebound from their 2025 Liga MX Clausura round of 16 exit, they've been dealt a major blow: one of their rising stars is leaving for La Liga after a breakout performance in the FIFA Club World Cup 2025. There, in a tightly contested matchup, Rayados were narrowly eliminated by Borussia Dortmund. Real Betis have officially announced the signing of Nelson Deossa on a five-year deal running through 2030. Deossa joined Rayados in January 2025 from Pachuca for a fee of €5.8 million. He wasted no time earning a regular spot in the starting lineup and went on to register seven goals and one assist in 29 appearances, including a standout strike in the 3–0 win over Urawa Red Diamonds in the Club World Cup. Now at Real Betis, the 24-year-old will look to secure a place in the midfield under head coach Manuel Pellegrini, who is retooling after losing USMNT star Johnny Cardoso to Atletico Madrid earlier this summer. Despite playing fewer than 30 matches for Monterrey, Deossa quickly became a fan favorite, known for his energy, work ethic, and composure in the midfield. Before boarding his flight to Spain, the Colombian addressed reporters and shared a heartfelt message for the club and its supporters. So it's not about that, I'm entirely grateful and I hope everything goes well for them over there, and that I can come back in the future,” he promised, leaving the door open for a return to Rayados. After thanking head coach Domenec Torrent, Deossa sent his best wishes to the entire organization: “I hope they become champions. Monterrey will face New York Red Bulls in Matchday 2 of the 2025 Leagues Cup group stage. Find out everything you need to know about when, where, and how to watch this highly anticipated clash live in the USA. Keylor Navas completed his sensational move to Pumas UNAM, prompting comparisons with his former Real Madrid teammate Sergio Ramos' salary at Monterrey. With 5 points on the board and Messi sidelined, Inter Miami needs a strong result against Pumas UNAM to punch their ticket to the Leagues Cup quarterfinals.
