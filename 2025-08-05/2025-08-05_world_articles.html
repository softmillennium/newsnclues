Brazil's Supreme Court placed far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro under house arrest Monday in anticipation of his trial for allegedly attempting a coup following his loss in the 2022 election. The order has heightened the current government's already simmering tensions with U.S. President Donald Trump, who has imposed high tariffs on some Brazilian imports over what he calls a “witch hunt” against his ally. Bolsonaro's house arrest was ordered by Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who says the former president had violated restrictions imposed last month banning him from using social media, which he'd been using to rile up supporters to attack the Supreme Court. Trump slapped Moraes, who is presiding over Bolsonaro's trial, with Magnitsky sanctions — typically reserved for major human rights abusers — last week, which supporters of Brazil's left-wing president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva called “a direct attack on Brazilian democracy.” Brazilian journalist Brian Mier says Bolsonaro has been emboldened by Trump's support to defy Moraes' orders, assuming that threats from the U.S. would cause the judge “to back down.” The U.S. State Department's Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs issued a furious condemnation of Bolsonaro's arrest, promising to “hold accountable all those aiding and abetting sanctioned conduct.” Brazilian state police have accused Bolsonaro of going even further — allegedly enlisting military officers in a plot to assassinate Lula and forcibly retake power. Trump has nevertheless drawn parallels between his own legal struggles and those faced by Bolsonaro. “This is nothing more, or less, than an attack on a Political Opponent – Something I know much about! It happened to me, times 10,” Trump wrote last month on Truth Social. Vinicios Betiol, a geopolitics scholar from the University of Rio de Janeiro, says that “Bolsonaro and Donald Trump are plotting a coup against Brazil.” “Radical Bolsonarists,” he said, “are already talking about blocking roads, toppling power towers, and attacking the [Supreme Court].” “We want Trump to help us,” said one protester, Ricardo, who wore a red MAGA cap and declined to give his second name as he stood outside Bolsonaro's compound holding up a star-spangled banner. “They know that Bolsonaro will be convicted and have thus gone all-in,” Betiol said. As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>House oversight committee also issued subpoenas to several former attorneys general and FBI directors The House oversight committee on Tuesday issued subpoenas to Bill and Hillary Clinton as well as several former attorneys general and directors of the FBI, demanding “testimony related to horrific crimes perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein”. The investigative committee's Republican chair, James Comer, sent the subpoenas in response to two motions lawmakers approved on a bipartisan basis last month, as Congress navigated outrage among Donald Trump's supporters over the justice department's announcement that it would not release further details about Epstein, a disgraced financier who died in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking. The president and his allies have long flirted with conspiracy theories around Epstein's death in federal custody, but the justice department upended those by concluding he died by suicide and a long-rumored list of his client did not exist. In the letter to Bill Clinton, Comer noted that the former president had flown four times on Epstein's private jet, and repeated an allegation that he had “pressured” Vanity Fair not to publish sex trafficking claims regarding Epstein. The chair further says that Clinton was “allegedly close” with Ghislaine Maxwell, a British socialite serving a 20-year prison sentence after being convicted on sex trafficking charges related to Epstein. “Given your past relationships with Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell, the Committee believes that you have information regarding their activities that is relevant to the Committee's investigation,” Comer wrote. In his letter to Hillary Clinton, Comer draws a more tenuous connect, writing: “Your family appears to have had a close relationship with both Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell”. In addition to details about them, Comer notes that Clinton “may have knowledge of efforts by the federal government to combat international sex trafficking operations of the type run by Mr. Epstein”. Others who received subpoenas were given dates ranging from mid-August through early October, while US attorney general Pam Bondi has until 19 August to release documents related to the case. In addition to the subpoenas, Republican congressman Thomas Massie and Democrat Ro Khanna are collecting signatures for a discharge petition to force a vote on legislation compelling release of the Epstein files. That vote is not expected to happen until the House returns from recess in early September.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The National Weather Service has received permission to hire 450 meteorologists, hydrologists and radar technicians just months after being hit hard by Department of Government Efficiency-related cuts and early retirement incentives. The new hiring number includes 126 new positions that were previously approved and will apply to “front-line mission critical” personnel, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration official told CNN. The NWS cuts have spurred concerns over how well-prepared the country is to withstand hurricane season, which is just starting to heat up in the Atlantic. The cuts to probationary employees, as well as early retirement incentives, meant the nation's front-line weather forecasting agency's staffing levels fell by more than 550 people since the second Trump administration began, to below 4,000 total employees. CNN has reached out to NOAA for comment. Agency employees are greeting the news, unveiled at an all hands meeting on Monday, with guarded optimism and relief. Current employees have been working additional hours with additional responsibilities since the layoffs and retirements earlier this year, trying to maintain the 24/7 posture US extreme weather requires. “How much time/money is it going to cost to train a bunch of new people when we had already-trained people in place?” asked another NOAA official, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media. It is possible that some of the new hires will have been previously trained employees who were let go in the DOGE cuts. The first NOAA official said there is going to be a focus on hiring in a smart, “asymmetric” way that is “based on workload.” The NWS, aided by lawmakers on Capitol Hill, had been arguing for months for a public safety exemption from the federal hiring freeze. Direct hiring authority, according to OPM's website, can be given to federal agencies “for filling vacancies when a critical hiring need or severe shortage of candidates exists.” It can help speed up the hiring process, the NOAA official said.</p>

If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size. According to initial unconfirmed reports, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has briefed “friendly journalists” that he has ordered the Israeli army to “conquer Gaza” in the face of opposition from the army's Chief of Staff, Eyal Zamir. The ceasefire was supported by Israeli army officials, while the decision to reoccupy Gaza is favored by the hardline ministers like National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who are key allies in Prime Minister Netanyahu's rightwing coalition and are credited with playing an influential role in sustaining the ongoing Israeli onslaught. Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day. Zamir's message to the cabinet came amid Israel's announcement last week of the end of its latest military offensive in Gaza, dubbed Operation Gideon's Chariots, while one of Israel's cabinet members, Zeev Elkin, threatened to “annex parts of Gaza” as a “pressure tool” against Hamas in ceasefire negotiations. On Friday, Witkoff met families of Israeli captives in Tel Aviv, where he reaffirmed U.S. efforts to reach a ceasefire deal, without giving any details on the progress of the talks. Witkoff said that Hamas was considering giving up its weapons, while the resistance group responded in a statement saying that it would only lay down its arms after the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. Before going to Tel Aviv, Witkoff spent five hours at one of the centers of the controversial U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). Following his visit to one of the GHF sites, he said that there is hardship and shortage, but “no starvation” in Gaza. On Monday, a group of 17 international human rights organizations responded to Witkoff's claims in a joint statement, saying that the US envoy had “totally ignored the facts on the ground,” stating that “evidence can't be erased with statements,” and “starvation in Gaza is real and has already claimed the lives of 159 people including 90 children which is a documented number that reflects the size of the crime that can not be justified or denied.” During Witkoff's visit, Hamas's armed wing released video footage of an emaciated Israeli captive suffering from starvation and severe malnutrition, who said in the video that he hadn't eaten in several days.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A former NFL player has been convicted for running an operation that bred and trafficked “grand champion” dogs and their offspring for dogfighting, the Department of Justice said. LeShon Johnson, 54, a former running back for the Green Bay Packers, Arizona Cardinals and New York Giants, was convicted by a federal jury in Oklahoma on six felony counts of violating the federal Animal Welfare Act's prohibitions against “possessing, selling, transporting, and delivering animals to be used in fighting ventures,” the department said. “My client respects the verdict,” defense attorney Courtney Jordan told CNN, noting Johnson was convicted of only six of 23 counts. He was acquitted on 17 counts of possessing a dog for use in an animal fighting venture, court records show. “The jury saw there is more to this story than what the government has made it out to be. He was never involved in dogfighting himself, per se,” Jordan said. Johnson's conviction recalls the 2007 federal case against then-NFL quarterback Michael Vick, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy involving illegal dogfighting. Admitting he participated in killing dogs and ran a business that involved illegal gambling, Vick was sentenced to 23 months in prison. After his 2009 release, he advocated against dogfighting, returned to the NFL and now coaches a college team. While dogfighting is a felony in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, more than 40,000 people participate in enterprises that breed, condition and train dogs to be “placed in a pit to fight each other for spectator entertainment and profit,” the Humane Society of the United States and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals say. In Johnson's case, “the American government is really after the American pit bull terrier, and that's what LeShon Johnson was breading,” his lawyer said. Johnson had a 2004 state conviction for dogfighting, the Justice Department said. “This criminal profited off of the misery of innocent animals and he will face severe consequences for his vile crimes,” Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement. “This case underscores the Department of Justice's commitment to protecting animals from abuse – 190 dogs are now safe thanks to outstanding collaborative work by our attorneys and law enforcement components.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two people have died and at least 58 have been sickened amid an outbreak of legionnaires' disease in the Harlem area of New York City, according to health officials. Details about those who have died are not immediately available, but officials have tracked the outbreak since 25 July in the central Harlem area and bordering communities. A statement from the acting New York City health commissioner, Dr Michelle Morse, said people in the affected area who are experiencing flu-like symptoms “should contact a healthcare provider as soon as possible”. “Legionnaires' disease can be effectively treated if diagnosed early, but New Yorkers at higher risk, like adults aged 50 and older and those who smoke or have chronic lung conditions, should be especially mindful of their symptoms and seek care as soon as symptoms begin,” Morse's statement added. Legionnaires' disease is a type of pneumonia caused by the bacteria legionella, which grows in warm water. According to the New York City health department, “Legionnaires' disease can be caused by plumbing systems where conditions are favorable for legionella growth, such as cooling towers, whirlpool spas, hot tubs, humidifiers, hot water tanks and evaporative condensers of large air-conditioning systems.” The disease cannot be transmitted person to person but can be contracted from breathing water vapor with the bacteria.

An estimated 8,000 to 18,000 people in the US are hospitalized for legionnaires' disease each year, and it has a fatality rate of 10%.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Report into fatal disaster found company fired staff to stop them from raising safety concerns OceanGate's chief executive “completely ignored” safety inspections in the run-up to the Titan submarine implosion, which killed all five people on board. A report into the disaster found that OceanGate's cultural and safety practices were “critically flawed” and that the company used “intimidation tactics” to avoid proper scrutiny. It singled out Stockton Rush, the company's chief executive, who was accused of creating a “false sense of safety” for passengers by misrepresenting the submersible as indestructible. He was killed alongside Hamish Harding, a British explorer, Henri Nargeolet, a French diver, and Shahzada Dawood, the British-Pakistani businessman who took Suleman, his son, on board to see the Titanic wreckage. It said he “completely ignored” crucial inspections that could have spotted fatal flaws in the submersible's design. It read: “The lack of both third-party oversight and experienced OceanGate employees on staff during their 2023 Titan operations allowed OceanGate's chief executive officer to completely ignore vital inspections, data analyses and preventative maintenance procedures, culminating in a catastrophic event.” Rush “may have been subject to criminal liability” had he not been killed in the incident, with the USCG saying they would have referred him to the Department of Justice to pursue a “separate criminal investigation”. As of this month, no criminal charges have been filed, though a separate investigation by the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York is ongoing. OceanGate fully suspended all work shortly after the implosion in June 2023, and permanently ceased operations less than a month later. The report also claimed that Rush led a company with a “toxic workplace environment”, which led to staff members being fired to stop them from expressing concerns about safety standards. A former OceanGate employee said a safety incident was inevitable, telling investigators that the company had bypassed all standard safety rules. The people on board were “exposed to approximately 4,930 pounds per square inch of water pressure, resulting in the instantaneous death of all five occupants”. The company also continued to use the vessel, despite a number of incidents that compromised its safety, which were not properly investigated. It also failed to conduct proper maintenance before the doomed 2023 expedition. Passengers on that dive said they heard a loud bang, which Rush attributed to the sub shifting its frame. But the USCG now believes it would have been caused by delamination, which involves a material breaking down into thinner layers. It continued: “No report can alter the heartbreaking outcome, nor fill the immeasurable void left by two cherished members of our family. “We believe that accountability and regulatory change must follow such a catastrophic failure,” it said, adding that the family hopes the tragedy will serve as a turning point to bring “meaningful reform, rigorous safety standards, and effective oversight”. “If Shahzada and Suleman's legacy can be a catalyst for regulatory change that helps prevent such a loss from ever happening again, it will bring us some measure of peace.” Though criminal charges are unlikely, the Coast Guard has made 14 safety recommendations to the submersible industry in order to avoid future incidents. It recommends that the USCG should require sub owners to notify them before they carry out operations, including by sending emergency response plans. It also suggests that the Coast Guard has dedicated resources to “providing field support for vessels of novel design”.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Palestinians wait to receive food from a charity kitchen in Gaza City. The World Food Programme has stated that nearly 470,000 people in Gaza are enduring famine-like conditions.Mahmoud Issa/Reuters In the winter of 1975, I went to work on a kibbutz. The work in the fish ponds was not glamorous: I stood for hours in a large, stinky pool of muddy water hauling spiny St. Peter's fish out into a tank for export. But the trip was an ideological inspiration. Here were whole neighbourhoods celebrating my holidays. That kibbutz experience, combined with values I learned at home watching my parents' community work, drove home a strong sense of social justice. I returned from Israel and entered the larger world imbued with a positive Jewish identity. Back then I didn't label it, but I now see it more clearly as carrying forward the Jewish value of Tikkun Olam – healing the world. For years I dedicated myself to that value, which included throwing myself into my Jewish community in Vancouver. We sent our kids to Jewish elementary school. Fast forward to Oct. 9, 2023, when Israel's defence minister vowed a “complete siege” of the Gaza Strip in the wake of a devastating Hamas attack. Videos of Israeli hostages increase pressure for ceasefire as warnings about famine in Gaza grow And fast forward again to last month, when I scrolled past photo after photo of mothers holding children whose vertebrae I could count, as truckloads of food awaited metres or kilometres away. Who foments manmade famine after bombarding such a densely populated area? Basic things that defined my identity have been shattered. What inspires me about the concept of Tikkun Olam is that it exhorts us to act in the greater good, thinking beyond our own self-interests. What we are seeing in Gaza is not Tikkun Olam. But I believe in humanity, and this is as profound a desecration as I have witnessed.) The past 22 months have been an agony and a mind warp. I watch as women, men and children are killed by bombs, buried in rubble, shot dead awaiting aid or killed fetching water. Let me be clear: Oct. 7 was an atrocity. I still recall the horror of that day, when roughly 1,200 people were murdered and some 250 were taken hostage, the majority of them civilians. But we are long past the time when silence was acceptable. Fear of appearing anti-Israel – as though it were impossible to both love a country and condemn its actions. As though our community cannot withstand a conversation around how and whether a state can be dedicated to both Jewry and equality. Action on the part of Canadian and American Jewish leaders. In fairness, there are Jewish organizations speaking out. Major Jewish organizations won't say this, so I will: Mark Carney, please demand action from Israel. Keep demanding an end to this murderous aid blockade – and back that demand up with the threat of economic sanctions. There are other Canadian Jews – Zionists, even – who are aghast at what is unfolding and long for a community conversation. Many are rendered silent for fear of being labelled self-hating Jews or worse. There's fear of fomenting antisemitism, that ever-present spectre. But I can no longer abide it. We are witnessing horrors, and have no choice but to speak out. It is the state of Israel that has abandoned them. All articles covering the Middle East are closed to commenting.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vance, President Donald Trump, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Makolo didn't provide a timeline for any deportees to arrive in Rwanda or say if they would arrive at once or in several batches. The U.S. sent 13 men it described as dangerous criminals who were in the U.S. illegally to South Sudan and Eswatini in Africa last month and has said it is seeking more agreements with African nations. It said those deportees' home countries refused to take them back. Rwanda attracted international attention and some outrage when it struck a deal in 2022 with the U.K. to accept migrants who had arrived in the U.K. to seek asylum. It sent eight men from South Sudan, Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar and Vietnam to South Sudan in early July after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling cleared the way for their deportations. They were held for weeks in a converted shipping container at an American military base in Djibouti as the legal battle over their deportations played out. South Sudan, which is tipping toward civil war, has declined to say where the men are being held or what their fate is. The U.S. also deported five men who are citizens of Vietnam, Jamaica, Cuba, Yemen and Laos to the southern African kingdom of Eswatini, where the government said they will be held in solitary confinement in prison for an undetermined period of time. A human rights lawyer in Eswatini said the men are being denied access to legal representation there and has taken authorities to court. Both South Sudan and Eswatini have declined to give details of their agreements with the U.S. Rwanda, a relatively small country of some 15 million people, has long stood out on the continent for its recovery from a genocide that killed over 800,000 people in 1994. It has promoted itself under longtime President Paul Kagame as an example of stability and development, but human rights groups allege there are also deadly crackdowns on any perceived dissent against Kagame, who has been president for 25 years. Government spokesperson Makolo said the agreement with the U.S. was Rwanda doing its part to help with international migration issues because “our societal values are founded on reintegration and rehabilitation.” There were no details about whether Rwanda had received anything in return for taking the deportees. Gonzaga Muganwa, a Rwandan political analyst, said “appeasing President Trump pays.” “This agreement enhances Rwanda's strategic interest of having good relationships with the Trump administration,” he said. The U.K. government estimated that its failed migration deal with Rwanda cost around US$900-million in public money, including approximately US$300-million in payments to Rwanda, which said it was not obligated to refund the money when the agreement fell apart.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia ends its moratorium on the deployment of short-and medium-range missiles; the EU is unlikely to jointly purchase US weapons for Ukraine; and Iran forms a Defense Council as it rules out direct dialogue with the US. These stories have topped Tuesday's newspaper headlines across Russia. The Precision Strike Missile (PrSM), whose subsequent modifications will have a range of over 1,000 km, was once again tested during an exercise in Australia in 2025. Oleg Barabanov, program director at the Valdai International Discussion Club, does not rule out that Russia's move to end the moratorium is an element of psychological pressure. Moscow is not seeking to raise the stakes but is rather conducting an informational campaign against the US president. "An arms race between the US and Russia has been going on for years. Now, a new aspect is being added to the Ukrainian theater of war—a global nuclear missile threat," Barabanov said. According to Dmitry Stefanovich, researcher with the Center for International Security at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of World Economy and International Relations, this is a somewhat belated move to "even up the stakes." Sergey Oznobishchev, director of the Institute for Strategic Assessments, told Kommersant that although in the short term, an arms race is expected to take place with regard to ground-based short-and medium-range missiles, in the longer run, the parties will try to make an agreement on some limitation measures. "After all, the Russian president has repeatedly said that an arms race is not our preference," the analyst emphasized. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte called on the bloc's members to start purchasing more US weapons for the Ukrainian army as soon as possible. However, US President Donald Trump's initiative is too demanding for many EU nations at this point, experts point out. The options include the handover of weapons from their own stockpiles and later purchases of similar weapons for their needs. Germany was one of the countries that supported the initiative, announcing plans to transfer Patriot systems to Kiev. Denmark also expressed readiness to buy US weapons for Ukraine. The NATO chief said that those willing to support Kiev also included Finland, Sweden, Norway, the United Kingdom and Canada. The thing to note is that the deals Trump has been making recently tend to only formally document obligations, political scientist Ivan Loshkaryov noted. "But when it comes to details, the setup of agreements often changes. Given that EU countries' finances are limited and decision-making by EU institutions is complicated, the real scope of weapons supplies to Ukraine will be smaller than announced, and the deliveries will take more time," the expert elaborated. Clearly, the initiative threatens to have at least several repercussions, including a rise in debt and budget deficit, Loshkaryov noted. Weapons supplies to Ukraine are objectively becoming a burden for European politicians. If agreements are reached on the entire range of related issues, a compromise may also be found on weapons supplies. As Tehran expects another round of escalation, it has announced the establishment of the Defense Council, which is supposed to make coordinated decisions on security issues, Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes. Russian International Affairs Council expert Kirill Semyonov notes that Iran's move to establish the Defense Council is part of preparations for a new war with Israel. "The Defense Council is being created in Iran in order to make sure that decision-making is more rapid," the expert explained. "Until recently, it was up to the Supreme National Security Council, a far more cumbersome institution, which discussed a large number of issues, but now, a body is being formed where it's clear who is accountable for what," he added. The analyst pointed out that it used to take Iran a long time to develop retaliatory measures in the direct conflict with Israel. "There were problems stemming from the complexity of internal communication and decision-making," Semyonov observed, referring to the recent 12-day war. That said, the Defense Council will now work so that military commanders and civilian authorities don't have to spend time on such discussions, the expert concluded. Central Asian nations are facing a risk of gas shortages, with a deficit threatening Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, Rossiyskaya Gazeta reports, citing Kazakh news outlet Bugin.info. The reasons for a rise in gas consumption in Central Asia include population growth, industrial development, infrastructure wear and tear and limited domestic resources. Alexey Grivach, deputy head of the National Energy Security Fund, points to certain advantages of Russian gas imports aimed at meeting the current and potential energy shortages in these countries: there are enough resources and infrastructure facilities that require minor upgrading. According to Yevgenia Popova, project manager at the Implementa company, the deficit scenario will unfold in a situation where energy consumption significantly grows in Central Asian countries but production does not increase. For Russia, infrastructure constraints will be the main obstacle to raising exports. As Russia has lost access to the European gas market, this option for increasing pipeline gas exports could be very appealing. In Grivach's view, there is currently no better offer on the market for Russian pipeline gas exports, and none is likely to emerge anytime soon. Valery Andrianov, associate professor at the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation, also believes that the Central Asian market, which requires a relatively short transportation leg, is a promising option for Russia's gas giant Gazprom to maintain and even increase its exports. For Beijing and Washington, it's not only about peacekeeping ambition, but also geopolitics, as China-US confrontation is particularly intensifying in the Asia-Pacific region. However, both parties have been accusing each other of violating the truce ever since. As no lasting ceasefire has been established yet, the parties will try to make an agreement for those evacuated from border areas to return home, said Yelena Fomichova, senior researcher with the Center of Southeast Asia, Australia and Oceania at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of Oriental Studies. Differences in documents date back to the times of French Indochina, a colony that included Cambodia, which had earlier been partially under the sovereignty of Siam (now Thailand). Meanwhile, territorial disputes are often used to mask domestic problems, which is especially true for Thailand, the expert remarked. The situation in the country is tense particularly due to political instability stemming from a change of prime minister, as well as to economic issues related to a sluggish GDP growth rate. That said, the risk remains of a renewed conflict, said Paul Chambers, visiting fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies. Regional instability is no good for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which is why it was the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur that hosted talks between two members of the group. Maintaining unity within the association is a crucial political goal, Fomichova stressed. TASS is not responsible for the material quoted in these press reviews</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The sale of US weapons to Ukraine via European countries will relieve American taxpayers of the financial burden, US Permanent Representative to NATO Matthew Whitaker said. "[US] President [Donald] Trump announced this mechanism where our NATO allies would buy American armaments and ammunition and then those allies would provide that to Ukraine," the diplomat said during a Newsmax TV broadcast. "Obviously, this takes the American taxpayer out of the equation. No longer are American taxpayers bearing the burden of the war in Ukraine," he explained. Whitaker pointed out that the new mechanism does not weaken US positions but strengthens them. Washington sells weapons produced by US workers, thus ensuring employment in the country and supporting the national defense industry. According to the diplomat, the US has successfully shifted responsibility for Europe's security onto the continent's countries. On July 14, President Donald Trump announced at a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte that the two had agreed to the delivery of US weapons to Ukraine at the expense of European countries. The alliance will coordinate the deliveries, which will include weapons such as Patriot systems. The US president said that the volume of military aid that will be supplied to Ukraine through NATO will amount to billions of dollars.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Five German Eurofighter Typhoon jets landed at an air base near Warsaw on Aug. 4 as a deterrent ahead of the planned Zapad military exercises in Belarus, the German media reported. The Russian-Belarusian Zapad-2025 drills are expected to take place in mid-September and involve around 13,000 troops. Kyiv and NATO officials have voiced concern over the drills, which are set to occur amid Russia's ongoing full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The funding will be channeled through NATO's Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA), which enables fast-track purchases of U.S. arms to meet Ukraine's most urgent defense needs. President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine has already prepared a draft agreement on drones and is ready to finalize what he called "one of the strongest agreements this could be." "(Russian President Vladimir) Putin will stop killing people if you get (the price of) energy down another $10 a barrel. He's going to have no choice, because his economy stinks," U.S. President Donald Trump said. Putin is reluctant to provoke Trump and recognizes that pressing ahead with the war could jeopardize a potential thaw in relations with Washington and the West, but his military objectives remain the top priority, two sources told Reuters. Ukraine has detected Indian-made components in Russian Shahed-type attack drones, Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak confirmed on Aug. 5, adding Moscow must be denied access to supplies that "enable the killing of Ukrainians." Colonel Vasyl Myshanskyi is accused of signing government contracts with supplier companies at knowingly inflated prices. Russian forces launched an Iskander-M ballistic missile from Russia's Bryansk Oblast and 46 Shahed-type drones from Kursk, Bryansk, Orel, and Primorsk-Akhtarsk against Ukraine overnight, according to Ukraine's Air Force. A Chisinau court ruled that Evghenia Gutul was guilty of systematically bringing funds from Russia to Moldova for the now-banned pro-Russian Shor Party's needs between 2019 and 2022. Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) special forces fought off a Russian attempt to advance in Sumy Oblast, "destroying more than eight Russian companies" during the battle, the agency said on Aug. 5 We will respond," President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a statement. Five German Eurofighter Typhoon jets will help monitor NATO airspace and potential Russian activity along the eastern flank for the next few weeks, a German Air Force spokesperson told DPA news agency.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>305 drones were launched at Ukrainian-held territory in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, with another 110 artillery strikes targeting the region, Fedorov said. Russia regularly strikes frontline regions as it continues to wage its war against Ukraine. Much of southern Zaporizhzhia Oblast remains occupied as Russian forces continue attempts to push forward despite calls for a ceasefire. Russian drone strikes in Ukraine's Kharkiv Oblast on Aug. 4 killed three civilians, the regional prosecutor's office reported. As Russia continues to launch strikes on Ukrainian cities and shows no interest in ending its war, Ukraine's allies have intensified efforts to broker a ceasefire and supply Kyiv with military aid. If Russia fails to reach an agreement, Moscow will face secondary U.S. sanctions. The measures could impose tariffs on Moscow's trading partners, including Brazil, China, and India. Ukraine and Russia have held three rounds of peace talks in recent months. Volodymyr holds a Certificate in Business Fundamentals from Rotman Commerce at the University of Toronto.
