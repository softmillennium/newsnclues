                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research has revealed that perilipin 2 protein modulates aggressive cancer progression in advanced lung adenocarcinoma, the most common type of lung cancer, by regulating lipid droplet accumulation, which plays an important role in lipid metabolism by making cancer cells store more fat, acting as a fuel source. Findings from this new study in The American Journal of Pathology, published by Elsevier, suggest that perilipin 2 could serve as a prognostic factor to help predict the likely outcome (prognosis) of the disease and point to new potential lipid-based targets for treating lung adenocarcinoma. This study addresses an urgent unmet need for new therapeutic approaches focusing on perilipin 2, part of a family of proteins found on the surface of lipid droplets (fat storage units within cells), which plays a key role in lipid metabolism. We need to study the underlying mechanisms for the progression and metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma to better understand the pathologic nature of these cancers and to discover new therapeutic targets." Researchers analyzed 214 histologic samples that were selected from patients with lung adenocarcinoma who underwent surgical resection between 2010 and 2016 at the Teikyo University Hospital. This study demonstrates that high perilipin 2 expression in lung adenocarcinoma was associated with more aggressive disease progression and shorter recurrence-free survival times than low perilipin 2 expression. Lung adenocarcinoma cell line with knockout of PLIN2 expression exhibited significant reduction in lipid droplet accumulation and suppression of cell proliferation and migration ability. "Perilipin 2 is required for the maintenance of lipid droplets, which serve as an energy source driving cancer progression. These findings advance our understanding of lipid mechanisms in disease progression and will help estimate the likelihood of recurrence as well as help identify new targets to treat lung adenocarcinoma," concludes Dr. Miyata-Morita. Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers with high global morbidity and mortality rates. While targeted therapies for driver mutations (specific genetic changes) have improved outcomes for some advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients, many others lack these mutations and are typically unresponsive to currently available targeted therapies.

In past decades, numerous emerging infectious diseases have markedly affected global health and social-economic development. Consequently, the concept of "disease X" has been developed and lists of the pathogens with potential to cause future pandemics have been proposed and updated several times by the World Health Organization. This article analyses the major features of pathogens with high probability to cause future COVID-19-like pandemics, on the basis of their transmission routes, animal-human interfaces, herd immunity barriers, and evolutionary and mutational characteristics. High-priority viral infectious diseases with potential to become disease X in the future, are also evaluated on the basis of their transmission pathways, including airborne/respiratory, vector-borne, and direct contact. Overall, viruses had much greater likelihood of becoming "pathogen X" than either bacteria or other microorganisms. Many contagious viral infectious diseases lead to severe clinical outcomes but have relatively low likelihood of causing global pandemics.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Activation of the body's opioid system may be required for ketamine's antidepressant effects, new research hinted. In a small study of adults with major depressive disorder, taking the opioid blocker naltrexone before a low-dose ketamine infusion both blunted the surge in glutamate — a key brain chemical linked to mood — and reduced ketamine's rapid antidepressant benefit the next day. “These results suggest that opioid receptors help mediate ketamine's effects and that blocking opioid receptors may lessen ketamine's acute mood-lifting action,” lead researcher Luke Jelen, MBBS, clinical lecturer in psychiatry, King's College London, London, England, told Medscape Medical News. Larger, dedicated clinical studies are required before recommending any alteration to current protocols,” Jelen cautioned. The study was published online on July 24 in Nature Medicine. Ketamine's rapid-acting antidepressant effects are thought to work by transiently elevating glutamate in the anterior cingulate cortex and other frontal regions, setting off a cascade of plasticity-related pathways. Prior animal and small human studies have suggested that activating mu-opioid receptors might be necessary for ketamine's mood benefits. To investigate, Jelen and colleagues enrolled 26 adults with moderate-to-severe depression in a randomized double-blind crossover trial separated by 3 weeks. Participants received either oral placebo or 50 mg naltrexone 1 hour before receiving intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg). Depressive symptoms were measured before and 24 hours after infusion, when ketamine's antidepressant effects peak, using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Specifically, the glutamate signal climbed significantly during ketamine when participants had taken placebo, but the rise was significantly smaller when they had taken naltrexone (P = .029; Cohen's d = 0.34). “We also identified a sex-related effect: The attenuating effect of naltrexone on glutamate activity appeared more pronounced in males with depression than in females with depression,” Jelen said. Looking ahead, Jelen told Medscape Medical News, a larger, well-powered study should include a true placebo-infusion arm to disentangle naltrexone's effects on both ketamine and placebo responses. He also noted that adding PET imaging would directly quantify opioid-receptor engagement, and prespecified analyses by sex are essential, given the stronger glutamate-dampening effect observed in men. “Understanding more about how ketamine works can lead to treatment being personalized for different people, which is vital for creating safe and effective treatments,” Jelen said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TORONTO — A number of modifiable risk factors are more common in women than in men and have a greater impact on cognition, an early look at new research showed. Investigators also found that the impact on cognition from some of these factors was greater in women than in men, especially hearing loss and diabetes. However, the impact of these and other risk factors varied by age. The results suggest personalized health and lifestyle interventions should consider both sex and age, study author Megan Fitzhugh, PhD, assistant professor, Department of Neurosciences, University of California San Diego, told Medscape Medical News. It's well-known that women are at greater risk for dementia. Sex-specific factors such as pregnancy and menopause may contribute to this imbalance. But while many researchers tackle this issue from a biological perspective, Fitzhugh focuses on the effects of modifiable risk factors. After excluding anyone younger than 40 years and those without self-reported risk factor information, the study sample included 17,182 individuals. As reported by Medscape Medical News, 45% of dementia risk factors are potentially modifiable. Risk factors identified in the Lancet report include less education in early life (contributing 5% to risk); hearing loss (7%), elevated low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (7%), depression (3%), traumatic brain injury (3%), physical inactivity (2%), diabetes (2%), smoking (2%), hypertension (2%), obesity (1%), and excessive alcohol (1%) in midlife; and social isolation (5%), air pollution (3%), and vision loss (2%) in late life. Looking at prevalence, investigators found that six of the 14 risk factors were more common in women, including physical inactivity, depression, smoking, poor sleep, less education and poor vision (for example, glaucoma or cataracts). Only three risk factors were more common in men, including hearing loss, diabetes, and alcohol use. For example, the diabetes plot shows this risk factor has a much bigger impact on cognition in women. “The line for men is relatively flat, so their cognition is really the same if they have diabetes or not, but for women, if they have diabetes, cognition is much lower compared to women who don't have diabetes”, explained Fitzhugh. In addition to diabetes, other risk factors that have a greater cognitive impact on women included poor sleep, BMI, hypertension, poor vision, less education, and hearing loss. Along with high LDL, hearing loss is the largest modifiable risk factor, accounting for 7% of dementia risk, according to the Lancet Commission report. But even though more men have hearing loss across all ages, it appears to be more impactful on women in terms of cognition, said Fitzhugh. “There's something about hearing loss in women that is particularly detrimental.” The cognitive impact of risk factors also varies by age, investigators found. Among women, the impact of hearing loss was greatest in middle to older age. Poor sleep only had a significant impact in middle age, which coincides with the menopause transition. “The way I think about age in this study is it's telling us when, potentially, we should be targeting these risk factors,” said Fitzhugh. She recognizes this is “just a snapshot” in time and said she'd like to “map out” how risk factors impact cognition over time. Commenting on the research, Liisa Galea, PhD, Treliving Family Chair in Women's Mental Health, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, and professor of psychiatry, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, said that more modifiable factors are associated with cognition in females than males is “most surprising.” “Clearly these factors are important for everyone, but we need more targeted messaging to women across the lifespan about the importance of these variables for their brain health,” Galea said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To construct such an effective protective layer, bacteria rely on specialized molecular machinery. The lipopolysaccharide transport (Lpt) system is a key player in this process, as it integrates functional lipopolysaccharide complexes into the OM. Although some components of this transport pathway, such as the LptDE complex, are known to be essential for bacterial survival, the precise mechanisms governing their assembly and maturation remain unclear. In a recent study, a research team led by Assistant Professor Ryoji Miyazaki from the Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST), Japan, made an important discovery toward a better understanding of these processes. Their study, made available online on July 16, 2025, and scheduled for publication on August 26, 2025, in Volume 44, Issue 8 of the journal Cell Reports, reveals the critical role of a small protein called LptM in maturing and stabilizing LptD, which, together with LptE, forms the LptDE complex. The study was co-authored by Mai Kimoto, Dr. Hidetaka Kohga, and Professor Tomoya Tsukazaki from NAIST. They investigated the precise timing of various events during LptD maturation, demonstrating that LptM acts at a later stage, influencing already-folded LptD intermediates. Through comprehensive mutational analyses, they identified a short region of LptM, comprising fewer than ten amino acid residues, as essential for its purpose. This analysis, combined with biochemical experiments, provided an unprecedented molecular view of how LptM directly interacts with and stabilizes the LptDE complex. Their results revealed that LptM positions itself at a critical interface within LptD, suggesting its role in fine-tuning the structure of this protein for Lpt. This enhanced understanding of the LptDE assembly process has significant implications for future therapeutic advances. "Our study highlights the essential role of LptM, providing fundamental insights that may support antibiotic design, as the LptDE complex has been identified as a potential target for novel antibiotics," states Dr. Miyazaki. "Thus, our findings contribute to the advancement of research that could guide future drug discovery." Beyond potential drug targets, this research also sheds important light on a broader principle in biology. "Our findings suggest that small proteins, many of which have been previously overlooked, may play critical roles in the assembly and regulation of larger membrane protein complexes. This opens up a new perspective in basic biology, underscoring the functional relevance of small proteins," remarks Dr. Miyazaki. Indeed, such results could open doors to new avenues for exploring the previously unrecognized functions of these "microproteins" in various cellular processes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Unlike most cells in the human body, neurons-the functional cells of our nervous system-cannot typically replace themselves with healthy copies after being damaged. Rather, after an injury from something like a stroke, concussion or neurodegenerative disease, neurons and their axons, fiber-like projections that relay electrical signals, are far more likely to degrade than regenerate. But new research from the University of Michigan opens new ways to think about neurodegeneration that could help protect patients against that degradation and neurological decline in the future. Their findings, made using a well-established fruit fly model, suggest that how resilient neurons are to degradation is connected to the fundamental process of how these cells process sugar. "Metabolism is often changed in brain injury and diseases like Alzheimer's, but we do not know whether this is a cause or consequence of the disease," said senior author Monica Dus, U-M associate professor of molecular, cellular, and developmental biology. "Here we found that dialing down sugar metabolism breaks down neural integrity, but if the neurons are already injured, the same manipulation can preemptively activate a protective program. Instead of breaking down, axons hold on longer." One is called dual leucine zipper kinase, or DLK, which senses neuronal damage, and is activated by a disrupted metabolism. The other protein is known as SARM1-short for Sterile Alpha and TIR Motif-containing 1-which has been implicated in axon degeneration and is coupled with the DLK response. Metabolic signals shape whether neurons hold the line or begin to break down." Monica Dus, U-M associate professor of molecular, cellular, and developmental biology Generally, in cases where neurons and axons don't degrade, DLK becomes more active and the movement of SARM1 is suppressed. In fact, prolonged DLK activation over time leads to progressive neurodegeneration, the study showed, effectively reversing earlier neuroprotective effects. DLK, in particular, has emerged as a target for treating and studying neurodegenerative disease. "If we want to delay the progression of a disease, we want to inhibit its negative aspect," Waller said. "We want to make sure that we're not at all inhibiting the more positive aspect that might actually be helping to slow the disease down naturally." Uncovering the mechanisms underlying how modulators like DLK switch between these protective and harmful states could hold massive implications for the treatment of neurodegenerative disease and brain injury, directly impacting clinical populations. Dus and Waller said that understanding this mechanism "provides a new perspective on injury and disease, one that goes beyond simply blocking damage to focusing on what the system is already doing to reinforce it."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ōtākou Whakaihu Waka-led research has found stress-controlling brain cells switch on and off in a steady rhythm about once every hour – even when nothing stressful is happening. Senior author Associate Professor Karl Iremonger, of Otago's Department of Physiology and Centre for Neuroendocrinology, says these rhythms shape activity patterns and alertness. These bursts of brain cell activity seem to act like a natural 'wake-up' signal, and often lead to a rise in stress hormones, or cortisol. This world first research opens the door to exploring how these patterns affect health, mood, and sleep." For the study, published in high-profile journal PNAS, the researchers used an optical technique called photometry to track brain cell activity of mice and rats. We could then look at how the activity of brain pathways is coordinated with sleep/wake patterns and stress hormone levels." A group of brain cells called corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons were found to be particularly important for the daily rhythms of stress hormone release. "These neurons turn on and off in a regular pattern about once every hour. Interestingly, we found that these changes were coordinated with patterns of sleep and waking which suggests that the pattern of release is coordinated with wakefulness or alertness. "We also found when the CRH neurons were artificially activated, this changed the animals' behaviour – animals that were previously quietly resting became hyper-active." Associate Professor Iremonger says the research findings may lead to a better understanding of how disrupted stress rhythms can result in changes in mood and disrupted sleep. "Our new research is helping us to understand how the brain controls these normal rhythms of stress hormone release. Knowing how these brain signals work will help us understand the links between stress hormone levels, alertness and mental health."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research from the University of Arizona Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health showed that living in resource-poor neighborhoods may raise the risk of women developing diabetes during pregnancy, a condition with potential long-term effects on the health of both mother and child. Researchers found that mothers living in more deprived neighborhoods in Arizona were 20% more likely to have gestational diabetes mellitus, or GDM, compared with those living in neighborhoods with adequate resources. They reported their findings in Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology. Where you live can influence your health. It can impact stress, access to quality food, the ability to interact with the outdoors and exercise – all factors that can affect health. We know there are racial disparities in GDM, and we wanted to go beyond that and more fully gauge the importance of social determinants of health at a neighborhood level." The research team, including first author and former U of A graduate student Kimberly Parra, PhD, used birth certificate and maternal health information from the Arizona Prenatal Environment and Reproductive Outcomes Study. They examined more than 480,000 births in 15 Arizona counties between 2014 and 2020. They combined that information with the Neighborhood Deprivation Index, or NDI, a mashup of neighborhood-related factors such as housing quality, violence, education, access to healthy food and poverty that reflects socioeconomic status in a neighborhood. "We compared people who live in highly deprived neighborhoods to those who live in less deprived neighborhoods and looked at the risk of GDM by neighborhood score," Furlong explained. "We found women living in neighborhoods with higher deprivation scores were more likely to have GDM. Those living in poorer neighborhoods had smaller babies and were younger, less educated, more overweight and more likely to have public insurance. Prior research has linked neighborhood conditions to a lower control of diabetes, but few studies have examined the impact of socioeconomic factors on the development of diabetes in pregnant women living in poor neighborhoods. "From a policy perspective, there could be more emphasis on eliminating food deserts, for example, and promoting programs that increase access to higher quality housing, healthy food and prenatal care," Furlong said. Furlong noted there is much more to learn about the potential role neighborhoods play in influencing maternal health. "This is only a characterization of people who live in these areas who have a higher risk for diabetes," she said. "We'd like to know many more details about the neighborhoods themselves and how they can impact the health of people who live there."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Published today in the Annals of Internal Medicine, the research analyzed nearly 700 studies between 1929 and 2024 on engineering controls such as HEPA filters, UV light, ionizers and advanced ventilation systems designed to reduce infection transmission through indoor air. While these technologies are commonly found in homes, schools and public buildings, researchers found just 9% of studies examined whether they reduce illness in humans. We were surprised to find that most of the research tested air cleaning devices in lab chambers, not in real-world settings where people live, work or go to school. We need stronger studies that look at actual health outcomes, whether people are actually exposed to fewer pathogens or get sick less often, and not just measurements of particles in the air." Most studies in the review focused on indirect measurements such as tracer gases, dust particles or harmless microbes rather than actual viruses or bacteria that cause illness. Very few tracked whether people experienced fewer infections when using air-cleaning technologies. The study also raises concerns about potential health risks. Only a small number of papers examined harmful byproducts such as ozone, which can irritate the lungs and worsen respiratory conditions. Many air cleaning technologies, such as ionizers, plasma-based devices, and certain ultraviolet light systems, can produce ozone, yet few studies evaluate the safety of their long-term operation in homes and workplaces. "Ozone and other chemicals created by some air-cleaning devices can actually harm the respiratory system, especially in children or people with chronic respiratory illnesses," said Louis Leslie, research services senior professional in the department of ophthalmology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and co-author of the study. "It may be worth checking whether the manufacturer provides data on any potentially harmful emissions from a device and what can be done to minimize them," said Bero, who is also with the Colorado School of Public Health. The researchers are calling for a new generation of studies that evaluate these technologies in real-world environments such as classrooms and hospitals and track actual infections rather than relying on indirect measures like air particle counts. They also emphasize the importance of assessing potential side effects, environmental impact, cost, and accessibility, including how feasible these solutions are across different types of settings. "Public health decisions should be based on solid, independent evidence," said Bero. Some of these studies are funded by the companies that make the technologies being evaluated, which creates a conflict of interest. Until we do know more, the public deserves clear and transparent information." For those buying an air purifier or installing a new ventilation system to reduce illness in homes, schools or workplaces, the researchers recommend choosing technologies that have been independently tested in real-world environments. They also advise avoiding products that produce harmful byproducts like ozone. Most importantly they emphasize that dependable practices such as improving ventilation, opening windows and regular cleaning remain effective ways to keep indoor spaces healthier. "This study highlights the urgent need for better science to guide how we make our indoor environments safer especially as respiratory infections continue to pose a serious public health threat," said Bero.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Have you ever wondered why some people who drink alcohol develop serious liver problems while others don't? Scientists at UofL, along with colleagues from Boston University and the University of Massachusetts Lowell, have identified perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) as a potential environmental factor that worsens alcohol-associated liver disease. PFOS is a man-made chemical belonging to the group known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), often referred to as "forever chemicals" because they do not readily break down in the environment or the human body. These substances have been used for decades in products such as non-stick cookware, water-resistant clothing, fast-food packaging, stain-resistant carpets and upholstery, and firefighting foams. Their extensive use has led to widespread contamination in the environment. Recent data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey show that PFAS can be detected in approximately 95% of Americans, sparking increasing concern about their long-term health effects. At the same time, alcohol consumption remains a significant global health issue. In the U.S. alone, excessive alcohol use is responsible for approximately 95,000 deaths annually, making it one of the leading causes of preventable death and a major contributor to liver disease. Matthew Cave, UofL professor of medicine and publication co-author Although it is well known that both alcohol and PFOS cause liver damage individually, little has been understood about their combined effects until now. Recent studies have shown that only about 35% of heavy drinkers develop severe forms of liver disease, indicating that additional factors such as genetics, sex, microbiome and environmental exposures may contribute to individual susceptibility. "This work helps explain why two people with similar alcohol consumption may experience very different liver outcomes," said Frederick Ekuban, assistant professor of medicine at UofL and first author of the study. "Environmental exposures like PFOS may be the missing link." Using animal models, the researchers simulated real-world exposures to both alcohol and PFOS. In short, the study demonstrates that PFOS exposure can significantly worsen liver damage when combined with alcohol consumption. While this research used high levels of alcohol to understand the underlying mechanisms, the findings reveal important biological pathways that warrant further investigation across different drinking patterns. The research team also found that PFOS interferes with the liver's ability to manage fats, disrupts its natural protective and repair systems and activates pathways that promote liver injury. "While the liver typically has a remarkable capacity to recover from alcohol-induced stress, PFOS appears to push that resilience beyond its limits, resulting in compounded and more severe damage," said Jennifer Schlezinger professor of environmental health at Boston University and co-author of the publication. Ongoing research at UofL is examining how other PFAS compounds may interact with alcohol, whether males and females respond differently to these exposures and what the long-term consequences of combined exposures might be. The team is also exploring whether targeted therapies can be developed to prevent or mitigate this type of liver damage.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A study by University of Maryland (UMD) School of Public Health, out today in Health Affairs, reveals major differences in coverage depending on adoption type (domestic or international) and citizenship status of the adoptive parent. Previous studies, many of which did not differentiate between different types of adoptees, found adopted children were consistently insured," said study co-author Jamie Fleishman. "Our study, which considered four types of adoptee, found a very high uninsured rate for some adopted children – particularly those adopted internationally by non-citizens living in the United States." Fleishman is a Chinese transnational adoptee who was adopted from China to an American parent. She graduated from UMD in 2024 with a masters in public health (MPH), focusing on health equity, and her master's thesis was the foundation of this study. The UMD researchers analyzed insurance coverage over five years (2018 – 2022,) comparing adopted and non-adopted children up to 17 years old who live with their head of household, using data from the American Community Survey (ACS), which includes over three million adopted and non-adopted children. The study distinguishes between international and domestic adoptions and further distinguishes international adoptees by householder citizenship, because international adoptees of U.S. citizens are, similar to a U.S.-born child, eligible for public insurance coverage such as Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) or Medicaid. The findings clearly show that we must not treat adopted children as a single group. The citizenship status and other factors such as income of adoptive parents are also different. The study compared four different groups of adopted children in the U.S. against a control group of non-adopted children: domestic adoptions, international adoptions by U.S. citizens, international adoptions by non-U.S. citizens and children who live with a biological relative, such as a grandparent, but who is not their biological parent. They also had lower rates of private and public health insurance than other adoptee groups, by 12.1 percentage points and 9.1 percentage points respectively. The study also highlights a significantly high uninsured rate (7.3%) for children who are living with relatives other than their biological parents, and who are also more likely to live in lower-income families. "There are likely multiple factors behind these disparities which were not examined in this study. But the data is clear: These groups are not homogenous, despite previous research often treating them as a single population. These children are worthy of policy attention to ensure all children have access to health care in the United States," said Yue.
