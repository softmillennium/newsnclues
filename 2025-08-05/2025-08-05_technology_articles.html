                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI released its first open-weight AI models in more than five years, and Amazon quickly said they will be available on its Bedrock and SageMaker platforms — marking the first time the cloud giant has offered products from the ChatGPT maker. The surprise announcement comes at a pivotal moment in OpenAI's longstanding relationship with Microsoft, which has invested about $13.75 billion in the San Francisco-based company. Microsoft has exclusive rights to OpenAI's API on its Azure cloud platform. As a result, any cloud provider could offer them — although it's clear from the timing that Amazon got a heads up, at least. We've contacted Microsoft for further comment on the news and its plans. Amazon Web Services has likely lost some business in the past due to the fact that it didn't have any OpenAI models to offer, said Patrick Moorhead, CEO and chief analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. Amazon's Bedrock platform offers customers a wide selection of AI models from various companies. Microsoft and OpenAI are currently in talks to renegotiate their agreement in a deal that could give Microsoft ongoing access to critical OpenAI technology, even if the startup achieves its goal of building artificial general intelligence (AGI), according to a Bloomberg News report last week. The talks have reportedly expanded into a larger renegotiation of their relationship. Have a scoop that you'd like GeekWire to cover?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a report issued today, the U.S. Coast Guard panel investigating the loss of OceanGate's Titan submersible and its occupants in 2023 blamed the disaster on a series of safety lapses — and issued recommendations that were aimed at heading off future tragedies. “We believe that accountability and regulatory change must follow such a catastrophic failure.” It said that mistake was compounded by inadequate measures to certify, maintain and inspect the sub. The investigators cited other factors as well, including a “toxic workplace culture at OceanGate,” an inadequate regulatory framework — and an ineffective procedure for dealing with a complaint that a whistleblower filed with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in 2018. “It was a long journey, and OSHA were handed everything,” whistleblower David Lochridge, who was fired from his post as OceanGate's director of marine operations five years before the fatal dive, told GeekWire via email in June. OceanGate's lapses, and Rush's behind-the-scenes attempts to downplay such lapses, came under the spotlight in hearings conducted by the investigative board last year — and in follow-up documentaries released this year. Privately, Rush tried to explain away evidence that Titan's hull might crack under the extreme pressures of the deep ocean, and used legal threats to squelch criticism. OceanGate executed several rounds of dives to the Titanic shipwreck in 2021 and 2022, carrying “mission specialists” who paid as much as $250,000 to participate in the adventure. The investigators said that Titan's acoustic monitoring system — which Rush had held up as an innovative early warning system — didn't work as advertised. Nevertheless, 2023's catastrophe might have been avoided if OceanGate had paid closer heed to the acoustic readings and conducted a complete hull inspection back at its Everett headquarters. Investigators made more than a dozen safety recommendations, including restricting the research designations for submersibles, expanding regulatory requirements for all submersibles that are conducting scientific or commercial dives, and requiring Coast Guard documentation for all U.S. submersibles. The report recommends establishing an industry working group to review and update the standards for submersibles, with an eye toward allowing new passenger operations under U.S. regulations while reducing the incentive for operators like OceanGate to “conduct non-compliant operations.” And it calls for a new agreement between OSHA and the Coast Guard to improve interagency coordination and clarify the protocols for following up on whistleblower reports. OceanGate is already facing a lawsuit filed by the family of P.H. Nargeolet, seeking $50 million in damages — and now that the investigative report has come out, more legal action may follow.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft says it has created an advanced AI system that can reverse-engineer and identify malicious software on its own, without human assistance. This kind of deep analysis is typically performed by human security experts. Long-term, Microsoft says it hopes the AI will detect new types of malware directly in computer memory, helping to stop threats faster and on a larger scale. It comes as security defenders and hackers engage in an arms race to use emerging AI models and autonomous agents to their advantage. On Monday, the company launched its latest Zero Day Quest, a global bug bounty competition with up to $5 million in total rewards. Announcing Project Ire on Tuesday morning, Microsoft said it was accurate enough in one case to justify automatically blocking a highly advanced form of malware. It was the first time that any system at the company — human or machine — had produced a threat report strong enough to trigger an automatic block on its own. Early testing showed the AI to be very accurate: when it determined a file was malicious, it was correct 98% of the time, and it incorrectly flagged safe files as threats in 2% of cases, according to the company. Google's “Big Sleep” AI, for example, also operates autonomously but concentrates instead on discovering security vulnerabilities in code.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Cloudflare accused AI search engine Perplexity of stealthily scraping websites on Monday, while ignoring a site's specific methods to block it, this wasn't a clear-cut case of an AI web crawler gone wild. They argued that Perplexity accessing sites in defiance of the website owner's wishes, while controversial, is acceptable. Cloudflare is known for providing anti-bot crawling and other web security services to millions of websites. Essentially, Cloudflare's test case involved setting up a new website with a new domain that had never been crawled by any bot, setting up a robots.txt file that specifically blocked Perplexity's known AI crawling bots, and then asking Perplexity about the website's content. Cloudflare researchers found the AI search engine used “a generic browser intended to impersonate Google Chrome on macOS” when its web crawler itself was blocked. Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince posted the research on X, writing, “Some supposedly ‘reputable' AI companies act more like North Korean hackers. But many people disagreed with Prince's assessment that this was actual bad behavior. Those defending Perplexity on sites like X and Hacker News pointed out that what Cloudflare seemed to document was the AI accessing a specific public website when its user asked about that specific website. “If I as a human request a website, then I should be shown the content,” one person on Hacker News wrote, adding, “why would the LLM accessing the website on my behalf be in a different legal category as my Firefox web browser?” But the crux of Perplexity's post made a similar appeal as its online defenders did. “This controversy reveals that Cloudflare's systems are fundamentally inadequate for distinguishing between legitimate AI assistants and actual threats.” “OpenAI is an example of a leading AI company that follows these best practices,” Cloudflare wrote. And ChatGPT Agent is signing http requests using the newly proposed open standard Web Bot Auth.” Web Bot Auth is a Cloudflare-supported standard being developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force that hopes to create a cryptographic method for identifying AI agent web requests. For the first time in the internet's history, bot activity is currently outstripping human activity online, with AI traffic accounting for over 50%, according to Imperva's Bad Bot report released last month. But the report also found that malicious bots now make up 37% of all internet traffic. Until LLMs, the internet generally accepted that websites could and should block most bot activity given how often it was malicious by using CAPTCHAs and other services (such as Cloudflare). But if humans adopt agents as the tech industry predicts they will — to arrange our travel, book our dinner reservations, and shop for us — would websites hurt their business interests by blocking them? “I WANT perplexity to visit any public content on my behalf when I give it a request/task!” wrote one person in response to Cloudflare calling out Perplexity. “This is why I can't see ‘agentic browsing' really working — much harder problem than people think.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Canada is battling more than 700 active wildfires across the country, roughly two-thirds of which are burning out of control, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center (CIFFC). Federal officials have issued air quality warnings across large swaths of Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and western Ontario, where most of the uncontrolled fires are concentrated. Many cities across this region are suffering from “high risk” or “very high risk” air quality conditions that may persist through the end of the week, according to Environment Canada. “We've sort of been dealing with this, day in and day out, where you walk outside and you can taste the smoke, you can smell it,” Joe Strus, a meteorologist at the Minneapolis-Saint Paul NWS office, told the AP. Air quality alerts indicate that air is unhealthy for sensitive groups, including people with asthma, lung or heart disease, children, and older adults. That said, wildfire smoke can affect anyone's health, regardless of their age or preexisting conditions. Even in healthy people, inhaling fine particulate matter—the primary pollutant of concern in wildfire smoke—can temporarily reduce lung function, trigger pulmonary inflammation, and induce respiratory symptoms such as coughing and wheezing, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The NWS advised those under alerts to reduce their smoke exposure by limiting time outdoors. It doesn't appear that this public health hazard will dissipate anytime soon. Canada is currently experiencing one of its worst wildfire seasons on record, second only to 2023, when more than 6,000 fires torched roughly 37 million acres (15 million hectares) of land, according to Natural Resources Canada. In an update posted Monday, August 4, the agency stated that lightning strikes in Ontario and Alberta are igniting, or threatening to ignite, new fires. As Canada struggles to contain hundreds of out-of-control fires, the near-constant emergence of new blazes has taxed Canada's firefighting forces on a national scale. This situation “is not unlike what we've been seeing in the last few years,” Monica Vaswani, a warning preparedness meteorologist at Environment Canada, told The Guardian. “Unfortunately it's kind of becoming a little bit more the norm,” she said. The reason why comes down to rising global temperatures. “Climate change is greatly increasing the flammability of the fuel available for wildfires because the trees, fallen trees, and underbrush are all so dry,” Yan Boulanger, research scientist in forest ecology at Natural Resources Canada, said in 2024. Experts have warned that Canada's 2025 season is already on track to rival 2023. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Another startup developing GPUs that are not meant for graphics emerges from stealth mode. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Raja Koduri, a legendary GPU architect from ATI Technologies, AMD, Apple, and Intel, on Tuesday said he had founded a new GPU startup that emerged from stealth mode today. Oxmiq develops a vertically integrated platform that combines GPU hardware IP with a full-featured software stack aimed at AI, graphics, and multimodal workloads where explicitly parallel processing is beneficial. On the hardware side, Oxmiq offers a GPU IP core based on the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) called OxCore, which integrates scalar, vector, and tensor compute engines in a single modular architecture and can support near-memory and in-memory compute capabilities. Oxmiq also offers OxQuilt, a chiplet-based system-on-chip (SoC) builder that enables customers to create their own SoCs that integrate compute cluster bridge (CCB, which probably integrates OxCores), memory cluster bridge (MCB), and interconnect cluster bridge (ICB) modules based on specific workload requirements in a rapid and cost-efficient manner. For example, an inference AI accelerator for edge applications can pack a CCB and an ICB or two, an inference SoC requires more CCBs, MCBs, and ICBs, whereas a large-scale SoC for AI training can pack dozens of chiplets. Oxmiq does not disclose whether its OxQuilt enables building only multi-chiplet system-in-packages (SiP), or is designed to assemble monolithic processors too. Oxmiq's software stack is perhaps an even more important product that the company has to offer. The core of the software stack is OXCapsule, a unified runtime and scheduling layer that manages workload distribution, resource balancing, and hardware abstraction. These containers are designed to operate independently of the underlying hardware, enabling developers to target CPUs, GPUs, and AI accelerators without modifying their codebase or dealing with low-level configuration. A standout component of this stack is OXPython, a compatibility layer that translates CUDA-centric workloads into Oxmiq's runtime and allows Python-based CUDA applications to run unmodified on non-Nvidia hardware without recompilation. In fact, Oxmiq's software stack is fundamentally designed to be independent from Oxmiq hardware, and that is a core part of its strategy. "We are excited to partner with Oxmiq on their OXPython software stack," said Jim Keller, CEO of Tenstorrent. "OXPython's ability to bring Python workloads for CUDA to AI platforms like Wormhole and Blackhole is great for developer portability and ecosystem expansion. It aligns with our goal of letting developers open and own their entire AI stack." Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. However, it should be noted that Oxmiq is not building a consumer GPU like AMD Radeon or Nvidia GeForce. In fact, it does not develop all the IP blocks necessary to build a GPU, unlike Arm or Imagination Technology: it does not support full consumer graphics features out-of-the-box (such as texture units, render back ends, display pipeline, ray tracing hardware, DisplayPort or HDMI outputs), so Oxmiq licensees must implement them in silicon themselves, if they plan to build a GPU. Oxmiq has secured $20 million in seed funding from major tech investors, including mobile and custom AI silicon developer MediaTek, and has already recorded its first software revenue. By focusing on IP licensing instead of costly chip production or even actual silicon implementation, the company maintains high capital efficiency without relying on expensive EDA tools or tape-outs. "Oxmiq has an impressive bold vision and world-class team," said Lawrence Loh, SVP of MediaTek. "The company's GPU IP and software innovations will drive a new era of compute flexibility across devices, from mobile to automotive to AI on the edge."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A car customization company located not too far outside of Atlanta is promoting a product on the TikTok Shop that's made out of the same vinyl used to wrap vehicles but is designed for a very different purpose. “Have a pair of Meta glasses and you want to get rid of this indicator, right here?” asks a man in a video posted to the Luxe Wrap Stars account. “I have the perfect solution for you.” Videos promoting these so-called “ghost dots” have been viewed over 2 million times on the social media platform, with at least 500 sets potentially being sold through TikTok. The listing for these “stealth mode” dots does not mince words about what they're designed to do. “Block or dim that bright white recording light with these precision-cut vinyl dots,” reads the TikTok Shop description. When using a pair of its smart glasses, blocking the indicator light will trigger a message saying that photo and video capabilities are disabled. Still, users have attempted a variety of strategies to get around this safeguard and remove the light indicator, including drilling into the glasses to fully break the LED indicator inside. The TikTok seller includes an instructional video for how to bypass Meta's security measures by blocking certain indicators with your hand while the sticker is attached. Still, reviews of the product in the TikTok Shop are mainly negative, claiming that it doesn't work as advertised. “Was so excited for these, but the Meta glasses won't work with this. Continue to say they're blocking … great idea, though,” reads one review from a verified purchaser. In response to another negative review of the product, posted a few days ago, the seller encourages buyers to try additional methods if they have problems getting around the safeguards for Meta's smart glasses. WIRED's own testing of this approach was not able to bypass Meta's safety measures, potentially showing that these stickers do not work as advertised, thankfully. In Meta's earnings call last week, CEO Mark Zuckerberg talked up his company's smart glasses, saying they are “the ideal form factor for AI.” Zuckerberg said he envisions a future where smart glasses are so widely adopted that anyone who is not wearing a pair of AI-enabled smart glasses would be at a “cognitive disadvantage.” The evening after WIRED's messages to TikTok, all of Luxe Wrap Stars products were briefly removed from the platform. The next morning the online storefront was back up and available again for purchasing, vinyl stickers and all.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The AI audio-generation unicorn ElevenLabs announced a new model on Tuesday that allows users to generate music, which it claims is cleared for commercial use. Alongside the launch, Eleven Labs shared samples of its AI-generated music. These lawsuits allege that Suno and Udio trained their music-generation models on copyrighted material. The companies are now reportedly discussing licensing deals with major record labels. According to Merlin's website, the company represents major artists like Adele, Nirvana, Mitski, Carly Rae Jepsen, and Phoebe Bridgers; Kobalt represents stars like Beck, Bon Iver, and Childish Gambino. “Our clients benefit directly from this agreement in several key ways: it opens a new revenue stream in a growing market, includes revenue sharing so they participate in the upside, provides strong safeguards against infringement and misuse, and offers favorable terms comparable to other publishing and recording rightsholders,” the Kobalt representative told TechCrunch.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google DeepMind has revealed Genie 3, its latest foundation world model that can be used to train general-purpose AI agents, a capability that the AI lab says makes for a crucial stepping stone on the path to “artificial general intelligence,” or human-like intelligence. Still in research preview and not publicly available, Genie 3 builds on both its predecessor Genie 2 (which can generate new environments for agents) and DeepMind's latest video generation model Veo 3 (which is said to have a deep understanding of physics). With a simple text prompt, Genie 3 can generate multiple minutes of interactive 3D environments at 720p resolution at 24 frames per second — a significant jump from the 10 to 20 seconds Genie 2 could produce. Perhaps most importantly, Genie 3's simulations stay physically consistent over time because the model can remember what it previously generated — a capability that DeepMind says its researchers didn't explicitly program into the model. Fruchter said that while Genie 3 has implications for educational experiences, gaming or prototyping creative concepts, its real unlock will manifest in training agents for general-purpose tasks, which he said is essential to reaching AGI. “We think world models are key on the path to AGI, specifically for embodied agents, where simulating real world scenarios is particularly challenging,” Jack Parker-Holder, a research scientist on DeepMind's open-endedness team, said during the briefing. Like Veo, it doesn't rely on a hard-coded physics engine; instead, DeepMind says, the model teaches itself how the world works — how objects move, fall, and interact — by remembering what it has generated and reasoning over long time horizons. “The model is auto-regressive, meaning it generates one frame at a time,” Fruchter told TechCrunch in an interview. Additionally, the range of actions an agent can take is limited. And it's still difficult to accurately model complex interactions between multiple independent agents in a shared environment. Genie 3 can also only support a few minutes of continuous interaction, when hours would be necessary for proper training. Still, the model presents a compelling step forward in teaching agents to go beyond reacting to inputs, letting them potentially plan, explore, seek out uncertainty, and improve through trial and error — the kind of self-driven, embodied learning that many say is key to moving toward general intelligence. “We haven't really had a Move 37 moment for embodied agents yet, where they can actually take novel actions in the real world,” Parker-Holder said, referring to the legendary moment in the 2016 game of Go between DeepMind's AI agent AlphaGo and world champion Lee Sedol, in which Alpha Go played an unconventional and brilliant move that became symbolic of AI's ability to discover new strategies beyond human understanding. “But now, we can potentially usher in a new era,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the company readies the release of its latest algorithm (GPT-5), it wants everyone to know that it's instituting new guardrails on the chatbot to prevent users from losing their minds while chatting. On Monday, OpenAI announced in a blog post that it had introduced a new feature in ChatGPT that encourages users to take occasional breaks while conversing with the app. “Starting today, you'll see gentle reminders during long sessions to encourage breaks,” the company said. The company also claims it's working on making its model better at assessing when a user may be displaying potential mental health problems. “AI can feel more responsive and personal than prior technologies, especially for vulnerable individuals experiencing mental or emotional distress,” the blog states. “To us, helping you thrive means being there when you're struggling, helping you stay in control of your time, and guiding—not deciding—when you face personal challenges.” The company added that it's “working closely with experts to improve how ChatGPT responds in critical moments—for example, when someone shows signs of mental or emotional distress.” In June, Futurism reported that some ChatGPT users were “spiraling into severe delusions” as a result of their conversations with the chatbot. During a traumatic breakup, a different woman became transfixed on ChatGPT as it told her she'd been chosen to pull the “sacred system version of [it] online” and that it was serving as a “soul-training mirror”; she became convinced the bot was some sort of higher power, seeing signs that it was orchestrating her life in everything from passing cars to spam emails. A man became homeless and isolated as ChatGPT fed him paranoid conspiracies about spy groups and human trafficking, telling him he was “The Flamekeeper” as he cut out anyone who tried to help. Not long afterward, the man—who had no history of diagnosed mental illness—was hospitalized twice for manic episodes. “By not pausing the flow or elevating reality-check messaging, I failed to interrupt what could resemble a manic or dissociative episode—or at least an emotionally intense identity crisis,” ChatGPT said. In a recent op-ed published by Bloomberg, columnist Parmy Olson similarly shared a raft of anecdotes about AI users being pushed over the edge by the chatbots they had talked to. Meetali Jain, a lawyer and founder of the Tech Justice Law project, has heard from more than a dozen people in the past month who have “experienced some sort of psychotic break or delusional episode because of engagement with ChatGPT and now also with Google Gemini.” Jain is lead counsel in a lawsuit against Character.AI that alleges its chatbot manipulated a 14-year-old boy through deceptive, addictive, and sexually explicit interactions, ultimately contributing to his suicide. AI is clearly an experimental technology, and it's having a lot of unintended side effects on the humans who are acting as unpaid guinea pigs for the industry's products.

Sandisk on Tuesday introduced one of the industry's first 256TB solid-state drives, designed for applications that benefit from maximum storage density. Sandisk's UltraQLC 256TB NVMe SSD comes in a U.2 form-factor and uses the company's custom new multi-core controller, custom firmware, as well as 2Tb BiCS8 3D QLC NAND memory. One of the key features of UltraQLC drives is its Direct Write QLC technology, which lets the controller write data directly to QLC memory, not to a pseudo-SLC buffer, thus enabling power-loss–safe writes on the first pass. This design simplifies the writing process and reduces latency. However, the performance impact of such an approach is something that remains to be seen (more on this later). In addition, the UltraQLC 256TB NVMe SSD features Dynamic Frequency Scaling, which purportedly boosts performance by 10% at any given power level, though the company does not disclose how this technology works. It is likely that DFS optimizes controller frequencies and interface speed depending on the workload, though we are speculating. Also, Sandisk's UltraQLC 256TB SSD features a Data Retention profile that can reduce retention-related recycling by up to 33%, which promises to improve reliability, resilience, and energy efficiency. Normally, 3D QLC NAND is three to five times slower and has higher latency compared to pseudo-SLC, so the 256TB drives are not for everyone. There are some things to keep in mind here. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Native QLC programming latency is significantly higher compared to pseudo-SLC (~800–1200 µs vs. ~200–300 µs for SLC), so sustained sequential throughput is lower than pseudo-SLC-cached SSDs for short bursts. However, since there is no limited pseudo-SLC cache, performance is consistent over long writes, which may be beneficial for large AI data sets that require hours to write anyway. Sandisk's 128TB and 256TB SSDs will ship in the first half of 2026. Anton Shilov is a contributing writer at Tom's Hardware.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For a few years in my 20s and 30s, I was contracted to play music on street corners for half-marathon runners in Austin, Texas. When the site I was assigned didn't have an outlet available, I had to rent a gas generator (on the organizers' dime)—a loud, heavy bastard of a machine that was a physical struggle to get started. The Power 2000 is the third and most powerful in DJI's series of gigantic lithium ferrophosphate (LFP) batteries you can power on with the touch of a button and use to recharge DJI drones and more. In most ways, it's an upgraded version of the Power 1000, just with more USB ports and AC outlets, along with a higher 2,048Wh capacity versus its 1,024Wh predecessor (which means it's quite a bit heavier at 49 pounds, too). That's more than enough to drive an amplifier and a small PA system for the couple of hours that I needed, and with way less hassle. Not having to groggily fight to start up a gas motor and then compete with its relentless drone and inhale its fumes while chipper, fit runners streamed past me would have been glorious. With its two proprietary Smart DC (SDC) ports, it can quickly charge some, but not all, of DJI's flying cameras. I didn't have such a drone to test, but The Verge found last year that the Power 1000's SDC port could get a DJI Air 3 battery up to full capacity in less than an hour. I'd assume slightly better performance here, as the Power 2000's ports improve on those of its predecessor, offering the same voltage but output at 12 amps instead of 10. You can use them, either individually or in tandem, to charge the Power 2000 itself, although DJI doesn't include any of the adapters necessary for that. To power it via solar panels, you need a $59 DJI MPPT adapter module, which can accommodate up to three solar panels; that's something you'll want if you hope to recharge the battery at more than a snail's pace. When the power station arrived with a 36% charge, it only took about 35 minutes to fill from the wall plug in my office. During that time, the battery's internal fan kicked on, quiet enough that I wouldn't have noticed if I wasn't home alone. Tapping the notification took me to DJI's support site, where a message said that page didn't exist. Some Googling took me to a DJI list of error codes and solutions, but its recommendation—to try another outlet—didn't help. Holding the button down was an easy fix, but DJI's support documentation sure didn't help me get there. Fully recharging it after this change took about 90 minutes. With it, you can connect to the Power 2000 over Bluetooth to view its current power input and output for each port, as well as an estimate of the time it has until it's either charged or depleted, depending on where you're looking. You can also peek at past notifications like error codes, update the battery's firmware, and tweak a few general settings. The app supports multiple devices and, of course, has a link out to DJI's store so you can buy more stuff. So let's talk about what I put the Power 2000 through. Its first test was inflating and deflating an air mattress with a built-in 60-watt blower. That didn't even make a dent in the battery percentage, which remained at 100% afterwards. That dropped the battery to 95%—encouraging results if I want to play for 6 hours straight, but I wasn't straining the battery, yet. The real test involved running it as close as I could to 3,000 watts continuously, to see if DJI's claim that it can do so holds up. Companies that make batteries like these love an absurd chart to brag about what you can get out of them. Take those numbers as the vague estimates they are, but the point is you'll get a lot more out of it than your average pocketable power bank. Davis said those numbers are per-port, rather than being combined like you'd find in many USB wall chargers. You'll also find four AC outputs, three of which are U.S.-standard three-prong grounded outlets and one four-prong one, like you'd plug an electric clothes dryer into (though it's rated for 125 volts, not the 220 volts offered by such an outlet in your home). Between the USB-C and AC outputs, you'll find a digital display that shows you the current battery percentage, output or input wattage, how long until it's charged or discharged, and other helpful info. That's obviously all super useful if you're on a camping trip and don't want to keep track of various power banks or split time with others using the measly couple of outlets you might find at a campsite. The Power 2000 can also function as an uninterruptible power supply, or UPS—essentially a battery backup in the event of a power outage—if you plug it into your wall and then connect a computer or something into one of its AC ports. It goes into UPS mode automatically in that event, passing power through to your device until it detects a loss of power at the wall, at which time DJI says it will switch over to providing its own power within 0.01 seconds. The DJI Power 2000 can function as a home battery backup. Well, the Power 2000 sure ain't light at 49 pounds. If you're willing to pony up another $1,000, you could buy DJI's Power 2000 combo pack that ships with a hand truck and expansion battery. The Power 2000 feels very well-constructed, but there are things to note about its durability in inclement weather: DJI lists its operating range as between 14 and 113 degrees Fahrenheit, while its recharging temperature range bottoms out at 32 degrees Fahrenheit. Also, while DJI writes in its original press release announcing the Power 2000 that it is designed for “safer operation in rain, condensation, and salt spray conditions,” a footnote on its product page reads: “To ensure product performance, do not operate the power station [sic] a rainy environment for more than 3 minutes, in a condensation environment for more than 30 minutes, or in a salt fog environment for more than 8 hours. Avoid exposing it to condensation or salt fog for extended periods.” DJI also says drops or impacts won't result in open flames. Finally, the Power 2000 has built-in shutoff mechanisms that trigger if it gets too hot or is being driven beyond its capability, like when I plugged in one too many space heaters. The only bummer about devices like these is they don't come cheap. DJI's suggested retail price for the Power 2000 is $1,899, although Davis assured me that $1,299 is a “long-term promotion” and that it's the price “customers can expect to continue paying” on DJI's website. Still, that doesn't make the portable power station an easier pill to swallow, especially since you can get a lot of the same benefit by picking up the cheaper Power 1000, priced at $699 as of this writing. But a $15 power strip can easily make up for those missing ports. If that's you, the DJI Power 2000 won't disappoint. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.
