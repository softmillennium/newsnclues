                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The SEC issued its latest crypto-focused exemptive statement Tuesday, formally greenlighting the activities of liquid staking providers, including issuing staking tokens and paying users financial rewards. The announcement comes two months after the agency issued a similar statement exempting self-custodial staking with a third party, self-staking, and custodial staking from securities regulation. "Today's guidance on liquid staking shows the same nuanced understanding of [liquid-staking-token] technology that the Crypto Task Force exhibited when we met with them on this topic back in February," Jito Labs CEO Lucas Bruder told Decrypt. "We are gratified to have worked with so many other in the industry, across ecosystems, in collaboration with the SEC on this important topic," he said. DeFi applications are the lifeblood of the on-chain economy, enabling users to interact with, buy, borrow, lend or sell crypto assets without giving up control of their assets to a custodian or disclosing personal information like names and addresses. Projects like Lido and Jito have accumulated vast amounts of the world's top cryptocurrencies by offering such services. Lido, for instance, currently holds over $31 billion worth of ETH, according to DeFi Llama—making it the largest player across all of decentralized finance generally, and handily the top ETH staker globally. Today's SEC statement makes explicit that in offering staking tokens like stETH, and paying out ETH staking rewards to customers, liquid stakers like Lido are explicitly not engaging in securities offerings, and do not need to register with the SEC to continue providing such services. Other statements in recent months have exempted crypto mining, meme coin trading, and stablecoins from the agency's purview. Those moves have accompanied a shutdown of nearly every crypto-focused lawsuit and investigation instigated under previous administrations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a new staff statement, the SEC clarifies that certain crypto liquid staking practices do not constitute securities offerings, marking a step toward clearer digital asset regulation. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has clarified that certain cryptocurrency liquid staking activities do not constitute securities offerings, a notable step in the agency's ongoing effort to provide clearer guidance on digital asset regulation. In its Staff Statement, the SEC defined liquid staking as the process of staking digital assets through a protocol and receiving a “liquid staking receipt token,” which serves as evidence of the staker's ownership. “Today's staff statement on liquid staking is a significant step forward in clarifying the staff's view about crypto asset activities that do not fall within the SEC's jurisdiction,” SEC Chair Paul Atkins said in a statement. The SEC's clarification comes amid rising institutional interest in liquid staking exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with firms like Jito Labs, VanEck and Bitwise urging the agency to approve liquid staking strategies for Solana (SOL)-based funds. Liquid staking has become one of the largest subsectors in crypto, with total value locked (TVL) nearing $67 billion across all protocols, according to DefiLlama. As SEC Chair Paul Atkins noted last week, the project was developed in response to recommendations from the White House's Working Group on Digital Assets Since taking office, Atkins has led a more lenient approach to digital asset regulation, moving away from the agency's prior “regulation by enforcement” stance under former Chair Gary Gensler. Under Atkins' leadership, the SEC has also taken meaningful steps to ease regulatory burdens on cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Notably, on July 29, the agency approved in-kind creations and redemptions for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) ETFs, allowing authorized participants to exchange ETF shares directly for the underlying assets rather than cash. The US crypto industry is also gaining momentum from sweeping policy reforms designed to make digital assets more accessible.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Phantom, the leading wallet on the Solana blockchain, said it has acquired SolSniper, an advanced on-chain trading terminal for memecoins and NFTs. The deal, announced 4 Aug., is Phantom's fourth acquisition in 16 months and is intended to accelerate the company's plan to evolve from a wallet into what it calls a comprehensive consumer-finance platform. The platform offers automated sniping, wallet tracking and analytics designed for rapid execution on Solana's low-latency network—features Phantom intends to embed directly into its wallet for a more sophisticated trading experience. The deal deepens Phantom's push into higher-margin trading services. Phantom's own perpetual-futures product has generated about $1.5 million in fees on $3.11 billion in volume during the past month, according to Flowscan. “Combining SolSniper's advanced feature set with Phantom's infrastructure and distribution will help us build for and serve entirely new audiences,” said Brandon Millman, Phantom's co-founder and chief executive. Phantom has been on an acquisition spree, previously buying blockchain indexer Simplehash in February 2025 and earlier snapping up security firm Blowfish and embedded-wallet provider BitSki. The latest purchase reflects a broader trend on Solana, where companies such as Jupiter and Kamino Finance are bundling multiple DeFi services under a single brand to capture a growing base of on-chain traders.

On July 30, 2025, the UK Information Commissioner's Office (“ICO”) launched a consultation seeking feedback on its draft guidance concerning the use of profiling tools for online safety (the “Guidance”). The Guidance aims to assist organizations with their compliance with the UK Online Safety Act 2023 (“OSA”), the UK General Data Protection Regulation (the “UK GDPR”), and the UK Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 (“PECR”), outlining the data protection and privacy considerations organizations should take into account when utilizing profiling tools in trust and safety systems.

The Guidance is divided into different sections, highlighting several critical issues that organizations should consider, such as:

Organizations have until October 31, 2025, to provide the ICO with feedback on the Guidance.  </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This follows a series of pilot programmes first launched in 2023 by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the “Digital HKD Plus” initiative, aimed at integrating central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) into everyday finance. The new round of testing, which included nearly 500 participants and more than 1,500 simulated transactions, focused on real-life applications, further accelerating the CBDC's readiness for public deployment. In the latest pilot concluded on August 5, the Bank of China Hong Kong (BOCHK) issued unified digital wallets to approximately 500 test participants. Identity verification was required before activation, aligning with Hong Kong's regulatory standards on anti-money laundering and user authentication. The wallets were powered by BOCHK's proprietary alliance blockchain, with full integration into multiple mobile banking applications. These were used to complete purchases at local coffee shops across the city, providing a retail-focused setting to evaluate payment speed, system stability, and transaction authentication. In those trials, BOCHK and HKMA explored the use of e-HKD in programmable finance, government grant distribution, offline payments, tokenised asset settlement, and digital retail transactions. Alongside CBDC development, Hong Kong is also setting legal foundations for the broader digital asset space. On August 1, the city's first stablecoin legislation officially came into effect, introducing a unified licensing and regulatory framework for fiat-backed stablecoin issuers. This framework aims to ensure financial stability and investor protection while allowing regulated digital currencies to coexist with public sector CBDCs. In addition, the Hong Kong government released its second digital asset policy statement this year, reinforcing its commitment to building a “full-fledged digital ecosystem.” The statement outlined key focus areas such as local adoption, compliance infrastructure, and market development. As the e-HKD moves through its pilot stages, the combination of private stablecoin regulation and government-backed digital currency experimentation positions Hong Kong as a dual-track leader in Asia's rapidly evolving digital finance landscape.</p>

Price action remained volatile between $2.83 and $3.11, with short-term upside stalling at resistance levels while volumes surged past 110 million XRP — including a $33 million one-minute transaction that spooked order books. For traders, the news was mostly background noise — as XRP's price held firm above $3.00 and saw liquidity bursts typically associated with large players moving in and out of the asset.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Figure Technology Solutions has confidentially submitted a draft registration statement with the SEC for a proposed initial public offering (IPO) of its equity securities, expected to launch in 2025. The confidential SEC filing is yet another significant milestone for Figure, which has been developing blockchain-based financial products since its founding under Cagney's leadership. The IPO filing builds on Figure's ongoing efforts to introduce an interest-bearing stablecoin that would operate as a regulated security under U.S. law. Figure filed its initial draft registration statement for this stablecoin project in October through its subsidiary, Figure Certificate Co., seeking to register the tokens as “face-amount certificates.” The proposed stablecoin would break from traditional models by offering 1 cent redemption value per certificate rather than the standard 1:1 dollar peg, meaning 100 certificates would equal $1. Interest would accrue daily and be paid monthly to holders, with returns generated from reserves including treasury securities, commercial paper, corporate debt, and other investment-grade assets. Beyond the stablecoin initiative, Figure is simultaneously pursuing registration of Figure Installment Certificates, an investment product targeting investors who want to earn yields while holding digital assets. Figure's move follows Circle Internet Financial's spectacular NYSE debut in June, when the USDC stablecoin issuer's shares surged 160% on their first trading day. That explosive performance appears to have opened the floodgates for crypto companies seeking public market validation and capital. Each filing has built upon the precedent Circle established, suggesting that regulated crypto infrastructure companies may have found their moment to access traditional capital markets. Yet the sustainability of this IPO wave remains uncertain, particularly as the crypto market's $4 trillion valuation invites questions about whether current enthusiasm can support multiple high-profile public debuts. The regulatory environment under President Trump's crypto-friendly administration has certainly provided tailwinds, but market conditions remain volatile enough to challenge even well-positioned companies. The company's unique positioning in both stablecoin innovation and yield-generating products could differentiate it from other crypto IPO candidates, though approval for its regulatory-compliant stablecoin remains uncertain.

Gleichzeitig bleibt Silo Pharma seinem biopharmazeutischen Fokus treu, wobei das PTSD-Medikament SPC-15 kurz vor der Einreichung des FDA IND-Antrags steht. Targeting Multi-Chain Digital Asset Growth and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Integration SARASOTA, FL, Aug.  05, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  Silo Pharma, Inc. (Nasdaq: SILO), today announced the launch of a cryptocurrency treasury strategy which is expected to focus on leading digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Expanded implementation of this strategy is anticipated to be based on available capital and market conditions. Silo has appointed digital asset tech pioneer, Corwin Yu, as the first member of its newly formed Crypto Advisory Board to lead this new strategy. To further this initiative, Silo has recently acquired market intelligence technology powered by artificial intelligence, equipping the team with real-time insights to potentially drive smarter, faster decision-making. “With the recent rise of successful cryptocurrency treasury allocations, and increasing capital inflows to digital assets, we believe there is an opportunity to potentially create and unlock long-term value for Silo's stockholders, starting now,” said Silo CEO Eric Weisblum. “We believe that we are fortunate to appoint Corwin Yu as our lead strategic advisor and head of a newly formed three-member advisory board overseeing our crypto treasury strategy, with 2 other members to be appointed in the future.” Corwin Yu is a senior technology and trading executive with over 20 years of experience building and managing mission-critical systems for institutional finance. In addition to these leadership roles, his prior experience spanned PIMCO, Credit Suisse, hedge funds and digital asset firms. As a proven leader in cryptocurrency trading infrastructure, fund management, and regulatory compliance, Mr. Yu has an extensive background in deploying scalable cloud-native platforms and overseeing cross-asset trading strategies. “Alongside our launching of a digital asset treasury strategy, we remain deeply committed to our core biopharmaceutical enterprise focused on innovative therapeutics for underserved conditions,” Mr. Weisblum continued. “Our lead asset, PTSD drug SPC-15, is completing final studies before submitting an FDA investigational new drug (IND) application, and if such IND is approved we would look to commence a first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial.” Its therapeutic focus is on addressing underserved conditions, including stress-induced psychiatric disorders, chronic pain, and central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Silo's research is conducted in collaboration with leading universities and laboratories.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Why HIVE Digital's Green Bitcoin Mining Strategy Is Winning Big With AI Companies that began as pure Bitcoin miners are increasingly repositioning themselves as diversified digital infrastructure providers, addressing both emerging technology demands and environmental concerns. A long-time advocate for Bitcoin mining's strategic role in modern energy markets, Holmes also serves as CEO and Chief Investment Officer of U.S. Holmes has helped shape HIVE's growth from high-efficiency Bitcoin mining into one of the leanest data center infrastructures now optimized for growing AI workloads. In a recent interview with CCN, he discussed this transformation and how HIVE is positioning itself at the intersection of blockchain, AI and sustainable computing. Holmes explained that the Nasdaq listing was primarily about exposure and institutional access. Holmes mentioned that “the Nasdaq gave us exposure,” he said. “A lot of global family offices, institutions will not buy Canadian-listed stock. HIVE was early to integrate green energy into its mining operations. Holmes emphasized that this approach created competitive advantages beyond environmental benefits. “Intel reached out to us because we were green,” he said. Holmes added that Hive facilities, designed for energy and thermal efficiency, have value beyond Bitcoin. These are not warehouses with computers and fans,” Holmes said. Holmes also pointed to their latest expansion explaining how HIVE is operating in Paraguay. Each location reinforces HIVE's approach to building sustainable, high-performance infrastructure across borders,” Holmes explained. He also noted that hydro remains his preferred energy source for long-term operations. You don't have the same disruptions as with solar or wind,” he said. “When it rains, that dam is full and we've got energy. You can't say the same with wind or clouds.” Each location, he explained, reinforces HIVE's approach to building sustainable, high-performance infrastructure across borders. Holmes explained that traditional Bitcoin rigs don't adapt well to diversified compute, this means that most Bitcoin mining rigs, typically ASICs, are designed solely for one function, hashing SHA-256. When asked if declining Bitcoin transaction fees or on-chain activity is risky to HIVE's mining model, Holmes replied, “Think short term, yes. Long term, no.” He noted that while short-term fluctuations can affect daily revenue, they don't undermine Bitcoin mining's long-term value. Holmes emphasized just how capital-intensive AI infrastructure has become. “It costs ten times more to build an AI compute facility than a Bitcoin mining site,” he said. “That creates a serious moat, only those already operating at scale can afford to reallocate resources and compete.” “We make nearly $900,000 a day in revenue with just 25 employees. He added that with over $6 million in annual revenue per employee, HIVE's efficiency rivals top-tier tech companies like Nvidia, in annual revenue per employee, a byproduct of its refusal to scale through excessive HR or marketing spend. When asked about expanding into solo or consumer-facing mining, Holmes was direct: While HIVE has the technical capacity to support such operations, Holmes made it clear that retail infrastructure isn't part of the company's focus. Holmes also acknowledges that “while HIVE scales its operations, it's equally disciplined about what not to pursue.” According to Holmes, today's energy-efficient, thermally optimized mining sites are quietly laying the foundation for tomorrow's high-demand compute infrastructure. “In those cases, an outsourced compute becomes a liability.” HIVE's long-term strategy is rooted in controlling the full physical stack, such as power, chips, cooling and location, that enables advanced computing. Bitcoin mining, Holmes said, was simply the economic catalyst that made these sites viable. “Bitcoin mining created the initial economic logic,” he explained. “But the next chapter is about leveraging them as sovereign-ready infrastructure.” From early builds in Iceland to recent expansion into Paraguay, HIVE has consistently focused on green-powered, energy-stable regions, not just for mining, but for building real compute infrastructure. Whether it's securing Bitcoin or preparing for a sovereign AI-driven future, Holmes made one thing clear: HIVE is building for more than just this cycle.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump signals tariff plans, Fed chair candidates, China deal progress Tech analyst warns AMD stock has run ahead of itself as company prepares to report Bitcoin price today: little changed at $114k amid macro uncertainty, Ether upbeat Up 23%+ in two sessions, this satellite stock looks poised for further upside The crypto market ended its five-week winning streak with a drop of over 5% last week. Bitcoin performed worse than the overall market, and altcoins fell even more, with an average decline of 8%. Still, they have not yet broken through key resistance levels needed to confirm a new upward trend. As August began, buying interest from this lower level pushed prices back up, but the recovery has been slow and cautious. Data from Santiment shows a rise in the number of wallets holding 10,000 ETH or more. Still, Ethereum is having a hard time breaking past the $3,900 resistance. This shows that broader concerns—like the US economic outlook and global trade tensions—are making investors more cautious. Right now though, buying pressure still looks too weak to break through. The daily Stochastic RSI shows there could be another attempt to move past $3,700. If that happens, prices could fall toward $3,000, and possibly even to $2,500. In short, Ethereum's short- to medium-term outlook depends on how long institutional buying continues. But overall, macroeconomic factors are still the biggest influence on whether ETH breaks out of its current range. Solana failed to hold above $200 in late July and entered a deeper correction. The daily Stochastic RSI is starting to turn upward, but a stronger signal will come if SOL climbs above $172. Litecoin ended its correction quickly in late July, finding strong support at $105 in early August and showing stronger performance than the rest of the market. If there is profit-taking, the price could pull back to around $115. So the $115–$125 range will act as a key support zone for now. The $130–$135 range, which was tested earlier this year, is now a major resistance zone. But if it fails to break this resistance, short-term gains could quickly disappear.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Burleigh is a reporter at Fortune, covering success, careers, entrepreneurship, and personal finance. Emma has also written for publications including the Observer and The China Project, publishing long-form stories on culture, entertainment, and geopolitics. She has a joint-master's degree from New York University in Global Journalism and East Asian Studies. But what is it like to be a top executive when you're off the clock? Fortune's series, The Good Life, shows how up-and-coming leaders spend their time and money outside of work. Today we meet Eric Chen, the CEO and cofounder of financial blockchain Injective Foundation. Hype around cryptocurrency has been growing for years, and Wall Street is now finally embracing it. Chen's company provides investors a secure platform to reinvent global markets; he says his layer 1 blockchain is one of the largest crypto networks ever built, leading the industry in user activity, transactions, and monetary volume. Since its 2018 inception, Injective has processed more than 2 billion on-chain transactions, with over 1.5 million wallets on the system. It has raised $56 million from major investors such as Binance, BitGo, Pantera, Jump—and even ex–Shark Tank billionaire investor Mark Cuban. “The mission is simple: to create a truly free and fair financial system through decentralization,” Chen tells Fortune. “It does so by giving every builder, financial institution, and user the tools they need to reinvent global markets in a fully transparent and permission-less manner.” Over the past seven years, Injective has grown to a $1.34 billion company—and at 26 years old, Chen is just getting started. More impressively, he launched the company at just 19 while enrolled in New York University. Chen was studying finance and mining Ethereum in his dorm room, all while interning at Innovating Capital on a hedge fund desk. Injective has since made leaps in progress; Deutsche Telekom, T-Mobile's telecoms arm, joined as a validator, bringing Fortune 500–quality network infrastructure. Cboe Global Markets—the largest options exchange in America—also submitted a request to list the fund, signaling strong institutional interest and placing Injective among networks with potential U.S.-listed ETFs. Because of his business's massive growth, Chen says he can't remember a time when he was fully away from his work. The CEO's fun luxury gadgets—including a $2,900 mattress cover, Oura ring, and racing simulator—help keep him sane, he says, in the thick of his busy schedule. He never buys groceries, opting to eat out in New York City or DoorDash his food. Taking very few swanky vacations, he lives a globe-trotting lifestyle through his business, with trips to Seoul, London, Toronto, Abu Dhabi, and Singapore this year. Fortune: What's been the best investment you've ever made? It enables me to be maximally efficient with sleep and minimize chances of productivity drop-off due to poor sleep quality. I wouldn't say there's been a single “worst” investment so far. Every decision, whether it's worked out or not, has taught me something valuable and shaped how I think going forward. I try to approach everything with a learning mindset, which helps turn even the less successful bets into long-term upside. I live in New York, so my commute is usually a quick walk from home to the office. Fiat [government tender, like the U.S. dollar] is dying so I actually never carry any cash! I mainly only buy and hold crypto via apps on Injective. I dollar-cost-average into my favorite assets and use various programmable AI-driven bots to automate most trades, since I'm normally very caught up with work to follow the markets closely these days. There are many great resources online including tutorials, videos, and forums that can help you build a strong foundation. Most platforms also offer paper trading, which allows you to practice with simulated money and no real financial risk. Use that experience to gain confidence before investing actual funds. What personal finance advice would you give your 20-year-old self? What's the one subscription you can't live without? It's great for tracking daily calories and sleep, which honestly is a godsend. How do you get your daily coffee fix? Like with my workouts, I try to be pretty disciplined about stepping away from my desk for lunch when I can. Most days, I'll eat in our communal office kitchen. That said, there are definitely days when things are nonstop and I end up eating at my desk or on the go. I live off of meal prep and DoorDash most days. How often in a week do you dine out versus cook at home? About 90% of the time, I end up eating out between work meetings, dinners, or just taking advantage of being in New York. There's always something new to try, and so many great spots nearby. One of my favorites right now is Barlume, a Mediterranean place near our office that I go to pretty regularly. Where do you shop for your work wardrobe? What would be a typical work outfit for you? It really depends on what the day calls for. Are you the proud owner of any futuristic gadgets? I'm not sure if it counts as futuristic, but my guilty pleasure is definitely the racing simulator I have at home. How do you unwind from the top job? It's one of the few things that really helps me unplug and reenergize. Even just hitting for an hour clears my head and gives me a second wind. What's the best bonus treat you've bought yourself? I usually don't buy myself anything physical as a reward, to be quite honest. My next vacation will actually be to Northern Macedonia to attend the wedding of one of our original Injective developers. It's a special full-circle moment, and I'm excited to celebrate with someone who's been part of the journey since the early days. Usually my “vacations” are just work conferences around the world. This year alone, I will have been in Seoul, London, Toronto, Abu Dhabi, and Singapore for talks I am giving. How many days of annual leave do you take a year? Even when I might be at a friend's housewarming or visiting a new city, I am 24/7 terminally online. Fortune wants to hear from business leaders on what their “Good Life” looks like.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to the trader, both altcoins and BTC could see staggering price drops that see them cut in half – or more. However, according to Capo, investors appear to be gobbling up the flagship crypto asset during dips despite signs of an impending crash. The risk of a black swan event is still high. If it happens, we could see BTC drop to $60,000-$70,000 and altcoins crashing 50-80%. Near the end of July, Capo warned investors that altcoin season has yet to begin and that a shakeout is required before it does. “If you're wondering why your alts aren't really going up, it's because the altseason hasn't started yet, and it's likely we'll see another big shakeout before it does… There will be a time to get very bullish. There will be a time when altcoins pump hard for weeks. Bitcoin is trading for $114,966 at time of writing, a fractional decrease during the last 24 hours.

James Howells, the man who has been hunting down his lost hard drive containing 8,000 BTC, addressed circulating reports claiming that he has given up on his 12-year search. In 2013, a British IT engineer accidentally threw out his hard drive containing Bitcoin he had mined a few years earlier, which ended up in a landfill site in Newport. Howells explored other options, such as using AI to help locate the hard drive. With today's bitcoin price of $114,231, Howell's lost hard drive is worth around $915 million. Earlier this week, several social media posts emerged saying that Howells has officially ended his quest to recover the lost bitcoin. "No, I have not 'given up," Howells told The Block via direct message on social media platform X. Howells explained that on July 1, he made a formal offer of between $33 million and $40 million in value to acquire and excavate the Newport landfill site, sent to the Newport City Council's leader, legal team and a member of its parliament. To raise funds for the acquisition, Howells had announced plans to launch an Ordinals-based token in October, representing 21% of the lost wallet's value. "So here's where we stand — If they won't sell, there's no need for a token sale to buy the landfill," Howells said. "I am no longer pursuing the purchase of the landfill, I am no longer pursuing excavation or remediation, I am no longer pursuing dialogue with the council or its representatives." Howells said he has simply "pivoted" his strategy, but has not given up on his lost bitcoin, as he remains the legal owner of the 8,000 BTC, citing a High Court ruling in January this year. Howells said now he is planning to tokenize his legal ownership of the lost 8,000 BTC into a new Bitcoin Layer 2 smart token named Ceiniog Coin (INI), utilizing the upcoming network update that removes the 80-byte cap on the OP_RETURN opcode in bitcoin transactions to free up space for more functionality. The token is slated for launch after October, and an ICO is planned for later in the year, Howells added. The Block has reached out to Howells for further comment on how his new Ceiniog coin plan affects his ultimate goal of retrieving the lost bitcoin.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Market analysts suggest that, while short-term volatility persists, Bitcoin's broader outlook remains influenced by whale activity and long-term holder behavior. Recent on-chain data provided by CryptoQuant highlights significant movement among high-volume Bitcoin traders. Over 30 million BTC have moved through Binance in both inflows and outflows, far exceeding figures recorded on competing platforms such as HTX Global and Kraken. While volume alone highlights the scale of transactions, Binance's leadership becomes even clearer when measuring transaction count. Data indicates more than 56 million whale transactions have taken place on Binance, compared to roughly 16 million on HTX, making it the most active platform for high-frequency, large-scale trades. This dominance suggests Binance provides unmatched liquidity for big players in the market. As Crazzyblockk noted, “The concentration of whale activity on Binance provides it with unparalleled liquidity. For traders, this means tighter spreads and a greater ability to execute large orders with minimal price impact.” The findings indicate that monitoring Binance's order book can offer valuable insights into institutional sentiment and potential market movements. While whale activity dominates short-term price movements, broader market sentiment remains supported by long-term holders (LTH). Another CryptoQuant analyst, Abrahamchart, pointed out that long-term investors continue to hold significant unrealized profits, with the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) ratio staying above 0.5. This indicates that long-term holders are not rushing to sell, helping sustain price support near the $104,000 range. Short-term holders (STH), on the other hand, appear to be taking profits during rallies, contributing to temporary selling pressure and minor corrections such as the latest dip below $113,000.</p>
