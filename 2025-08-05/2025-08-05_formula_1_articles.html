                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Yuki Tsunoda insisted that the gap he has to Red Bull team mate Max Verstappen has continued "to close" as he revealed car damage played its part in a disappointing Hungarian Grand Prix result. However, he was unable to make progress as damage picked up midway through the Grand Prix hampered his efforts on his way to a P17 result. While Verstappen also had a disappointing race in finishing ninth, Tsunoda's result means he has not scored for seven races and he still has just three top-10 finishes in Grands Prix since joining Red Bull. “The gurney flap fell off halfway through and that cost us a lot of pace and worsening grip, so we then lost the ability to make a positive strategy call that would benefit us.” “Also, something we can improve a lot communication wise is that if I was fighting for the points, there was a situation that could cost quite big,” he added. “It has happened the last two weeks, the last two races back-to-back in a row so it is starting to get very frustrating with that. Something we have to improve a lot and fight hard the second half.” For example, since he got his hands on the RB21 floor upgrade to make his car the same spec as Max Verstappen's, his pace has improved – even if results do not reflect that at this stage. “Looking back on the season so far, I can feel pretty positive, we've made progress, especially since the new floor upgrades were brought to Spa," he continued. "The gap with Max continues to close, it may not feel like we are getting there but on paper we are only one tenth off his pace. I'm not sure many other drivers could get as close to him. It's frustrating but we will stay positive and bounce back stronger."</p>
