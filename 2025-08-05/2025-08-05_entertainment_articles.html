                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With dozens of films and series and decades of Marvel comic continuity to draw from, the limited series is a welcome cul-de-sac off the MCU superhighway—and one that should be traveled more often. Reaching into the past and possibilities of an established (and under-developed) entity in the African nation of Wakanda allows Marvel, through Eyes Of Wakanda's stylish animation, to shade in its world even as the MCU proper cruises ahead with more high-profile and impossible to ignore mega-projects. Startlingly introduced by a chyron placing the series in 13th-century Greece, the show's four installments each take place in a different time period spanning some 600 years. The premiere shows how the temptation to extend vibranium-fueled influence outside that country's borders means being inevitably tainted, as a loyal female agent battles a legendary former War Dog turned pirate king and slaver. The Hatut Zeraze enforce Wakanda's unbreakable code of isolation because, in the advanced and judgmental Wakandans' eyes, people (meaning everyone not Wakandan) are too irresponsible, violent, and untrustworthy to handle such power as they possess. This exercise in retroactive world-building could indeed be leading up to a more nuanced and complex series of Wakandan stories, of course, even if there are at present no plans for a continuation. In Ryan Coogler and showrunner Todd Harris' choice to spin out the story of the Wakanda the former helped establish in two major MCU blockbusters, this relatively humble (a reported $20 million in Marvel money) project stubbornly resists obvious expansion or commercial exploitation. Lovingly crafted but lacking go-to playset potential in its thoughtful depiction of the past and its conflicted heroes, there's something smacking of—dare it be suggested—art above commerce going on here. Coogler's MCU success, both commercial and critical, allowed him that freedom. As more and more heroes, villains, nations, and even entire worlds are ground up in the MCU content shredder, there's plenty of opportunity for creators to sift through the rubble. Sadly, editorial has likely rendered some elements irrecoverable—there are no doubt fans disappointed to see a C-list character they've always been drawn toward reduced to a one-dimensional nemesis or sidekick. Just take a look at Mantis: While James Gunn and Pom Klementieff's empathic naif and amusingly blank comic foil is an endearing minor Guardian of the Galaxy, those familiar with the comic character's richly overstuffed backstory as martial arts master turned Celestial Madonna no doubt lament the simplification. But Marvel fairly bristles with unspoken stories around the fringes of each successive (and fairly supervillainous-sounding) phase of its world-conquering entertainment onslaught. And while it's unlikely we ever would have seen a full Mantis movie, an MCU where superpowers burst out of every radioactive canister, spider bite, or random mutation (here come those mutants!) leaves plenty of C- and D-listers to build a minor-key character piece around. Promisingly, Phase Six's upcoming Wonder Man TV series looks to be nodding in that direction. Simon Williams (embodied in the show by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) is decidedly B-list at most, an ion-powered bruiser with action-hero aspirations and a ridiculously convoluted backstory (that's streamlined for the series). With its mix of showbiz satire and superhero action, this Wonder Man is no doubt prepping for his turn in the Avengers spotlight. (That government cleanup crew Damage Control somehow plays into Wonder Man's adventures is promising as well. A world economy needing to factor in routine January 6-level supervillain catastrophes would make for an intriguing watch, right?) A bracingly contemplative smash-em-up, the film was all C-list, as MCU cast-offs, also-rans, and fallen would-be icons banded together to overcome their own imposter syndrome insecurities and  Julia Louis-Dreyfus' deliciously scheming Valentina Allegra de Fontaine to inevitably save the world. Thunderbolts* ends with a media montage of worldwide skepticism about this scruffy group's ability to fill the vacant Avengers' boots, and the collective meagerness of its superpowers lends an air of unaccustomed risk and narrative possibilities to the ongoing mission. Hints about Sam Wilson's resurgent Captain America reforming the “real” Avengers is one thing. We don't know why the Fantastic Four of First Steps is rocketing into “our” skies, but as much as 616 needs its own FF at this point, it's understandable to have a twinge of disappointment at the prospect of First Steps' parallel MCU being so quickly subsumed. That aforementioned film took a bold, stylish (if not entirely thrilling) stride outside the established MCU, introducing Marvel's first family in a kicky, '60s-groovy, retrofuturistic New York where the Mad Men-look FF adventure in atomic age knitwear and employ nifty gadgetry more at home in the group's origin era. But blasting that dimension-hopping super team right into the heart of the present-day MCU after a single outing makes it look an awful lot like Kevin Feige and co. have cold feet about maintaining a major franchise off of the expected path. (She-Hulk found toxic misogyny a much tougher villain than Titania.) The MCU simply wore people out in a blur of thunderous CGI explosions and one too many glowing otherworldly portal climaxes. Spectacle sapped of substance can only sustain its momentum so long before audiences grow numb and—more to Marvel's concern—money falls off. Phase Six has more than enough big bang to lure the throngs back into the fold, what with two Avengers movies plus the creatively dubious return of Robert Downey Jr. as a different sort of iron man in Doctor Doom. As much as it'd be refreshing to see action figures of series protagonists Noni and Memnon, it's unlikely sales would recoup the cost of the plastic.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>John Legend was thrilled to reunite with Kelly Clarkson and Adam Levine in late July to film the Blind Auditions for Season 29 of “The Voice,” calling their reunion one big “love fest.” On August 2, 2025, Extra released an interview with Legend at the Social Impact Summit, where he was honored as Philanthropist of the Year. While there on July 24, Legend told Extra that “it's all love” among the trio of judges, despite having to compete against each other for the first-ever “Battle of Champions” season, scheduled to air in the spring of 2026. Legend has so much love for Clarkson, in fact, that he told Extra that he and his wife, Chrissy Teigen, have made sure to check in on the “Since U Been Gone” singer during her highly-publicized challenges this year, which have included unexplained absences from her talk show and the cancellation of her first Las Vegas residency shows in early July. “We just shot the Blind Auditions … and it was a love fest,” Legend told Extra of reuniting with Clarkson and Levine in late July. “You know, we've been friends, all three of us, for quite a long time. When I started working with Adam and Kelly, we all had, like, really young kids. So, you know, I feel like we're all growing up together, experiencing that parent life, and figuring out how to do it all.” Legend confirmed “there always is a group chat” going between the “Voice” coaches. Chrissy is friends with Kelly as well and checks on her, too. “We're so excited to be working together,” Legend concluded. In early July, it was reported that “insanely complicated” personal matters contributed to her missing episodes and pushing back the launch of her Vegas residency by a week. Clarkson may have to miss additional episodes of her talk show in order to tape additional rounds of “The Voice” in Los Angeles and when Season 29's live shows begin.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Hot on the trail of a strong weekend opening of The Naked Gun, the '80s prime time procedural T.J. Hooker will be next procedural in line for promotion to an action comedy movie. Netflix has collared screen rights to the venerable cop drama, with Jarrad Paul & Andy Mogel tapped to write. The original series premiered in March 1982 on ABC and ended its five-season, 91-episode run in 1986, with its final season airing on CBS. The show starred William Shatner as Sgt. Principled, moral, and driven to fight crime, the former plainclothes detective returns to uniform to train recruits and clean up the streets of criminals like the kind who killed his partner. Heather Locklear, Adrian Zmed and James Darren also starred. It is at this point unclear whether the 94-year old Shatner will be involved. 'The Hunting Wives' Soars Atop Luminate's TV Streaming Rankings After Netflix Debut As 'And Just Like That...' Reps HBO Max In Top 25 Amid Cancellation Everything We Know About 'My Life With The Walter Boys' Season 2 So Far The show seems organically suited for a more action comedy take, given Hooker's old style and often roughneck crime fighting style, which seemed out of place in a more woke world. The series was created by Rick Husky, who will also serve as an executive producer on the film. The original series was produced by Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg. Jarrad Paul & Andy Mogel are currently showrunning Bert, a Netflix show starring Bert Kreischer that they co-created, wrote. Their feature Little Brother is shooting for Netflix this summer, starring John Cena and Eric Andre, directed by Matt Spicer. Paul & Mogel also created and directed Huge in France, the Netflix series that premiered April 2019. The pair wrote Himelfarb, which Donald Deline is attached to produce. They began together cowriting the 2008 romantic comedy Yes Man for Warner Bros, starring Jim Carrey and Zooey Deschanel, and co-created and executive produced Allen Gregory for Fox/20th with Jonah Hill.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: With the Skydance merger expected to close on Thursday, the exec shuffle continues at Paramount Studios as sources tell Deadline that Motion Picture Group Chief Mike Ireland is exiting the studio. Insiders say Ireland will stay on in a consulting role to help with the transition and is considering an offer for a producing deal with the studio. This comes following a number new of roles being announced which include Dana Goldberg and Josh Greenstein being named Co-Chairs of Paramount Pictures with Goldberg being Chair of Paramount Television and Greenstein being Vice Chair of Platforms and Don Granger leading film at the studio. RELATED: Top TV Executive Nina L. Diaz To Depart Paramount When Skydance Merger Is Completed: “I'm Incredibly Proud Of What We've Built” Ireland joined the studio in November 2020, and the well-liked exec quickly was named co-president of production alongside Daria Cercek in January 2021. Prior to joining Paramount, Ireland worked at Leonardo DiCaprio's production company Appian Way in 2007, where he helped develop projects including The Wolf of Wall Street. He left Appian Way to join then-20th Century Fox in 2012, where he most recently was SVP Production and oversaw a slate of big-budget movies including the Ryan Reynolds action comedy Free Guy.

I wish there were 100 Mikey Irelands in this business. Cannot wait to see where he lands next. Awesome guy and credit to our industry! It's going to be very interesting to see how the new Skydance / Paramount reboots itself and gets folks back into the “funnel” again. Skydance faces major challenges after acquiring Paramount: managing over $14 billion in debt while making the unprofitable Paramount+ streaming service competitive against Netflix and Disney+; dealing with the declining linear TV business that's losing viewers and ad revenue; integrating two very different company cultures while cutting hundreds of jobs; and maintaining creative diversity and quality content production amid industry consolidation concerns. Success depends on balancing aggressive cost-cutting with continued investment in compelling content during the shift from traditional TV to streaming. They won't be able to do it without leveraging content creators in some way, since that's whose taken most of the audience. His next chapter will be another great one.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A rep for the British musician confirmed his death. An exact cause of death was not given, though Reid had been battling cancer and other health issues. A recent GoFundMe said Reid had been “in and out of the hospital, enduring rounds of treatment and uncertainty,” forcing him to cancel a six-week tour scheduled for the fall. With a reedy voice that could push to mighty and soulful heights, Reid earned the nickname “Superlungs” (partly a nod, too, to his rendition of the Donovan song, “Superlungs My Supergirl”). And though he never scored a genuine chart hit, he garnered high praise from critics and esteem from his peers. He catapulted me into an intense new world he chose to decline … I listen now to his album River and shed a tear for my brother in arms.” Reid's 1973 album, River, stands out as the gem in his catalog for its mix of progressive folk tinged with elements of R&B, funk, pop, and samba. While it became a longtime cult favorite that received a proper reissue in 2016, it struggled to gain any traction upon its original release. Now people tell me how much they love River — I think it's found its audience.” Nash, in a tribute of his own, wrote, “Finding it hard to put into words how sad I am about the passing of my dear friend Terry. How was it just a few short months ago we were smiling on my bus together? A talent beyond what I can express right now. That wonderful person we will all miss so dearly.” By 1967, Reid was embarking on a solo career, spurred on by his friend, Jimi Hendrix, and under the auspices of producer/manager Mickie Most. Loni Anderson, Emmy-Nominated Star of ‘WKRP in Cincinnati,' Dies at 79 David Roach, Singer of Eighties Hard-Rock Band Junkyard, Dead at 59 That same year, Yardbirds guitarist Jimmy Page asked him if he'd be interested in fronting his next band. Though Reid considered it, he declined, instead suggesting Page check out the singer and drummer from another group called Band of Joy: Robert Plant and John Bonham. “I was intent on doing my own thing,” he said. “I contributed half the band — that's enough on my part,” he added of Zeppelin. It took him several years to settle a contractual dispute with his former manager and producer, before he was able to finally record River. He released two more albums, 1976's Seed of Memory, and 1978's Rogue Waves, before stepping back from his solo career. He moved to California and, in the Eighties, started working as a session musician for artists like Don Henley, Bonnie Raitt, and Jackson Browne. But that failed to garner much attention, and even Reid was dissatisfied with the record, later calling it “unlistenable.” As his back catalog garnered renewed attention, he was enlisted for vocal work by artists like DJ Shadow and Alabama 3. And new covers of his songs emerged, like a rendition of “Rich Kid Blues” by Jack White's band, the Raconteurs, and a version of “To Be Treated Rite” by Chris Cornell that appeared on his posthumous collection, No One Sings Like You Anymore, Vol. Trump on Undocumented Workers: ‘These People' Do Farm Labor ‘Naturally' ‘Alien: Earth' Brings New Monsters, Big Ideas, and a Little Bit of Pixie Dust Reid even revealed that Dr. Dre was such a fan of Seed of Memory, that the hip-hop legend invited him into the studio where they “reworked it alongside his rappers.” Reid called it a “fascinating experience,” though the sessions still have not been released. “I've never looked at making music as chasing fame and fortune,” Reid said.

Related Stories ‘Rental Family' Trailer: Brendan Fraser Lands a Most Unusual Gig in Tokyo in Searchlight's Fall Awards Hopeful TIFF 2025 Adds Over 50 Films to Sprawling Centrepiece Lineup, Including Titles from Richard Linklater, Christian Petzold, Shih-Ching Tsou, and More Leave it to Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan to crack the code as to what makes a good legacyquel, which they've done quite handily with their long-gestating “Freaky Friday” sequel, Nisha Ganatra's charming and quite fun “Freakier Friday.” The secret? Fittingly enough, it harkens back to exactly what Curtis and Lohan brought to Mark Waters' 2003 “Freaky Friday”: actual verve, obvious joy, and performances that are about three times better than they need to be. If you're of the mind that Curtis should have won her first Oscar for her work in Waters' film, thanks to a spectacular and incredibly funny turn as overworked mom Tess Coleman, who switches bodies with her wise-ass teenage daughter (Lohan), leading to all kinds of high jinks, “Freakier Friday” is very much for you. Twenty-two years ago, Curtis turned in some of her best work as a sassy rocker teenager trapped in the body of her strait-laced mom, and revisiting that concept is more than enough reason to launch a sequel. Lohan ably matches Curtis' vim and vigor, and a pair of young stars give them a serious run for their money as their body-switching compatriots. Simply put: Here is a legacyquel worth the wait. Written by Jordan Weiss (who shares story-by credit with Elyse Hollander), the sequel makes an early claim to something sort of tricky: Yes, it's going to love its various characters and their very different generational markers, but it's sure as heck gonna poke some fun at them, too. More than two decades on from the first film, we find Tess (Curtis) still working as a therapist, now armed with a podcast she's attempting to launch, despite her Boomer tendencies to not actually record the damn thing. She's got a “no triggering” sign on her bedroom and attends a high school where “gluten-free” is the default offering for any and all foodstuffs. Still, the Coleman ladies really love each other, and as Tess tells us in voiceover, when Anna decided to become a single mom all those years ago, she vowed they'd raise Harper together. Surely, it's nothing a little double body-switching can't cure? The fourth member of this ill-fated quad soon comes into focus: British transfer student Lily (Sophia Hammons), who cannot stand laidback surf bum Harper (the feeling is mutual). When the girls' deep dislike for each other explodes into chem lab violence, their single (very, very much single) parents are forced into a parent-teacher meeting for the ages. The sparks are instant for Anna and Lily's dad Eric (Manny Jacinto), and a zippy montage races us through their speedy romance, straight into an autumn wedding that, like many things in Ganatra's film, sweetly echoes the original. This time around, it comes courtesy of an absolutely hilarious Vanessa Bayer as a multi-hyphenate psychic who can't seem to nail any of her many jobs (Reiki to Starbucks, business card-making to something involving dogs? Soon enough, Anna and Harper have switched (Butters nails the uptight-adult-in-kid-body ask, while Lohan gets to dabble in the teenage fun she wasn't able to in the first film), along with Lily and Tess (if this was all a bid to get Curtis back to playing nutso teens in her adult body, the full force of her performance makes that reasoning hard to argue with). While Anna and Tess naturally team up to try to reverse things — and how fun for everyone else to see “Harper and Lily” hanging out — Harper and Lily come up with a different idea: They'll use this as an opportunity to break up their parents finally. And while much of what they take on is, well, kind of silly — consider a long-form montage sequence in which the duo try on wacky outfits with Anna's rising star client Ella (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan) — the obvious joy with which that stuff is approached is contagious. — but just look at a decade-plus worth of dour, dim, and dismal fellow legacyquels, and it's clear how rare “Freakier Friday” really is. While many of the beats might feel familiar, there's something cozy about those story points (that the film is centered on a wedding, just like the original, mostly feels right), and even some early tonal issues are forgotten as the film ratchets up its enthusiasm and good humor. Curtis and Lohan's commitment naturally extends to some bouts of dizzying physical comedy, some of the best examples taking place at (gasp!) at a record store belonging to no less than Jake (returning co-star Chad Michael Murray), who romanced both Coleman ladies in the first film. As Lohan attempts to flirt in such a way that it makes her look like she's having a medical emergency, and Curtis finds herself crawling and joint-cracking around nearly every inch of the joint's floor, another sort of spell takes hold — this time, on the audience. Something like this might only come around once every 22 years.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>George Clooney got everything he could have wanted in the teaser trailer for Noah Baumbach‘s Jay Kelly. The actor fittingly plays an actor in the titular role — but one who doesn't know what comes after fame and fortune. Throughout the preview, Jay Kelly feels disconnected, wondering, “How can I play people when I don't see people?” He barely sees himself, he admits. Being “just an actor that got famous” is a less complicated way of interrogating his reality than actually coming to terms with it. “You know how difficult it is to be yourself?” he asks. Jay Kelly follows the fictional movie star and his manager as they traverse through Europe. Written by Noah Baumbach and Emily Mortimer, Jay Kelly is the first directorial release from Baumbach since 2022's White Noise and his first as a writer since the 2023 blockbuster Barbie. Jay Kelly also stars Laura Dern, Billy Crudup, Riley Keough, Grace Edwards, Stacy Keach, Jim Broadbent, Patrick Wilson, Eve Hewson, Greta Gerwig, Alba Rohrwacher, Josh Hamilton, Lenny Henry, Emily Mortimer, Nicôle Lecky, Thaddea Graham, Isla Fisher, Louis Partridge, and Charlie Rowe. Trump on Undocumented Workers: ‘These People' Do Farm Labor ‘Naturally' ‘Alien: Earth' Brings New Monsters, Big Ideas, and a Little Bit of Pixie Dust That was in the DNA of what this thing should be: What if a movie star was essentially playing one, and reflecting back our own vulnerabilities and our own questions about life? “It's all the things that Noah has loved his whole life and have meant so much to him,” Mortimer added. “He can embody that character in a way, I do think. And once he started to do that, then I could join in.”</p>

With his pal Stephen Colbert's Late Show recently canceled amid financial losses to the tune of tens of millions a year and a pending multibillion-dollar merger at its parent company, Oliver's Last Week Tonight finds itself ensconced in its premium cable/streaming corner at HBO, where it tackles complicated, often uncomfortable subjects such as immigration, policing and juvenile justice. Still, Oliver is adamant that it's the show's bevy of awards — 30 Emmys and counting — that has kept it on the air and without interference for 12 seasons. Come September, it will vie for six more, including outstanding scripted variety series. Zooming from Last Week Tonight's Manhattan offices in late July, Oliver weighed in on his battles with legal, his concerns for late night and his desired level of anxiety. Stephen Colbert Lands New Late Night Role on CBS Crime Comedy 'Elsbeth' Marc Maron Jokes He's "Not Afraid to Die Anymore" as Long as This Taylor Swift Song Is Playing Last Week Tonight segments come together in six weeks. The jokes used to come in earlier, but you don't want to start writing before a story is stable because then you'll fall in love with jokes that are built on material that doesn't stand up, and that's a terrible position to put comedy writers in. But in that first month, you're trying to give people ingredients that they'll be able to create comedy from. You want it to be like an episode of Chopped, where it's not impossible to make something palatable at the end. So, you're not giving them broken glass and weed killer. I mean, there's always a low-level anxiety with every story. I'd argue a healthy level of anxiety. And it's only ever about whether people are going to be willing to listen to us talk about something, because it's so superficially dry or contentious that you're not sure if it's something people will want to hear, and then you're practicing force-feeding. But that's part of the joy of having this show — the ability to show people things they might not necessarily think, on their face, they want to see. I mean, just a few weeks ago, we did a long piece on juvenile justice, and that's the kind of story where you think, “I'm not sure people want to hear this,” but I am sure that it's the absolute point of having a show like this. From the Emmy stage, you thanked HBO and “our lawyers, who are angry with us all the time.” What is that push and pull like? They are our final line of defense, so it has to be a functional relationship, but it can be fraught, especially toward the end. The general tension that we land on is having a slightly different view of their job. They think it's to stop us from getting sued, and I think it's to make sure that when we are sued, we win. But you also don't get to be angry at the lifesaving device. You've had a revolving door of corporate owners. Is interference something you've either experienced or worry about? We've not experienced interference, and I refuse to worry about something that hasn't happened yet. My tolerance level, were it to, would be zero. Put another way, is there a “there but for the grace of God go I” aspect to what appears to have happened with Colbert and his show? We are fortunate enough to be in a very different situation than network commercial TV, so those corporate pressures are not comparable, and we have no pressures from advertisers. Presumably you saw the shots of Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav palling around with Ivanka Trump in Sun Valley. What goes through your mind when you see something like that? I try to pay as little attention to what is happening outside of our show as possible because it feels like wasted energy. The moment that intrudes on our show, I will react very badly to it, but it hasn't. At the same time, you seem to bite the hand that feeds you with regularity and some degree of glee … And you're right, I'm truly happy in those moments. But I always used to love watching David Letterman do it. To me, it felt like a really healthy sign of contempt and just a very fun and slightly important indication of noncompliance. So, I loved it when he'd make fun of G.E. and CBS and, yeah, for me, making fun of whoever owns us on a minute-to-minute basis is a thrill. Do you worry about the future of late night TV? What's happened to The Late Show is incredibly sad for comedy and, obviously, for the staff in that building. It really resonated with me when Stephen said he was hoping to hand this show over to someone else. You hope that the franchise lives on partly because there are generations of teenagers watching those shows and deciding, “Maybe I'd like to be a comedy writer,” and then maybe writing on that show. I'm sure it'll find a way to exist in some form, we just don't yet know exactly what that's going to look like for network television. You've had success having a point of view on your show, as Colbert has, at least in the ratings. Late night used to be broad, unifying entertainment. I know Jay Leno recently spoke on this topic, about making a show for everyone … I'm going to take a hard pass on taking comedic advice from Jay Leno. Fair enough, but should these shows still try to be for everyone, or is that as antiquated as the tanning bed? So, yeah, when you do stand-up, some people try to play to a broader audience, which is completely legitimate. Others decide not to, which is equally legitimate. I think our show clearly comes from a point of view, but most of those long stories we do are not party political. Our last few shows were about gang databases, AI slop, juvenile justice, med spas, air traffic control. I'm not saying that these don't have a point of view in them. But I hope a lot of them actually reach across people's political persuasions. As someone who's found a version of a late night show that succeeds on streaming, do you think it's replicable and, if so, what should it look like? [Late New York Times media columnist] David Carr said something so nice at the end of our first year. Because I don't think, on the page, our show sounds very good. I mean, we're doing, like, 40 minutes on juvenile justice. So I don't know that you can emulate this success. I just don't know that this is scalable. But I'd really like late night to exist in some form somewhere. My favorite thing is when you can have things that both have a strong point of view and are incredibly stupid. It was the hardest I laughed all week. So, I love the fact that those things can coexist, and I don't want that to go away. Well, the stakes are just lower now. Many of you came on Colbert's show on July 21, appearing in a Coldplay kiss-cam spoof, shortly after the news of his cancellation. Well, we've been in contact as a group since the strike [several of them hosted a podcast, Strike Force Five], so as soon as the news broke, we were all checking in with Stephen in that chat and then he came up with the idea and asked us to come, and of course we're all going to do it. I did appreciate just how much everyone sort of played into their brand while sitting there, down to Anderson Cooper looking fairly uncomfortable. Amid all the bleakness, you and your writers decided to give yourselves this ambitious side project, rebranding a minor league baseball team the Erie Moon Mammoths. How much pressure did you feel to make sure that was something that could produce actual civic pride, rather than simply five funny minutes on HBO? The reason we first started talking about it is that we were doing a show about deportations — so, monumentally bleak — and it felt like an example of when you've had a kale-based meal, it's nice to serve something resembling a dessert at the end of it. One of our writers, Charlie, he pitched this story about minor league baseball and just how eccentric and, in many ways, life affirming it is, and we had the idea at the end of that to issue this offer [to have Last Week Tonight have carte blanche to rebrand a team]. Once it became clear that people were really interested, then it felt like it might be something that could spin us out of a bunch of very dense, dark stories. It is odd the extent to which it repaired some of my faith in human nature, and that is a very weird thing to find yourself saying when you're standing next to a seven-foot purple mammoth. Speaking of happy endings, earlier this year, HBO let you return to releasing full segments of your show on YouTube the day after airing. I think they wanted to see if moving it back on YouTube had an effect on our ratings. I didn't think it would, which is why I was against moving it in the first place. And I was massively grateful that, upon looking at it, they realized it wasn't having a negative enough effect to be worth doing. Again, in the difficulty of the media environment that we're in, I try to be as cognizant as I can be that HBO is still a fantastic place to work. And yet you make a lot of jokes about how all these Emmys are your show's only armor against getting canceled. I mean, two things can be true at the same time. It's a fantastic place to work while we are insulated by golden armor. If that stops, we might be going away. It's not entirely a joke, that's for sure. So, yeah, I do think there is a utility to it.

The synopsis reads: “Set against modern-day Tokyo, ‘Rental Family' follows an American actor (Fraser) who struggles to find purpose until he lands an unusual gig: working for a Japanese ‘rental family' agency, playing stand-in roles for strangers. As he immerses himself in his clients' worlds, he begins to form genuine bonds that blur the lines between performance and reality. Confronting the moral complexities of his work, he rediscovers purpose, belonging, and the quiet beauty of human connection.” Related Stories TIFF 2025 Adds Over 50 Films to Sprawling Centrepiece Lineup, Including Titles from Richard Linklater, Christian Petzold, Shih-Ching Tsou, and More ‘Jay Kelly' Teaser: George Clooney Grapples with Fame in Noah Baumbach's Venice-Bound Drama Takehiro Hira, Mari Yamamoto, Shannon Gorman, and Akira Emoto co-star. “Rental Family” is produced by HIKARI, Eddie Vaisman, Julia Lebedev, and Shin Yamaguchi.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Midwest emo no longer has to be from the Midwest and it doesn't even need to be emo, and, for that, you can thank this one line from Algernon Cadwallader's “Motivational Song”: “So if fucking up feels right/Then fuck it up!” The quartet band out among other scrappy, spirited groups like Snowing, Glocca Morra, Street Smart Cyclist, and Marietta that reclaimed “the whole Chicago '90s emo thing” of Cap'n Jazz and American Football at a time when the genre's credibility was at its lowest ebb. Frontman Peter Helmis was ambivalent about capitalizing on that renewed interest. Algernon Cadwallader reissued their catalog in 2018, and Helmis guessed it would take at least another decade before they reunited, if they ever did at all. His bandmates had started families, careers, and plenty of other bands. Helmis was off by about six years, and, in 2022, Algernon played to crowds that eclipsed any they ever saw at their peak, filled with teenagers who would have to agree with Helmis' claim that there was “something unattainable” about the band during its existence. If Helmis couldn't keep his promise about the timetable of Algernon's reunion, he did hold firm in his belief that Algernon couldn't simply be a reunion band playing old album run-throughs at Best Friends Forever and Florida's Fest. So he and his bandmates made a new album. Trying Not to Have a Thought doesn't pick up where Algernon left off on 2011's underappreciated Parrot Flies. It imagines an alternate history where all of the members channeled their artistic evolution from their many, many projects right back into Algernon Cadwallader, as if that had been the plan all along. Now two decades into their career, Algernon Cadwallader can relate a straightforward history lesson about the 1985 MOVE bombing that fits right alongside their older DIY house anthems and newer experiments like “noitanitsarcorP,” a tribute to the creative process that emerged from a group ketamine trip; “I played the same drum beat for, like, 25 minutes,” Nick Tazza recalls. “And I remember being like, that was the most beautiful thing we ever wrote.” With the original lineup of Helmis, Reinhart, Tazza and guitarist Colin Mahony together for the first time since their debut, Some Kind of Cadwallader, the same “if it feels good, do it” spirit of 2008 pervades Trying Not to Have a Thought. “We wrote a bunch of songs in Joe's parents' basement,” Helmis reflects. “And now we're writing these new songs fucking 20 years later in Joe's own basement.” Everything that keeps us together is falling apart on Trying Not to Have a Thought—high school friends die tragically before their time, endless war continues unabated, the working class is one paycheck away from poverty, and the social safety net is hanging on by a thread. The urgency of speaking to these anxieties while the creative spark burned hot allowed Algernon Cadwallader to write their first album in 14 years within a few weeks at retreats in Snoqualmie, Washington, and the Poconos. “I think it makes you appreciate the time that we are spending together; it's more like an affirmation,” Helmis states in my Zoom call with him, Joe Reinhart, and Nick Tazza. Nick Tazza: I don't think we've ever really stopped being in touch with each other, regardless if we're making music or just fucking off. Peter Helmis: With the exception of our fucking boy Colin [laughs]. He was an original founding member and also one of the first humans that I ever started playing music with, and he left pretty abruptly before Some Kind of Cadwallader came out. I saw him twice over the period of, like, a decade. We were all going different paths and moving at a million miles an hour. He's the one person who I feel like actually changed the least since high school; he's so funny at all times. That helped put us in the mindset to write a record like this, the four of us all back together. In fact, if anything, we'll steer something in another direction if we think it's gonna be perceived too well. Helmis: I'm glad you're aware of MOVE, being from Philadelphia. I feel like it should be like one of our country's most horrific tragedies of all time, but it's somehow pretty much buried. I feel like it ties into every other event that happened in Philadelphia before and afterwards. Growing up in the scene when we did, in the early 2000s, you'd go to punk shows and there would always be “Free Mumia” flyers. I got to know what these people are talking about.” That left a real impact on me. But I feel like by the time we moved to the city and started our bands, that fell off a little bit. And maybe we were responsible for some of that. But it's twofold: us being a band again and having an audience, knowing that people are listening and also seeing all these super young kids on the reunion tour, we're speaking to another generation here. I didn't want to premeditate it, this is what's going on in my mind and probably everybody's mind these days. It was very clear when I first moved here and—I think Nick can probably relate to this—you see [the homelessness] so much more than back in the East Coast. I don't know if it's just less swept under the rug. Nick Tazza: One common thread through everything is that it's all kind of fucked in a similar way. I think Philadelphia is denser and you feel the anxiety of it a lot more. Out here [in Seattle], it's definitely more chill, but you see the wealth disparity a lot more clearly, where I see people like us who are “normal” and have working jobs, but they're fucking on the street. I do think there's better social services on the East Coast; at least it seems that way. I live in a pretty chill area, but the cops fucking suck, same bullshit. It's just been an extension of what we've always done. And I think it's really cool to see Peter align the band that way. I also think we're at a point now where if you're not using your fucking voice to promote something, it's a waste. But I listen to Joan of Arc at least once a month. If I want to listen to something, I can't think of what, it's like, “well, let me just pick a Joan of Arc record.” Incredible catalog; they could have been 12 different bands. I'll [produce] their first record and you can tell they only ever played these songs in small rooms because everybody's playing bass chords and hitting every part of the drum at the part of the song they want to be loud. But once you get into these rooms where there's space and big low end, I've heard bands come back and have more of those sorts of textures in their music. I don't know if we made any of those decisions consciously, but I was pushing the energy in the music. Seventy percent of what I listen to has that melodic punk push to it, and I think it was consciously making stuff like that and then, yeah, some of it was a ketamine jam. Tazza: Joe wrote a fucking ska part on this record, and that's the sickest thing of all time. Helmis: You got to go back and find that ska Easter egg. Reinhart: I was thinking about that today, like, man, when are we doing Europe or other countries? Maybe we should just plan to write an EP before any of that stuff happens.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After a turbulent run on “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” season 14, Kyle Richards and Dorit Kemsley appear to be repairing their friendship—and they're doing it in style. On Saturday, August 2, the Bravo stars linked up in Montauk for a Hamptons weekend filled with music, dancing, and a surprise “Southern Charm” crossover with Austen Kroll. Richards documented the weekend on her Instagram Stories, showing herself and Kemsley dancing at the Surf Lodge while watching Mojave Grey, a musical duo made up of Zander Bleck and Michael Pozzi. The two were joined by Rachel Zoe, who will be a full-time cast member on RHOBH season 15. Ruchards and Kemsley's once-close friendship hit a low point during season 14, largely due to Richards' ongoing issues with her estranged husband, Mauricio Umansky, and her close bond with country artist Morgan Wade. In a May 2024 Amazon Live stream, Richards confirmed the two were back on good terms: “Dorit and I, thank God, we're good,” she said. “We haven't really seen each other except at Alexia's engagement dinner because of both of our schedules, but we're good. Kemsley shared her perspective in a 2025 Rollacoaster Magazine interview. And it's not,” she said, explaining how confronting the issues actually strengthened their bond. According to a tip sent to Bravo and Cocktails, “Southern Charm's” Austen Kroll was also at the Surf Lodge that night. “Kyle and Rachel Zoe were much more reserved but also nice.” Though Kroll didn't interact with the RHOBH women on camera, he was spotted chatting with Robert Sieber—Danielle Olivera's ex from “Summer House”—who reportedly works at the venue. There were also rumors that cameras were rolling, though it's unclear whether it was for RHOBH, “Summer House,” or just background footage for the event.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Maynard James Keenan is far from the only artist to ban phones at his live shows, and now he's expanded on the reasoning behind that decision. Keenan – who is best known for fronting acts such as Tool and Puscifer – has been noted for years as one of the more prominent artists to discourage the usage of phones during live performances. In fact, one of Keenan's other projects – A Perfect Circle – had previously made headlines for reportedly ejecting concert attendees who violated the request. Australian Rockers The Angels Honored With Laneway & Mural in Hometown Lady Gaga's 'Wednesday' Role Will Also Include a Spooky New Song for Season 2 Metro Boomin Blames Social Media for Music Not Being Regional Anymore: 'Let's Get Back to Actual Culture' In a new interview with the Serious Clownversation podcast, Keenan spoke to host Clownvis Presley about the apparently-divisive topic, outlining his disdain at how prominent phone usage has become at shows. “A lot of times if you go to shows nowadays it ends up becoming the kneejerk thing, that's just what you do, it's just acceptable behavior to block somebody else's view with your phone,” he explained. “You're not gonna go home and watch it.” Notably, the likes of Tool and Puscifer (the latter of which are preparing for a pair of album preview shows in Los Angeles on Aug. 11) have employed a practice in their live sets in which audiences are allowed to use their phones to capture the final song. “It's only three hours and at the end we'll let you pull out it out and you can film the last song,” he adds. “We think you'll enjoy looking up from your gadgets for a little while and experience music and our shared love of it in person,” a note from the band read at the time. More recently, Iron Maiden manager Rod Smallwood made a public plea for fans to honor the request for limited phone use, later praising those who adhered to his request and wishing those who ignored his pleas “nothing but a very sore arm.” Pop icon Sabrina Carpenter also sided with the topic of phone bands, telling Rolling Stone she was “absolutely” open to asking fans to pocket their devices at her shows after being turned onto the idea following a Las Vegas show from Silk Sonic.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After convincing the American people that Joe Biden was old, actor, director, and New York Times opinion writer George Clooney has a new mission: Convince his Jay Kelly castmates that Adam Sandler isn't “some goofy comedian.” Speaking to Vanity Fair about his latest film, Jay Kelly, Clooney talked passionately about his co-star Adam Sandler, or as Vanity Fair put it, he was “protective” of him. In Jay Kelly, Clooney plays a George-Clooney-esque movie star and The Sand Man Sandler portrays his doting manager. However, on set, when people try to treat Sandler like a “goofy comedian” because of “what his paycheck is, which is doing big goofy comedies,” Clooney takes offense. It's disturbing to think that Sandler has been doing precisely the kind of work he wants to do for the last 30 years and has become a beloved star as a result of his relaxed, dare we say, “goofy” persona. But we understand what Clooney means, even if he frames it like a backhanded compliment. Clooney isn't the only one impressed by Sandler's work, particularly when he digs a little deeper into his sweet and sour archetypes, as in Punch Drunk Love and the aforementioned Gems. But Sandler doesn't do anything he doesn't want to do, and to describe the man's lifework (e.g., making goofy comedies with his friends in beautiful locations) as “his paycheck” is pretty dismissive of Sandy Wexler. Or maybe Clooney is tired of his co-star Stacy Keach constantly yelling, “What's my name?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"The Angels helped shape the sound of South Australia and now their legacy has a permanent place in our city's streets," said Adelaide Lord Mayor Dr Jane Lomax-Smith. Lady Gaga's 'Wednesday' Role Will Also Include a Spooky New Song for Season 2 Metro Boomin Blames Social Media for Music Not Being Regional Anymore: 'Let's Get Back to Actual Culture' RIP SLYME on 25th-Anniversary Reunion & Creative Process of New Releases: Billboard Japan Monthly Feature Interview “From packed pubs to festival stages, The Angels helped shape the sound of South Australia and now their legacy has a permanent place in our city's streets,” Dr Lomax-Smith said in a speech at the ceremony. “This honour both acknowledges rock royalty and reinforces Adelaide's global reputation as a UNESCO City of Music.” However, the original location – an unnamed private road in Gawler Place – was nixed after building owners refused the installation of a commemorative plaque and public artwork. The Angels rose to fame throughout the '70s and '80s, delivering a uniquely Australian blend of hard rock often labelled ‘pub rock.' While their 1977 self-titled debut achieved little chart success upon its release, the group's 1978 album Face to Face saw them impact the Australian top 10, and even hit No. Their biggest North American success came about by way of 1980's Dark Room, which peaked at No. In Australia, it was a different story, however. Reforming in 2008, Neeson would remain as frontman until 2011, eventually being replaced by the Screaming Jets' Dave Gleeson, who would retire from the role in 2003. Neeson would pass away in 2014, one year after longtime bassist Chris Bailey. While cited as an influence by the likes of Pearl Jam and Guns N' Roses, in Australia, The Angels' legacy is largely tied to the enduring success of their debut single, “Am I Ever Gonna See Your Face Again.” Though initially escaping wider chart success in 1978, a live recording in 1988 saw the track hit No. “It wasn't a very big deal at the time but it seems to have become a big deal — that was incredible,” guitarist John Brewster told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. 11 in triple j's Hottest 100 of Australian Songs poll. The track beat out songs by other Adelaide acts such as Cold Chisel and Paul Kelly, who have both been honored with laneways in the South Australian capital. Other local artists to have received a similar honor include Indigenous rock outfit No Fixed Address and Hot 100-chart topper Sia Furler.
