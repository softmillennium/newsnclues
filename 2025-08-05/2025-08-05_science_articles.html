                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What Is the Legionnaires' Disease Outbreak That Has Killed Two People in New York City? Fifty-eight people have been infected—and two have died—in a New York City outbreak of Legionnaires' disease—a severe type of pneumonia caused by a bacterium commonly associated with air-conditioning systems and cooling towers A color-enhanced transmission electron micrograph (TEM) of the bacterium that causes Legionnaires' disease (Legionella pneumophia). A little-known illness called Legionnaires' disease has infected at least 58 people in New York City's Central Harlem neighborhood in the past two weeks. Two people have died during the outbreak, which has been tied to cooling towers that tested positive for the disease-causing bacterium Legionella pneumophila, according to a statement from city health officials on August 4. When diagnosed early, Legionnaires' can be treated successfully with antibiotics. Health care providers report about 6,000 cases of Legionnaires' disease annually in the U.S., although some cases are likely mistaken as other types of pneumonia. The disease became five times more prevalent between 2000 and 2018 for reasons experts have struggled to identify.

Water systems such as cooling towers, large air-conditioning systems, spas and hot tubs can then aerosolize the microbe, making bacterial control in these types of structures a vital prevention measure. When the current outbreak was first identified, New York City health officials directed an investigation into all cooling towers in the affected neighborhood. But such structures have long been known to cause some of the largest Legionnaires' outbreaks on record. New York City laws require cooling towers to be registered, tested and disinfected regularly to reduce the presence of Legionella bacteria. Legionnaires' was first identified at a convention of the American Legion's Department of Pennsylvania (hence the name) that was held in late July 1976. Scientists had to rule out potential causes, including foodborne pathogens and metal poisoning, among other challenges, before managing to identify the previously unknown bacterium. Simultaneously, investigators pored through reports of other then recent, mysterious outbreaks of pneumonialike diseases, piecing together an image of an infection that “has turned out to be not very rare after all,” the researchers wrote in their 1979 article.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NASA's acting administrator Sean Duffy testifies during a congressional hearing on July 16, 2025. The space agency's acting administrator Sean Duffy has issued a directive to expedite building a nuclear reactor on the lunar surface. If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. The space agency has pursued various projects over the years, most recently in 2022, when it awarded three $5-million contracts to companies to craft designs for small space-ready reactors meant for lunar operations in the mid-2030s. Inspired in part by a space policy directive issued by President Donald Trump during his first term, those reactors were intended to produce 40 kilowatts of power—enough to sustain a small office building—and to weigh less than six metric tons. The space agency is tasked with appointing an official to oversee the effort within 30 days and to issue its solicitation within 60 days. A concept illustration showing NASA's Fission Surface Power Project on the moon. Under a new directive, the space agency is seeking to develop bigger and more powerful nuclear reactors that could reach the lunar surface by 2030. Lunar nights are very long—two Earth weeks—and perilously cold, making nuclear power desirable for surface operations. The sun never crests high above the horizon there, leaving some craters in permanent shadow—and valuable deposits of water ice lacing their eternally dark floors. Besides providing abundant electricity for surface operations, a nuclear reactor on the moon could also allow for a strategic lunar land grab. Ownership of otherworldly territory is prohibited, according to the United Nations Outer Space Treaty, but the treaty also obliges spacefaring powers to exercise “due regard” in their activities, meaning that they should not encroach on or interfere with sensitive infrastructure built by others. A nuclear reactor placed on the lunar surface, therefore, could allow the declaration of what Duffy's directive calls a “keep-out zone.” These include plans for extraordinarily deep cuts to NASA's science programs, as well as an active and ongoing culling of the space agency's workforce. The president's budget request for fiscal year 2026 notably zeroes out funding for a joint program between NASA and the Department of Defense to develop nuclear rocketry. The biggest question facing NASA's latest nuclear foray, however, may be what these notional new reactors would actually power. Many experts say a 2027 launch for Artemis III is unlikely and citing factors such as the ongoing difficulties of developing a requisite lunar lander based on SpaceX's Starship rocket. With each logistical misstep or schedule delay, additional Artemis missions that would put more meaningful and power-hungry infrastructure on the moon slip further over the horizon, potentially making the entire program more vulnerable to additional rounds of budget cuts—or even outright cancellation by future administrations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When given nutritionally matched diets, participants lost twice as much weight eating minimally processed foods compared to ultra-processed foods, suggesting that cutting down on processing could help to sustain a healthy weight long term, finds a new clinical trial led by researchers at UCL and UCLH. The study, published in Nature Medicine, is the first interventional study comparing ultra-processed food (UPF) and minimally processed food (MPF) diets in 'real world' conditions, as well as being the longest experimental study of a UPF diet to date1. One group started with an eight-week diet of MPF, such as overnight oats or homemade spaghetti Bolognese. This included levels of fat, saturated fat, protein, carbohydrate, salt and fiber, as well as providing recommended intakes of fruits and vegetables. After eight weeks on each diet, both groups lost weight, likely as a result of the improved nutritional profile of what they were eating compared to their normal diet. These changes corresponded to an estimated calorie deficit of 290 kilocalories (kcal) per day on the MPF diet, compared to 120 kcal per day on the UPF diet. The greater weight loss experienced on the MPF diet came from reductions in fat mass and total body water, with no change in muscle or fat-free mass, indicating a healthier body composition overall. The findings suggest that, when observing recommended dietary guidelines, choosing minimally processed foods may be more effective for losing weight. Dr Samuel Dicken, first author of the study from the UCL Centre for Obesity Research and UCL Department of Behavioural Science & Health, said: "Previous research has linked ultra-processed foods with poor health outcomes. But not all ultra-processed foods are inherently unhealthy based on their nutritional profile. The main aim of this trial was to fill crucial gaps in our knowledge about the role of food processing in the context of existing dietary guidance, and how it affects health outcomes such as weight, blood pressure and body composition, as well as experiential factors like food cravings. Though a 2% reduction may not seem very big, that is only over eight weeks and without people trying to actively reduce their intake. Over time this would start to become a big difference." On the MPF diet compared to the UPF diet, participants reported a two-fold greater improvement in overall craving control, a four-fold greater improvement in craving control for savoury food, and an almost two-fold greater improvement in resisting whichever food they most craved. This study highlights the importance of ultra-processing in driving health outcomes in addition to the role of nutrients like fat, salt and sugar. Across these markers, there were no significant negative impacts of the UPF diet, with either no change, or a significant improvement from baseline. Generally, there weren't significant differences in these markers between the diets, and the researchers caution that longer studies would be needed to investigate these measures properly in relation to the changes in weight and fat mass. "The normal diets of the trial participants tended to be outside national nutritional guidelines and included an above average proportion of UPF, which may help to explain why switching to a trial diet consisting entirely of UPF, but that was nutritionally balanced, resulted in neutral or slightly favourable changes to some secondary health markers. "The best advice to people would be to stick as closely to nutritional guidelines as they can by moderating overall energy intake, limiting intake of salt, sugar and saturated fat, and prioritizing high-fiber foods such as fruits, vegetables, pulses and nuts. Choosing less processed options such as whole foods and cooking from scratch, rather than ultra-processed, packaged foods or ready meals, is likely to offer additional benefits in terms of body weight, body composition and overall health."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new analysis of the bite strength of 18 species of carnivorous dinosaurs shows that while the Tyrannasaurus rex skull was optimized for quick, strong bites like a crocodile, other giant, predatory dinosaurs that walked on two legs -- including spinosaurs and allosaurs -- had much weaker bites and instead specialized in slashing and ripping flesh. Reported in the Cell Press journal Current Biology on August 4, these findings demonstrate that meat-eating dinosaurs followed different evolutionary paths in terms of skull design and feeding style despite their similarly gigantic sizes. "Tyrannosaurs evolved skulls built for strength and crushing bites, while other lineages had comparatively weaker but more specialized skulls, suggesting a diversity of feeding strategies even at massive sizes. In other words, there wasn't one 'best' skull design for being a predatory giant; several designs functioned perfectly well." Rowe has always been fascinated by big carnivorous dinosaurs, and he considers them interesting subjects for exploring basic questions in organismal biology. For Rowe and Rayfield, those facts raised questions about whether their skulls were functionally similar under the surface or if there were notable differences in their predatory lifestyles. As there are no massive, bipedal carnivores alive today -- ever since the end-Cretaceous mass extinction event -- the authors note that studying these animals offers intriguing insights into a way of life which has since disappeared. "Tyrannosaurids like T. rex had skulls that were optimized for high bite forces at the cost of higher skull stress," Rowe says. "But in some other giants, like Giganotosaurus, we calculated stress patterns suggesting a relatively lighter bite. It drove home how evolution can produce multiple 'solutions' to life as a large, carnivorous biped." "Large tyrannosaur skulls were instead optimized like modern crocodiles with high bite forces that crushed prey. This biomechanical diversity suggests that dinosaur ecosystems supported a wider range of giant carnivore ecologies than we often assume, with less competition and more specialization."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Although we are a member of the Great Ape primate family, we sport an array of differences from our closest genetic cousins. However, the human brain may not have grown to such an astonishing size if it wasn't for our second most distinguishing feature—bipedalism. Of course, this was a slow process—one that scientists believe was likely kickstarted by climate change, as a warming world turned the forests of equatorial Africa into dry woodland called “savannah-mosaic.” As trees became more sparse, distant human ancestors began walking upright as a more efficient way to move in this new environment. Now a new study from scientists at University College London, the Max Planck Institute, and Greater Mahale Ecosystem Research and Conservation in Tanzania shows that the story of human bipedalism isn't so clear-cut. To get a better understanding of what may have taken place six to seven million years ago, scientists studied a population of chimpanzees in Issa Valley along Lake Tanganykia in western Tanzania. The area is perfect for studying bipedalism's origins, as the area is made up of gallery forests and woodland savannah. They found that chimpanzees often adopted bipedalism to effectively feed on the sparse woodland trees. This could have been a key driver for ancient hominids developing their upright gait. “For decades it was assumed that bipedalism arose because we came down from the trees and needed to walk across an open savannah,” Rhianna Drummond-Clarke, lead author of the study, said in a press statement. “Here we show that safely and effectively navigating the canopy can remain very important for a large, semi-arboreal ape, even in open habitat. They also used specialized techniques—such as standing on branches—to reach highly prized food in the tree's large, open crown. “We suggest our bipedal gait continued to evolve in the trees even after the shift to an open habitat,” Drummond-Clarke said in a press statement. “Observational studies of great apes demonstrate they can walk on the ground for a few steps, but most often use bipedalism in the trees. It's logical that our early hominin relatives also engaged in this kind of bipedalism, where they can hold onto branches for extra balance.” The authors admit to some limitations of their theory. For instance, these conclusions only apply to the Issa Valley chimpanzees (so more data would be needed to apply this idea to chimps more broadly), and the feeding patterns were only analyzed during the dry season.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, its broader application has been hindered by three critical limitations: This led to the development of novel Lox variants that reduce reversible recombination activity by over 10-fold (approaching the background level of negative controls) while retaining high-efficiency forward recombination. They then leveraged their recently developed AiCE (AI-informed Constraints for protein Engineering), model -- a protein-directed evolution system integrating general inverse folding models with structural and evolutionary constraints -- to develop AiCErec, a recombinase engineering method. By harnessing the high editing efficiency of prime editors, they developed Re-pegRNA, a method that uses specifically designed pegRNAs to perform re-prime editing on residual Lox sites, precisely replacing them with the original genomic sequence, thereby ensuring seamless genome modifications. These platforms allow flexible programming of insertion positions and orientations for different Lox sites, enabling precise, scarless manipulation of DNA fragments ranging from kilobase to megabase scale in both plant and animal cells. As a proof of concept, the researchers used this technology to create herbicide-resistant rice germplasm with a 315-kb precise inversion, showcasing its transformative potential for genetic engineering and crop improvement. This pioneering work not only overcomes the historical limitations of the Cre-Lox system but also opens new avenues for precise genome engineering in a variety of organisms.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Let's face it, we've all curbed a wheel at some point while driving (an especially painful experience for those of us with aftermarket wheels). However, Unplugged Performance, a high-performance tuning company that makes go-fast parts for Teslas, is claiming that its latest “Road Warrior” wheels are indestructible. Available for the Model 3 and Model Y, Unplugged Performance feels so confident in its engineering that it's offering a free lifetime replacement promotion. They're not all that expensive either, at $80 for a two-pack. Forged wheels are also significantly lighter than cast wheels (even though that may sound counterintuitive to some), but Unplugged is certain that hasn't affected their product's toughness. In fact, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) data shows that the Road Warriors very nearly matched Tesla's most aerodynamic 18-inch “Photon” aero cover wheel, with a drag coefficient (Cd) just .010 higher. We were a little surprised to see Unplugged claim that beyond being designed for car enthusiasts, these sporty-looking rims were intended for taxis and fleet vehicles. But reading their promotional materials, it makes marginally more sense. Think about it: Should Tesla's Robotaxi actually become driverless one day, there's no expectation for the passenger to change a flat tire. Conveniently, the Road Warriors are designed to accommodate the OEM tires and Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) that your Model 3 or Model Y came with. This eliminates the need to spend extra money on a new set of tires, and helps retain the ride comfort, handling, and efficiency that Tesla spent millions to optimize. While we admire the engineering that's gone into these wheels, we doubt many fleet managers will opt to swap in Road Warriors, given the nearly $3,000 price tag for a set of four. For fleet use, implementing a service interval that replaces the standard wheels and tires before they break is much more practical.

These materials are stabilized by directional hydrogen-bonding patterns, giving rise to one-dimensional or two-dimensional assembly. It remains a challenge to mimic biology's context-adaptive and flexible structures. Here we introduce minimalistic tripeptide sequences that form highly soluble dynamic ensembles through multivalent side-chain interactions. We observe these supramolecular dispersions undergo drying-induced sequential liquid–liquid phase separation followed by solidification, resulting in the formation of films of stiff, densely packed and porous peptide microparticles that can be instantaneously redispersed upon the re-introduction of water. Air-drying of peptide dispersions in the presence of proteins or small-molecule payloads results in efficient encapsulation and the retention of protein stability after redispersion, showing promise for the emulsification, encapsulation, protection and storage of biomacromolecules. The mechanism resembles the protective strategies in natural systems during desiccation, which rely on liquid–liquid phase separation to survive extreme conditions. All life forms share conserved sets of building blocks. Biomolecular covalent and non-covalent interactions dictate the rich structural design space, supporting wide-ranging functions, including recognition, self-assembly, catalysis and shapeshifting. Beyond their critical roles in the chemistry of life, these structures provide inspiration for supramolecular materials1,2,3,4 and systems5 for various technological and biotechnological applications6,7,8. Peptide materials usually contain patterns of backbone hydrogen bonding derived from protein secondary structures9,10,11,12,13, typically giving rise to ordered one-dimensional (1D)14, two-dimensional (2D)15,16 or three-dimensional (3D)17 assemblies. These hydrogen-bond patterns may be further stabilized by aromatic stacking18,19, giving rise to architectures that are remarkably stiff and stable20. This is exemplified by ‘dry' diphenylalanine (FF) zippers21, where the chiral organization of side chains provides additional control over assembly structures22. We previously established that aromatic tripeptides with polar groups, such as lysine–tyrosine–phenylalanine (KYF), retain strong directional self-assembly tendencies complemented with favourable solvent interactions, leading to hydrogelation23. Besides ordered structures, the notion of non-directional assembly is also common in biology, for example, in liquid condensates, where it typically leads to spherical morphologies dictated by surface tension24,25. In these systems, side-chain interactions dictate the assembly, complementing flexible backbone interactions26. Short peptide motifs that display liquid–liquid phase separation27, including through flexible linkers separating aromatic dipeptides to disrupt directionality28, as well as the formation of unstructured solid glassy states29,30 have been reported. Beyond structures with varying instrinsic directionalities through backbone or side-chain interactions, biology frequently employs architectures that display structural agility in response to external factors. This may be achieved through dynamic selection and adjustment from the complex side-chain interaction space that is available5. This concept has been demonstrated in synthetic systems, where the adaptive versatility of biomimetic random heteropolymer sequences with flexible backbones and multiple (randomized) functional side chains have been shown to adaptively decorate and wrap proteins31 or to recapitulate the dynamic features of protein ensembles in biofluids32. Here we introduce sequence designs of tripeptides that are not isotropic through backbone hydrogen-bonding interactions but instead form dynamic ensembles through multiple possible combinations of weak and reversible interactions, by combining polar, hydrogen-bonding aromatic and basic residues (tryptophan (W), tyrosine (Y) and lysine (K); Fig. We show that these peptides form aqueous dispersions (Fig. 1b) with high aqueous solubility and unique context-adaptive properties, including dehydration-induced liquid–liquid phase separation and the formation of mechanically stiff particles with the ability to wrap, encapsulate, stabilize and protect proteins, while retaining instantaneous dispersibility upon rehydration. a, Chemical structures of tripeptides KFF, KYF, KYY and KYW. b, Macroscopic images of KFF, KYF, KYY and KYW peptides at 20 mM in phosphate buffer (PB) at pH 7.5. c, Selected snapshots of simulations for KFF (only backbone shown for clarity) and KYW, with predominant hydrogen-bond interactions highlighted. d, Sequence-dependent AP = SASAinitial/SASAequil (top) and distribution of hydrogen-bond interactions (bottom) between simulated peptides from MD trajectories for KFF, KYF, KYY and KYW. error bars were measured from three replicate simulations using 250 data points (the last 50 ns) of each analysis set. e, Snapshot from MD trajectory of KYW showing assembly inside a water box. f, Chemical shift perturbation (Δδ in parts per billion) for KYW between 50 mM and 1 mM concentrations. This figure highlights the evolving chemical environment for each KYW's protons (colour-coded accordingly) during concentration-driven assembly. Downfield shifts are represented as positive values and upfield shifts as negative values, reflecting the strengthening or weakening of hydrogen bonding and π-type interactions, respectively. Each bar represents the average of three independent experiments, with s.d. error bars from three replicates. g, The 1H NMR spectra of KYW at concentrations of 1 mM, 20 mM and 50 mM in 99:1 D2O/H2O with 100 mM Na/PB at pH 7.5, illustrating concentration-dependent shifts in f1 (frequencies) that reveal key interactions in the formation of dynamic soluble ensembles. Tripeptide assembly is favoured by sequences of two aromatic amino acids complemented with a charged residue23,33. Aromatic amino acids (Y and W; Fig. 1a,c) add a diversity of interactions beyond backbone hydrogen-bond directionality, including side-chain π-stacking, hydrogen-bonding and dipole–dipole interactions, importantly, including those with water34. Lysine–phenylalanine–phenylalanine (KFF), KYF and lysine–tyrosine–tyrosine (KYY) undergo gelation and phase separation, but lysine–tyrosine–tryptophan (KYW) remarkably retains the appearance of a clear solution up to 20 mM in phosphate buffer23 (Fig. Notably, KYW assembly is strongly dependent on the ionic context and on forming fibres and gels in unbuffered conditions23,35. We used atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to understand differences in assembly and hydrogen-bond interactions in KFF, KYF, KYY and KYW (Fig. First, exchanging F → Y → W leads to an increase in the aggregation propensity (AP; Fig. We analysed the contribution of the backbone–backbone (as a proxy for 1D self-assembly) and side-chain hydrogen bonds (Fig. Consistent with the increased AP, we observed a concomitant increase in the total number of hydrogen bonds in F → Y → W variants, with decreased backbone and increased side-chain hydrogen bonds resulting in non-directional assembly for KYW (Fig. We investigated the concentration-dependent behaviour of the KYW peptide using extensive 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses at 1, 20 and 50 mM in pH 7.5 phosphate buffer (Fig. Across this range, KYW showed no line broadening or signal loss, indicating that it remains highly dynamic and fully soluble even at higher concentrations. The assembly process is driven primarily by π-type hydrophobic interactions, side-chain hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, consistent with a dynamic, non-aggregating state. The relative contributions of side chains and backbone interactions when substituting F → Y → W are also evident in the circular dichroism spectra (Supplementary Figs. At a concentration of 5 mM, which is just above the critical aggregation for KYF and KYY (Supplementary Fig. 20a,b), the spectra show a carbonyl π → π* transition peak at 203 nm (Supplementary Figs. 18, 19a,b and 20a,b), suggesting backbone–backbone interactions, while the transitions of aromatic side chains may also contribute22. For KYW, this transition is less intense, while the appearance of the 229 nm positive signal that increases with concentration (Supplementary Figs. 18 and 19c) confirms the dominating influence of tryptophan side-chain interactions8,36. We previously demonstrated differential assembly of tripeptide sequence isomers driven by side-chain-induced conformation selection33. We speculated that in a system stabilized by a multitude of possible side-chain and water interactions, these would not be defined by one dominant conformation but instead represented by a rich ensemble of conformers. We studied the six K/Y/W sequence isomers to determine the sequence-dependent self-assembly (Fig. 21–26) and found lower variation in AP values (Fig. 21) and similar ratios of side-chain/backbone interactions (Fig. 22–25), consistent with the formation of non-directional ensembles. We also analysed the solvent exposure of tryptophan, measured through the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA; Fig. 26) of the indole side chain. This was found to be sequence dependent, with tryptophan–tyrosine–lysine (WYK) and tryptophan–lysine–tyrosine (WKY) being the most contrasting in terms of AP and tryptophan solvent exposure (Fig. a, From top to bottom, the AP score, tryptophan SASA and hydrogen-bonding interaction distribution analyses for K/Y/W sequence isomer MD trajectories. error bars were measured from three replicate simulations using 250 data points (last 50 ns) of each analysis set. Below is the ThT fluorescence emission intensity (50 µM) in the presence of peptide at 20 mM. error bars from three replicates. b, Snapshots for WKY and WYK showing non-directional self-assembly resulting in differential tryptophan environments and water binding (shown in blue) with zoomed-in areas showing a dry (top) and water-bound (bottom) tryptophan. c, The 3D fluorescence spectra showing the differential polarity and water interactions of tryptophan residues in solution. d, Chemical shift perturbation (Δδ in parts per billion) for WKY and WYK between concentrations of 50 mM and 1 mM. Each plot corresponds to a different sequence, with downfield shifts represented as positive values and upfield shifts as negative values. Each bar represents the average of three independent experiments, with s.d. error bars from three replicates. e, Concentration-dependent chemical shifts of the indole NH proton in K/Y/W sequence isomers, highlighting variations in the chemical environment and intermolecular interactions as concentration increases (1, 20 and 50 mM). Tryptophan exposure in peptide ensembles could be experimentally verified by measuring the tryptophan emission, which is widely used as a probe to detect the tryptophans' environment and solvent exposure in proteins, with redshifted emissions indicating an increase in local polarity and blueshifts indicating hydrophobic environments37,38,39. These ensembles (20 mM) did not show evidence of phase separation when observed by optical microscope (shown for KYW in Fig. We measured the emission spectra of all sequence isomers in soluble dispersions (Fig. 2c) and found that emission maxima (excitation wavelength λex = 280 nm) range from 357 nm to 370 nm, with the most redshifted emission corresponding to the most hydrated tryptophan (WYK) and the most blueshifted emission corresponding to the most hydrophobic tryptophan environment (WKY; Fig. The 3D excitation/emission spectra of contrasting sequences (Fig. 2c) differed by the appearance of a new band in WYK's spectrum at λex = 318 nm, which is also prominent in tyrosine–lysine–tryptophan (YKW) and tyrosine–tryptophan–lysine (YWK). We also found that the intensity and absence/presence of the band is concentration dependent, suggesting its origin from an emissive state of a supramolecular arrangement (Supplementary Fig. Concentration-dependent NMR studies on all K/Y/W sequence isomers revealed that while all maintain high dynamicity and solubility up to 50 mM, π-type, cation–π, hydrogen-bonding and electrostatic interactions contribute across all isomers, and the nature and strength of intermolecular interactions vary with sequence (Fig. The local chemical environment of tryptophan residues was probed by following the NH (W4) and CH (W3) indole protons in the 1H NMR spectra of the six K/Y/W peptide solutions at variable concentrations and showed contrasting concentration-dependent chemical shifts of tryptophan protons (Fig. The indole-ring protons in WYK shift downfield as the concentration increases, indicating their positioning in an electron-poor environment and the formation of a polar network and hydrogen bonding, while (minimal) upfield shifts were observed for WKY, in line with the formation of π-stacking-driven aggregation. The other four sequences exhibited moderate upfield shifts, less pronounced than those of WKY, in agreement with the MD simulation data (Fig. To quantify the degree of assembly across peptide sequences, we monitored changes in thioflavin T (ThT) emission upon co-incubation with 20 mM peptide solutions (Fig. 2a), revealing enhanced fluorescence consistent with the formation of dynamic hydrophobic pockets. This sequence-dependent ThT response, aligned with calculated AP scores and supported by NMR chemical shifts, confirms the presence of soluble dispersions featuring dynamic hydrophobic domains. To further probe dynamic ensembles in solution, we conducted fluorescence spectroscopy across increasing concentrations (2–20 mM), observing progressive tryptophan quenching (Supplementary Fig. Concentration-dependent diffusion changes, analysed by 1H diffusion-ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) NMR, were performed at 1, 20 and 50 mM (Supplementary Fig. 31), revealing decreased diffusion with increasing concentration. The peptide-to-water diffusion ratio suggests small soluble aggregates, consistent with unbroadened 1H NMR signals. The 1H–1H nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) NMR spectra for all six K/Y/W tripeptides highlight water interactions, predominantly at W4 and W3 (Supplementary Fig. WYK and YWK exhibit enhanced water contacts at positions W2 and W1, consistent with higher SASA values (Fig. 2a), while WKY also shows a W1–water correlation that aligns with the 1H NMR downfield shift (Fig. 28 and accompanying text), likely due to its N-terminal location. Upon investigating the fluorescence of KYW peptide assemblies using confocal microscopy, we observed a remarkable phase separation behaviour triggered by localized evaporation during drying. Given the (competing) role of water in modulating interactions in these dynamic ensembles, in particular those involving tryptophan40, the observation led us to study the assembly during gradual removal of water through the evaporation of sessile droplets41,42,43 (Fig. a, Representation of evaporation-driven self-assembly in sessile droplets. b, Evaporation patterns over time, with the differential assembly of KYW clearly visible. c, Microscopy time course for evaporation-driven assembly of KYW. d, Bright-field microscopy images showing 1D assembly for KYY (left) and the formation of spherical particles upon drying for KYW (right). e, The dynamic droplet fusion process of WKY is recorded by time-lapse confocal microscopy. From 0 s to 14 s, a transient fusion of two liquid–liquid phase separation droplets is seen. By 430 s, the rigidification of the droplets and appearance of pores on the surface are seen. f,g, Time-lapse confocal analysis (f) revealed the onset of pore formation upon solidification. The moment that the droplet stationized was set as 0 s. The spectrum of bright-field images across the particle (white dashed lines) during the solidification process were profiled (g) for quantitative visualization. Macroscopically, when observing tripeptide assembly in drying droplets starting from 20 mM peptide dispersions, we observed contrasting behaviours: a strongly scattering opaque ring upon drying for KYW, in contrast to KFF, KYF and KYY, which lead to heterogeneous semi-transparent structures (Fig. When observed by microscopy (Fig. 33), the differential morphologies (1D fibres versus 3D spherical objects) are evident (Supplemental Fig. Over time, KYW and its five sequence isomers all display a remarkable drying-induced phase separation behaviour, giving rise to the formation of films composed of densely packed spherical particles (Fig. 3d, Supplementary Video 3 and Extended Data Fig. 2a,b), contrasting with KFF, KYF and KYY, which lead to 1D structures resembling previous observations for the evaporation-driven assembly of peptide derivatives43 (Supplementary Fig. We propose that the multitude of possible interactions and the flexibility of the backbone enable the K/Y/W peptides to more effectively reconfigure and adapt to the newly formed interfaces that form upon water evaporation. The observed directionality (in the case of KFF, KYF, KYY) or lack of directionality (in the case of K/Y/W) initiates at the molecular level and clearly translates hierarchically to macroscopic scales. We observe complex drying patterns related to the solvent and solute gradients in the drying of droplets, with phase separation occurring at the drying front due to concentration gradients inside the drying droplet. Streaks observed during drying are a consequence of complex Marangoni flows in these drying droplets (Extended Data Fig. Based on the previously reported interfacial supramolecular aggregation of tripeptides in oil–water emulsions35, we hypothesized that the ensembles would lead to interfacial aggregation and a reduction in surface tension. We measured the dynamic tension profile via the pendant drop method44 of the six K/Y/W tripeptides, which have contrasting tryptophan solvent exposures and environments. The dynamic surface tension indicates that the peptide sequence dictates the surface activity, with a general trend observed in which less solvent-exposed tryptophan (in WKY) gives rise to higher surface activity (Supplementary Fig. Time-dependent cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) images illustrate the nanoscale structural transformations from amorphous aggregates to spherical droplets to porous droplets observed at the early stages of assembly (Extended Data Fig. Dynamic droplet fusion and subsequent solidification is captured by time-lapse confocal microscopy (Fig. Time-dependent confocal analysis revealed the onset of pore formation upon solidification (Fig. Time-dependent fluorescence spectroscopy during the drying-induced assembly gave rise to a decreased emission due to concentration-induced quenching, followed by a sharp fluorescence increase upon liquid–liquid phase separation (5–10 min), and subsequent quenching during droplet solidification (Supplementary Fig. Upon analysis of the tryptophan emission in the dried films at 5% relative humidity, we noted a general loss of emission from the 318 nm band in the 3D excitation/emission spectra, with spectra of the dried films now suggesting a redistribution of conformations (Supplementary Figs. The original variable tryptophan exposure was partly recovered by temporarily exposing the solid film to high humidity (95% relative humidity). These data highlight the adaptive nature of the assemblies, in which tryptophan partitioning reversibly changes depending on the water competing via weak multivalent interactions. Upon microscopy analysis of the dried particulate films, we observed the expected spherical objects, but also porous, disc-shaped particles of varying sizes with flat surfaces (Fig. These structures are found at the top of the sample (Fig. 4b,c and Extended Data Fig. 4), suggesting that they are formed at the air–water interface. The observation suggests that, in contrast to typical dense coacervate droplets that form as a sediment, the structures studied here are low-density, buoyant condensates. The observation of flattened 2D hemispherical objects suggests that these particles are initially liquid, and due to their low density, they rise to the interface, where they deform, flatten and solidify. This optical observation (Supplementary Fig. 41) is confirmed using focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM; Fig. 4c), which shows a part-circular cross-section. The pore size distribution ranged from 30–500 nm (Supplementary Fig. a, Schematic representation of evaporation-driven assembly of buoyant liquid droplets that settle at the droplet interface and, upon drying, form half-dome-shaped particles. b, SEM image showing a mixture of porous spheres and half-dome particles at the interface and also showing surface pores. Note that the fine granular structures on the surface are from sputter-coated gold. d, TEM analysis of glutaraldehyde-crosslinked dissociated KWY particles reveals that non-surface particles are highly porous spheres. e, AFM analysis showing porous half-dome particles. f, The plot of Young's modulus showing the stiffness of fibres or particles formed by the indicated peptides. A total of 15–36 particles or fibres were profiled for each sequence. We propose that the observed buoyancy is related to the formation of gas bubbles inside liquid droplets (Fig. This may be a consequence of a loss of solvating water from the peptide structures, water that is replaced with air and leads to micro-cavitation, resulting in a porous structure upon dehydration (Fig. Notably, degassing of the peptide dispersion prior to evaporation-driven assembly leads to smaller particles of more spherical morphology (Fig. This observation indicates that the buoyant nature of the droplets relates to their gas content, and it can be regulated. Non-surface particles are smaller and spherical, indicating fusion and flattening at the air–water interface (Fig. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of glutaraldehyde-crosslinked KWY particles reveals the porous and spherical structure of the non-surface particles (Fig. The hemispherical porous structure was further confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM; Fig. A Young's modulus from Derjaguin-Muller-Toporov (DMT) model fitting analysis demonstrated that these particles, formed by all sequence isomers, are mechanically stiff (6 GPa) due to the efficient packing (Fig. 4f), in line with previously reported FF derivatives20,21. a,b, Temperature dictates the size distribution of the dried peptide particles. KWY shows a reduction in particle size and more homogeneous size distribution as temperature increases during evaporation. A total of 368–1,456 particles at each temperature were analysed. c, The 20 mM WKY peptide was dissolved in Na/PB at concentrations of 25, 50, 100, 250, 500 and 1,000 mM. A bright-field image of dried WKY in 500 mM PB is shown. d, Plot of 296–662 Imaris-3D-rendered particles at each concentration demonstrates the reduction in particle size and increase in homogeneity with the increase of salt concentration. e–g, The peptide solution was degassed, followed by the evaporation assay; the example of WKY is shown (e). Imaris 3D rendering demonstrated a reduction in particle size and increase in sphericity, as plotted in f and g, respectively. h, Fully reversible formation of porous peptide particles upon addition of water and re-evaporation. Representative time-lapse images of KWY are shown. The macroscopic images of 5 µl peptide solution drops at each stage are shown in the insets. Scale bar in the insert, 500 µm. We first investigated whether the size distribution of the particles formed could be controlled. Given the important role of water evaporation in this process, we reasoned that by simply increasing the temperature, evaporation would occur faster and consequently, the formation of solid particles would be accelerated. We observed that temperature increase leads to more homogeneous and smaller particles (Fig. 5a,b and Extended Data Fig. The combination of reduced buoyancy, due to lower gas content at elevated temperature, with the acceleration of the phase transition and solidification yields particles that are monodisperse (Extended Data Fig. Another approach to control sphericity was through an increase of the buffer concentration, which results in smaller and monodisperse particles (Fig. 5c), observed through an accelerated phase change and solidification (Fig. As an alternative method to control particle size, we removed the air from the solution through sonication under a vacuum, followed by storage under argon gas, and examined the drying process in a degassed solution under argon. Live confocal time-lapse imaging of the particle-forming process revealed smaller droplets (Extended Data Fig. Further Imaris 3D reconstruction and analysis demonstrated a 20-fold reduction in particle volume and increase in sphericity in the degassed samples compared with a prevalence of disc-shaped particles in non-degassed samples (Fig. Consistent with the role of air in pore formation, degassed peptide particles show fewer and smaller pores (Extended Data Fig. Upon a re-introduction of a 5 µl droplet of water on top of a dried film, the structures immediately redispersed, as shown in Fig. When this droplet was left to dry again, the particle film reappeared after a few minutes, demonstrating that the process is fully reversible (Supplementary Video 11). These observations strongly contrast with those previously reported for peptide materials, where the formations of 1D and 2D structures are highly stable due to a large enthalpic gain from cooperative hydrogen bonds, which are not readily reversed20,21. Peptide ensembles with multivalent, weak and dynamic interactions offer more reversible assemblies, as water solvation can compete with the energetics of the interaction space5. We propose that the spontaneous formation of tightly packed particles upon air-drying could be useful in encapsulation, protection and drying strategies, inspired by phase-separation protection mechanisms seen in biological systems45 (Fig. We first used the small organic fluorophore Alexa 488, which has been previously demonstrated to non-covalently conjugate through the sulfonate group and lysine side chains46. Upon introduction of the dye, it is encapsulated during KWY droplet formation and solidification (Fig. Similar efficient encapsulation was obtained for crystal violet, a positively charged hydrophobic dye (Extended Data Fig. a, Proposed mechanism for payload uptake involving dynamic complexation of payload molecules through dynamic side-chain interactions, followed by the molecules being surrounded to form droplets upon liquid–liquid phase separation. b, Confocal live imaging (left) of KWY peptide particles incorporating Alexa 488 shows efficient enrichment of the dye in peptide droplets. Fluorescence intensity analysis (right) of the preload solution (i), the droplet (ii) and the post-load solution (iii) at the frontier of emulsification. A total of 20 regions of interest of each group from six time-lapse frames were quantified, and the average intensity of the preload solution was set as 100 arbitrarily. c, Encapsulation assay of the EGFP protein by the WKY peptide was performed as described in b. d, Confocal and bright-field imaging of dried peptide particles reveal that the green fluorescence signals of EGFP remain in WKY peptide particles under ambient conditions for five days after solidification. e,f, Experiment to test the storage and redispersion ability of WKY with a schematic representation (e) of the experiment and the fluorescence emission at 510 nm (λex = 488 nm) of the corresponding solution (EGFP, EGFP + KYF and EGFP + WKY) over time (f). g, The amount of reactive lysozyme in the dried particles with PBS or WKY at day 0 and day 15 under ambient conditions were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Next, inspired by the ability of dynamic interacting block copolymers with random distributions of side-chain functionalities to stabilize proteins through an adaptive matching of side-chain interactions to complementary patches on the protein surface31, we investigated the ability to encapsulate and stabilize enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). We observed efficient encapsulation in WKY (Fig. By comparing the encapsulation efficiency across the six sequence isomers, we conclude that both the Alexa 488 and EGFP encapsulation efficiencies are comparable for all peptide sequence isomers studied (Extended Data Fig. As EGFP fluorescence requires a folded conformation, we evaluated the preservation of structure in the dried state (Fig. After drying and subsequent rehydrating, the EGFP solution loses its fluorescence, whereas the WKY + EGFP sample shows retention of fluorescence emission after drying and storage in dried form for five days, followed by instantaneous re-dissolution (Fig. The control KYF + EGFP (fibrous assembly)23 reveals a decrease in the fluorescence (Fig. 42c), suggesting a level of stabilization through protein–peptide interactions. These results highlight that the drying peptide ensembles provide an environment where proteins are stabilized, including in the dried state, possibly through mechanisms analogous to dynamic interfacial complexation via the self-organization of side chains with a protein surface45 (Fig. Using either a desiccator or lyophilizer, we found comparable EGFP fluorescence recovery, indicating that further dehydration does not impair dry-state protein preservation (Supplementary Fig. Under degassed conditions, we observed that the encapsulation of EGFP inside the particles was comparable to that at ambient conditions and does not depend on the microporosity (Supplementary Fig. The encapsulation mechanism in this system is distinct from conventional partitioning into preformed condensates. Here, small molecules or proteins first interact with dynamic peptide ensembles in solution through non-covalent side-chain interactions—particularly electrostatic and π-related contacts involving the lysine, tyrosine and tryptophan residues. These interactions result in complexation with the payload in solution, before phase separation resembling previously described dynamic surface-stabilization approaches32, enabling efficient engulfment of the payload during droplet formation. A series of experiments support this mechanism: tryptophan fluorescence quenching confirmed the binding, before the liquid–liquid phase separation, of both positively and negatively charged aromatic dyes (crystal violet and Alexa 488; Extended Data Fig. 6a,b), and confocal microscopy demonstrated efficient encapsulation regardless of charge (Extended Data Fig. GFP variants with varied net charge47,48 revealed that a higher charge enhances encapsulation (Extended Data Fig. 8a–d), reinforcing the role of electrostatics and π-interactions. Furthermore, simultaneous encapsulation of multiple fluorescent proteins of differing charge and colour49 preserved the fluorescence over time, highlighting the system versatility (Extended Data Fig. Finally, functional lysozyme encapsulation and the retention of active enzyme after 15 days in the dried state confirmed both the stability and bioactivity preservation (Fig. The drying-induced assembly process was evaluated for potential scalability by heating, vacuum (Extended Data Fig. 9a) or producing small droplets for rapid drying, resulting in comparable particle formation and EGFP encapsulation within these sprayed micro-droplets (Extended Data Fig. These data suggest that K/Y/W isomer tripeptides offer potential for encapsulation, drying, storage and the redispersion of biomolecules. We demonstrate the unique phase behaviour of tripeptides that form non-directional soluble dispersions covering a rich interaction space, leading to context-adaptive assembly. Through air-drying, these K/Y/W tripeptides lead to the spontaneous formation of high-porosity solids upon water evaporation that are instantaneously redispersed. The observed assembly and phase behaviour is governed by side-chain interactions, in contrast to the rigid-backbone hydrogen-bond topologies that typically dictate directional architectures in self-assembling molecules. We demonstrate that the six sequence isomers of K/W/Y form soluble ensembles with the sequence dictating the preferred interactions, but upon drying-induced assembly, all sequences lead to particle films with comparable emission in the dried state, suggesting that regardless of sequence, tryptophan has comparable stabilizing interactions. The phase separation process enables the encapsulation of small-molecule and protein payloads, and they are rapidly and fully reversible upon the re-introduction of water. We propose that this peptide-based evaporation-driven emulsification and encapsulation approach, without mechanical energy input, may find applications in the storage, formulation and desiccation protection of both biomolecules and biomacromolecules. Tryptophan's rich interaction potential makes it a good candidate for adaptive and interfacial assembly5,8, building on its roles in proteins that are enabled by its unique heteroaromatic nature, such as its specific interfacial functions, for example, near lipid bilayers and ion channels50,51. We note a remarkable similarity with the protective mechanism of the natural adaptations in organisms such as tardigrades and plant seeds, which rely on liquid–liquid phase separation and vitrification of disordered proteins to preserve biomolecular function45,52. All reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. Peptides were either synthesized in‑house or purchased from GenScript and used after trifluoroacetic acid removal. All-atom tripeptide (PDB) structures (KFF, KYF, KYY, KYW, KWY, WKY, WYK, YKW and YWK) were generated using Avogadro (ref. These were then processed using the GROMACS tool gmx pdb2gmx to generate a topology file in the OPLS-AA/L all-atom force field54 (2001 amino acid dihedrals), and the TIP3P (ref. 55) explicit water model was chosen to simulate the solvent. The ionizable peptide side chains and termini were set to their respective charged states (NH3+ for Lys and N termini, and COO− for C termini), and 60 molecules of these tripeptides were inserted in an 8 × 8 × 8 nm3 box using a random seed with the tool gmx insert-molecules, giving an effective peptide concentration of ~200 mM. This box was then solvated using the tool gmx solvate by using a pre-equilibrated solvent box (SPC216) as a reference. Sixty solvent molecules were then randomly replaced by 60 Cl− ions to neutralize the net positive charge from the cationic tripeptides using the tool gmx genion. This neutralized box was subjected to steepest-descent energy minimization to remove packing conflicts. Short (1 ns) NVT (constant number of particles, volume and temperature) (temperature T = 298 K) and NPT (constant number of particles, pressure and temperature) (T = 298 K and pressure P = 1 bar) equilibrations were carried out while imposing position restraints on the peptides to allow the water to equilibrate. Self-assembly production MD simulations in the NPT ensemble were then carried out for 1,000 ns in triplicate for all sequences with no restraints on positions with the GROMACS v.2022.x package56 using the leap-frog integrator (time step = 2 fs). 57) was used to constrain bonds, and the particle mesh Ewald method was used for long-range electrostatics with a Coulomb and van der Waals cut-off of 1.0 nm each. Temperature coupling was achieved using the modified Berendsen thermostat58, whereas isotropic pressure coupling was maintained using the Parrinello–Rahman barostat59. The trajectory was saved every 100.0 ps or 0.1 ns, giving 10,000 frames per 1,000 ns simulation. The last 50 ns or 500 frames were used for statistical analysis of hydrogen bonding, SASA and AP. The number of hydrogen bonds were measured in peptide–peptide interactions (total) as well as backbone–backbone, backbone/side-chain and side-chain/side-chain interactions using the tool gmx hbond with the donor–acceptor distance cut-off set to 0.35 nm and the hydrogen–donor–acceptor angle cut-off set to 30°. SASA was measured for the total peptides and the tryptophan side chain specifically using the tool gmx sasa with a solvent probe radius of 0.14 nm. Running AP was computed by a custom Python script dividing the initial SASA by the SASA at the current frame: AP = SASAinitial/SASAtime. Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD; ref. Peptide solutions (and aggregates) were prepared by dissolving peptides in 100 mM sodium PB at pH 8 to a final peptide concentration of 20 mM. The pH was adjusted to 7.5 using 0.5 M HCl solution. The stock solution was heated for 5 min at 70 °C and left to cool for 1 h at room temperature (22–25 °C) to remove kinetically trapped aggregates. For lower concentrations (from 0.5 mM to 10 mM), the stock solutions were first heated and then left to cool to room temperature and the required amount collected. The diluted solutions were then heated for 5 min at 70 °C and aged for 1 h at room temperature. Peptide solutions (and aggregates) were prepared by dissolving peptides in 100 mM sodium PB at pH 8 to final peptide concentrations of 1 mM, 20 mM and 50 mM in a 90:10 (v/v) H2O/D2O ratio. The pH was adjusted to 7.5 using 0.5 M HCl solution. The stock solution was heated for 5 min at 70 °C and left to cool for 1 h at room temperature (22–25 °C) to remove kinetically trapped aggregates. For lower concentrations (from 0.5 mM to 10 mM), the stock solutions were first heated and then left to cool to room temperature and the required amount collected. The diluted solutions were then heated for 5 min at 70 °C and aged for 1 h at room temperature. The 1H and 19F NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker AVANCE HD III 700.20 MHz spectrometer and 282.2 MHz in the frequencies of 1H and 19F, respectively. The NMR experiments were performed at 298.2 K on a 5 mm QCI-F cryoprobe and on a multinuclear Broadband Fluorine Observe (BBFO) probe with z gradients. Typical 1D 19F NMR acquisition parameters were as follows: 8.0 μs pulse length (60° flip angle), 100 ppm sweep width (65,789 Hz) centred at −80 ppm, 0.50 s acquisition time, 2 s relaxation delay time and 256 scans (11 min). The 1D 19F NMR spectra were processed with 5 Hz exponential line broadening and visualized using TopSpin v.3.6.4. The 1D 1H NMR spectra were acquired using excitation sculpting (zgesgp) for water suppression, 32,768 points (time domain) and a recycling delay (relaxation delay (d1)) of 1.5 s. The 2D NMR experiments (1H–1H correlation spectroscopy (COSY), 1H–1H NOESY, 13C/1H heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) and 13C/1H heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC)) were acquired at 298.2 K using the same spectrometer and cryoprobe. The number of scans was set according to sample concentration. For the 13C/1H HSQC experiments (the hsqcetgpprsisp2.2 pulse program), the 1JCH was adjusted to 145 Hz, and the 13C/1H HMBC experiments (the hmbcgplpndprqf pulse program) were performed using an nJCH of 6 Hz; both pulse sequences used presaturation for water suppression. The 1H diffusion (DOSY) experiments were performed using the stimulated echo pulse sequence, stebpgp1s19. The following parameters were used for all peptides and at all concentrations: diffusion time (Δ) was set to 80 ms, the little delta (δ) was set to 2.4 ms, a linear ramp of 16 points varying from 1.019 to 47.906 G cm−1 was used and a d1 of 1.5 s was used. The water diffusion coefficient at the different peptide concentrations was measured using the stimulated echo pulse sequence without water suppression, stebpgp1s. The diffusion time (Δ) was set to 20 ms, the little delta (δ) was set to 2.0 ms, a linear ramp of 16 points varying from 1.019 to 42.809 G cm−1, and a d1 of 2 s was used. Evaporation-driven assembly was performed by depositing 5 µl droplets of peptide solution (prepared as per previous section) on a glass no. 1.5 coverslip and leaving it to evaporate at room temperature (22–25 °C) at around 40–50% humidity. For the imaging of the final products of peptides after evaporation, the 5 µl droplets were left to dry at the ambient conditions indicated above for about 30 min. The coverslips with dried peptide residue were subsequently used for analysis by confocal microscopy, AFM, FIB-SEM or TEM, with sample preparation and imaging occurring within 1 h. For live imaging, the droplets were first left to evaporate at ambient conditions for about 10 min and then moved to the confocal stage for time-lapse imaging under laser excitation. We note that while this approach may elevate the temperature of samples by a few degrees, we observe similar behaviour in the absence of laser irradiation. Fluorescence emission and excitation spectra were measured on a JASCO FP-8500 spectrofluorometer with emitted light measured orthogonally to the excitation light sourced from a xenon lamp in quartz cells with a path length of 1.5 mm. The spectra were measured on 50 µl peptide solutions, using a scanning speed of 200 nm min−1 with an emission bandwidth of 5 nm, a 1 nm data collection interval, a 1 s response time and medium sensitivity. The 3D spectra were recorded at λex = 230 to 450 nm and λem = 230 to 600 nm. Emission spectra were recorded on Jasco FP-6500 fluorometer, using a 1.5 mm black quartz cuvette. The spectra were measured with a bandwidth of 2.5 nm and response time of 0.1 s, with collection at 500 nm min−1 and 0.1 nm intervals. Some 15 µl of each sample was placed on the cuvette and excited at 488 nm. The emission spectra were recorded from 490 to 580 nm. The dry samples were resolubilized with 15 µl distilled water to evaluate their fluorescence in solution. The experiment was replicated with three individual samples. Degassing was carried out by placing the peptide sample in a small Eppendorf vial and placing this in a septum vial. The sample was then placed on ice and put under vacuum for 5–10 min while being sonicated and subsequently refilled with argon. This was repeated five times. Alternative degassing by a 20 min gentle sonication in a Bioruptor (30 s on and 30 s off, 20 cycles) at 4 °C achieved a similar degassing effect. Some 5 µl droplets of peptides were deposited onto a glass coverslip and allowed to dry at room temperature. To assess the drying time and patterns at the macroscopic level, videos coupled with microscopy were taken of the drying process. Bright-field videos of KFF, KYF, KYY, KYW and PBS were taken using a Zeiss Stemi 580 dissecting microscope outfitted with a smartphone adaptor (Celestron NexYZ three-axis universal smartphone adaptor for a telescope, purchased from Amazon.com) at ×2.5 physical zoom and ×2 digital zoom to allow for recording with a smartphone (iPhone 13, 12MP camera system). Side-view video of KYW was taken by a wireless digital microscope at ×75 zoom (STPCTOU wireless digital microscope, 2MP camera, 1080P, purchased from Amazon.com) connected to a Dell Precision Tower 5810 computer, using the microscope's companion recording software, Inskam. Post-processing of the videos to create time-lapses was performed in Adobe Premier Pro. Confocal imaging was performed using a Zeiss LSM880 Airyscan instrument. Live images were taken, focusing at the bottom left edge of the 5 µl drying peptide droplet sample at ×10 or ×20 magnification. Time series were taken with a scan speed of 7 or 8, a line average of 2 and a frame size of 1,024 × 1,024 or 512 × 512 pixels under the objective EC Plan Neofluor ×10 (0.3 numerical aperture) or Plan Apo ×20 (0.8 numerical aperture). Time-lapse videos were captured continuously without interval and exported as .avi files at 10–25 frames per second. Processing of the videos to create time-lapses was performed in Adobe Premier Pro. For the confocal imaging of dried peptide samples, 5 µl of each peptide sample was deposited onto a no. 1.5 coverslip and allowed to dry at the ambient conditions indicated above or on a heated plate at a designated temperature, and the complete dried samples were subjected to confocal imaging. Transmitted light coupled with a 561 nm laser at 0.2% laser power and a T-PMT detector module was used to capture the bright-field imaging under a Plan Apo ×20, 0.8 numerical aperture objective. A 405 nm laser at 1.0% laser power was used to detect the weak but traceable blue fluorescence (414–472 nm) of the peptide aggregates, and the blue fluorescence signal was used for Imaris 3D rendering. For the encapsulation of the Alexa 488 experiment, 1 mM aqueous stock solution of Alexa 488 dye (Thermo Fisher) was added such that the final concentration of the dye was 10 µM. For the encapsulation of the crystal violet experiment, 1 mM aqueous stock solution of crystal violet dye (Thermo Scientific) was mixed with 20 mM WKY peptide solution to reach the final concentration of 10 µM. For the encapsulation experiment of native EGFP (charge –7), lyophilized recombinant EGFP was purchased from ProSpec (catalogue no. PRO-1606) and reconstituted into 100 µg ml−1 stock solution. The stock solution was mixed with 20 mM WKY or KYF or 10 mM PBS solution to a final concentration of 10 µg ml−1. For encapsulation of the varying charged GFP proteins, a 2 mg ml−1 aqueous stock solution of GFP with net charge of −30, −18, 0 or +18 was mixed with 20 mM WKY solution to a final concentration of 10 µg ml−1. For the simultaneous encapsulation of multiple proteins, 2 mg ml−1 aqueous stock solutions of miRFP682 (−6), mScarlet (+5) and GFP (0) were mixed with 20 mM WKY solution to a final concentration of 10 µg ml−1 each. All the encapsulation assays were conducted using 5 µl of the mixture dropped onto a coverslip. For Alexa 488 and EGFP protein encapsulation imaging, a 488 nm laser at 0.5% and 0.3% laser power was used, respectively, to detect green fluorescence emission at 502–561 nm, together with transmitted light to detect the peptide aggregate structure. For crystal violet imaging, an excitation wavelength of 561 nm at 0.2% laser power was used to detect red fluorescence emission at 575–631 nm. For various charged GFP protein encapsulations, a 488 nm laser at 0.2% laser power and an emission of 502–561 nm were used. For the multicolour fluorescent protein encapsulation experiment, a 488 nm laser at 0.2% laser power was used to detect GFP (0) emission at 502–561 nm; a 561 nm laser at 0.2% laser power was used to detect red fluorescent protein mScarlet (+5) emission at 575–631 nm; and a 633 nm laser at 0.5% laser power was used to detect near infrared fluorescent protein miRFP682 (−6) emission at 638–677 nm. All the fluorescence imaging was captured together with transmitted light to detect the peptide aggregate structure. For the lysozyme–Alexa 488 encapsulation assay, a 100 µg ml−1 aqueous stock solution of lysozyme–Alexa 488 was mixed with 20 mM WKY or PBS solution to a final concentration of 10 µg ml−1. For confocal fluorescence imaging, 5 µl of each mixture was dropped onto a coverslip to dry through evaporation at ambient conditions. The dried particles were examined using a confocal microscope with excitation at 488 nm by a laser and green fluorescence emission of 502–561 nm. For the lysozyme preservation experiment, three 5 µl droplets of a mixture of 20 mM WKY plus 10 µg ml−1 lysozyme were dropped onto a coverslip for an evaporation assay at ambient conditions. The dried particles were rehydrated using 5 µl double-distilled H2O on day 0 and day 15. The rehydrated solution from 3 dried droplets were combined into a measurable volume of 15 µl as one replicate to proceed with concentration measurement using a Chicken Lysozyme ELISA Kit (NOVUS Biologicals, catalogue no. A microplate reader (SpectraMax 190) was used to measure absorbance at 450 nm, with the correction wavelength set at 540 nm. A four-parameter logistic standard curve was generated by plotting the mean absorbance for each standard on the x axis against the concentration on the y axis using GraphPad Prism. The reading of optical density values of each sample was matched to this standard curve to obtain the corresponding lysozyme concentration. All experiments were carried out in three replicates. For scaling up the evaporation by heat, 20 µl of WKY peptide solution was dropped onto a coverslip, which was placed on a heated plate at 35 °C. For scaling up the evaporation by vacuum, a coverslip with 20 µl of 20 mM WKY peptide solution was placed in a desiccator connected to a vacuum. For scaling up the evaporation by spraying, 20 µl of 20 mM WKY peptide solution was injected into an HTX M5 sprayer (HTX Tech) through a Microfluidics Programmable Syringe Pump (NE-1002X). Different flow rates of 40, 60, 80 and 160 µl min−1 were tested. The same spray parameters were used for all tested flow rates: a velocity of 1,300 mm min−1, track spacing of 2 mm, N2 pressure of 10 psi and nozzle height of 40 mm. The sprayer was operated for 15 s to complete one spray cycle. To analyse the encapsulation efficiency of the spray system, 20 µl of 20 mM WKY peptide solution with 10 µg ml−1 EGFP was injected into the HXT M5 and sprayed at 80 µl min−1. The enrichment of GFP fluorescence in the dried particles within each micro-drop was examined using confocal microscopy, as described above. Confocal z-stack images were obtained at ×20 magnification with ×4 zoom. The optical sections were taken at the optimal interval suggested by a Zeiss Zen Black 8.0 with 50% overlap. The thickness of the sets of z stacks ranged from 10 µm to 15 µm. The z-stack images were exported as .czi files and then converted to .ims files using ImarisConverter. Analysis was done on Imaris v.10.0.0 (Bitplane) and MatLab v.8.0 (Mathworks) on a Dell Precision 7920 Workstation with a 12 GB NVIDIA 4070Ti graphics card. The 3D reconstruction was performed on z-stack images using the ‘Spots' and ‘Surfaces' functions in Imaris with a surface detail of 0.4 µm and automatic thresholding using local contrast in transparency mode. Objects were statistically coded by diameter, with a range of 0.5 µm to 8 µm. MATLAB XTension was used to control camera angles in animated videos. Approximately 200–1,000 particles were analysed in each of the conditions. Dots were not marked due to large sample size (n > 10). Quantification of object diameter, volume or sphericity was generated in the Imaris statistics tab, and GraphPad Prism was used to generate box plots. TEM grids were purchased from Ted Pella (product no. 01895-F) with a lacey carbon support film. All grids were treated for 35 s in Fischione Nanoclean 1070 (70% power) with a mixture of argon (75%) and oxygen (25%). Cryo-EM grids were prepared in Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 21 °C with the following settings: relative humidity, 100%; wait time, 0 s; blot time, 3 s; and blot force, 4. A 2 µl of sample solution was gently pipetted onto a freshly glow-discharged lacey carbon grid and put through evaporation under ambient conditions for the indicated periods of time before being blotted with filter paper and plunged into liquid ethane that was precooled by liquid nitrogen. The cryo-EM grids were then transferred to and stored in liquid nitrogen. The cryo-EM grid was transferred in liquid nitrogen into a Gatan 626 cryo-specimen holder that was then inserted into the microscope stage. The specimen temperature was maintained at about −170 °C during data collection. Cryo-EM imaging was performed in low dose mode of a Titan Halo TEM instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operating at 300 kV, and images were recorded on a CETA camera (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The 5 µl peptide samples were first applied onto glass slides and air dried. They were then mounted onto SEM pin stubs using double-sided carbon tape. Gold was sputter-coated on the sample surface to a thickness of 10 nm using a Leica EM ACE600 coater for better electrical conductivity. These samples were then imaged in a Thermo Scientific (FEI) Helios NanoLab 660 FIB-SEM instrument with a high tension (voltage) of 5 kV and a current of 25 pA using an Everhart–Thornley detector and a through lens detector. A FIB was used with Ga+ ions at 30 kV and 0.79 nA to mill cross sections at a scale of tens of micrometres. The stage was tilted at 52° for FIB milling and cross-section imaging. Height images and mechanical property mapping were simultaneously carried out in PeakForce QNM (quantitative nanoscale mechanical) tapping mode using a Bruker Multimode 8 AFM. The optical lever sensitivity of the AFM cantilevers (RTESPA-525, Bruker) was calibrated on a sapphire surface. The cantilever spring constant was calibrated by Bruker Thermal Tune software. Prior to measuring tripeptide samples, a flat polystyrene surface of 3.5 GPa Young's modulus was used to confirm the Young's modulus reading of the AFM set-up. The measurement from 5–10 solid porous particles or fibres of each peptide was plotted.

Nature Reviews Cancer (2025)Cite this article Ageing is a process characterized by a wide array of cellular and systemic changes that together increase the risk of developing cancer. While cell-autonomous mutations within incipient tumour cells are important, age-related changes in the microenvironment are critical partners in the transformation process and response to therapy. However, aspects of ageing that are important and the degree to which they contribute to cancer remain obscure. One of the factors that impacts ageing is increased cellular senescence but it is important to note that ageing and cellular senescence are not synonymous. We highlight open questions, including if senescent cells have phenotypically distinct impacts in aged versus young tissue, or if it is the cell type that dictates the impact of senescence on tissue homeostasis and disease. Finally, it is probable that our current definition of cellular senescence encompasses more than one mechanistically distinct cellular state; thus, we highlight phenotypic differences that have been noted across cell types and tissues of origin. This Review focuses on the role that senescent stromal cells have in cancer, with a particular emphasis on fibroblasts given the amount of work that has focused on them.
