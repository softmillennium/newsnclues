                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI on Tuesday released two open-weight language models for the first time since it rolled out GPT-2 in 2019. An artificial intelligence model is considered open weight if its parameters, or the elements that improve its outputs and predictions during training, are publicly available. Open-weight models can offer transparency and control, but they are different from open-source models, whose full source code becomes available for people to use and modify. Several other tech companies, including Meta, Microsoft-backed Mistral AI and the Chinese startup DeepSeek, have also released open-weight models in recent years. "It's been exciting to see an ecosystem develop, and we are excited to contribute to that and really push the frontier and then see what happens from there," OpenAI President Greg Brockman told reporters during a briefing. "OpenAI showed the world what could be built on Nvidia AI â€” and now they're advancing innovation in open-source software," Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. In a post on X in July, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company needed more time to "run additional safety tests and review high-risk areas." That came after a separate post weeks earlier, where Altman said the models would not be released in June. OpenAI said Tuesday that it carried out extensive safety training and testing on its open-weight models. It filtered out harmful chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear data during pre-training, and it mimicked how bad actors could try to fine-tune the models for malicious purposes. Through this testing, OpenAI said it determined that maliciously fine-tuned models were not able to reach the "high capability" threshold in its Preparedness Framework, which is its method for measuring and protecting against harm. The company also worked with three independent expert groups who provided feedback on its malicious fine-tuning evaluation, OpenAI said. The models will be available to run on PCs through programs such as LM Studio and Ollama. Cloud providers Amazon, Baseten and Microsoft are also making the models available. Users can run gpt-oss-20b on a laptop, for instance, and use it as a personal assistant that can search through files and write, OpenAI said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NASA should be ready to launch a reactor to the lunar surface by the first quarter of fiscal year 2030, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who is serving as the space agency's acting administrator, said in a directive to NASA dated July 31. This would work out to late 2029. China and Russia are aiming to deploy a reactor to the moon by the mid-2030s to power a joint base, officials in Moscow and Beijing have said. The first country to deploy a reactor on the moon "could potentially declare a keep-out zone which would significantly inhibit the United States from establishing a planned Artemis presence if not there first," Duffy warned NASA. The Artemis mission is NASA's lunar exploration program, which was first announced in 2017. NASA should issue a request for proposals to industry within 60 days, according to Duffy's directive. The reactor should be able to generate 100 kilowatts of electricity at a minimum, according to the directive. It would be transported aboard a heavy class lander with a payload of 15 metric tons. The NASA program, called Fission Surface Power, will rely on microreactor technology, according to Duffy's directive. But no microreactor has been licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, let alone built in the U.S. President Donald Trump issued a series of executive orders in May that aim to expedite the commercialization of small nuclear reactors. Duffy's ambitious directive comes as the Trump administration has proposed steep cuts to NASA's budget. The space agency also remains without a Senate-confirmed leader. Trump named Duffy as acting administrator after pulling his original nominee in May amid a feud with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The rift between Moscow and Washington looks set to deepen after U.S. President Donald Trump said Tuesday that Russia's economy "stinks" and that lower oil prices will hammer President Vladimir Putin's oil-funded war machine. "Putin will stop killing people if you get energy down another $10 a barrel. He's going to have no choice because his economy stinks," the president told CNBC's "Squawk Box." The comments come after relations between Moscow and Washington, which remained cordial at the start of Trump's second term in office despite the ongoing war, soured in recent weeks. Trump has appeared to lose patience with Putin given Russia's apparent reluctance to pursue a ceasefire or peace deal with Ukraine. Last Monday, the president said he was cutting from 50 days to less than two weeks his deadline for Putin to reach a peace deal with Ukraine or face big "secondary tariffs" on Moscow's trade partners. That prompted former Russian President and high-ranking Russian official Dmitry Medvedev to respond on social media that each new ultimatum that Trump makes about Russia to force an end to its war on Ukraine "is a threat and a step towards war." "Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country," Medvedev wrote on X. Trump said on Friday said that he had ordered two nuclear submarines "to be positioned in the appropriate regions" in response to Medvedev's comments. Russia, one of the world's top oil exporters, has used revenues from oil exports to largely fund its war machine in Ukraine, which it invaded in 2022. This has infuriated Trump and he has, in the last few days, threatened India with steep tariffs if it does not stop buying Russian oil. The president threatened a 25% duty on Indian exports, as well as an unspecified "penalty" last week, accusing New Delhi of buying discounted Russian oil and "selling it on the Open Market for big profits." "India has not been a good trading partner ... so we settled on 25%, but I think I'm going to raise that very substantially over the next 24 hours, because they're buying Russian oil, they're fueling the war machine, and if they're going to do that, I'm not going to be happy," Trump said. Russia earlier on Tuesday weighed into the spat, with the Kremlin saying India was free to choose its own trading partners and that Trump's tariff threats were "attempts to force countries to stop trade relations with Russia." "We do not consider such statements to be legitimate," Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov continued, speaking to reporters Tuesday. "We believe that sovereign countries should have, and have the right to choose their own trade partners, partners in trade and economic cooperation. And to choose those trade and economic cooperation regimes that are in the interests of a particular country." Oil prices declined to around the mid-$65 a barrel mark on Tuesday as traders assessed the announcement by OPEC and its oil-producing allies on Sunday that they would hike output, amid potential weaker global demand. After Trump's comments on Tuesday, Brent crude futures were down 83 cents, or 1.2%, to $67.92 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude slipped 87 cents to $65.41. Russia's finance ministry said in April that it expects 24% lower revenues from oil and gas this year, compared to earlier estimates, and lowered its oil price forecast from $69.7 to $56 per barrel.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said Tuesday that the two largest American banks previously rejected him as a customer, reviving claims that conservative clients were being unfairly denied accounts. Trump told CNBC's "Squawk Box" in a wide-ranging interview that JPMorgan Chase informed him he had 20 days to move "hundreds of millions of dollars in cash" to another bank. The president said he then approached Bank of America to "deposit a billion dollars-plus" and was told the bank couldn't provide him an account, Trump said. I ended up going to small banks all over the place. Shares of the two banks dipped more than 1% in afternoon trading. Some conservatives, crypto executives and religious organizations have claimed to be unfairly "de-banked" by large U.S. financial institutions. Banks generally deny rejecting clientele based on political or religious beliefs, but say they are required to comply with federal laws aimed at preventing financial crimes, including the 1970 Bank Secrecy Act, and have faced regulatory pressure related to crypto and other industries that are considered higher risk for money laundering or fraud. The topic came up again in January, when Trump accused Moynihan of denying services to conservative customers. At the same time, banks have been a major beneficiary of the Trump administration's efforts to roll back Biden-era regulatory rules across a wide swath of financial activities. The Trump administration is preparing an executive order that threatens the industry with fines if they drop customers on political grounds, The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. A draft version of the order asks regulators to investigate whether banks violated laws, according to the Journal. A trade group for big banks said that "regulatory overreach" was the root cause of the de-banking problem. "Banking agencies have already taken steps to address issues like reputational risk, and we're hopeful that any forthcoming executive order will reinforce this progress by directing regulators to confront the flawed regulatory framework that gave rise to these concerns," the Bank Policy Institute told CNBC. While Trump on Tuesday mentioned his business, likely referring to his real estate and hospitality conglomerate, it wasn't clear if the events he described were in reference to personal or business accounts, or both. Trump said that he believes banks rejected him and his supporters because regulators during the Biden administration applied pressure to the companies. JPMorgan denied targeting conservatives or Trump supporters for de-banking. "We don't close accounts for political reasons, and we agree with President Trump that regulatory change is desperately needed," a JPMorgan spokeswoman said Tuesday. "We commend the White House for addressing this issue and look forward to working with them to get this right." In a broadcast interview later Tuesday, Moynihan told CNBC that Trump was "after the right thing" in terms of criticizing an industry that is beholden to a web of regulations. "We bank everybody, but the reality is, we want to make sure that the rules and regulations don't cause decisions we make that then are looked at in the aftermath" and questioned, Moynihan said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump told CNBC on Tuesday that he has narrowed the field of potential future Federal Reserve chairs to four candidates, a list that does not include Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. While the president did not disclose who is in contention, he revealed that Bessent, previously considered a leading candidate, has taken himself out of contention. "Well, I love Scott, but he wants to stay where he is," Trump said during a "Squawk Box" interview. "I asked him just last night, 'Is this something you want?' He actually said, 'I want to work with you.' The news follows Fed Governor Adriana Kugler's surprise announcement Friday that she is resigning effective this Friday. The move allows Trump to install another of his appointees to the Fed Board of Governors at a time when the White House is aggressively pushing the central bank to lower interest rates. Among the likely candidates remaining are former Governor Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett, the National Economic Council director and a key Trump advisor. Fed Governor Christopher Waller also is thought to be in the running. "Both Kevins are very good, and there are other people that are very good, too," Trump said, adding that Kugler's resignation "was a pleasant surprise." Current Chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May 2026. He has been a frequent target of Trump's criticism, and there has been speculation that the president would name a "shadow chair" who could help undermine Powell until his term expires. Trump did not commit to taking that approach but conceded that it is "a possibility." Trump nominated Powell for the Fed job in 2017, during his first term as president. Trump alleged Tuesday that Powell told him, "Sir, I'll keep interest rates so low. The Fed last week voted to hold its benchmark interest rate steady in a range between 4.25%-4.5%. Markets expect the Fed to approve its next cut in September. The central bank lowered its policy rate a full percentage point from September through December 2024, moves that Trump has said were politically motivated to help Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Nikesh Arora was named CEO of Palo Alto Networks in June 2018, the cybersecurity company was valued at about $19 billion and was taking on large networking vendors like Cisco and Juniper, which were building security into their products. Seven years later, Palo Alto's market cap has expanded by sixfold, driven in part by an acquisition spree that's seen Arora spearhead more than 20 deals in an effort to create a one-stop shop for all things cybersecurity. Arora's ambitions took a dramatic turn last week, when Palo Alto announced by far its biggest bet to date: the $25 billion purchase of Israeli identity security platform CyberArk. Not only does CyberArk represent Palo Alto's heftiest deal in the 20 years since its founding, but it's the second-biggest U.S. tech acquisition announced in 2025, after Alphabet's $32 billion purchase of Wiz, another cloud security company from Israel. Alphabet had become a more notable player in Palo Alto's universe even before the calendar turned. In the company's 2024 annual report published in October, Palo Alto named Alphabet as a competitor for the first time, listing it alongside Cisco and Microsoft as companies "that have acquired, or may acquire, security vendors and have the technical and financial resources to bring competitive solutions to the market." In 2023, Cisco paid $28 billion for Splunk, which focuses on data protection. The era of cybersecurity megadeals coincides with a surge in the number of sophisticated cybercrimes tied to rapid advancements in artificial intelligence. With CyberArk, Palo Alto is making a big splash in the identity management market, taking on the likes of Okta as well as Microsoft and IBM's HashiCorp. It also puts the company into further competition with CrowdStrike, the other pure-play security company that's topped $100 billion in market cap. In an interview with CNBC soon after last week's announcement, Arora said CyberArk fits squarely into his company's focus on AI and, in this case, the complexities that come with granting permissions and access. "Our entire acquisition strategy, our organic product growth strategy, our selling strategy, has always been based on that approach," said Arora, 57, who's seen his personal wealth top $1 billion with the big run-up in the stock. "We look for great products, a team that can execute in the product, and we let them run it," Arora told CNBC. "This is going to be a different challenge, but we've done well 24 times, so I'm pretty confident that our team can handle this." Last month, the company closed its takeover of Seattle-based startup Protect AI for an undisclosed amount. Before joining Palo Alto, Arora spent a decade at Google, including his last three years there as chief business officer. Some analysts called him the "acting CEO," due to his lengthy roster of responsibilities, such as strategic partnerships and navigating the needs of advertisers. In 2014, Arora left Google to join SoftBank as head of its internet and media operations business and vice chairman of the overall company. At SoftBank, Arora had been tapped as the likely successor to visionary founder and CEO Masayoshi Son. But less than two years after taking the job, Arora resigned. Roughly 10 months before leaving SoftBank, Arora said he was buying more than $480 million worth of stock in the Japanese conglomerate, which he said involved taking an "enormous risk" reflecting his confidence "about the future" of the company. While that's all firmly in the past, Arora said that over the years, he's "scavenged" different leadership qualities from each of his mentors, including an appetite for risk from Son. "It's about finding role models for certain behaviors and wanting to understand what makes them really successful," he said. Investors weren't completely sold on Arora when he joined Palo Alto in 2018, said Joseph Gallo, an analyst at Jefferies. He was a skilled and experienced businessman but some worried that he hadn't created a notable product or founded a company like many of his industry peers, said Gallo, who recommends buying Palo Alto shares. Arora made up for it with an ability to spot trends ahead of the curve, Gallo said. In his first few years at the company, Arora made numerous acquisitions for a total of about $3 billion, helping Palo Alto penetrate the cloud security space as more businesses were moving their workloads to Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google's cloud. "Every company wishes they were in Palo Alto shoes, where they could actually offer all these different products," said Andrew Nowinski, an analyst at Wells Fargo who has a buy recommendation on the stock. You're not going to see many vendors like Palo Alto." With its expansion into identity management, Palo Alto is going big in a space that's viewed by experts as a key spending area for IT in the coming years. According to a joint report from IBM and Palo Alto published in January, the average organization uses 83 different security products from 29 separate companies. "You can't really be just a one-product company." It's the first time at Palo Alto that Arora has led a multibillion-dollar purchase, and he now faces the execution challenges of integrating thousands of new employees. Analysts at KeyBanc lowered their rating to the equivalent of hold from buy, due partly to concerns about a lack of "meaningful synergies" in the product offerings and a view that customers would prefer an "independent vendor solely focused on identity." But TD Cowen's Shaul Eyal still recommends buying the shares. He said that what's made Arora successful is his "relentless focus on execution" and his strategy of betting on sizeable markets where Palo Alto can quickly scale and become the leader or runner-up.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"It is true that AI is starting to show up more clearly in the data," wrote Jan Hatzius, Goldman Sachs' chief economist, in a Monday note. Goldman's analysis shows that the tech sector's share of the US employment market peaked in November 2022 â€” when ChatGPT was launched â€” and has since fallen below its long-term trend. The impact has been especially sharp for young tech workers. "While this is still a small share of the overall US labor market, we estimate that generative AI will eventually displace 6-7% of all US workers," Hatzius wrote. Goldman expects that shift to happen over the next decade. The firm forecasts that the peak unemployment impact will be limited to a "manageable" 0.5 percentage point, as other industries absorb many displaced workers. The report comes amid growing concerns about US labor market weakness. Job growth for May and June was also revised sharply lower. "Friday's jobs numbers reinforced our view that US growth is near stall speed â€” a pace below which the labor market weakens in a self-reinforcing fashion," wrote Hatzius. Despite AI's impact, Hatzius pointed to a bigger near-term problem: a slowdown in US output growth, which he attributes in part to higher tariffs. Analysts wrote that they expect a "similarly sluggish pace" in the second half. "While the easing in financial conditions and the pickup in business confidence should support growth, real disposable income and consumer spending are likely to grow very slowly, not just because of the weakness in job growth but also because most of the pass-through from tariffs to consumer prices is still ahead of us," Hatzius wrote.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Palantir exec had some strong words for Large Language Models. "LLMs, on their own, are at best a jagged intelligence divorced from even basic understanding," Ryan Taylor, the company's chief revenue officer and chief legal officer, told shareholders on the earnings call. "By contrast, our ontology is pure understanding concretized in software. This is reality, not rhetoric," Taylor added, referring to a company approach to AI that is based on using logic and data to recreate a digital model of how an organization works. These comments came after the company smashed analyst expectations and nearly doubled its commercial revenue in the US since last year's second quarter to $628 million, mostly thanks to a 10-year, $10 billion consolidated contract with the US Army. Company executives also outlined how it plans to win the AI race and what kind of talent would thrive at Palantir. Shyam Sankar, chief technology officer, told investors that the Trump administration's new AI Action Plan, which promotes the deregulation of AI, has taken "all the brakes off" and that industry customers are "really excited to get to work." "If you are a highly talented person and would believe that the West is superior or at least tolerant of me telling you it every day, you'll not find a place anywhere I've seen â€” and now over 20 years I've interacted with almost every agency in the West, many of the largest companies, many of the smaller companies â€” that is comparable on time of joining to full agency like Palantir," Karp said toward the end of the call. "If you come to Palantir, your career is set," he added. Palantir did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.</p>
