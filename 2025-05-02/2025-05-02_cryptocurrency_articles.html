According to Milk Road (@MilkRoadDaily), most crypto tokens on the market lack strong fundamentals, with the majority being created faster than new investors are entering the space. The analysis stresses that ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) are not equivalent to IPOs and warns traders that the vast majority—about 99.9%—of newly launched tokens are likely to fail due to weak project foundations and oversupply. For effective trading, Milk Road recommends filtering tokens by assessing utility, team credibility, and actual user adoption before making investment decisions (source: Milk Road, May 2, 2025).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Riot Platforms Posts Mixed Q1 Results as Effects of Bitcoin 'Halving' Linger Riot Platforms posted mixed earnings results for the first quarter as it took steps to mitigate the effects of mining industry headwinds on its business. That's roughly 2% above Wall Street's expectations of $160.72 million. “We achieved a new record for quarterly revenue…driven by the significant work our teams have put in during the preceding years,” Riot CEO Jason Les said, adding that his company had recently boosted its mining capabilities and operational efficiency. Bitcoin was recently trading at $97,222, up 65% in the past year, CoinGecko data shows. Riot's mixed first-quarter results came as the miner has taken steps to push through the negative effects of "the halving” on its mining business. In April 2024, the Bitcoin blockchain cut in half the amount of BTC rewarded to miners who secure its network, increasing the difficulty and cost of Bitcoin mining. However, Riot has continued to build out its Corsicana Facility to meet the rising skill and capital demands of mining on the Bitcoin blockchain. As a result, Riot notched $142.9 million in token mining revenue in the first quarter, compared to $71.4 million during the same time last year. Riot's performance last quarter also came amid a lawsuit brought against the firm by its bankrupt competitor Rhodium—a court battle that cost the miner more than $8 million in litigation costs in the first quarter. However, Riot acquired several assets belonging to Rhodium last month—a strategic move that effectively ends litigation between the firms and will save Riot money moving forward, according to Les.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the last five months, Ethereum has gone from $4,000 to less than $2,000, printing consistent red monthly closes during this period. Now with five consecutive negative monthly closes, we take a look at where the ETH price could be headed next. In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), crypto analyst CryptoBullet pointed out that the Ethereum price had closed its fifth consecutive month in the red. This development has set Ethereum back years, with its price crashing to levels not seen since 2023. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Completes Bullish Rounded Bottom, Moves Into Range For This Breakout However, it may seem that this is not entirely bad news for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and could end up being the start of a bullish impulse. This is due to the formation of a giant Hammer/Dragonfly doji candle that CryptoBullet points out happened as the price swept 2023 lows when it fell toward $1,400 earlier in the month. Naturally, this formation is bullish for the cryptocurrency as it could mean that Ethereum has finally found a bottom from here. Looking back at Ethereum's history, there has been only one time in the past, where the optics have been this bad for Ethereum, and it was seven years ago. In the end, it would take almost a year for the altcoin to gather enough momentum for it to get bullish again and start a sustained recovery. A popular saying in the crypto market is that “history doesn't repeat, but it often rhymes”. If this is true and plays out in this scenario, that means Ethereum may not follow the bearish continuation to a tee, but it could mean that the pain is far from over for investors. In such a case, the ETH price could be looking toward the end of 2025 for a sustained recovery. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stablecoin market capitalization reached an all-time high in April amid strong performance across cryptocurrency sectors, CoinDesk Data said in a report released Friday (May 2). The market cap of non-USD fiat stablecoins leaped 30% in April to reach $533 million. “In addition, gold-backed stablecoins have also gained traction as investors seek alternative stores of value, buoyed by the precious metal reaching new all-time highs in April.” In addition, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins of 2025 (GENIUS) Act has emerged as a beacon of hope for crypto firms seeking clarity. “There's certainly a change in how the administration views the digital assets industry,” Dan Boyle, partner at Boies Schiller Flexner told PYMNTS in an interview posted April 23. Regulatory maturation, the real-world quest for stablecoin utility, and the institutionalization of digital assets mark a turning point in which the Wild West days of crypto are being replaced by a convergence with mainstream finance, PYMNTS reported April 23.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin looks ready to take a fresh shot at the $100,000 level, but will bears sell into the key price level once it's hit? Will bears sell at this level? Altcoins are trading above their respective support levels, suggesting that an altcoin rally is brewing. Bitcoin's (BTC) tight consolidation resolved in favor of the bulls with a break above the $95,000 barrier on May 1. Veteran trader Peter Brandt sounded positive when he said in a post on X that Bitcoin could rally to the $125,000 to $150,000 range by August or September 2025 if it manages to regain its broken parabolic slope. However, Brandt cautioned that the rally could be followed by a sharp correction of more than 50%. As Bitcoin nears the 100,000 mark, onchain analytics firm Glassnode cautions that the long-term holders (LTHs) may be tempted to book profits. The firm said in its newsletter that the LTHs tend to book profits when their profit margin reaches 350%, and that level will be hit at $99,900. A significant amount of buy-side pressure is needed to overcome the selling to continue the up move. Could Bitcoin break above $100,000, pulling select altcoins higher? Bitcoin's break above $95,000 signals an advantage to buyers, but the bears are unlikely to give up easily. Sellers will try to pull the price back below $95,000, trapping the aggressive bulls. If they can pull it off, the BTC/USDT pair could test the 20-day exponential moving average ($91,391). This is a necessary support to watch out for as a solid bounce off the 20-day EMA suggests the bullish sentiment remains intact. That increases the likelihood of a break above $100,000. The pair may then reach $107,000. This optimistic view will be invalidated in the short term if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA. Buyers successfully defended Ether's (ETH) drop to the 20-day EMA ($1,757) on April 30, signaling demand at lower levels. This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and plunges below the moving averages. That could pull the pair down to $1,537, which is expected to attract buyers. Buyers will seize control on a break and close above the resistance line. That clears the path for a rally to $3. This is a critical level to keep an eye on because a break below $2 could pull the pair to $1.61. Buyers are expected to vigorously defend the $566 level because a break below it may sink the pair to $520. The bulls will have to push the price above $620 to signal strength. The pair could then rise to $644, which is likely to act as a strong resistance. If buyers bulldoze their way through, the pair could surge to $680. Solana (SOL) continues to face selling at the $153 level, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not ceded much ground to the bears. If buyers push and maintain the price above $153, the SOL/USDT pair could rally to $180. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down sharply and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests profit booking by the short-term bulls. If buyers pierce the $0.21 level, the DOGE/USDT pair will complete a double-bottom pattern. That could start a move to $0.25 and then to the pattern target of $0.28. Buyers are expected to defend the $0.14 level with all their might because a break below it may sink the pair to $0.10. Buyers bought the dip to the moving averages in Cardano (ADA), but the failure to build upon the rebound suggests a lack of demand at higher levels. If they do that, the ADA/USDT pair could rally to $0.83. The pair could slide to $0.58, where the buyers are expected to step in. XRP's strongest spot premium aligns with 70% rally setup Chainlink (LINK) turned up from the moving averages on May 1, indicating that the sentiment remains positive. Sellers are expected to fiercely defend the resistance line because a break and close above it signals a potential trend change. If the price turns down from the overhead resistance and breaks below the moving averages, it suggests selling on rallies. The LINK/USDT pair may drop to $11.68, extending its stay inside the channel for some more time. Avalanche (AVAX) bounced off the 20-day EMA ($20.89) on May 1, indicating that the bulls are buying on dips. If they manage to do that, the AVAX/USDT pair will complete a double-bottom pattern. That may start an up move to $28.78 and later to the pattern target of $31.73. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While it remains the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, its lead is rapidly eroding as ‘Layer One' competitors like Solana and Cardano gain ground. Two Prime, an SEC-registered investment advisor, recently announced it was abandoning Ether entirely in favor of a Bitcoin-only strategy. Two Prime, known for its curated Bitcoin derivatives strategies and transparent investment approach, cited Ethereum's declining reliability and increased volatility as key reasons for the move. CEO of Two Prime, Alexander Blume, argued that ETH now trades more like a meme coin than a foundational asset, showing erratic behavior that has decoupled it from Bitcoin. "ETH's statistical trading behavior, value proposition, and community culture have failed beyond a point that is worth engaging," the firm stated. ETH is down 45% year-to-date, and its ETF demand has lagged behind Bitcoin's by a factor of 24, further signaling a waning institutional appetite. Although still far behind, Solana now outpaces ETH in daily active users, transactions, and wallet growth. Solana's technical edge makes it the increasingly preferred platform for real-time decentralized applications. They're also focusing on bringing developers into the conversation earlier to help shape practical solutions. A pricing model, developed by Bitcoin Custody Company 21st Capital, suggests that Bitcoin's price increases roughly sixfold for every 40% increase in network age. Bitcoin's appeal continues to grow, fueled by rising institutional adoption and strong backing from financial leaders like BlackRock's Larry Fink and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, the former CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald. Blume said himself, “Bitcoin stands alone in its use case. Stacy Herbert, director of El Salvador's Bitcoin Office, said many are “wasting time building on Ethereum and its Layer 2 tokens, while investors simply aren't buying in.” Bitcoin is emerging as the clear institutional favorite, while Ethereum struggles to redefine its role amid fierce competition and internal reform. As rivals like Solana close the gap and macroeconomic forces reward predictability over experimentation, Ethereum's dominance is no longer assured, and its future is increasingly in question.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In this overview, we'll examine why these tokens are the top altcoins to buy and potentially your best bet. The top altcoins to buy are those with proven backing, real utility, a growing DeFi ecosystem, and explosive potential—and RCOF checks every single box. RCO Finance's rise centers on its intelligent robo-advisor—an advanced digital assistant that collaborates with users. This sophisticated AI analyzes market data, filters opportunities, and offers real-time, customized trade suggestions on the DeFi platform. This would have saved you time by steering clear of unprofitable ventures. What makes this decentralized platform unique is its focus on user success. On May 7, 2025, RCO Finance will introduce CRM Sync and User Behavior Tracking, improving onboarding and engagement tools for a personalized trading experience. Starting May 24, RCO Finance will also enable crypto-funded demo trading, allowing users to trade without sharing bank details or waiting for approvals. Simply fund a demo account with crypto, instantly converted to USDT. This secure process, backed by SolidProof's smart contract auditing, boosts transparency and investor trust. XRP has risen 9% this week, hitting a new monthly high of $2.35, driven by strong buying interest in a Reverse Head and Shoulders pattern. Experts are evaluating its potential as one of the top altcoins to buy, as it still aims to reach the recent peak of $3.18 from 90 days ago. Cardano (ADA) has demonstrated notable strength in recent trading sessions, making it one of the top altcoins to buy. Technical analysis indicates that ADA is testing a significant resistance zone between $0.70 and $0.75. While XRP and ADA are among the top altcoins to buy in May, RCOF is stealing the spotlight, having successfully raised over $17 million in its ongoing token presale. Currently priced at $0.13, market experts believe RCOF has even greater potential ahead. Forecasts suggest that RCOF could surge by over 900% during the remaining presale stages, potentially reaching $0.60 at its launch. In addition to its potential as one of the top altcoins to buy in the market, investors will benefit from discounts on transaction fees, making trading more cost-effective. or more information about the RCO Finance (RCOF) Presale:</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the Dubai Token2049 conference concludes, one key takeaway is that the narrative around bitcoin (BTC) is swiftly expanding beyond its traditional role as a store of value to a potential DeFi asset competing with Ethereum and Solana. "I don't think focusing on Bitcoin DeFi will dilute or complicate Bitcoin's core narrative," Kevin Farrelly, managing principal of blockchain venture capital at Franklin Templeton and VP of Digital Assets, explained during his keynote speech at the Bitlayer side event this week. "Instead, it expands Bitcoin's utility for a specific type of investor — one with enough technical sophistication to optimize for yield, security, or custom portfolio needs." "These users aren't replacing the 'store of value' thesis; they're building on it," Farrelly added. Franklin Templeton is an investor in Bitlayer, a BitVM that serves as Bitcoin's computational layer while preserving the mainnet's security. It offers features such as faster transaction processing, lower fees, and new functionalities like smart contracts or advanced DeFi integrations, areas that base-layer Bitcoin alone doesn't natively support. Franklin Templeton's bitcoin ETF (EZBC) has registered net inflows of $260 million since its debut on Jan. 11 last year. Satoshi Nakamoto's original vision for the Bitcoin blockchain was driven by creating a decentralized financial system that promotes financial sovereignty and privacy, eliminating the need for transaction intermediaries. It's the most liquid cryptocurrency, averaging several billion dollars in daily trading volumes worldwide, and several publicly listed companies have adopted it as a reserve asset. Meanwhile, ether ETFs have seen net inflows of just under $3 billion. These platforms support a wider array of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and use cases, helping their native token holders earn additional yields on top of their spot market holdings. "At its core, it's seen as a digital store of value," Farrelly told CoinDesk. "Unlike more complex crypto projects, Bitcoin doesn't require deep technical explanation — it has a clear, focused purpose. As a result, many purists resist the idea of introducing features similar to DeFi directly on the Bitcoin blockchain, fearing it could dilute its core appeal. “At Bitlayer we are building important infrastructures which can empower the Bitcoin DeFi with our BitVM technologies," Hu added. "A lot of interesting Bitcoin DeFi use cases can make bitcoin assets more valuable, give users more reason to hold and use in the future” This BTC DeFi trend could also benefit miners, who are rewarded for mining blocks. While the per-block reward is halved every four years, increased on-chain activity driven by DeFi applications could help offset this reduction through higher transaction fees, supporting the network's security and sustainability. "Importantly, Bitcoin DeFi also introduces new transaction fees — a critical component for the network's long-term sustainability and security as block rewards continue to decline," Farrelly said. Hu voiced a similar opinion, saying the rising network hashrate means miners need more activities, like Bitcoin DeFi, to remain profitable.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Surinamese political candidate has projected an image of herself as a successful businesswoman running as a pro-Bitcoin presidential candidate to the international Bitcoin community, but those who've interacted with her on the ground — or those who've obtained reported government intel on her — tell a different story. Last year, Maya Parbhoe quickly became well-known in the international Bitcoin community as she presented herself to the world as a presidential candidate in her country, Suriname. Prominent members of the Bitcoin community such as Bitcoin mining analyst and leadership coach Daniel Batten have vouched for Parbhoe in recent months, while Jan3 CEO Samson Mow was the one who encouraged Parbhoe to run for president. The reports claim that Parbhoe has overstated her odds of becoming president of Suriname to the international community and that her political messaging within the country has had little to nothing to do with Bitcoin. What is more, some reports that are now reaching the international Bitcoin audience also contend that Parbhoe's candidacy is not well known within Suriname. And while Parbhoe has positioned herself as an advocate for those within her country who are struggling financially, one source told Bitcoin Magazine that she has disdain for the country's poor. According to Bitcoin Magazine's source, the same reported intel states Parbhoe's father was knowingly in business with drug traffickers and money launderers and that there's also a chance that the bank accounts for Parbhoe's companies are being used to launder money. Some of the highest-ranking individuals in the country have also been involved in corruption, as the country's current vice president has been convicted of drug trafficking and the country's former president, Dési Bouterse, was convicted of drug trafficking and murder and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Parbhoe billed herself as an anti-corruption presidential candidate in Suriname's upcoming elections, which are slated to occur on May 25, 2025. As part of her messaging, she often mentions how her father was murdered for speaking out against corruption in the country, and she says that she wants to carry on his legacy by speaking out against corruption in Suriname, as well. The part of this story that Parbhoe has left out as she's recounted it time and time again, though, is that her father had two Colombian partners in his casino business who he knew were also involved in drug trafficking and money laundering. According to a former senior advisor for Parbhoe's campaign, Shamay, Parbhoe is aware that her father knew he was in business with these people, as she has told him as much. Micah Dunford, a retired Green Beret and CEO of Greyscale Protection, a company that Parbhoe contracted to protect her during the beginning of April, when she gave birth to her daughter, informed Bitcoin Magazine that reported intel from the U.S. government states that Parbhoe's father was knowingly involved with “nefarious actors” and was murdered by “narco terrorists.” [Author's note: Dunford would like to make it clear that he only shared the information above as well as other information in this piece about a client of his because he is a Bitcoin enthusiast and feels that Parbhoe is doing a great disservice to the Bitcoin community and to Bitcoin's reputation.] When I initially interviewed Parbhoe in July 2024, she offered an account of her father's business dealings that did not include his knowingly being in business with drug traffickers and money launderers. “My father was in business with Dorsett Resorts,” Parbhoe told Bitcoin Magazine via email. My father went to the then Minister of Justice, Santhokhi, and all authorities, including the three letter agencies, when he realized what was going on,” she added. I am his only living heir fighting this case.” If Parbhoe's father was knowingly in business with drug traffickers and if Parbhoe knew that he knew this and continues to omit it from the story of her father's murder that she tells the media, what she's doing is part of a broader trend when it comes to some of the stories she tells — including the one about her becoming president of Suriname. Although it was technically possible for a candidate lower on the list to be elected into parliament directly if enough people vote on this candidate specifically (rather than the party leader), this rarely happened. Under the new system, each voter votes for one member of parliament, and each party has 51 candidates for the 51 seats of parliament. So, if a political party gets (say) five seats in parliament, those five seats will go to the five candidates of that party with the most individual votes; their ranking on the party's candidate list is irrelevant. Parliament then votes based on that list of candidates, and a two-thirds majority vote determines who wins the presidency. (This seems logical in that 283,834 people voted in Suriname's 2020 election, and if each of the 51 candidates elected to parliament received 5,380 votes, this would mean that 274,380 people voted, which is very close to the voter turnout from the previous election. A poll conducted on April 21, 2025 shows that NPS may win 10 seats in parliament (7 more than they currently have), but the poll doesn't indicate which of NPS's candidates are most popular. However, this doesn't matter much to Parbhoe anyway because winning a seat in parliament is what she calls a “worst case scenario.” In a Reddit post on April 13, Michel Greijmans, a businessman based in Curaçao who visited Suriname for work in February, commented that Parbhoe has less of a chance of winning the presidency because she is ranked number 21 within the NPS. What Greijmans didn't acknowledge, though — probably because he was not privy to this information — is that Parbhoe, by her own account, strategically selected this ranking of number 21 as an ode to Bitcoin, because rank within a party is mostly irrelevant now anyway. Parbhoe first informed me of her doing this via text weeks back when her rank within the party was first announced, and she reiterated this to me in our most recent communications. (This type of candidate is sometimes referred to as a Lijstduwer, which translates to “list pusher,” and it exists in the Surinamese and Dutch parliamentary systems. List pushers often include celebrities, artists, or athletes who have no intention of serving in parliament.) This type of candidate is sometimes referred to as a Lijstduwer, which translates to “list pusher,” and it exists in the Surinamese and Dutch parliamentary systems. List pushers often include celebrities, artists, or athletes who have no intention of serving in parliament. (Such a candidate in Suriname's current electoral race is Ingrid Bouterse-Waldring, widow of the late Dési Bouterse, the aforementioned former president of Suriname. Well, she's broadcasted to the international Bitcoin community that she plans to replace Suriname's national currency, which has an average yearly inflation rate of 8.7% and which spiked as high as 59% in 2020, with bitcoin. However, those who've visited Parbhoe in Suriname and who have reported back to the international Bitcoin community have said that Bitcoin is hardly part of her messaging within the country and that her strategy to replace the national currency with bitcoin won't work. Dr. Jack Kruse, who'd met with Parbhoe on the ground in Suriname in February and even gave a nationally-televised talk on reforming Suriname at an NPS event during this visit, claimed on X that Greijmans' experience was comparable to his own. Don't Trust, Verify: Maya Parbhoe, “The Next Bitcoin President of Suriname”… pic.twitter.com/O2nVkPXWWe I followed up with Greijmans to learn more about his experience on the ground. “The fact that the people I spoke to didn't want to talk about her raised concerns for me,” Greijmans told Bitcoin Magazine. Greijmans didn't speak up about his experience immediately after his visit, though, because he felt it was possible that members of the local Bitcoin community were simply trying to distance the community that they were building from her campaign. (Kemal Yaşar, Marketing Director for Blink Wallet, confirmed that the number of transactions by Blink users in Suriname increased 2,389% from July 2024 to March 2025.) Greijmans also noted that as of the second week of April, Parbhoe had revamped her website, removing all claims that she is running for president. He said that one of his motivations in writing the Reddit piece was to let the international community know that Parbhoe seemed to be taking advantage of the fact that it was easy for her to project a certain image to an international audience, as her actions are difficult to audit for those who aren't on the ground in Suriname. Taghizadegan also mentioned that he'd communicated to Parbhoe that her plan to make bitcoin the primary currency in Suriname wasn't realistic, an assessment she wasn't fond of. “Maya disliked my assessment that her proposal to convert the national currency directly into [b]itcoin by governmental decree was unfeasible,” he wrote. Furthermore, Taghizadegan also noted Parbhoe's shortcomings as a businesswoman. “Her business track record revealed deficiencies in judgment and execution, but this was hardly unexpected and quite typical for someone transitioning into politics,” he added. Shamay, who first met Parbhoe at Adopting Bitcoin El Salvador in November 2024 and began communicating with her soon after, visited Parbhoe in Suriname twice, once in January and once in February of this year, also voiced concerns about Parbhoe based on her lack of ability to execute as well as her poor business acumen. While he was with Parbhoe on the ground, Parbhoe tearfully told him that the companies she'd founded — Quickship Logistics, Icarus Geosystems, and Daedalus Labs — weren't profitable, but that she had to keep up the image that they were successful or she wouldn't be respected as a young woman in politics in Suriname. Another source familiar with the matter confirmed that Quickship Logistics is not profitable, and that Parbhoe uses funds from the company to pay for personal expenses. He said that the campaign was being run from her living room couch with a few unpaid team members and that there was “no discussion about bitcoin.” “Parbhoe did not have a Bitcoin platform within Suriname,” said Shamay. One of the members from Greyscale's security team who went to Suriname wasn't as concerned about Parbhoe's lack of focus on bitcoin, which he still noted, as he was with how Parbhoe treated the less fortunate in the country. “If they are poor, you can tell that she does not give a flying shit about them. We would walk through the streets, and if somebody walked past her or walked too close to her, she would act like they were dirty — she did not like these types of people being around her,” he added. (Taghizadegan also commented on Parbhoe's behavior toward others in his X post. He wrote that “She was unkind to many people.”) According to the security team member, she asked him how much money he made, and when he told her, she responded by saying, “I didn't know you're one of the poors.” The security team member also noted that Parbhoe's critique of him seemed ironic since Parbhoe herself didn't seem to have much money (though, he reported that she owns a Mercedes-Benz), and almost every source for this piece said that Parbhoe either owes them money, owes someone that they know money, or owes someone with whom she works money. According to the security team member, she repeatedly asked to either borrow money from him or for him to pay for things like her groceries or dinner at a restaurant because she couldn't afford them. “[My] chances [of winning] decrease if I pay companies like Greyscale 3x for [a] contract and they deplete us out of funds,” wrote Parbhoe, alluding to the notion that Greyscale had overcharged her. “I have projects for the teachers (painting schools, materials for the kids), orphanages (we still deliver food daily and have also planned sports/play days for them) and nurses (they've planned delivery of 70 bags with products new moms need) with deadlines and now less resources to complete,” she added. What is more, early one morning, she made the security team member with whom I spoke move to the floor to sleep. This sort of paranoia and irrational thinking had started weeks earlier, and the broader world started to get a glimpse of it on April 2, 2025. SOS,” which didn't feature any evidence of a threat. Many in the Bitcoin community who are on X became concerned, as there were no reports of her status for the hours that followed. Hours after the original messages, she posted another message on X in which she stated “The US Secret Service is here in Suriname to protect me and to help me uncover corruption.” (This message has since been deleted.) Days later, Parbhoe stated in an X post that it was because she was “under heavy medication and recovering from childbirth” that she inaccurately posted about the Secret Service protecting her. “They” included the hospital staff and her political opposition. Dunford surmised that Parbhoe's emotional state in this situation was a result of a combination of her being both paranoid and irrational in part because she was being “controlled by the opposition.” “They most likely wanted to cut ties because she wasn't endorsed to run a campaign and/or went off the reservation either politically or businesswise with whomever she is in bed with — which is most probably a combo of government [officials] and narcos, which are synonymous in Suriname.” (More on this in the following section.) Around this time, Parbhoe sent repeated erratic messages to the cofounder of Bitcasa Homes, Amanda Dawn. Dawn had been introduced to Parbhoe a year and a half prior, and the two had worked together in a small capacity as their respective companies (Daedalus Labs for Parbhoe) were focused on the intersection of bitcoin and real estate. On March 26, 2025, Parboe had reached out to Dawn, frantically claiming that her life was being threatened. Dawn was rattled by the desperation in Parbhoe's voice. (I can relate to how Dawn likely felt, as I've received my fair share of panicked messages from Parbhoe, especially as her child's due date approached. Dawn, who believed deeply in Parbhoe's alleged pro-Bitcoin mission in Suriname, reached out to a contact at Bitcoin Veterans, stating that she needed to quickly find protection for Parbhoe. In the following days, Dunford sent two of his team members to guard Parbhoe, one a combat medic who is capable of delivering babies, as she gave birth. Parbhoe didn't sign the contract with Greyscale, as she claimed she was being forced to do so under duress, but Dunford sent help regardless. (Parbhoe never did sign the contract, which included a nondisclosure agreement. Kroll also donated 0.5 bitcoin to Parbhoe during the latter part of 2024 and urged others to follow his lead by donating, though, he now regrets doing so. And while Dunford's men were with Parbhoe in the hospital and back at her home, a contact in the U.S. government shared intel on Parbhoe with Dunford. He wanted to believe she was the next Nayib Bukele — another pro-Bitcoin president — but what he learned from the intel changed his views on Parbhoe. “She's linked in with nefarious people,” Dunford told Bitcoin Magazine. As mentioned, controlled opposition refers to a situation where voters feel they have an option in an election, but the option is either owned financially or coerced into complying with the sitting power in some manner. In Parbhoe's case, Dunford believes that both are at play. “This way, they could ensure that even if she got into some sort of power, that they would never be extradited to the EU,” he added. (When I first spoke with Parbhoe in July 2024, she said that the leaders of her country fear extradition, because, if extradited, they would be tried for the international crimes they've allegedly committed.) “She puts on a policy platform that would make the people think, ‘Yeah, we're going to fight the powers — we're going to implement Bitcoin, blah, blah, blah, and that just isn't true because they are pulling her puppet strings.” Dunford also shared that he is a specialist in controlled opposition and information operations (i.e., propaganda campaigns). “So, they sent five really burly dudes to get into the hotel room to fix the batteries and the light or whatever it was, but we assessed that they were making a battery, camera, or microphone adjustment to correct their initial placement.” I was in touch with these two Greyscale team members via text as this situation in the hotel played out, and they seemed genuinely concerned about their safety. With that said, I was not able to find further information to corroborate that Parbhoe is “controlled opposition,” as Dunford put it. According to Dunford, intel derived from an artificial intelligence system built by the U.S. government states that there's a highly credible chance that the bank accounts for Quickship Logistics and Icarus Geosystems are being used to launder funds. A source privy to bank records at Quickship Logistics said he didn't get the sense that this sort of activity was happening through the company's bank accounts, though. If one of Parbhoe's accounts were being used for such activity, it would more likely be the account for Icarus Geosystems, a company that builds infrastructure such as roads in remote regions of the country. Parbhoe is the financial director of this company, and six-figure sums of money frequently flow through a bank account for the company, as per bank records obtained by Bitcoin Magazine. “Though Icarus is a private company, I can share that that's revenue from projects currently in progress at Newmont and housing development and a retaining wall/channel project in Guyana.” In my research, I couldn't find anything to confirm or corroborate the notion that funds are being laundered through Parbhoe's companies' bank accounts, nor that she is involved with money laundering in any other way. A number of sources described Parbhoe as “delusional,” “narcissistic,” and “mentally unstable,” but almost all of them were reluctant to call her a criminal. “She's more delusional than fraudulent,” is how one source put it. In my personal interactions with Parbhoe, I've witnessed her stretch the truth on a number of occasions. An example of this is last year at Bitcoin Amsterdam where I overheard her tell someone that she is an Oxford Alumni, when, in reality, she's only completed a weeks-long certificate program at the university — not a proper degree. (Other donors also donated to her campaign outside of Geyser, but those amounts haven't been made public.) For some time, Parbhoe published a campaign funds tracker, and she seemed to take pride in being transparent about where the funds were going. 🚀For the first time in history, a candidate can share live updates on how campaign funds are being spent. No more static overviews, now you can track the campaign balance and expenses in real time, directly on our website!This is all… pic.twitter.com/5Obp961rc4 She's recently taken down the campaign funds tracker, though. When I asked Parbhoe for an overview of expenses, she provided me with a link to this document (screenshot below), which only has eight line items. Parbhoe provided more information on this in my email communication with her. “He is engaged to be economic advisor once [I'm] elected.” While in Suriname, Parbhoe conducted an on-camera interview with Laffer, which was published via the Bitcoin Magazine YouTube channel. (When Parbhoe reached out to me about publishing the video, which I helped facilitate, she did not mention that Laffer was paid to visit Suriname.) However, there are no reports of him speaking about Bitcoin adoption with those with whom he engaged while on the ground in Suriname, despite the fact that he spoke with NPS about money and government financing. “He gave a presentation for the NPS, which had a great impact on how the party views taxes and monetary incentives,” wrote Parbhoe. Parbhoe also paid Daniel Batten $2,500 in total, though half of that funding came from Daedalus Labs, according to her. Parbhoe wrote that Batten's services were helpful in part because the breathing techniques he taught her helped her to cope with a situation that occurred approximately one week before she gave birth in which she was hospitalized and claims she was taken off of IV and left without water while she needed to be hydrated. Shamay, who claims to have worked for her pro bono, said that she'd agreed to pay her campaign manager $15,000 per month, but her most recent campaign manager quit after only being paid $8,500 after two months. Parbhoe's aforementioned billboard expense cost the campaign $35,000, and she paid Greyscale $27,000 for its services. Parbhoe continues to campaign despite the challenges she's faced as of late. “The thought of losing my daughter, if you had given me 21 million Bitcoin, I would have spent it all to save her life. Parbhoe also stated that whether or not she wins the election, she'll continue to fight for Bitcoin adoption in Suriname past election day. She concluded her final email to me with a quote from Bitcoin's creator, Satoshi Nakamoto: I don't know for sure whether Parbhoe is controlled opposition or if she's just someone struggling to execute a vision. Having been in touch with Parbhoe on a semi-regular basis for the past eight months, I'd imagine, in her mind, her plan looked something like this: But the most maddening part of this whole scenario is that if Dunford is right in that Parbhoe is “controlled opposition” — that her campaign has been little more than a ruse and that she's working with “nefarious actors” behind the scenes — then the majority of this piece was written for naught and Parbhoe should simply be classified as the first major scammer of this cycle. If this is the case, please accept my apology for helping to platform Parbhoe via Bitcoin Magazine. And whether this is the case or not, this situation has been a strong reminder of the popular Bitcoin-related adage: Don't trust, verify. Some of us — myself included — should not so readily believe that certain characters in this space, especially political figures, are everything they purport to be.</p>

Borrowing to fund investments, when asset values could change dramatically, meant consumers risked losing their entire investment and potentially other assets, such as their home. These characteristics closely resembled gambling, the Treasury committee found. The proposed ban is expected to face resistance from some fintech firms. Dismissing concerns that private companies such as Meta, Google and Apple might control digital currencies in the future, he told a Senate finance committee hearing in January: “I see no reason for the US to have a central bank digital currency.” In 2023, MPs on an all-party parliamentary committee urged ministers to treat retail investment in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin as a form of gambling. As part of her growth strategy, Reeves has called for an easing of regulations in some areas, an approach backed by the FCA chief executive, Nikhil Rathi, who has suggested that rules in the Square Mile could be simplified to spur innovation.

However, caution is still warranted even on a breakout, as ETH remains about 8% below the next significant upside level at $1,956 — the April high. A clean reclaim of $1,956 could open the door to higher prices, but without strong follow-through, there's a risk of false breakouts. Traders should be patient and wait for confirmation rather than getting caught chasing price within a still-choppy environment. $2,140: Important daily level where ETH tried to form a base before breaking down; also aligns with the March 24-25 swing high. $2,520 – $2,700: Major high-timeframe zone formed after the March 2 crypto reserve announcement. If Ethereum can clear $1,956, the next major level to watch would be $2,140. This area is important because on the daily chart, ETH previously tried to build a base here before breaking down, and it matches up with the March 24-25 swing high, making it a strong technical zone. Get up to $400 in rewards for successfully completing short educational courses and making your first qualifying trade on Coinbase. Beyond $2,140, bulls will have their eyes on the $2,520 to $2,700 range. It represents a previous swing high where heavy profit-taking took place. Until then, Ethereum remains trapped in its six-day consolidation. Tight price action like this often precedes a larger breakout move, and with broader volatility metrics like the VIX continuing to decline, the next expansion could happen quickly and catch a lot of market participants off-guard. For now, the playbook is simple: stay patient while ETH is inside the range, monitor the key levels mentioned above, and be ready for volatility to return once this compression phase resolves.

Further evidence emerged early Friday with news that the money-transfer platform MoneyGram International Inc. has launched MoneyGram Ramps, an application programming interface aimed at easing crypto-based transfers. Dallas-based MoneyGram, which bills its latest API as “the most powerful yet,” says it will enable digital wallets, fintechs, and exchanges to “instantly” reach MoneyGram's global cash network with a few lines of code. That feature leads the money-transfer service to boast that it is becoming “the connective tissue” for access by digital currency to legacy money networks. “For years, developers have been searching for an easy way to bridge physical and digital currency,” Luke Tuttle, MoneyGram's chief technology officer, says in a statement. MoneyGram promises smooth integrations, cutting deployment time, it says, to minutes from what might have taken days. Onboarding can be done at a MoneyGram Web site, and banking integrations are not required, the network says. El Salvador-based Bitget Wallet's Paydify integration, meanwhile, will smooth merchant acceptance, the company says, leading to routine, everyday use of digital currency. The alliance with Paydify rests on what the company says is its ability to facilitate transactions for merchants from “any wallet without the need for custom integration.” Bitget cites an Onchain Report indicating “limited merchant acceptance” stands as “a key barrier to using crypto for payments.” Dallas-based MoneyGram, which bills its latest API as “the most powerful yet,” says it will enable digital wallets, fintechs, and exchanges to “instantly” reach MoneyGram's global cash network with a few lines of code.

Aptos APT/USD is expanding its scope beyond traditional crypto verticals like DeFi and NFTs, with a growing focus on real-world consumer applications, particularly in payments, HR systems and micro-credit. That's according to Ash Pampati, Head of Ecosystem at the Aptos Foundation, who spoke in an interview with Benzinga about where the Layer 1 network is aiming to differentiate itself. "We feel there are two evergreen areas that will last forever: trading and payments," Pampati said. While trading spans both crypto-native and traditional assets, Pampati emphasized the potential of blockchain to fundamentally reshape how money moves and how services are built for consumers around the world. "You can open up micro-streaming payments, remittance, cross-border transfers," he said. "We're already seeing founders build native HR payroll software fully on-chain or extend credit networks to emerging markets." In addition to payments and credit, Aptos is increasingly focused on decentralized infrastructure, particularly where it can solve longstanding Web2 data bottlenecks. Pampati said one of the biggest barriers to blockchain adoption in areas like social media and content streaming is the lack of usable, composable data. "We're working on how to unlock that data so big networks or dApps can actually be fully powered on-chain." This product-oriented vision comes as Aptos pushes to carve out competitive territory in a landscape increasingly dominated by Ethereum L2s, modular blockchains and fast-rising alternatives like Solana. Also Read: UAE Sets Global Benchmark For Crypto-Banking Integration, Amina Bank's Rohan Misra Says Pampati noted that Aptos currently ranks among the top four chains by RWA total value locked (TVL), even ahead of Solana in that category. "What we're really focused on is the utilization of those assets in native Web3 use cases," he said, adding that Aptos plans to onboard Aave, one of the largest DeFi money markets, in the coming months, its first expansion beyond EVM chains. While many blockchains position themselves as general-purpose networks, Aptos is explicitly focused on long-term adoption scenarios where billions of users could eventually be onboarded. Our CEO and founding team are obsessed with performance. They built blockchain systems at Meta to support billion-user apps," Pampati said. He added that the network's focus on reliability is critical to standing out. Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is set to shake up the $11 billion crypto wallet industry with a new super app that lets you meet all your blockchain needs from one dashboard. The project is currently undergoing a presale where it has raised $11.9 million so far, reflecting immense appeal among investors. Its early success reflects deep market interest, which, when combined with its innovative use case, is stirring considerable optimism among industry experts. Several top traders have said $BEST will explode when it lists on the open market, with some forecasting that 100x gains could follow the exchange launch. While wallets such as MetaMask and Phantom are tied to a small number of blockchains, Best Wallet supports a staggering 60 different networks. This includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, Cardano, and Sui. What's more, the project also has a built-in cross-chain decentralized exchange. Scams are rife in crypto, especially once you venture outside the garden walls of a centralized exchange. But Best Wallet grants you all the benefits and opportunities of decentralized crypto storage, while providing security measures that exceed those of a top centralized exchange. It's a setup that greatly enhances the user experience while ensuring funds are always safe. For instance, analysts from Cryptonews said the price could rally by 100x after listing on exchanges. Considering its early stage and powerful use case, 100x gains certainly should not be ruled out. There has been a vibe shift in crypto recently, with Bitcoin and altcoin prices rallying again after months of adversity. It offers users two core money-making features capable of delivering substantial returns in bullish periods. The first is Upcoming Tokens, a presale aggregator that allows investors to research, buy, and track all the top crypto presales from one dashboard. This feature has already proven useful, having provided a 10x gain on Pepe Unchained and 50x gain on Catslap during December, which was the last time the market was bullish. Currently, projects like Solaxy, MIND of Pepe, and BTC Bull Token are available to buy. This feature allows users to deposit a range of different cryptocurrencies and generate passive yields. Best Wallet covers all bases ranging from multi-chain support to crypto launches and staking – it's compiling the multi-trillion dollar crypto industry into one smartphone app. Holding the Best Wallet Token unlocks special perks inside the app such as trading fee discounts, higher staking yields, governance rights, and access to promotions on partner projects. Despite being newly launched, Best Wallet already boasts over 250,000 users. But with price increases occurring throughout the ICO, potential investors shouldn't wait to get involved.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Featuring views and opinions written by market professionals, not staff journalists. Bitcoin has officially closed above $95,000, breaking its six-day rejection streak and invalidating the previously anticipated pullback scenario. With price action now clearly above the daily, 4h, and weekly TBO Clouds, this marks a strong bullish shift. With major Fibonacci levels now mapped, the next resistance zones are: $100–$103K, $117–$123K, $138K, and $173K. However, overhead resistance drawn from 2021 still looms around $99,800, reinforcing the importance of this next leg higher. Dominance and market structure show BTC leading the way Stablecoin dominance continues to fall inside the daily TBO Cloud, signaling a shift toward risk-on assets. While current action mirrors the whipsaw behavior of September 2024, this typically leads to broader market rallies. The daily and weekly charts are both bearish, while OTHERS.D has broken prior resistance but now contends with dominance shifting back toward BTC. RSI has broken support, but the OTHERS market cap chart still looks strong with continued OBV growth and a recent TBO Open Long. Total market structure reflects BTC pause, altcoin sentiment remains cautiously bullish TOTAL remains stalled just below $3T, while TOTAL3 (excluding BTC and ETH) has already confirmed a TBO Open Long. OTHERS also closed a TBO Open Long, though 4h signals show potential short-term weakness. Volatility remains low with BVOL7D back in the Bounce Zone. Altcoins begin to diverge with mixed signals across the board SUI and TAO are showing signs of exhaustion, while S, QNT, IMX, and KAIA are seeing renewed interest with TBO Open Longs printing or forming. While BTC shows strong macro signals, short-term volume remains soft. Dominance remains firmly with BTC, causing altcoin momentum to remain inconsistent. As long as BTC stays above key levels and TradFi maintains its risk-on tone, the broader crypto market is likely to continue its bullish expansion into Q2.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Glossy  E-Commerce Summit: Hear from execs at H&M, Warby Parker and Fabletics Glossy  E-Commerce Summit: Hear from execs at H&M, Warby Parker and Fabletics This week, we talk about Prada's positive earnings, including the spectacular growth of Miu Miu and why so many other luxury brands are falling behind. We also talk about Nike being sued in a class action lawsuit over the shutdown of its NFT business, RTFKT — one of a number of lawsuits over the ill-fated technology. Below are some highlights from Manoff's conversation with Hyman, lightly edited for clarity. “We have made in 2025 the biggest investment that we've ever made into our inventory and into our assortment. We know that, for our business, inventory is the key to growth. We spent the last few years bringing our business to a place where we were essentially nearly breakeven on a free cash flow basis, really changing our margin profile, our unit economics, the way we actually acquire inventory and setting up the business for this next phase. So we decided to go for it this year and double the inventory. In doubling the inventory, we've been able to go much deeper into use cases that we might have lacked or not had as much inventory of in the past, because the inventory in the past was more concentrated from March through May or September through November. We are now able to focus on those occasions in deep summer and in deep winter, when folks may be using Rent the Runway for things like having a tennis match with your friends, or going to the beach or going skiing in the winter. “We understand that there are some blockbuster brands on Rent the Runway, where, when a customer receives items from those brands, she actually is more loyal overall. So then we embarked on a customer service transformation within the organization. Customer service has always been one of the things we're known for. We've taken all the manual tasks out of customer service and really outsourced a lot of those tasks and redeployed our own internal team into loyalty-driving behaviors. So, as opposed to our internal team writing you an email back about a shipping label, we're instead having that internal team have the time to call you when you first join and have a welcome call, and teach you all about Rent the Runway, or spend time styling you, or help you create lists, or do those high-value actions that make us a more premium service.” And then, when I sit down with brands, no one knows what's going on right now. People are kind of running around trying to figure it out. I'm actually going next week to L.A. to sit down with 20 of our brand partners there and just going to have open conversations with them on how we should handle this together.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin price broke above its key resistance level of $95,000 on Thursday after consolidating around it for the past five days and reaching a high of $97,400. However, if BTC fails to close above $97,700, it could face a correction toward its next daily support at $95,000. Ethereum price has been consolidating between $1,700 and $1,861 since last week. If ETH breaks and closes above the daily resistance at $1,861, it could extend the rally to retest its psychological importance level at $2,000. Conversely, if ETH declines and closes below $1,700, it could extend the losses to retest its next daily support at $1,449. XRP price retested and found support around its previously broken 50-day EMA level at $2.20 on Wednesday, stabilizing at this level the next day. At the time of writing on Friday, it continues to hold around this level. If the support level at $2.20 holds, XRP will extend the rally to retest its March 24 high of $2.50 before potentially reaching $3.00. Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions. Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

Sam Altman's biometric identity project — World, formerly known as Worldcoin — has officially launched in the United States, bringing with it a blend of sci-fi-like ambition and mounting global concern. The technology verifies individuals by scanning their irises in exchange for a share of cryptocurrency and a digital ID called World ID. The debut event, held Wednesday night in San Francisco, unveiled a new, more compact version of the company's signature imaging device known as the Orb, a silver sphere that captures iris patterns to prove a person is human. Altman, who also leads OpenAI, framed the launch as a critical step toward digital trust in an artificial intelligence-driven future. "As AI advances, it's increasingly important to distinguish between humans and bots online," the company said in a press release, positioning World ID as a "proof-of-human" standard for the internet age. World has already faced legal scrutiny on multiple continents. Authorities in Spain have suspended the project. Argentina has issued fines over its data terms. Kenya opened a criminal investigation before ultimately halting the project. And, in Hong Kong, regulators ordered World to cease operations, citing the collection of biometric data as "excessive and unnecessary." Despite these rebukes, World claims its system is safe. It says the Orb doesn't store actual images of users' eyes, instead generating an encrypted "iris code" that is then tied to a blockchain-based digital identity. "Once you link an unchangeable biometric like your eye to a global ID system, you can't take it back," one cybersecurity expert warned. Under his leadership, OpenAI has driven artificial intelligence into the public mainstream while sparking fears over deepfakes, misinformation and job displacement. Now, with World, he's turning his focus from thinking machines to verifying the humans still using them. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI Inc., center, with boxer Jake Paul and wrestler Logan Paul during the 60th presidential inauguration in Emancipation Hall at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., Jan. 20, 2025. The app has already verified over 11 million people worldwide, and its ambitions are expanding quickly. On Wednesday, the company also announced a partnership with Visa to release the World Card later this year, a crypto-linked debit card that users can spend anywhere Visa is accepted. In Japan, a separate partnership with Match Group's Tinder will allow users to verify their identity via iris scan, aimed at cracking down on romance fraud. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, speaks at the Microsoft Build event in Seattle May 21, 2024. President Donald Trump has called for making the country the "crypto capital of the world," and his administration has reportedly supported initiatives that reduce regulatory barriers to private sector innovation. That supportive environment may explain why Altman chose now to bring World home after a cautious international rollout during the previous administration. As artificial intelligence evolves and biometric systems spread, Americans are being asked to trade something personal — their eyes — for convenience and access.

As it trades just above $96,000, up 2.14% on the day, Bitcoin is getting close to a turning point. It is currently in a technical vacuum following a robust recovery in late April; neither significant resistance nor obvious support is located right above it or below. A significant volatility spike that determines the market's course for weeks or even months frequently precedes this kind of price structure. If momentum returns, Bitcoin has the potential to soar higher because there are not any nearby resistance zones. But the volume remains low, which is a warning sign. In the absence of increased participation, this breakout could turn into a bull trap. A new leg up that might target the psychological $100,000 level and beyond could be started by a clean break above $97,000 with high volume. Alternatively, a collapse below the $93,000-$92,000 range would probably lead to $89,000 or even lower, indicating the end of this rally and possibly igniting a general market correction. Bitcoin is perched on the edge of a tight market. Hold on tight because this level of calm is short-lived. As it tests the upper limit of a descending channel that has characterized its price action since January 2025, XRP is poised for a significant move. With declining volume suggesting that a breakout — or breakdown — is imminent, the chart clearly shows that XRP is compressing toward the tip of a wedge following months of lower highs and lower lows. This confluence serves as a dynamic floor of support. The volume is still low, but given how swiftly XRP moves when sentiment changes, any increase in buying interest around $2.40 could spark a quick rally to the $2.80-$3.00 region. Technically speaking, XRP is acting in a positive way. It made a clean recovery from the April bottom of the wedge and is now marking higher lows, which suggests that buyers are intervening more forcefully. With its strong 3.14% daily gain, Ethereum has pushed to $1,850, igniting cautious optimism about a wider recovery. This rally might not be as strong as it first appears, at least not yet, according to a closer examination of the market environment and chart structure. As of right now, ETH is trading just above its 50-day EMA, which it recently flipped into support. Generally speaking a sustained breakout above this level is a bullish indication, particularly when combined with price consolidation close to the top. These moving averages could confirm a reversal and restore medium-term bullish momentum if they break cleanly. Significant ETH reversals in the past have been marked by spikes in volume and volatility, neither of which is present at the moment. The RSI, which is at 59, indicates that ETH has some leeway before hitting overbought levels, but it might not mean much if volume does not increase. Although it is speculative at best without confirmation, this could be seen as quiet accumulation. Keep a close eye on the $2,150 zone; it will determine ETH's short-term destiny.
