                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A ship carrying humanitarian aid bound for Gaza was bombed just off the coast of Malta on Friday, with activists saying that Israel bears responsibility for the attack on the vessel aiming to break Israel's two month-long total aid blockade on the Gaza Strip. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, an activist group formed in 2010 aiming to break Israel's decades-long blockade of Gaza, announced that its ship came under attack in international waters shortly after midnight in Maltese time on Friday. According to officials, there were 12 crew members and four civilians on board, and the crew confirmed that the fire had been put out. Freedom Flotilla Coalition did not directly blame Israeli authorities for the strike in a statement on the attack, but said that “Israeli ambassadors must be summoned and answer to violations of international law, including the ongoing blockade and the bombing of our civilian vessel in international waters.” Others in the group have pointed out that Israel has attacked activists involved in the Freedom Flotilla movement numerous times in the past, and most recently tried to obstruct a Freedom Flotilla mission last year as it tried to provide aid amid Israel's genocide. In 2010, the Israeli military sieged and boarded a flotilla crewed by activists trying to deliver 10,000 tons of aid to Gaza. “This attack fits a well-documented pattern: the use of force to block aid ships headed to Gaza — long before they reach its shores. This isn't the first time,” Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor said on social media. Friday's attack comes as major aid groups warn that the entire humanitarian aid operation in Gaza is on the verge of total collapse because of Israel's total aid blockade that has gone on for seven weeks now. Human rights experts and advocates for Palestinian rights have called for an investigation into the attack, condemning it as a war crime. “Today's attack proves that Israel sees every attempt to save Palestinian life from total annihilation as an existential threat to its genocidal project — and [will] wage war against the whole world to preserve it.” We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency. Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.” Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Democrats have urged the IRS internal watchdog to probe whether Trump targeting Harvard's tax-exempt status is illegal. On Friday, President Donald Trump announced that he intends to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status, despite the university's recent moves to comply with many of the administration's demands. “We are going to be taking away Harvard's Tax Exempt Status. It's what they deserve!” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. Just weeks ago, Harvard was celebrated for resisting the Trump administration's threats to withhold $2.2 billion in federal funding, positioning itself as a defender of academic freedom by filing a lawsuit challenging the funding freeze. But recently, the university has quietly reversed course, rebranding and altering the mission of its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) office, announcing that it will no longer fund affinity group celebrations during commencement, and sharing international student information with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). “You mean to tell me banning affinity group graduations, handing over school records to the DHS gestapo, cracking down on protests, and dismantling DEI didn't appease this fascist dictator?! Earlier this year, Columbia University faced backlash for similar concessions. In an attempt to restore $400 million in frozen federal funding, Columbia agreed to suspend or expel students who participated in pro-Palestine protests, enforce a mask ban for demonstrators, coordinate with police to monitor students, and place an entire academic department under federal receivership. Last week, students affiliated with the unrecognized campus groups Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine and Jews 4 Palestine held a rally condemning Harvard University for targeting pro-Palestinian students and yielding to pressure from the Trump administration. Organizers emphasized that Harvard's quiet capitulation should come as no surprise. They are two sides of the same coin,” said Violet T.M. That same month, Harvard removed Professors Cemal Kafadar and Rosie Bsheer from their leadership positions at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former pardon attorney Liz Oyer said president erased more than ‘$1bn in debts owed by wealthy Americans' The justice department's pardon attorney, who was recently fired, has claimed on social media that Donald Trump's recent wave of pardoning white-collar criminals has erased more than “$1bn in debts owed by wealthy Americans” to the public purse. In a TikTok video, Liz Oyer, who has said that she was terminated in March after refusing to comply with an order to restore the gun rights of the actor Mel Gibson – a supporter of Trump's – explained that “when you're convicted of a financial crime like fraud or embezzlement, the law requires you to pay back the money that you stole. Oyer alleged: “In total, Donald Trump has granted pardons that have wiped out over $1bn in debts owed by wealthy Americans who have committed fraud and broken the law.” In the video, Oyer highlights the case of Michele Fiore, a former Republican politician from Nevada, who was convicted of wire fraud last year. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. The White House pardoned Fiore, and according to Oyer, this released her from repaying those funds. Notably, Milton and his wife contributed more than $1.8m to a Trump re-election campaign. Oyer said his pardon erased the restitution being sought. The newspaper also noted that some of Trump's pardon recipients had not yet been sentenced, so their owed amounts had not been finalized by the courts. Trump also pardoned several company executives who had pleaded guilty to financial crimes. Oyer told the Post it was “unprecedented for a president to grant pardons that have the effect of wiping out so much debt owed by people who have committed frauds”. Last month, Oyer, who served in Joe Biden's administration, testified before Congress about her termination and the Trump administration's treatment of the justice department and law firms.</p>

MOSCOW, May 2. /TASS/. European countries are turning into totalitarian regimes led by unpopular politicians and parties, speaker of the Russian State Duma, or lower house of parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin said, commenting on the designation of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party as "right-wing extremist."

"Today, popular politicians in Germany, France, Romania, and Moldova are prosecuted, and parties are banned. European countries are turning into totalitarian regimes led by unpopular politicians and parties," he wrote on his Telegram channel, adding that what is happening there can be described as a "collapse of democracy in Europe."

"As soon as the leader of France's National Rally party, Marine Le Pen, became the most popular politician having outstripped incumbent President [Emmanuel] Macron in ratings, she was deprived of electoral rights for five years and brought to criminal responsibility," he noted.

He also pointed to the annulment of the November 2024 election in Romania, which were won by opposition politician Calin Georgescu, who was barred from taking part in a new election. Apart from that, Evghenia Gutsul, the head of Moldova's Gagauz autonomy, who refused to support the Moldovan authorities' course toward European integration, was arrested ahead of parliamentary elections, he recalled.

"The political system based on democratic principles, such as competition, free expression of people's will, rights and freedoms, has become a thing of the past," he emphasized.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thousands of discrimination investigations are idled, even those nearing resolution when Trump took office again. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox Then the U.S. Department of Education in March suddenly closed the California regional outpost of its Office for Civil Rights and fired all its employees there. In South Dakota, the OCR abruptly terminated its work with a school district that had agreed to take steps to end discrimination against its Native American students. Now, Education Secretary Linda McMahon is “reorienting” what's left of it. Part of that shift has been ordering investigations related to the administration's priorities, such as ending the participation of transgender girls and women in girls' and women's sports. After hearing that a transgender woman from Wagner College in New York competed in a women's fencing tournament at the University of Maryland last month, the head of the OCR launched a special investigation into both schools and threatened their access to federal funding. Through internal memos and case data, interviews with more than a dozen current agency attorneys, and public records requests to school districts and other targets of investigations across the country, ProPublica has documented how the Trump administration has radically reshaped the OCR. Only 57 investigations that found a civil rights violation and led to change at a school or college were completed in March, ProPublica has learned. Leadership under President Donald Trump also has made it easier for the OCR to drop discrimination complaints quickly. In March, 91% of cases closed by the office were dismissed without an investigation, and 89% were dismissed outright in April, according to internal case data obtained by ProPublica. Typically, 70% of cases are dismissed because they don't meet criteria to warrant an investigation. With more than half of the Education Department's civil rights offices closed and the division reduced to a fraction of its former staff, families' pleas for updates and action have gone unheard. One OCR attorney, who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation, told ProPublica that her caseload went from 60 to 380 as she absorbed cases previously handled by employees who worked in offices that had been closed. As with civil rights divisions in other federal agencies that the Trump administration has fundamentally altered, the OCR has worked for decades to uphold constitutional rights against discrimination based on disability, race and gender. Unable to do the work,” said Michael Pillera, who until recently was an OCR attorney in Washington, D.C. He is now with the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. Investigating cases that allege racism, discrimination based on sexual orientation or mistreatment of students with disabilities now requires permission from Trump appointees, according to a memo from OCR leadership. “I thought we were somewhere, and now we are back to square one because they are closed,” said K.D., the mother of the Black California student who said her daughter has been called racial epithets by her classmates. Education Department spokespeople did not respond to questions and requests for comment sent over several weeks about changes in the civil rights division. Another OCR attorney who, like others, asked not to be named for fear of retaliation, said the administration's new vision for civil rights enforcement has harmed families. Its investigators followed a process to determine whether complaints from the public met legal criteria for a civil rights claim, then carried out investigations methodically. The vast majority of investigations were based on discrimination complaints from students and families, and a large share of those were related to disability discrimination. The inquiries typically took months and, in complex cases, years. Investigations being publicized now have largely bypassed the agency's civil rights attorneys, according to Education Department employees. McMahon and OCR head Craig Trainor created what amounts to a shadow division. The Trump administration has ordered more than a dozen investigations in the past three months on its own, not initiated by an outside complainant. These “directed investigations” are typically rare; there were none during President Joseph Biden's administration. Some letters describe transgender girls as “biological males,” which is ideologically pointed language that OCR attorneys say they've never used before. “They're blowing through past precedents, past practices, best practices,” said Catherine Lhamon, who led OCR under former Presidents Barack Obama and Biden and departed the office in January. “And they're not even attempting to appear like neutral arbiters of the law.” The administration made an “End DEI” portal that bypasses the traditional online complaint system and seeks only grievances about diversity, equity and inclusion in schools. McMahon then announced a “Title IX Special Investigations Team” last month to work with the Department of Justice and appointed Trainor to it. It launches its own investigations into schools that include transgender girls in athletics. In an internal memo to the new team that was obtained by ProPublica, Trainor defined the special team's purpose: “To effectively and efficiently address the increasing volume of Title IX single-sex sports/spaces cases, expedite those investigations and resolutions, and collaborate seamlessly with DOJ to conclude investigations that go to DOJ for enforcement.” The investigation began after Fox News and other media reported about a fencing tournament at the University of Maryland in which a transgender player from Wagner competed. Trainor signed the notification letters himself, a departure from Lhamon's practice. But an online database that is supposed to list all investigations underway hasn't been updated since Trump took office. Among them were two related to a family's complaints that their California school district discriminated against students with disabilities, including by barricading them inside what it called a “reset” room. The district said it could not comment on the pending investigation but said it participated in more than a dozen interviews with an OCR attorney. OCR attorneys say they have been repeatedly blindsided by public announcements about policy changes and investigations. To find out what Trainor and McMahon have launched on their behalf, they check the Education Department's website daily for press releases. Those statements sometimes quote Trainor preemptively saying a school “appears to violate” civil rights law. The attorneys worry they will have no choice, despite what their investigations uncover, but to find against schools that have already been excoriated by the department publicly. For example, in a press release announcing an investigation into a transgender athlete participating in girls' track and field in Portland Public Schools in Oregon, Trainor said, “We will not allow the Portland Public Schools District or any other educational entity that receives federal funds to trample on the antidiscrimination protections that women and girls are guaranteed under law.” A third current OCR attorney, who asked not to be named for fear of losing her job, said the administration is misinterpreting civil rights law. Conservative groups with complaints about diversity or transgender students have been able to file complaints directly with Trainor and get quick results — another norm-breaking way to operate outside of the OCR's protocol. America First Legal, a group founded by Trump deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller that considers itself the “answer to the ACLU,” emailed Trainor a few days after Trump's “Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling” executive order. The order directs schools to stop teaching about or supporting diversity, equity and gender identity. “AFL respectfully requests that the Department of Education open investigations into the following public-school districts in Northern Virginia for continuing violations of Title IX,” the letter read, listing five districts that have policies welcoming to transgender students. America First issued a press release headlined “VICTORY.” The group declined to comment further. Remaking the OCR isn't just about increasing caseloads and reordering political priorities. The Trump administration now is taking steps to roll back OCR's previous civil rights work. Last month, Trump issued an executive order that directs all federal agencies, including the Education Department, to stop enforcing cases involving policies that disproportionately affect certain groups — for example, when Black students are disciplined more harshly than white students for the same infractions or when students with disabilities are suspended more than any other group even though they represent a small percentage of student enrollment. Trump's order requires the agencies to “assess all pending investigations, lawsuits, and consent judgements” that consider disproportionate discipline and “take appropriate action.” Complaints made to the OCR that students were unfairly disciplined could be thrown out; existing enforcement actions or monitoring of schools that had disciplined students disproportionately could be revoked. About a year ago, the office had signed an agreement with Rapid City Area Schools after an investigation found that the district's Native American students were disciplined far more harshly than white ones. The former superintendent, Nicole Swigart, denied saying any of that. “I recognize those comments are horrendous,” Swigart said in an interview with ProPublica. But last month, the OCR abruptly terminated that agreement, based on its differing interpretation of civil rights law. The OCR's new view is that equity and diversity efforts discriminate against white students. “Native students in Rapid City just lost a layer of protection,” the Lakota People's Law Project announced on Facebook. “Native students are still being pushed out of classrooms and denied opportunities.” “And this time, they are partisan, political,” said Thompson, who works for the nonprofit Sacred Defense Fund affiliated with the Lakota group in Rapid City. In response to questions from ProPublica, the school district said it has completed much of the work — including broader access to educational opportunities and an improved behavior tracking process — and plans to continue it even without federal oversight. But it also said this week that under the OCR's new directives, “we must shift our approach.” The district did not elaborate on what will change. It's unclear whether the OCR has ended agreements with other districts or colleges. Education Department spokespeople did not respond to questions from ProPublica. Some subjects of the OCR's new directives and investigations have capitulated. A school district in Tumwater, Washington, that Trainor targeted for allowing a transgender basketball player from an opposing team to compete responded by voting to support the state athletic association excluding trans players altogether. According to communication obtained by ProPublica through public records requests, the district called out the OCR for “continuing to take a different approach with this case without explanation, a case with no complainant who is awaiting any form of relief or remedy.” Kristin Bailey, a Denver Public Schools attorney, wrote to an OCR supervisor that the way the investigation is being handled “appears to be retaliatory.” Since February, at least half a dozen lawsuits have been filed to try to stop the dismantling of the Education Department and its civil rights functions — among them, suits by Democratic state attorneys general and from the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers. It noted that under McMahon and Trainor, “cherry-picked investigations appear to be the only matters the Department is currently pursuing.” Those lawsuits are pending. Several OCR attorneys told ProPublica that they hope these groups and school districts continue to push back. “Hopefully we're still here and can help rebuild in the future.” We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency. Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.” Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said he planned to strip Harvard University of its tax-exempt status, the latest salvo against the Ivy League school amid a larger crackdown on elite U.S. universities. “We are going to be taking away Harvard's Tax Exempt Status. It's what they deserve!” Trump said in a post on his social-media platform, without specifying when he might take action. Representatives for the Internal Revenue Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump's post and whether it was revoking the university's tax-exempt status. Harvard, in a statement, said the move would be unlawful and unprecedented. “There is no legal basis to rescind Harvard's tax-exempt status,” the Boston-area school said. It would also cut money available for student scholarships, medical research and technological advancements that drive economic growth, Harvard added. Since taking office in January, Trump has targeted major U.S. universities by freezing federal funding, launching investigations, revoking student visas and making other demands. Under federal law, the president cannot request that the IRS, which determines whether an organization can have or maintain tax-exempt status, investigate organizations. Trump said he was considering an end to Harvard's tax-exempt status in a separate social media post on April 15, when annual U.S. tax returns are due, but did not say how he would do it. White House spokesperson Harrison Fields last month said any forthcoming IRS actions were independent of the president and that any tax status investigations were initiated before Trump's post.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LONDON, May 2. The international Euroclear platform plans to seize about €3 billion in frozen Russian assets as compensation to Western investors whose funds were allegedly confiscated by Moscow, Reuters reported, citing a document in its possession and two sources. The agency notes that the €3 billion in question is part of a larger €10 billion sum belonging to Russian companies and individuals who have been under EU sanctions since 2022. According to Reuters, this move became possible last year following amendments to the sanctions framework. As Reuters reports, Euroclear notified clients of the forthcoming payments on April 1. "We received authorisation from our competent authority, to unfreeze the compensation amounts and make these available to our participants," the agency quotes the document as saying. The European Union, Canada, the United States and Japan froze around $300 billion in Russian assets after the launch of the special military operation. Of that total, approximately $5-6 billion is held in the United States, while the lion's share is located in Europe — including $210 billion at the Euroclear platform in Belgium. In March, European Council President Antonio Costa admitted that the EU cannot unfreeze Russian assets, as the proceeds from their reinvestment act as collateral for military loans extended to Ukraine by the Group of Seven (G7). Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated that Moscow would not renounce its rights to the frozen assets in the West and would continue to protect them.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Never in his political career has Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre been humiliated like this. The number of personal apologies he has delivered in his 20 years of politics could probably fit on one hand (in fact, I can think of just two), while still leaving his middle finger free to wave at anyone who passes by. Indeed, it has been a series of successes for the once-youngest MP, then star cabinet minister, then leader of the Official Opposition, whose two-decade rise in politics suddenly fell out the bottom on Monday evening. There might be ways to excuse, explain and rationalize the Conservatives' loss to the Liberals during this election, but there is nothing to palliate Mr. Poilievre's loss of his own seat. It is the worst thing that could happen to someone who has made a career out of never showing weakness, simply because it is so utterly humiliating. Why would the CPC want to keep him around? It's worth noting, firstly, that there is a very human inclination to generalize and transpose our feelings onto others; that is to say, if we viscerally can't stand someone, it's hard to conceive of how others might feel differently. But the reality in this election is that more than eight million people in this country voted for the Conservatives – some, because of Mr. Poilievre, and no doubt for others, despite him. But there is no question that Mr. Poilievre is popular in caucus, among CPC members and yes, across Canada, and that popularity has the potential to grow if – and only if – Mr. Poilievre is genuinely humbled by this first significant loss. For any party, the decision to boot a leader should be forward-looking; it should not necessarily be about how badly he screwed up his first kick at the can (and let's be clear: Mr. Poilievre missed the can altogether while he was chasing the ghost of Justin Trudeau), but about whether he has the capacity to improve, and whether someone else would likely do better. The gains the party made under Mr. Poilievre are significant; Conservatives picked up seats in Ontario ridings heavily populated by blue-collar workers, by students, and new Canadians, which represents a meaningful broadening of the Conservative base. But I suspect more factory workers in Windsor West are familiar with Mr. Poilievre's “Boots not Suits” slogan and manner of speaking about the trades than they are with page 20 of the party's platform regarding RESP eligibility for apprenticeship credentials. And I also suspect many young people appreciate his particular style of talking about their economic struggles, and not simply that he talks about them generally. But Mr. Poilievre also carried himself with the hubris of someone who has never experienced a political loss: by antagonizing the media, by sparring with provincial premiers, by muzzling his candidates and making the campaign all about him. It's the type of childish campus Conservative antics that scare progressive Canadians into voting strategically, and tune moderate voters out from his message. But the sophomoric antics made it such that many Canadians simply didn't see him as a leader. A chastened Pierre Poilievre – and a chastened Conservative Party – would do well to show some humility in the face of this loss, which was unfathomable just months ago. If he has that capacity, and has the capacity to finally grow up, then it is in the party's strategic interest to keep Mr. Poilievre as leader.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump's ambitions for the US to “drill, baby, drill” for more fossil fuels have ironically been hampered by the economic chaos unleashed by his own tariffs, but the US is still on track to increase oil and gas extraction, causing a surge in planet-heating emissions, a new analysis shows. But Trump has sought to escalate this further, declaring an “energy emergency” to open up more land and ocean for drilling and launching an unprecedented assault on environmental regulations in his first 100 days back in the White House. This new political climate means that the expected amount of greenhouse gas emissions from active and planned projects in US oil and gas fields has jumped under Trump, after previously dropping under Biden, forecasts shared with the Guardian show. Despite awarding more drilling leases than Trump in his first 100 days, Biden also pursued policies to combat the climate crisis that saw oil and gas companies revise down their production estimates. That situation has now reversed, threatening a pulse of new pollution that will further add to the fever of a planet already suffering from heatwaves, floods, droughts and other disasters accelerated by global heating. “The uptick in embodied emissions from forecast US oil and gas production is worrying,” said Olivier Bois von Kursk, policy adviser at the International Institute for Sustainable Development, which tracks emissions projections from the lifetime of projects, based on data from research consultancy Rystad Energy. Trump has already taken more than 140 initial actions to reverse environmental regulations and promote the use of fossil fuels, dismissing established climate science as a “giant hoax” and exhorting further drilling. “We have more liquid gold under our feet than any nation on Earth, and by far, and now I fully authorize the most talented team ever assembled to go and get it,” the president told Congress in March. While “drill, baby, drill” won't fully be realized unless Trump manages to push through significant deregulation and tax cuts for the sector, the US will still move towards a record peak of 15m barrels of oil a day, up from about 13.5m barrels a day now, according to projections by Rystad. The International Energy Agency, which has forecast that global oil and gas demand will peak by 2030, has said that no new major fossil fuel projects can occur if the world is to stay within agreed temperature limits and avoid catastrophic climate impacts. Trump's ambitions for more drilling in the US have been clouded, however, by his own economic policies. While oil and gas has been exempt from a barrage of tariffs imposed by Trump, the industry is smarting from tariffs placed on materials such as steel, which it needs for pipelines, and has been unnerved by fears of recession amid an increasingly erratic trade war. The price of a barrel of American crude oil briefly dropped below $60, a threshold under which companies cannot operate profitably, before edging up slightly in recent weeks. ‘Drill, baby, drill' is nothing short of a myth and populist rallying cry,” one executive told a survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Said another: “I have never felt more uncertainty about our business in my entire 40-plus-year career.” The full impact of the tariffs have yet to be seen but industry expectations have been “completely shattered” by their imposition, according to Claudio Galimberti, chief economist at Rystad. “Investments have been put on hold and the expectations of growth of economic activity have been slashed dramatically,” Galimberti said. While more than 90% of new power added to the US electricity grid this year is expected to be from solar, wind and batteries, the administration's turn against renewables is already affecting planned projects that are overwhelmingly located in Republican rural and exurban districts. Nearly $8bn in planned investments and 16 large-scale clean energy projects were shut, cancelled or downsized in the first three months of the year, according to E2, a nonpartisan business group. “Clean energy companies still want to invest in America, but uncertainty over Trump administration policies and the future of critical clean energy tax credits are taking a clear toll,” said Michael Timberlake, a spokesperson for E2. Economic disruptions from the fluctuating price of oil, as well the climate impacts from burning oil and other fossil fuels, can be alleviated if “governments and investors make smart choices”, said von Kursk. “Clean energy is more competitive than ever, eroding demand for fossil fuels.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prime Minister Mark Carney, left, and President of France Emmanuel Macron shake hands after delivering a joint statement at the Palais de l'Elysee in Paris, on March 17.Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press We have voted, once again, for a more continental-style form of government that combines robust state institutions with a free-trading liberal market economy. To lead it, we've got a former European central banker whose first prime ministerial trip was to France and who describes Canada as “the most European of non-European countries.” And our economic productivity, average incomes and standards of living have for years operated at a more modest European level compared to the soaring American exception – giving us a common cross-Atlantic project to fix it. With the U.S. economy walled off, the Canada-European Union Trade Agreement, which entered into force in 2017, now gives us our largest unprotected market; our volume of bilateral trade with the 27-country bloc has increased 65 per cent since, with about $44-billion in annual goods exports. Several EU countries, including France and Italy, still haven't ratified the deal, suggesting there's some room for growth. Ottawa recently began negotiating a set of deals to shift its defence procurement away from Washington and toward Europe, and implicitly to join an emerging European defence bloc that may either replace or take control of NATO. And Canada has signed a number of bilateral agreements that make it part of the European Green Deal, a massive initiative to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and boost economic growth. It probably began in early January, when a column in The Economist argued that Canada ought to be the 28th EU state, because Canadians need Europe's people for skills and population growth and Europeans need Canada's resources and land. Proposals to welcome Canada into the bloc were made by Sigmar Gabriel, who was German chancellor Angela Merkel's foreign minister, and Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister, who declared: “There is no reason why EU membership [for Canada] should be off the table!” A number of Canadian commentators followed suit, and an Abacus survey suggested that almost half of Canadians favoured joining (with only a quarter against). And yes, it would technically be possible – the Maastricht Treaty says any new EU state must be “a European country,” but that carries no definition, and the EU has long included Cyprus, which is geographically in West Asia. But I also don't think it's something we should be pursuing. The first reason: it wouldn't solve Canada's serious problems. CETA already provides us all the free access to European markets we need. Many of those are resources that can't affordably be shipped overseas. We are inescapably a North American country, economically and in most cultural respects. And it wouldn't take us further on defence or the environment, all of which we are quite successfully negotiating from outside the EU. The bloc is already engaged in decades-long projects to help Serbia, Moldova, Ukraine and sometimes Turkey on the long road to membership – and they're at least physically in Europe. It would be absurd and more than a little bigoted to be pursuing Canada as a “culturally European” country before, say, Morocco. That kind of thinking, after all, is exactly what we're trying to escape in our quest for better trade and political partners, now that the United States has been poisoned with it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Be among the first to get it. Russian air defenses allegedly intercepted 89 Ukrainian drones over occupied Crimea and another 23 over the waters of the Black Sea, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed on May 2. The pro-Ukrainian Crimean Wind Telegram channel reported explosions in several key locations across the peninsula, including Sevastopol, Dzhankoy, Saky, Novofedorivka, and Kacha — sites that host Russian military airfields. The Saky and Kacha airfields are used by Russia to control airspace over the Black Sea and to launch strikes on Ukrainian territory. Videos published by Crimean Wind showed multiple explosions and a fire near the village of Uhlove, close to the Kacha airfield. Uhlove is located about 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) from the coast of Kalamit Bay and roughly 25 kilometers (15 miles) southwest of Simferopol. Mikhail Razvozhayev, the Russian-installed leader in Sevastopol, confirmed on Telegram that "loud sounds" were caused by Russian forces repelling an attempted drone attack. He claimed seven drones had been destroyed over the sea at a significant distance from shore. "The fleet, in cooperation with air defense forces, is reflecting a massive combined attack," he wrote, claiming no damage to infrastructure in Sevastopol or its waters. Ukraine has carried out several successful attacks against Russian targets in occupied Crimea and its vicinity, heavily degrading the Russian Black Sea Fleet.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States remains committed to supporting peace efforts in Ukraine but will scale back its direct role as mediator, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said on May 1. "He (U.S. President Donald Trump) knows also that there is another part of the world, a whole globe that needs some attention," Bruce told reporters. The remarks reflect a significant shift in Washington's approach after months of stalled diplomacy aimed at brokering a ceasefire in Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump had previously warned that the U.S. would withdraw from mediation efforts if no meaningful progress was made. On April 18, Trump said, "If one of the two parties makes it very difficult, we're just going to say: 'you're foolish, you're fools, you're horrible people,' and we're just going to take a pass." Vice President JD Vance echoed the shift on May 1, telling Fox News that the war in Ukraine is unlikely to end "any time soon." It is "going to be up to the Russians and Ukrainians now that each side knows what the other's terms for peace are. The U.S. intensified its diplomatic outreach earlier this year, including negotiating proposals for a 30-day ceasefire and partial truces aimed at halting attacks on civilian energy infrastructure. Moscow has rejected these initiatives, and Russian forces have intensified strikes across Ukraine. In contrast, Kyiv has accepted the U.S.-backed ceasefire plan and continues to demand an unconditional cessation of hostilities. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said on May 1 that at least 72 senators are ready to vote for sweeping new sanctions and tariffs against Russia, should Putin continue to avoid serious peace negotiations.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A staffer of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) said on May 1 that he dropped out of Harvard University to join the advisory commission and described losing friends and facing social ostracization at his former school afterward. DOGE leader Elon Musk and his team sat down with Fox News host Jesse Watters for an interview that aired on Thursday evening, discussing some of their findings after auditing various federal agencies. One DOGE member, Ethan, said he dropped out of Harvard University to join the advisory commission, which President Donald Trump created by executive order earlier this year to find waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal government. Ethan said he has received threats and lost friends after joining DOGE. “Young folks of [DOGE] have gotten email threats from reporters and the public alike. Speaking for myself, I dropped out of Harvard and came here to serve my country, and it's been unfortunate to see lost friendships,” he said. The source said that federal law enforcement had been dispatched to protect family members of DOGE staffers after their names were leaked to the press. Some anonymous users on the social platform Bluesky had made posts disclosing DOGE employees' names and faces, and in one post, the words “Dead or Alive.” Rep. Derrick Van Orden (R-Wis.), who leads the House DOGE Caucus's defense and veterans' affairs portfolio, told The Epoch Times that “if those people broke the law by doxxing these folks and doing that and threatening them, they should be thrown into prison.” “I think the value of this and the impact here is so much more vast than anything you could learn in a classroom doing computer science,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Be among the first to get it. U.S. Vice President JD Vance said in an interview with Fox News on May 1 that the  war in Ukraine is not going to end "any time soon." It is "going to be up to the Russians and Ukrainians now that each side knows what the other's terms for peace are. It's going to be up to them to come to an agreement and stop this brutal, brutal conflict," Vance told Fox News' Bret Baier. Earlier on April 30, Vance said that the Trump administration is working to broker a "durable solution" to the Russia–Ukraine war within the next 100 days, according to a Fox News Digital interview. Asked about the state of negotiations, Vance said, "The first and necessary step of getting the Russia-Ukraine conflict solved is to get each of them to make a peace proposal." He added, "We've got the peace proposal out there and issued, and we're going to work very hard over the next 100 days to try to bring these guys together." The renewed push follows months of diplomacy and comes after U.S. President Donald Trump shifted his campaign promise to end the war "within 24 hours" to a 100-day timeline, which has now passed without a deal. Ukraine accepted a 30-day U.S.-backed ceasefire in March, but Russia rejected it, demanding an end to Western military aid. Despite calls for peace, Moscow has stepped up attacks against Ukrainian civilians in recent weeks.</p>

All funds collected through the enforcement of this new law would be deposited in the Air Pollution Control Trust Fund and would be strictly used for air pollution control purposes. The language of the bill accounts for both private individuals and corporate entities, and ensures that a general report line will be open for any person to submit via email. All operators of public infrastructure, like airports, will be required to submit monthly reports on weather modification or geoeingeneering to the Department of Transportation beginning Oct. 1. Cloud seeding involves dispensing heavy metals such as silver iodide into the atmosphere to induce precipitation, and solar radiation modification, or solar geoengineering, is the process of using heavy metals such as sulfur dioxide to reflect more of the sun's rays back into space in an effort to curb global warming. “Heavy metals, which are found in weather modification patents, can have severe effects on human health when ingested, inhaled, or touches our skin,” the fact sheet stated. Those possible effects include kidney damage, liver cancer, neurological damage, autism, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and immune system dysfunction. Several states on both sides of the political aisle already allow or even fund weather modification, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Texas, and Wyoming. At the same time, other states including Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Illinois, and Tennessee have already taken measures to ban or restrict it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A congressional committee is investigating reports that more than a hundred Chinese nationals are serving as mercenaries for the Russian military in Ukraine. Zelenskyy's comments marked the first time that the Ukrainian government made such a claim about Chinese fighters, although Russia is believed to have deployed approximately 10,000 North Korean troops to the front lines as it has struggled to replenish its battlefield losses. The CCP has denied sending anyone to fight for Russia. According to a copy of the Select Committee's letter shared with The Epoch Times, it is unlikely that such a large number of Chinese nationals could be fighting for Russia without at least tacit approval from the CCP. “The reported presence of PRC mercenaries in Ukraine is only the latest evidence of Beijing's extensive support for Russia's war effort,” the letter reads, using an acronym for the official name of communist China, the People's Republic of China. “Given the Chinese Communist Party's broad control in Chinese society, it is clear that Russia's recruitment campaign of PRC nationals could not exist without at least the tacit approval of the Party.” To that end, the Select Committee's letter notes that the intelligence community's most recent annual threat assessment found that the CCP is providing economic and security assistance for Russia's war in Ukraine by supporting the Russian defense industrial sector and providing dual-use technologies, including components used for weapons systems. Beijing and Moscow have grown closer since Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. “The recent reporting on Chinese mercenaries fighting in Ukraine, in addition to the PRC's broader support for the Russian war effort, underscores the deepening alignment between the autocratic regimes in Beijing and Moscow, including their mutual support and encouragement of each other's expansionist aims.” The State Department did not return a request for comment by publication time.</p>
