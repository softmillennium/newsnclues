                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chinese bargain retailer Temu changed its business model in the U.S. as the Trump administration's new rules on low-value shipments took effect Friday. In recent days, Temu has abruptly shifted its website and app to only display listings for products shipped from U.S.-based warehouses. Items shipped directly from China, which previously blanketed the site, are now labeled as out of stock. Temu made a name for itself in the U.S. as a destination for ultra-discounted items shipped direct from China, such as $5 sneakers and $1.50 garlic presses. It's been able to keep prices low because of the so-called de minimis rule, which has allowed items worth $800 or less to enter the country duty-free since 2016. The loophole expired Friday at 12:01 a.m. EDT as a result of an executive order signed by President Donald Trump in April. Trump briefly suspended the de minimis rule in February before reinstating the provision days later as customs officials struggled to process and collect tariffs on a mountain of low-value packages. The end of de minimis, as well as Trump's new 145% tariffs on China, has forced Temu to raise prices, suspend its aggressive online advertising push and now alter the selection of goods available to American shoppers to circumvent higher levies. A Temu spokesperson confirmed to CNBC that all sales in the U.S. are now handled by local sellers and said they are fulfilled "from within the country." "The move is designed to help local merchants reach more customers and grow their businesses." Before the change, shoppers who attempted to purchase Temu products shipped from China were confronted with "import charges" of between 130% and 150%. Shein, which has also benefited from the loophole, moved to raise prices last week. The fast-fashion retailer added a banner at checkout that says, "Tariffs are included in the price you pay. You'll never have to pay extra at delivery." The company's Temu competitor, called Amazon Haul, has relied on de minimis to ship products priced at $20 or less directly from China to the U.S. Amazon said Tuesday following a dustup with the White House that had it considered showing tariff-related costs on Haul products ahead of the de minimis cutoff but that it has since scrapped those plans. Critics of the de minimis provision argue that it harms American businesses and that it facilitates shipments of fentanyl and other illicit substances because, they say, the packages are less likely to be inspected by customs agents.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple was issued a potentially crushing setback in its ongoing legal battle over App Store fees — but players across the subscription creator economy are cheering it as a win. 1 platform for fan engagement on Patreon, and we believe this ruling allows creators to get paid without giving Apple 30%." Patreon is a platform where creators can build subscription businesses and charge fans for paywalled content, such as podcasts or videos, and other perks. Wednesday's ruling said the company failed to do that. It also said Apple violated the court's order by charging a 27% fee when links guide users to off-app purchases. An Apple spokesperson previously told BI that the company "strongly" disagrees with the court's decision and plans to both comply and appeal — a sentiment echoed by CEO Tim Cook on the company's earnings call. Apple did not respond to a request for further comment. Apps that help creators make money from subscriptions, like Patreon, Passes, Kajabi, and Mighty Networks, rejoiced at the changes. Patreon said it's submitting an app update for review that will enable payment options outside of in-app purchases so creators can keep more money. Last year, the company said it was removing all other billing systems from its iOS app, and advised creators that they could either raise their in-app prices to cover Apple's fees or eat the fees themselves. Subscribers could also avoid the fees by signing up on Patreon's website. While "the dust has yet to settle," given Apple's plans to appeal, "this is a good day for creative people," Patreon CEO Jack Conte said on Instagram. Passes founder and CEO Lucy Guo told BI in a statement that "companies have had to charge more to creators because of these commissions, so this will put more money in creators' pockets." Last quarter, the company's services business, which includes its App Store, accounted for $26.6 billion in net sales. While it's unclear how many prospective subscribers will forego the convenience of in-app purchases, Kajabi CEO Ahad Khan said the ruling points to a shift toward more creator ownership. "Creators have long relied on social platforms and tech giants to earn money, and it cuts into their earnings and even limits how they engage with their audiences," he told BI.</p>

Apple Inc. is teaming up with startup Anthropic PBC on a new “vibe-coding” software platform that will use artificial intelligence to write, edit and test code on behalf of programmers.

The system is a new version of Xcode, Apple's programming software, that will integrate Anthropic's Claude Sonnet model, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Apple will roll out the software internally and hasn't yet decided whether to launch it publicly, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the initiative hasn't been announced.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos plans to sell up to 25 million shares in the company over the next year, according to a financial filing on Friday. Bezos, who stepped down as CEO in 2021 but remains Amazon's top shareholder, is selling the shares as part of a trading plan adopted on March 4, the filing states. The disclosure follows Amazon's first-quarter earnings report late Thursday. While profit and revenue topped estimates, the company's forecast for operating income in the current quarter came in below Wall Street's expectations. The results show that Amazon is bracing for uncertainty related to President Donald Trump's sweeping new tariffs. Trump personally called Bezos to complain, and Amazon clarified that no such change was coming. Bezos previously offloaded about $13.5 billion worth of Amazon shares last year, marking his first sale of company stock since 2021. Since handing over the Amazon CEO role to Andy Jassy, Bezos has spent more of his time on his space exploration company, Blue Origin, and his $10 billion climate and biodiversity fund. He's used Amazon share sales to help fund Blue Origin, as well as the Day One Fund, which he launched in September 2018 to provide education in low-income communities and combat homelessness.

A rocket holding Boeings Starliner spacecraft launches from Space Launch Complex 41 in Cape Canaveral, Florida. 

President Donald Trump's proposed budget for next year calls for sweeping cuts to many of NASA's programs, including a plan to phase out the agency's Boeing Co.-made moon rocket, reduce crews and operations on the International Space Station and gut science initiatives. 

Trump's funding request would decrease NASA's budget by more than $6 billion from what the agency received for 2025. The proposed $18.8 billion budget includes cuts across NASA's entire portfolio, but the biggest changes would fall on the agency's science programs, with a nearly $2.3 billion reduction in funding.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The streaming giant's stock has traded for 11 straight days without a decline, the company's longest positive run ever. Its previous record was a nine-day stretch in late 2018 and early 2019 when the stock traded up for four days, was unchanged for a day and then traded positively for another four days. The stock is also trading at all-time-high levels since it went public in May 2002. This new streak comes on the heels of Netflix's most recent earnings report on April 17, in which it revealed that revenue grew 13% during the first quarter of 2025 on higher-than-forecast subscription and advertising dollars. Netflix has been one of the top-performing stocks during the first 100 days of President Donald Trump's second term, with shares up more than 30% since mid-January. The company has been largely unaffected by Trump's tariffs and trade war with China and is a service that consumers are unlikely to cut during a recession. Meanwhile, traditional media stocks have been slammed by a tumultuous market prompted by Trump's trade policy. Discovery has lost nearly 10% since Trump took office, while Disney is down 13% during that same period. "There's been no material change to our overall business outlook," the company said in a statement last month. As investors worry about the potential effect of tariffs on consumer spending and confidence, Netflix's co-CEO Greg Peters said on the company's earnings call, "Based on what we are seeing by actually operating the business right now, there's nothing really significant to note." "We also take some comfort that entertainment historically has been pretty resilient in tougher economic times," Peters said. "Netflix, specifically, also, has been generally quite resilient. We haven't seen any major impacts during those tougher times, albeit over a much shorter history." JPMorgan said Thursday that it sees more upside for shares. "NFLX has established itself as the clear leader in global streaming & is on the pathway to becoming global TV … Advertising Upfronts in May should serve as a positive catalyst to shares," analysts wrote. But it is unclear if the subscriber base is growing or shrinking because the company recently stopped sharing details on its membership numbers, instead focusing on revenue growth.

US stocks are in for another drop that will eventually lead to a bear market in the coming months, according to veteran technical strategist Tom DeMark, who accurately called this year's top in February and subsequent April low.

DeMark — a closely-followed analyst who's advised billionaire investors including Paul Tudor Jones, Leon Cooperman and Steve Cohen — uses a system for predicting where markets will move, divined from a half century of chart gazing that's based on mathematical relationships. He focuses on trend exhaustion, with his mantra being markets top on good news and bottom on bad news.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rachel Cohen, an attorney who dramatically quit her job at a Big Law firm for its inaction in the face of President Donald Trump's war on major law firms, is joining a new firm that's taking on the president. Cohen announced on LinkedIn that she's joining the new firm launched by Abbe Lowell, an attorney who's represented an array of prominent Democratic Party figures, including Hunter Biden, former Sen. Bob Menendez, and former Sen. John Edwards, as well as Jared and Ivanka Trump. "This firm isn't going to shy away from the tough fights on behalf of our clients and we are building it with attorneys like Rachel Cohen who've proven they're ready to do just that," Lowell told Business Insider Friday morning. "Some lawyers and law firms aren't prepared to meet the current moment," she wrote. In March, Cohen publicly posted her resignation letter from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, where she had been an associate. Brenna Trout Frey, who quit her position as a Skadden associate after it signed the deal with Trump, will also be joining Lowell's new firm. As an attorney, if my employer cannot stand up for the rule of law, then I cannot ethically continue to work for them," Frey wrote on LinkedIn at the time. By starting his own firm, Lowell is also leaving the world of Big Law, where he co-chaired a white collar defense practice at Winston & Strawn. Lowell plans for his new firm to represent people Trump has singled out. The firm is also representing New York Attorney General Letitia James. A press release from the firm said it will also represent organizations that have had funds revoked by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Coco Mocoe. It has been edited for length and clarity. Three days before Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter tour kicked off at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, I bought a ticket to see her. I'd never seen her in person, and was so excited at the thought of seeing her perform after she'd won her first album of the year at the Grammys — a win I predicted. I felt like the concert would be a historic moment for her, and I was excited to see her live. The security guards put me in another section — still on the floor, just in a different section. Chatting and making friends with the people around me, a couple got my attention and said they thought I was sitting in their seat. We were showing each other our tickets, trying to figure out who was meant to be where. I asked the security guards for help, and they were getting different people involved to figure out what to do. A manager eventually appeared and apologized for the confusion. "We're going to hook you up," he said. "Your seat is going to be even better." I'm guessing it was easier to adjust my seat because I was there as a single person. I ended up in Section B, Row 12. It was closer than my original seat, only two school buses' lengths away from the runway. As I got to my seat, Serena and Kordell from "Love Island USA" were being escorted in, mobbed by fans. I also saw her getting buckled on the giant horseshoes that she'd fly across the stadium on. The audience was great — it felt like a big community of people just so happy to be there. Taking my time leaving, I stopped to get merchandise. I hadn't planned to buy anything, but after getting so lucky, I needed a lucky charm to commemorate the evening. I watched videos of people who had paid for a closer seat in the Honey Bucking Pit, saying they were disappointed because Beyoncé spent a lot of time on the runway — the runway in front of me. I looked on StubHub and Ticketmaster to see what my seat would cost now. One of the tickets in my section is now going for $7,000. It was an unexpected and magical night.</p>

Chevron Corp. will reduce share buybacks this quarter after oil prices tumbled, indicating that President Donald Trump's trade war is hurting a key US industry he pledged to help.

The Houston-based company said Friday it will repurchase about $2.75 billion of stock in the second quarter, about 30% less than it bought in the first three months of the year. It comes despite Chevron beating earnings estimates on more low-cost production from Kazakhstan and the Permian Basin. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spring is in the air, and Meghan Markle is back on our TV, which can only mean one thing. It's time for a spring garden pasta salad à la the Duchess of Sussex. After reviewing Meghan's new line of As Ever products and spending a weekend trying hosting tips from her Netflix show, I knew I also had to try some of Meghan's recipes. I was a huge fan of her Chantilly Lili dessert, a twist on banana pudding that Meghan named after her daughter, Princess Lilibet. Would the spring garden pasta salad be as big of a success? In the first season of her new show, Meghan demonstrates two different pasta dishes. My colleague Erin McDowell tried her one-pot pasta, a quick and easy dish that only requires a skillet. To make the pasta salad at home, you'll need: Meghan notes that frozen peas work well for this dish and don't need to be thawed beforehand. If you opt for fresh peas instead, boil them in salted water for about one to two minutes until they turn "bright green and crisp tender," according to the recipe. Then, drain the peas, rinse them under cold water, and drain again before adding them to the skillet. The recipe states that prep time for the spring garden pasta salad will take 20 minutes, but it took me at least half an hour to chop, slice, and dice everything. I should note that I'm not the quickest with a knife and was already pretty tired from a day full of trying Meghan's hosting projects, so I wasn't exactly working at full speed. I forgot that it can take quite a bit of time to bring a large pot of water to a boil, so I wasted precious time by not putting it on the stove right away as I did my prep work. And, as always with pasta, make sure to generously salt the water. Meghan says you should season the shallots and garlic with salt and cook them until they just start to soften, making sure to stir often. This should take about one to two minutes. Meghan says you should salt everything again and cook until the veggies are "crisp-tender," which should take two to three minutes. I took my skillet off the heat and threw in the box of rigatoni to my boiling pot of salted water, cooking the pasta until it was al dente. The recipe recommends saving half a cup of pasta water. I stirred everything together to coat the rigatoni noodles evenly. I grated a generous amount of each over the pasta, which I topped with lots of freshly ground black pepper. This is also the step where you can scatter the mint on top — although I must admit I forgot! And, full transparency, that tiredness immediately made me not want to like this pasta. There are a lot of great spring pastas that take much less time and work — I'm partial to Ina Garten's spring spaghetti carbonara — but if you're quick with a knife, or have an extra pair of hands to help, Meghan's spring garden pasta salad will be a crowd-pleaser.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On the manicured lawns outside Building 21 on Meta's sprawling Menlo Park headquarters, live llamas meandered with languid indifference, drawing clusters of developers who momentarily abandoned technical discussions for selfies with the stoic, woolly ambassadors of Meta's family of large language models. The cavernous auditorium's air conditioning was cranked up high. This was LlamaCon, Meta's first-ever conference for AI developers. Earlier this year, DeepSeek, an open-source AI model from China that delivered groundbreaking performance with computational efficiency, had much of Silicon Valley, including Meta's AI division, panicked. Around the same time, Meta announced that it would spend $65 billion in 2025 to build out AI infrastructure. Almost immediately after, Meta was accused of artificially inflating Llama models' performance benchmarks, a claim that executives pushed back against. LlamaCon, I thought, was Meta's moment to reclaim trust and clarify its AI strategy. Onstage, Meta's Chief Product Officer Chris Cox framed the company's open source strategy as principled rather than reactive: "We were a startup once, too," he said in the keynote. The subtext was clear: Meta wants developers to see Llama as their path to autonomy and flexibility in an increasingly closed AI ecosystem dominated by offerings from OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google. LlamaCon featured several announcements, including the launch of a new Llama API that Meta says will make it easy for developers to integrate its models using familiar tools and interfaces. Some tasks will be possible with just a few lines of code. Meta also announced partnerships with companies to make AI run faster; a security program with AT&T and others to fight AI-generated scams; and $1.5 million in grants to startups and universities around the world using Llama. Conspicuously absent, however, was what many developers had actually come hoping to see: a new reasoning model to compete with what has rapidly become table stakes in the AI industry, including in Chinese open-source alternatives like DeepSeek and Alibaba's Qwen. In a conversation with Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi, Zuckerberg seemed to tacitly acknowledge these shortcomings. "Part of the value around open source is that you can mix and match," he said. This is part of how I think open source basically passes in quality all the closed source [models]…[It] feels like sort of an unstoppable force." Vineeth Sai Varikuntla, a developer working on medical AI applications, echoed this sentiment when I spoke with him after the keynote. "It would be exciting if they were beating Qwen and DeepSeek," he said. "I think they will come out with a model soon. But right now the model that they have should be on par—" he paused, reconsidering, "Qwen is ahead, way ahead of what they are doing in general use cases and reasoning." The online reaction to LlamaCon reflected similar disappointment across developer communities. On Reddit's r/LocalLLaMA, the top post was titled "No new models in LlamaCon announced." Llama went from competitively good Open Source to just so far behind the race that I'm beginning to think Qwen and DeepSeek can't even see it in their rear view mirror anymore," wrote one user. Others debated whether Meta had planned to release a reasoning model but pulled back after seeing Qwen's performance. On Hacker News, a popular forum for developers and tech industry professionals, some criticized the event's focus on API services and partnerships rather than model improvements as "super shallow." And one user on Threads summed up the event simply as "kinda mid." "They wanted to cast a wider net and appeal to enterprises, but I think the technical community was looking for more substantial model improvements." Still, LlamaCon won praise from Wall Street analysts tracking the company's AI strategy. Some developers using Llama models were equally enthusiastic about the technology's benefits. For Yevhenii Petrenko of Tavus, which creates AI-powered conversational videos, Llama's speed was crucial. "We really care about very low latency, like very fast response, and Llama helps us use other LLMs," he told me after the event. Hanzla Ramey, CTO of WriteSea, an AI-powered career services platform that helps job seekers prepare résumés and practice interviews, highlighted Llama's cost-effectiveness: "For us, cost is huge," he told me. "We are a startup, so controlling expenses is really important. Llama 4, Zuckerberg explained, had been designed around Meta's preferred infrastructure — the H100 GPU, which shaped its architecture and scale. But he acknowledged that "a lot of the open source community wants even smaller models." "To be able to basically take whatever intelligence you have from bigger models," he added, "and distill them into whatever form factor you want — to be able to run on your laptop, on your phone, on whatever the thing is…to me, this is one of the most important things," he said. For all the pageantry, LlamaCon wasn't a coronation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Saturday, the famed investor will break his silence with nearly five hours of questions at Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting. The $1 trillion conglomerate, which Buffett still heads at 94, owns many businesses, including auto insurer Geico and the BNSF Railway, and holds billion-dollar stakes in public companies such as Apple and Coca-Cola. More than a dozen of Buffett's close followers told Business Insider the burning questions they want him to answer, from tariff impacts and Berkshire's cash pile to his retirement plans and Apple disposals. Tariffs have reignited investors' fears of inflation and recession, sparking an exodus from US stocks, Treasurys, and the dollar in recent weeks. He also wanted to hear Buffett's views on tariffs from a global perspective. Adam Mead, the author of " The Complete Financial History of Berkshire Hathaway " and a money manager, told BI that Trump's tariffs "might change the calculus" for Berkshire's solar projects, adding they likely source many of their panels and equipment from overseas. Adam Schwartz, the founder and chief investor of Black Bear Value Partners, told BI he hoped Buffett would address tariffs and advise investors on protecting their portfolios. John Longo — a finance professor, investment chief, and the author of "Buffett's Tips: A Guide to Financial Literacy and Life" — told BI he hoped Buffett would say whether he still thinks the US trade deficit is an urgent problem as he argued in a Fortune article in 2003. Buffett nearly doubled Berkshire's pile of cash, Treasury bills, and other liquid assets to a record $334 billion last year, partly by selling a net $134 billion of stocks and halting share buybacks in the second half. His followers want to know what he plans to do with that war chest, which exceeds Coca-Cola's entire market value. He could use the dry powder to make a blockbuster acquisition, scoop up stocks, reinstate share purchases, or even pay a dividend. "Why is he amassing this huge cash position, and where would the stock market need to fall for him to write 'Buy American. Smead was referring to Buffett's famous New York Times op-ed at the height of the financial crisis, in which he urged others to join him in making long-term bets on American businesses. Alex Morris, the author of "Buffett and Munger Unscripted" and the founder of investment research service TSOH, told BI he was "curious" to hear whether Buffett still believes Berkshire should have a minimum of $30 billion in cash reserves, and what "the largest deal they could do today" would be. Buffett's acolytes are also waiting impatiently to learn whether the legendary bargain hunter capitalized on the recent stock plunge. "Has Berkshire been investing its cash after the sharp market decline in April?" asked David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland and longtime Buffett blogger. That raises a roughly "$60 billion question of why not sell the whole position?" Darren Pollock, a portfolio manager at Cheviot Value Management, also queried the remaining Apple stake. "He's Warren Buffett, he obviously has a thoughtful rationale, and I'd love to hear it," Pollock told BI. Buffett often sheds light on Berkshire's myriad subsidiaries during his annual Q&A. He reeled off Geico, the overall insurance division, the BNSF Railway, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and Berkshire's manufacturing and retailing segments. Several followers said they hoped Buffett would compare Geico, the revitalized auto insurer, to its archrival Progressive on profitability, market share, and underwriting expenses. Mead said he wanted to know why Berkshire valued energy giant BHE below $50 billion in a deal last year to buy a minority interest from his late friend Walter Scott's estate, despite valuing it closer to $90 billion when Berkshire purchased non-insurance chief Greg Abel's stake in 2022. "Is BHE really worth that much less today compared to then, or was that a quirk in the purchase agreement with the Scott estate?" Others said they were hungry for insights into how Abel would run the company. Lawrence Cunningham, the author of numerous books about Berkshire and the director of the University of Delaware's Weinberg Center on Corporate Governance, told BI he wanted to hear from Abel, "particularly his vision for Berkshire's future and how he plans to uphold the company's core values and strategic direction." Luke Rahbari, the CEO of Equity Armor Investments, told BI he was eager for Abel to elaborate on how he'll "approach capital allocation, including stock picking and acquisitions, and how might his leadership style differ from Buffett's?" Brett Gardner, an analyst and the author of the recently released "Buffett's Early Investments," told BI he's crossing his fingers that the Berkshire chief will be asked about some of his findings: such as whether an early bet, Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, was an "inspiration for Berkshire," and details on how Buffett analyzed the corporate governance risks attached to buying 5% of Disney in 1966. "Selfishly, I am hoping he gets some questions on my book!" Brian Gongol, a Buffett superfan who's been a shareholder since 2007, told BI his question was inspired by Buffett's oft-repeated advice: "Invest in yourself." "I'd like to know what he thinks was Berkshire's best reinvestment in itself, whether it took place this past year or simply bore fruit in the last year," he said.</p>
