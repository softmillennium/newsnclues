                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new research paper was published in Aging (Aging-US) on April 2, 2025, as the cover of Volume 17, Issue 4, titled "Decreased mitochondrial NAD+ in WRN deficient cells links to dysfunctional proliferation." In this study, the team led by first author Sofie Lautrup and corresponding author Evandro F. Fang, from the University of Oslo and Akershus University Hospital in Norway, discovered that cells from people with Werner syndrome (WS)-a rare genetic disorder that causes premature aging-have low levels of a molecule called NAD+ in their mitochondria. This molecule is essential for energy production, cellular metabolism, and maintaining cell health. The researchers also found a potential way to improve cell function in WS patients, pointing to new directions for treating age-related decline and other premature aging disorders. Werner syndrome leads to signs of aging much earlier than normal, including problems such as cataracts, hair loss, and atherosclerosis by age 20 to 30. The team found that when the WRN gene is missing or damaged, cells cannot maintain healthy NAD+ levels in their mitochondria. As a result, the cells age more quickly and stop growing properly. When the researchers boosted NAD+ levels using nicotinamide riboside (a vitamin B3 compound) the affected stem cells and skin cells from patients showed less aging and improved mitochondrial activity. "Interestingly, only 24 h treatment with 1 mM nicotinamide riboside (NR), an NAD+ precursor, rescued multiple pathways in the WRN−/− cells, including increased expression of genes driving mitochondrial and metabolism-related pathways, as well as proliferation-related pathways." Without WRN, this system becomes unbalanced, which affects how cells function, grow, and respond to stress. Although adding more NAD+ helped some cells look healthier, it could not completely fix the growth problems in other types of lab-grown cells. This suggests that while NAD+ supplementation is beneficial, it cannot fully replace the essential functions of the WRN gene. These findings offer new insights into the biological mechanisms of aging and reinforce the therapeutic potential of targeting NAD+ metabolism in age-related and genetic diseases. Future studies will aim to better understand how subcellular NAD+ regulation interacts with mutations like those seen in WS. Finally, this research supports ongoing efforts to develop NAD+-based treatments that could slow cellular aging and improve quality of life for patients with premature aging conditions. Decreased mitochondrial NAD+ in WRN deficient cells links to dysfunctional proliferation. Explore how the Radian ASAP mass spectrometer is being used to streamline and enhance seized drug screening.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Investigators found larger dementia prevalence estimates in people aged 75 years or older, women, and White individuals, whereas self-reported hearing loss was not associated with dementia risk. “This cohort study suggests that treating hearing loss might delay dementia for a large number of older adults. Public health interventions targeting clinically significant audiometric hearing loss might have broad benefits for dementia prevention,” the investigators wrote. This study was led by Emily Ishak, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York City. It was published online on April 17 in JAMA Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery. This study's generalizability was limited owing to the inclusion of only self-identified Black and White adults. Classifying dementia using hospital and death records may have led to reduced sensitivity toward including milder cases, and a potential survivor bias may have influenced the findings. Additionally, information about appropriate hearing aid use, fit, and compliance was unavailable; and the cumulative effects of hearing loss on the risk for dementia were not assessed. Several investigators reported receiving grants from and having ties with various sources. This article was created using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Even mild COVID-19 cases can trigger lingering symptoms, especially in women and younger adults, while severe cases show a strong link to long-term fatigue, brain fog, and joint pain, setting COVID-19 apart from other respiratory infections. Among symptomatic COVID-19 patients, nearly two-thirds regain their usual health status within one or two months, while others experience protracted recoveries. According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, long COVID is defined as sequelae that persist for at least three months following the initial infection. However, other studies suggest post-acute COVID-19 as symptoms lasting up to 120 days after recovery. Further, while long COVID is more likely in subjects who had the most severe initial disease, individuals with mild initial disease also develop symptoms. Some studies have observed differences in long-term sequelae between COVID-19 and influenza. Moreover, while post-acute COVID-19 has been repeatedly studied, few studies have focused on the nuanced delineations of acute disease severity or compared it to other infectious respiratory diseases. In the present study, researchers examined the risk of post-acute COVID-19 across severity levels of initial illness among US adults. Eligible subjects were aged ≥ 18 years and had clinically diagnosed or lab-confirmed COVID-19 in 2020, with continuous inclusion in the database from January to December 2020, and reported symptoms at diagnosis. Moreover, another cohort was created for subjects diagnosed with pneumonia in 2018. The primary outcome was the presence or absence of symptoms four weeks, three months, and six months after COVID-19 diagnosis. The following symptoms were considered: fatigue, cough, dyspnea, anosmia, ageusia, arrhythmias, brain fog, insomnia, joint pain, general pain, muscle weakness, and headache. Potential predictors of symptoms were gender, ethnicity/race, age, US region, and comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, obesity, dementia, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], chronic renal disease, and ischemic heart disease). The 10-point severity index was modified, and only six levels were considered. These were severity level 3 (symptomatic but ambulatory), 4 (symptomatic with emergency department visit), 5 (hospitalized), 6 (hospitalized and required supplemental oxygen), 7 (hospitalized and required mechanical ventilation), and 8 (hospitalized and required mechanical ventilation plus renal dialysis or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). Presence of symptoms by cohort over time. The most common comorbidity across cohorts was hypertension. Notably, the flu cohort had the lowest frequencies of all comorbidities, except for asthma, and the pneumonia cohort exhibited higher frequencies, except for obesity. Interestingly, while racial and ethnic minorities often face higher risks for acute COVID-19, this study observed mild reductions in adjusted post-acute risks among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic individuals within this insured population. An unexpected finding was a regional difference, with patients in the Northeast showing the greatest risk of post-acute symptoms. In the COVID-19 cohort, fatigue, dyspnea, and joint pain were the most common symptoms after four weeks. In the flu cohort, joint pain, fatigue, and cough were the most common after four weeks, while dyspnea, fatigue, and cough were the most common for pneumonia subjects. While symptoms tended to decrease over time, they persisted across all severity levels at three and six months, although the increased odds of having symptoms remained highest for the most severe initial cases (levels 7 and 8) compared to the least severe (level 3). The specific symptoms experienced also varied by age, with younger adults having increased risks for anxiety and headache, while older adults had increased risks for brain fog and fatigue. The presence of a comorbidity increased the odds of post-acute symptoms at all time points. The comorbidities with the highest increase in odds were rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and ischemic heart disease. Further, the odds of any symptom in the flu cohort compared to COVID-19 were 0.77 at four weeks and three months and 0.68 at six months. Conversely, the corresponding odds ratios for pneumonia subjects were 2.24, 2.41, and 2.46, at four weeks, three months, and six months, respectively. Likewise, the odds of any symptom, except for headache and brain fog, were higher for the pneumonia cohort than the COVID-19 cohort at all time points. The findings corroborate prior observations that fatigue, dyspnea, and joint pain are the most common persistent symptoms after acute COVID-19. The highest risk of post-acute symptoms was found in people with rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, or ischemic heart disease. Symptoms observed four weeks after initial COVID-19 were likely to improve later. Although individuals with less severe initial illnesses had a lower risk of persistent symptoms, the paper notes that, because their numbers are significantly larger than those of hospitalized patients, they contribute substantially to the overall population burden of post-acute COVID-19. Overall, COVID-19 symptomatology cannot be perfectly described by pneumonia or influenza symptomatology, and there are differences in symptom prevalence and the time to resolution that better characterize long COVID, indicating that this persistence is unique to COVID-19. The study acknowledges limitations, including its reliance on administrative health claims data from an insured population during the early phase of the pandemic, which may affect generalizability and requires careful interpretation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Staying active during your 40s and 50s could help your brain resist early Alzheimer's changes, especially if you follow WHO activity recommendations, this study finds. Study: Physical activity changes during midlife link to brain integrity and amyloid burden. Their findings indicate that becoming physically active at the levels recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) was associated with reduced amyloid burden in the brain, and both becoming and remaining active, even at less than recommended levels, were linked to greater cortical thickness in areas vulnerable to AD, compared to remaining sedentary. Alzheimer's disease (AD) begins with a long preclinical phase marked by early brain changes, such as neurodegeneration and amyloid-β (Aβ) buildup, which may be detected through biomarkers years before symptoms begin to emerge. Researchers believe that up to one-third of cases are linked to modifiable lifestyle factors, and there is increasing interest in AD prevention through behavioral changes, particularly physical activity. Sedentary behavior is a known risk factor for dementia, while midlife physical activity has been shown to reduce the risk of AD and cognitive decline. This could be through pathways such as improved mental and cardiovascular health. Midlife is a crucial period because age-related brain changes and AD pathologies often begin then, especially in people at genetic or familial risk. While prior studies have shown cross-sectional links between physical activity and reduced AD biomarkers, few have examined how changes in activity levels – especially adherence to WHO recommendations – affect the progression of AD-related changes in at-risk individuals. In this study, researchers assessed a critical research gap by investigating whether increases in physical activity, including adherence to WHO guidelines, are associated with lower Aβ burden and better brain structure in cognitively unimpaired middle-aged adults at risk for AD. They analyzed data from 337 cognitively unimpaired participants in Catalonia from a larger study on preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). Only those with MRI and/or amyloid-PET data at follow-up were included. A continuous measure of activity change was also calculated. Brain amyloid burden was assessed through positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, and cortical thickness in AD-sensitive regions was measured using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The AD-signature region was defined using a composite of medial temporal lobe areas vulnerable to early AD atrophy. Statistical models examined how physical activity group and changes in activity predicted amyloid burden and cortical thickness at follow-up, adjusting for age, sex, education, apolipoprotein E (APOE)-ε4 status, and the time between assessments. It is worth noting that brain imaging outcomes were measured only at follow-up, so causality cannot be firmly established. Participants were categorized into five groups based on adherence to the WHO physical activity guidelines. Nearly 30% remained sedentary, while 15.7% became adherent to their treatment. Those who became adherent showed the greatest increase in physical activity minutes. No significant group differences emerged for age, education, sex, or APOE-ε4 status. Participants who maintained sedentary behavior had significantly lower cortical thickness in Alzheimer's disease (AD)-sensitive brain regions than those who maintained or became adherent, or even those who were non-adherent but not sedentary. Additionally, those who became adherent had a significantly lower amyloid-β (Aβ) burden than those who became non-adherent, a finding that remained statistically significant even after correction for multiple comparisons. The difference in amyloid burden between those who became adherent and those who remained sedentary was also present but less robust. A dose-response association was found, with increased physical activity correlating with a lower Aβ burden; however, this dose-dependent effect was not observed for cortical thickness. These results remained largely robust after adjusting for cardiovascular risk and mental health scores, although some associations with cortical thickness were attenuated after these adjustments. The study reveals that increased or sustained physical activity during midlife is associated with a lower Aβ burden and greater cortical thickness in AD-vulnerable brain regions, underscoring its potential neuroprotective effects. Even partial adherence to activity guidelines (i.e., non-adherent but not sedentary) appeared beneficial. A dose-dependent relationship between increased activity and reduced Aβ supports this link. Strengths of this analysis include longitudinal design, biomarker data, and adjustment for confounders. Potential unmeasured mediators, such as sleep or neurogenesis, were also not assessed. Overall, the findings suggest that adopting the WHO-recommended physical activity during midlife may enhance resilience against early AD pathology, even in individuals at risk.

Pulmonary rehabilitation is an exercise and educational program supervised by a health care professional, which helps people with chronic breathing difficulties. Pulmonary rehabilitation programs are traditionally held in person; however, virtual or online programs are also available. In this new report, the authors examined the feasibility, safety and effectiveness of a virtual pulmonary rehabilitation program for people with COPD who did and did not require supplemental oxygen. Virtual pulmonary rehabilitation allows for increased access to these programs, which benefit people with COPD, regardless of their supplemental oxygen use. Our findings demonstrate the need to increase use of virtual pulmonary rehabilitation programs to help improve the quality of life for people with COPD.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, most other birth outcomes and health disparities showed no significant change due to the limited data available. Study: The association of COVID-19 lockdowns with adverse birth and pregnancy outcomes in 28 high-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis. In a recent review published in the journal Nature Human Behaviour, researchers conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on adverse birth and pregnancy outcomes (ABPOs) during the pandemic. The review focused on publications comparing these impacts in high-income countries (HICs) between January 2019 and June 2023, both before and during the pandemic. A random-effects meta-analysis of 132 studies revealed that the first lockdown significantly reduced pre-term birth rates (specifically spontaneous pre-term births) in Europe and Australia, and increased positive depression antenatal screening rates. The analysis also identified an 18% decrease in neonatal mortality associated with lockdown. However, this finding should be interpreted with caution due to the strong influence of a single extensive study and the need for further time-adjusted analysis. While the study also attempted to elucidate inequalities between regions, ethnic groups, and deprivation levels, insufficient data prevented these analyses and underscored the need for further research on the topic. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic prompted several governments to impose social distancing measures, known as ‘lockdowns', to mitigate disease transmission and curb infection rates. Research during these non-pharmaceutical interventions suggests that these lockdowns may have inadvertently triggered alterations in adverse birth and pregnancy outcomes (ABPOs), specifically, exacerbated stillbirth rates in low- to middle-income countries (LMICs) and reductions in pre-term birth (PTB) rates in high-income countries (HICs). Previous examinations of these trends have highlighted substantial regional differences between LMICs and HICs, which may be attributed to variations in the stringency of national lockdown policies, disparities in healthcare systems, and COVID-19 epidemiology, including infection rates and testing. Even within HICs, healthcare access and socioeconomic disparities between different ethnic groups and deprivation cohorts are expected to have resulted in a spectrum of ABPO outcomes, but prior studies have provided conflicting findings. The present review aims to address these inconsistencies in the literature by collating, synthesizing, and reanalyzing data from publications that evaluate the association between COVID-19 lockdowns and ABPO outcomes. It focuses on HICs and further investigates if variations in continental regions, ethnic groups, time periods (first versus subsequent lockdowns), and deprivation levels altered ABPO outcomes during and shortly after the pandemic. Publications for study inclusion were obtained through a custom search of three online scientific repositories: EMBASE, Web of Science, and MEDLINE/PubMed. Additionally, preprints (MedRxiv) and unpublished reports were manually obtained. HICs derived population (except Sweden, which did not enforce a lockdown). Potential publications were screened via a cascade of title and abstract screening, duplicate removal, and full-text screening. Missing data were obtained through personal emails to study authors or proxy estimates (when authors did not respond). Meta-analyses were conducted for variables of interest with at least three corresponding studies. Outcomes were analyzed using random-effects models adjusted for heterogeneity and continent (region). Subgroup analyses were undertaken where applicable (e.g., for studies reporting outcomes from second or subsequent lockdowns). Studies with overlapping populations, time periods, or outcomes were excluded from the meta-analyses, resulting in a final study dataset of 132. Summary statistics revealed that these studies included participants from 28 countries, with Europe (45%) and North America (41%) comprising the bulk. Cohort studies were the most common (86%), followed by cross-sectional publications (11%). This finding remained robust even after adjusting for long-term trends (11 studies, -3%), but was found to be limited to the first lockdown. Notably, high inter-study heterogeneity and subsequent subgroup analyses revealed that these findings were significant only for European and Australian continental regions and not for North America, Asia, South America, or the Middle East. While 18 studies explicitly tested for low birth weight (LBW), no credible evidence supporting an association was observed. For other outcomes, the overall pooled analyses showed no significant association for caesarean sections or sepsis (based on limited studies). However, substantial regional variations were observed despite no overall association for: Neonatal mortality was associated with an 18% decrease during lockdown (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74–0.91); however, the researchers noted that this pooled estimate requires cautious interpretation and further time-adjusted investigation. The only other significant overall finding was the increase in antenatal depression screening rates, which were observed to rise by 37%. Unfortunately, inequality-based analyses could not be undertaken due to insufficient data availability, characterized by high inter-study heterogeneity and limited data for subgroup analyses. The present meta-analysis revealed a reduction in spontaneous pre-term births (in Europe and Australia) and an increase in positive antenatal screening for depression following the implementation of COVID-19-associated lockdown restrictions. The study also found a decrease in neonatal mortality, though this needs further confirmation, and highlighted significant regional differences in neonatal admissions and maternal readmissions. The authors suggest that COVID-19 lockdowns served as a natural experiment, and the uneven associations observed require further exploration, potentially through mixed-methods research, to understand the underlying health determinants and barriers to care. These findings indicate that broad, umbrella lockdown approaches can have unequal consequences, suggesting that targeted policies and tailored support structures are necessary to better promote maternal and neonatal health.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hypertension is a major public health concern, affecting millions worldwide and increasing the risk of heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. It is typically characterized by persistent high blood pressure, which can result from multiple mechanisms, including increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), inflammation, and oxidative stress. Although pharmaceutical treatments are available, they often come with side effects, making the search for natural, side-effect-free alternatives increasingly important. Egg whites, known for their high-quality protein content, also contain various bioactive peptides with proven antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antihypertensive properties. Recent studies have shown that egg white proteins, even after depleting ovotransferrin, can still provide effective antihypertensive peptides. A study (DOI:10.48130/fmr-0024-0026) published in Food Materials Research on 30 December 2024 by Jianping Wu's team, University of Alberta, highlights the potential of egg white proteins as a valuable functional food ingredient for addressing high blood pressure. In this study, the antihypertensive effects of ovotransferrin-depleted egg white hydrolysate (OD-EWH) were evaluated in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), with egg white hydrolysate (EWH) serving as the reference. The rats were administered 1 g/kg body weight per day of either hydrolysate for 9 days. The results showed that both OD-EWH and EWH significantly reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP), with OD-EWH lowering SBP to 160.47 mmHg and EWH reducing it to 159.42 mmHg, compared to the untreated group (178.07 mmHg). Further analysis revealed that both hydrolysates upregulated the expression of ACE2, an important enzyme in regulating vascular health, in the aorta. While EWH also decreased ACE and AT1R levels, OD-EWH had no significant effect on these proteins but increased the AT2R level. In the kidneys, both OD-EWH and EWH reduced renal ACE levels, but did not affect ACE2, MasR, or AT1R/AT2R expression. Additionally, OD-EWH significantly enhanced the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in the aorta, suggesting a mechanism for blood pressure reduction through improved nitric oxide production. Both hydrolysates also attenuated vascular oxidative stress, as indicated by reduced nitrotyrosine staining. These findings suggest that OD-EWH may reduce blood pressure through the modulation of the renin-angiotensin system, eNOS activation, and antioxidant effects, making it a promising functional food ingredient for hypertension management. By modulating the RAS, enhancing eNOS expression, and reducing oxidative stress, OD-EWH offers a promising approach for managing high blood pressure. This research highlights the importance of natural, cost-effective food-based solutions in combating hypertension and opens the door for further innovations in functional food development aimed at improving cardiovascular health. Ovotransferrin-depleted egg white hydrolysate reduces blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study shows that even a moderate dose of caffeine alters brain activity during sleep, increasing complexity and nudging neural systems toward a high-efficiency processing state, especially in young adults during deep sleep. Left column shows statistical differences (blue: reduced during caffeine, red: increased during caffeine), while SVM/LDA columns show classification accuracy between conditions (green). Study: Caffeine induces age-dependent increases in brain complexity and criticality during sleep. Caffeine ingestion leads to a reduction in long-range temporal correlations and also causes an increase in brain complexity, especially during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. A recent study in Communications Biology assessed sleep electroencephalography (EEG) reports to understand the effects of caffeine on the brain, particularly during sleep. On the contrary, research has demonstrated caffeine's neuroprotective qualities, particularly against Parkinson's disease (PD). Therefore, the impact of caffeine on health is complex. It also leads to other health issues such as weight gain, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and depression. Despite encouraging progress in research, existing knowledge on the mechanisms by which caffeine alters brain dynamics during sleep is in its early stages. There are not only direct effects through adenosine signaling, but also a host of downstream effects on other neurotransmitter systems, as well as complex interactions that drive the diverse effects of caffeine on brain function and sleep architecture. Additionally, these complex interactions may affect the balance between neural excitation and inhibition, which plays a key role in how the brain processes information during different sleep stages. This study conducts an in-depth assessment of caffeine's effects on the brain's electrophysiological signals while sleeping. The specific focus was on brain complexity and criticality. Periodic and aperiodic components in the EEG spectra were disentangled, thereby improving upon existing power spectral investigations. A previous study has shown that caffeine increases brain entropy during wakefulness. However, whether similar effects extend to sleep EEG signals is still unknown. This study also assessed whether caffeine-induced changes in slow-wave sleep (SWS) and increased lighter sleep stages (e.g., N1 and N2) resulted in an increase in EEG complexity during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. The authors note that some of the observed increases in brain complexity may be partly due to caffeine shifting the proportion of lighter NREM stages, making it difficult to disentangle direct effects on brain dynamics from indirect effects via changes in sleep architecture. Additionally, it explored age heterogeneity in how caffeine impacts the brain, given that adenosine receptor density decreases with aging, which reduces the time spent in deep sleep. Sleep EEG data were collected from 40 healthy participants under caffeine (200 mg) and placebo conditions during two non-consecutive nights. Entropy measures, complexity metrics, and power spectral density (PSD) were extracted from the EEG. Across parietal and frontal channels, a widespread increase in beta power was noted, which could be attributed to elevated GABA levels. During REM sleep, theta power was lowered in the occipital, parietal, and temporal channels. The study emphasizes that correcting for the aperiodic component reveals caffeine's effects on rhythmic brain activity that might otherwise be missed, highlighting the importance of separating these components in EEG analysis. All EEG complexity measures exhibited a consistent increase under caffeine. Although the caffeine-induced alterations in brain signals were widespread and prominent during NREM sleep, a weaker effect that was limited to the occipital regions was observed during REM sleep. The most accurate association between caffeine and placebo sleep EEG was obtained via Spectral Sample Entropy as a feature in NREM sleep. The random forest (RF) classifier, trained on all extracted features, achieved significantly higher decoding accuracy in NREM sleep than REM sleep. The complexity and criticality-related measures performed considerably better than the spectral features for classifying caffeine and placebo samples during NREM. The distribution of features ranked by importance during REM was found to be more heterogeneous and less structured. Caffeine exerted significant effects during NREM sleep on several EEG features in both young (20–27 years) and middle-aged (41–58 years) adults. The younger age group exhibited more prominent effects. However, caffeine-induced changes in REM sleep were only significant in the younger age group, affecting specific features, including sample entropy (SampEn), spectral entropy (SpecEn), Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZc), and the DFA scaling exponent. The study found no significant age differences in the impact of caffeine during NREM sleep, but clear age-related differences were seen in REM, suggesting that age-related changes in adenosine receptor density may diminish caffeine's effect on REM sleep in middle-aged adults. The authors also discuss that the observed shift in brain activity patterns reflects a movement toward a theoretical “critical regime” or “edge of chaos,” where the brain is thought to be most sensitive, adaptable, and efficient at processing information. This study demonstrated that caffeine intake resulted in a significant increase in EEG complexity, particularly during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Caffeine also affects the brain, allowing it to process information most efficiently. Compared to the middle-aged group, younger adults exhibited a significantly increased brain entropy response to caffeine during REM sleep. The effects were more widely distributed in NREM compared to REM sleep. However, the authors caution that these findings are based on healthy adults, and that caffeine's effects may differ in individuals with sleep disorders or neurodegenerative conditions. Results should also be interpreted in the context of both direct and indirect changes to sleep architecture.
