                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The White House unveiled a budget blueprint Friday that would pump more money into defense and homeland security, while taking an ax to programs the Trump administration has already targeted, including education, foreign aid, environment, health and public assistance programs. The proposal outlines President Donald Trump's vision and provides recommendations to Congress for fiscal year 2026 spending, but lawmakers are not required to follow it. The blueprint released Friday is an outline, otherwise known as a “skinny budget,” with a more comprehensive plan expected to be released in coming weeks. It would also provide a “historic” $175 billion investment to “fully secure the border,” according to an Office of Management and Budget letter sent to Sen. Susan Collins, who chairs the Appropriations Committee, which was obtained by CNN. The administration is pushing to have these increases – which includes $119 billion in defense spending – included in the budget reconciliation bill Congress is currently assembling, which would allow it to be approved without Democratic votes in the Senate. The blueprint also calls for sweeping cuts to a multitude of discretionary programs that the Trump administration has been dismantling since it took office in January. The administration “protected” Transportation, Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs and “numerous other priorities,” a senior administration official told reporters on Friday. The proposal calls for eliminating multiple diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, environmental justice efforts and other “woke” programs, according to the OMB letter. It would also slash nearly $2.5 billion from the Internal Revenue Service, a frequent target of Republicans. The proposal does not make recommendations for so-called mandatory spending programs, including Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps. Several key Republican senators, however, were not impressed with the administration's budget proposal. “Based on my initial review, however, I have serious objections to the proposed freeze in our defense funding given the security challenges we face and to the proposed funding cuts to – and in some cases elimination of – programs like LIHEAP, TRIO, and those that support biomedical research,” Collins said, referring to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program and TRIO educational opportunity outreach program. Sen. Roger Wicker, chair of the Armed Services Committee, said that OMB's request equals a fifth straight year of Biden administration-level funding for defense, which translates into a cut in military spending after taking inflation into account. “President Trump successfully campaigned on a Peace Through Strength agenda, but his advisers at the Office of Management and Budget were apparently not listening,” the Mississippi Republican said in a statement. “This budget proposal would set our country back decades by decimating investments to help families afford the basics, to keep communities safe, and to ensure America remains the world leader in innovation and lifesaving research,” Sen. Patty Murray, vice chair of the Appropriations Committee, said in a statement. Without those rescissions factored in, the proposed budget is $28 billion lower than last fiscal year. The proposal highlights a more than $1.5 billion cut in peacekeeping operations, which the administration argued are “wasteful,” a $3 billion reduction for disaster assistance, and a $1.6 billion cut in the Food for Peace program. It reduces the State Department and USAID operations budget by $2 billion. The budget proposes cutting $15 billion in programs from a bipartisan law passed in 2021, including gutting funding from a program that would install EV chargers on highways. It also proposes cutting $2 billion in funding from the Energy Department office promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy, as well as cutting $80 million from a program at the Interior Department that put wind and solar on public lands. The budget proposes cutting over $400 million from Department of Energy's Office of Nuclear Energy, saying it wants to stop funding “non-essential research.” The budget for the DOE also proposes cutting $389 million from a program that cleans up and stores nuclear waste at several different locations around the country. The budget would maintain current funding levels for cleaning up the Hanford nuclear waste facility in Washington state, but “reduces funding for various cleanup activities at other sites,” although it doesn't specify where. The budget proposes cutting the National Park Service operating budget by $900 million, and cutting its construction, historic preservation, and national recreation funds collectively by hundreds of millions more. It proposes recategorizing smaller and lesser-known national park sites as state-level parks, saying these sites “receive small numbers of mostly local visitors.” The budget would slash Earth science research at NASA, including eliminating what it says are “low-priority climate monitoring satellites.” It would also cut funding for climate research at the National Science Foundation and make sweeping reductions to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's climate monitoring and research functions. At NOAA this would include focusing next-generation satellites more on weather than climate. The budget also proposes cutting $235 million from EPA's climate and environmental justice research. The budget proposes a large reduction in funding to the National Science Foundation, which would see a 56% reduction from fiscal year 2025 enacted levels. That includes climate and clean energy research funding but also what the proposal describes as “woke social, behavioral, and economic sciences; and programs in low priority areas of science.” It would also end funding to programs categorized as DEI-related. The budget includes sweeping cuts to federal programs that providing housing assistance. The Trump administration has proposed saving more than $26 billion by eliminating the Department of Housing and Urban Development's rental assistance program, including Section 8 vouchers, and replacing it with a plan to allow states to design their own rental assistance programs “based on their unique needs and preferences.” The plan would also include a two-year cap on rental assistance for able-bodied adults. More than 2.3 million low-income families use the Section 8 housing voucher program, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. It also includes cuts to organizations and non-profits that work on fair housing issues. Giving states and local governments control of rental assistance programs could lead to less funding for low-income Americans in the long-term, said Deborah Thrope, the deputy director of the National Housing Law Project. It comes at a time when buying and renting homes has become increasingly unaffordable. The president repeatedly proposed steep cuts to HUD's budget during his first term, though they never successfully passed Congress. The budget for those projects would be reduced to $300 million, from $1.3 billion in 2023. The proposal echoes an internal document reviewed by CNN last month, which would reorganize the NIH's 27 research institutes into eight new entities. The reorganization “would align with the President's priorities to address chronic disease and other epidemics,” and eliminate research on climate change, gender ideology, and “divisive racialism,” according to the budget document. It said the program is unnecessary because states have policies preventing utility disconnections for low-income residents, which means LIHEAP mainly benefits utilities. (Most states have temporary winter shut-off protections and some have temporary summer rules, but all require households to pay off their bills when the protection period ends, according to the National National Energy Assistance Directors Association.) The proposal would slice $12 million from the Department of Education, or 15% of its budget, and would eliminate many K-12 and higher education programs. It would also consolidate 18 grant programs into a new $2 billion formula grant designed to reduce federal influence on schools and students, as well as bureaucracy. And it would consolidate seven programs for students with disabilities, and cut $64 million in funding for Howard University, the nation's only federally chartered historically Black university. The budget would also eliminate the $1.6 billion Job Corps program, which it called a failed experiment to help America's youth and said was “plagued” by violence, assault, sex crimes, drugs and death. It would also cut the Senior Community Service Employment Program, which provides community service and work-based job training for low-income, older Americans. The administration said it fails at its goal of moving seniors to unsubsidized employment. The budget would increase spending on veterans' medical care – both at VA medical centers and by community providers – by $3.3 billion. This amount includes a $1.1 billion increase for ending veterans' homelessness. This new $2.9 billion fund would focus on investments that support some of the nation's key partners, such as India and Jordan. It would also support repatriation, counter China and fund new activities to strengthen America's national security. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. would receive $500 million for his signature “Make America Healthy Again” initiative. That funding would go to nutrition policy, research on physical activity, technology usage, environmental exposures and “over-reliance on medication and treatments,” per the proposal. The budget includes a request for $13.8 billion for Federal Aviation Administration operations to support hiring air traffic controllers and increasing their salaries, as well as updating the agency's telecommunications systems. Also, it would provide $5 billion for the modernization of FAA systems and facilities that comprise the US National Airspace System, including radar replacement. The administration would also increase rail safety and infrastructure grant funding by $400 million, a 400% increase over the fiscal year 2025 level. Human space exploration would receive a boost of $647 million. A total of more than $7 billion would be allocated for exploring the moon, plus $1 billion would be invested in new Mars-focused programs, which is an area of interest for Musk.</p>

Fox News correspondent Mark Meredith reports on the National Transportation Safety Board's investigation on ‘Special Report' after multiple aviation disasters mark the first months of 2025. Two planes had to perform "go-arounds" to avoid crashing into a military helicopter on Thursday at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA), where a commercial plane and a Black Hawk Army helicopter crashed in January, killing 67 people. At about 2:30 p.m., air traffic control instructed Delta Air Lines Flight 1671 and Republic Airways Flight 5825 to perform "go-arounds" at DCA due to a Priority Air Transport helicopter inbound to the Pentagon Army Heliport, according to a statement from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). A Department of Defense official in an email to Fox News Digital said they are "aware of reports" about the incident. A plane flies near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, in the aftermath of the collision of American Eagle flight 5342 and a Black Hawk helicopter that crashed into the Potomac River, in Arlington, Virginia, U.S., January 30, 2025.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Economic developments: China said it is weighing proposals by the US to begin trade talks. It comes as an exemption allowing lower-cost Chinese goods to be shipped duty-free into the US has expired. President Donald Trump is also calling on the Fed to lower interest rates after a better-than-expected jobs report. • Budget proposal: The White House released a budget blueprint that would amp up defense spending while slashing programs focused on education, foreign aid, environment, health and public assistance. • Cabinet shakeup: Secretary of State Marco Rubio will temporarily replace national security adviser Mike Waltz after Trump removed Waltz and announced his nomination as UN ambassador. • Harvard funding showdown: Trump said Harvard University will be stripped of its tax-exempt status, as a clash is underway over free speech, political ideology and federal funding at the school. In a letter made public today, a trade group representing Nike, Steve Madden, Under Armour, Crocs and dozens of other brands urged the Trump administration to provide exemptions from so-called reciprocal tariffs. “American footwear businesses and families face an existential threat from such substantial cost increases,” reads the letter from the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, which was dated Tuesday. Many orders have been placed on hold, and footwear inventory for U.S. consumers may soon run low.” “This is an emergency that requires immediate action and attention,” the letter said. Many companies will now have to pay a tariff of between 150% and almost 200%, the industry group said. “Many companies making affordable footwear for hardworking lower and middle-income families cannot absorb tariff rates this high, nor can they pass along these costs,” the letter states. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio harshly criticized Germany after its domestic intelligence agency labeled the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) an extremist entity that threatens democracy and called on the country to reverse course on its own domestic matter. “Germany just gave its spy agency new powers to surveil the opposition. More context: The tweet comes in response to Germany's domestic intelligence agency's finding, based on a 1,100 page expert report, that AfD is racist and anti-Muslim. The classification of the party as an extremist entity allows authorities to increase their surveillance, including by recruiting confidential informants and intercepting communications. Both Vice President JD Vance and Elon Musk have voiced support for AfD. President Donald Trump will be hosting a military parade celebrating the Army's 250th birthday on June 14, which is also his birthday, the White House said today. “To celebrate the U.S. Army's 250th Birthday on June 14, President Trump will honor American Veterans, active-duty servicemembers, and military history with a military parade!” Anna Kelly, White House deputy press secretary, wrote on X, linking to a Fox News story about the parade. Detailed Army plans for the parade call for more than 6,600 soldiers, at least 150 vehicles, 50 helicopters, seven bands and possibly a couple thousand civilians, The Associated Press reported yesterday. High costs halted Trump's push for a parade in his first term, and the tanks and other heavy vehicles that are part of the Army's latest plans have raised concerns from city officials about damage to roads. The White House released a budget blueprint today that would pump more money into defense and homeland security, while taking an ax to programs that the Trump administration has already targeted — including education, foreign aid, environment, health and public assistance programs. The proposal outlines President Donald Trump's vision and provides recommendations to Congress for fiscal year 2026 spending, but lawmakers are not required to follow it. The blueprint is an outline, otherwise known as a “skinny budget,” with a more comprehensive plan expected to be released in coming weeks. The United States designated both a Haitian gang and a coalition of gangs in the country as terrorist organizations today, as Secretary of State Marco Rubio argued they are “a direct threat to US national security interests in the region.” Rubio designated Viv Ansanm, an alliance of gangs on the island nation, and Gran Grif as both foreign terrorist organizations and specially designated global terrorists. The top US diplomat warned that both Haitians and US citizens could face counterterrorism sanctions for “engaging in transactions with members of these groups.” The terrorism designations factor in to President Donald Trump's broader effort to socialize the idea that the US is at war with transnational gangs, which he has used to justify elements of his sweeping immigration crackdown. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney told reporters today that he will meet with President Donald Trump in Washington, DC, on Tuesday, May 6. “So [the meeting will be about] addressing both sets of issues. Asked how he might avoid the same kind of public argument that occurred between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office earlier this year, Carney said he's going into the meeting expecting a “difficult, but constructive” conversation. On Tuesday, Carney said his country would “never” yield to the United States as he declared victory in federal elections, following a campaign overshadowed by relentless provocations and steep trade tariffs imposed by Trump. Democrats are launching a new effort to pressure Republican lawmakers to oppose President Donald Trump's tax and spending cuts package, specifically targeting four Republican lawmakers in some of the most competitive House districts in the country. Bacon, Fitzpatrick and Lawler won districts carried by former Vice President Kamala Harris in last year's election. Democrats have zeroed in on Medicaid as a key messaging issue against Republicans, arguing any cuts to the program would be detrimental to millions of low-income people across the country. That is an increase from current levels of approximately $893 billion. “I'll be supporting a record setting $1 trillion investment in our national defense,” he said at the Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Michigan on Tuesday. “We're going to go $1 trillion, the largest in the world, largest ever in our country, but no other country has invested that much. President Donald Trump once again called on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates after a better-than-expected April jobs report was released this morning. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said that “… employment (is) strong, and much more good news, as Billions of Dollars pour in from Tariffs. …  Consumers have been waiting for years to see pricing come down. That's a slower pace of price hikes than February's 2.7% increase. The White House plans to unveil its budget proposal today, targeting education, foreign aid, environmental, health care and other non-defense discretionary spending with $163 billion in cuts, two administration officials told CNN. The proposal — referred to internally as a “skinny budget” because it is an outline, rather than a comprehensive plan — calls for $557 billion in non-defense discretionary spending, one of the officials said. The official said agencies that would face steep cuts include: The budget proposal is essentially a statement of President Donald Trump's priorities to Congress, which must hammer out the details and pass them into law. In his first months in office, Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk have sought to dramatically slash the federal government, laying off federal workers and eliminating functions that don't align with the administration's political views. A busy news week continued heading into this morning as President Donald Trump's sweeping tax and spending cuts package picks up steam in Congress and his administration continues to target migrants. Here's more of the latest news as you get your day started: Rubio's rise: Secretary of State Marco Rubio has ascended as one of Trump's most trusted hands after moving in as interim national security adviser following widespread reports that Trump planned on ousting Mike Waltz from the position. Trump's tax and spending cuts package: House Republicans are starting to put some meat on the bones of their sweeping tax and spending cuts package, or what Trump calls his “big, beautiful bill.” It aims to extend the GOP's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as well as fulfill several of Trump's campaign promises, such as ending taxes on tips. Relabeling cartel and gang members: The Trump administration is considering labeling some suspected cartel and gang members inside the US as “enemy combatants” as a possible way to detain them more easily and limit their ability to challenge their imprisonment. Veterans Day: Trump said he wants to rename Veterans Day, a federal holiday on November 11, to “Victory Day for World War I” in a move to purportedly “start celebrating our victories again.” He also said he wants to celebrate May 8, which is not a federal holiday, as “Victory Day for World War II.” Federal workers: Many federal workers who are used to relative job security are now beset by low morale and deep uncertainty and have decided to quit their jobs. Many of the more than a dozen workers who spoke to CNN describe a culture of fear that now permeates the workforce. Vance on Ukraine war: Vice President JD Vance said the war in Ukraine is “not going to end any time soon” in comments aired on Fox News yesterday evening, just hours after Washington and Kyiv signed a key minerals agreement that has peace in Ukraine among its goals. The US economy added a surprisingly strong 177,000 jobs in April, a slight slowdown from March's downwardly revised 185,000 gains, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Economists were expecting the economy to have added 135,000 jobs last month and that the unemployment rate held at 4.2%, according to FactSet consensus estimates. Radio Free Asia is laying off most of its staff and shutting down many of its news broadcasts and streams, amid a funding battle with the Trump administration. “Every day that we're not broadcasting is a day that will allow adversaries to spread propaganda unchecked,” Voice of America journalist Patsy Widakuswara, the lead plaintiff in one of the cases, told CNN. Half a dozen lawsuits have been filed to reverse the moves. Vast flows of trade between the world's two largest economies are at stake after President Donald Trump hiked tariffs on China this month, making it difficult for some Chinese businesses to continue trading with the US. In response, Beijing has also slapped massive tariffs on American imports. A major shipping loophole expired at one minute past midnight. The de minimis exemption allowed shipments of goods worth $800 or less to come into the US duty-free, often more or less skipping time-consuming inspections and paperwork. A baseline tariff as high as 145%, depending on the carrier, is set to take effect on Chinese imports, potentially more than doubling the cost of all those cheap products that deal-hungry Americans have scooped up. Inching toward trade deals: China says it is “currently assessing” proposals by the US to begin trade talks, in a tone shift that could open the door for negotiations. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Beijing was eager to talk. But Financial Times reported that Šefčovič suggested the Trump administration would need to abandon its 10% across-the-board tariffs on European goods as a precursor to any trade arrangement. Most of Apple's iPhone supply chain is based in China. Apple has shifted some iPhone production to India, and Cook said he expects “the majority of iPhones sold in the US will have India as their country of origin.” President Donald Trump said the administration will be stripping Harvard University of its tax-exempt status. In an early Truth Social post, Trump wrote, “It's what they deserve!” Last month, Trump threatened to strip Harvard of its tax-exempt status, and CNN reported that the Internal Revenue Service was making plans to do so. Earlier this week, Harvard announced it is renaming its “Office for Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging” to “Community and Campus Life.” The university also said it would no longer host or fund affinity group celebrations during commencement, according to The Harvard Crimson. President Donald Trump signed an executive order yesterday directing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to end federal funding for America's two biggest public broadcasters, which have faced a series of attacks from the White House and Republican lawmakers accusing them of biased reporting. It also orders the board to take steps to “minimize or eliminate” indirect funding from other public radio and TV stations that may support NPR or PBS. CPB filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration this week after three of its five board members were terminated by email on Monday. Each year, the CPB disperses $535 million in taxpayer funds to public radio and TV stations. Congress specifically set up the corporation as a private entity “to afford maximum protection from extraneous interference and control,” according to a law passed in 1967. President Donald Trump said yesterday that he would nominate Mike Waltz to serve as United Nations ambassador, shifting from his role as national security adviser. A White House official later told CNN Trump informed Waltz of the changes this morning.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Idaho State Police say seven people died when a pickup truck and a tour van collided in eastern Idaho Thursday evening near Yellowstone National Park. Both vehicles caught fire after the crash, which remains under investigation. BOISE, Idaho (AP) — A pickup truck and a tour van collided on a highway leading to Yellowstone National Park, leaving seven people dead and eight others injured, Idaho State Police said. The crash happened just before 7:15 p.m. Thursday near Henry's Lake State Park in eastern Idaho, police said in a press release. Authorities have not said what led up to the crash. Both vehicles caught fire, the Idaho State Police said in a press release. The van was carrying a tour group of 14 people, and the surviving occupants were taken to hospitals with injuries, police spokesman Aaron Snell said. Air ambulances and emergency paramedics responded to the collision, which remains under investigation. The Fremont County coroner's office had not released the names of those killed as of Friday morning. The Idaho State Police said officials were still working on notifying family members of those killed and injured, so the agency was not yet releasing the names, ages, hometowns or nationalities of the people involved. Rescue workers arrive to the scene after a deadly collision between a pickup truck and tour van near Henry's Lake State Park in eastern Idaho on Thursday, May 1, 2025. Merrill said he often sees tourist vans on the highway that leads to Yellowstone National Park. “It is a very dangerous highway because it leads to the main entrance of Yellowstone National Park,” he said. Due to the remote location, Merrill said he anxiously awaited the help of first responders. “It took an unnervingly long time for help to arrive just because of the location,” he said. That portion of the highway had an average of about 10,500 vehicles traveling it daily in 2023, according to the agency. Dupuy reported from New York City.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The attorneys for Babbitt's family said they reached an agreement in principle on Friday, according to various reports. Details about the settlement in principle were not disclosed. Babbitt was shot and killed by Capitol Police during the riot after she allegedly tried to make her way through a smashed window in the building near the speaker's lobby. Her family alleged she posed no threat and sued the government for $30 million. [Michael] Byrd, who is a [Capitol Police] commander and was the incident commander for the House on January 6, 2021, shot Ashli on sight as she raised herself up into the opening of the right door sidelight. Lt. Byrd later confessed that he shot Ashli before seeing her hands or assessing her intentions or even identifying her as female,” lawyers for Babbitt said in the initial lawsuit filing. Her hands were up in the air, empty, and in plain view of Lt. Byrd and other officers in the lobby. Babbitt unlawfully entered the Capitol. Although officers had barricaded the Speaker's Lobby doors with heavy furniture, demonstrators broke through the glass panels of the lobby doors and matching windows (called “sidelights”) on either side of the doors,” the filing said. “Michael Byrd, a U.S. Capitol Police lieutenant, was positioned on the other side of the lobby doors. When Ms. Babbitt, wearing a backpack, tried to climb through a sidelight into the Speaker's Lobby, Lt. Byrd fatally shot her,” the filing added. The initial trial date was set for July, 2026. The riot, which occurred in the waning days of President Donald Trump's first term, returned to the headlines early in his second term when he issued blanket pardons and commutations of criminal sentences to rioters.</p>

Passing MAGA Republican priorities in reconciliation with Republican votes — ending Democrats's leverage against the President in appropriations to fund the Left's wasteful, woke and weaponized bureaucracy. The president is seeking to decrease non-defense discretionary spending and boost funding for defense. President Donald Trump delivers a speech marking his 100th day in office at the Macomb County Community College Sports Expo Center in Warren, Mich., April 29, 2025 (Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images) Trump "is proposing base non-defense discretionary budget authority (of) $163 billion, 22.6 percent below current-year spending, while still protecting funding for homeland security, veterans, seniors, law enforcement, and infrastructure," Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought indicated in a message to Senate Committee on Appropriations Chair Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. "For Defense spending, the President proposes an increase of 13 percent to $1.01 trillion for FY 2026; for Homeland Security, the Budget commits a historic $175 billion investment to, at long last, fully secure our border.

(Win McNamee/Getty Images) "This budget re-aligns federal spending to the priorities of the people: a secure nation, making America healthy again, a Justice Department combatting crime and not weaponized against the people, and common sense," the congressman declared in a statement. "Combined with our joint efforts to rescind other wasteful spending and deliver a reconciliation bill that will extend and expand the Trump tax cuts while reforming Medicaid and other programs to reduce deficits, we are poised to deliver prosperity, freedom, and strength to the American people," he said. Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., another member of the House Freedom Caucus, referred to Trump's proposal as "a game-changing budget," in a post on X, asserting it "is exactly what Republicans were elected to deliver: securing the homeland, cutting the federal government, and crippling the deep state." Freedom Caucus member Rep. Barry Moore, R-Ala., described the president's budget as "a bold step toward fiscal responsibility." Alex Nitzberg is a writer for Fox News Digital.

EXCLUSIVE: President Donald Trump will host a military parade in June to honor military veterans and active-duty service members and commemorate the U.S. Army's 250th birthday, Fox News Digital has learned. President Donald Trump salutes at a campaign rally March 16, 2024, in Vandalia, Ohio. It will also feature active-duty service members and students at U.S. military academies.

(Nicholas Kamm/AFP via Getty Images) "The president is planning an historic celebration of the Army's 250th birthday that will honor generations of selfless Americans who have risked everything for our freedom," White House Domestic Policy Council Director Vince Haley told Fox News Digital. We owe our freedom to them and to every solider who has given their life for our nation in the 2½ centuries since." The parade comes after Trump, in January, signed an executive order creating "Task Force 250," which is focused on coordinating the plans and activities celebrating the 250th anniversary of American independence. The 250th anniversary of America's founding is July 4, 2026. "As one of the first events of the year-long celebration of our 250th anniversary, this commemorative parade will be a fitting tribute to the service, sacrifice and selflessness of the brave men and women who have worn the uniform and devoted their lives to defending the greatest experiment in liberty known to man," Vance told Fox News Digital. The White House is coordinating closely with the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security, the National Park Service and a number of other agencies to plan "this spectacular event honoring our veterans, active-duty service members and military history," an official told Fox News Digital. "We love our military and take great pride in honoring our warfighters," Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told Fox News Digital. "In celebration of 250 years of the U.S. Army, we will throw the biggest and most beautiful military parade in our nation's history." Meanwhile, the task force is coordinating "the plans and activities of federal agencies for an extraordinary celebration of the 250th Anniversary of American Independence." "We love our military and take great pride in honoring our warfighters," Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told Fox News Digital. The celebration "emphasized national renewal of our founding ideals after a period of national unrest and division," the White House told Fox News Digital. The executive order that established the task force also reinstated executive orders from Trump's first administration, establishing the National Garden of American Heroes, a statuary park memorializing 250 historically significant Americans. The executive order that established the task force also reinstated executive orders from Trump's first administration, establishing the National Garden of American Heroes, a statuary park memorializing 250 historically significant Americans, and commissioning artists for the first 100 statues. The National Garden of American Heroes honors "American heroism" after dozens of monuments to Americans, including presidents and Founding Fathers, were toppled or destroyed and never restored. The order also reinstated an order to protect American monuments, memorials and statues from destruction or vandalism. The White House said America's 250th anniversary will "afford an opportunity to unite the American people around their shared history and common future as a nation." During Trump's first term, he held a unique "Salute To America" event on the Fourth of July in 2019, which was different from typical Independence Day celebrations put on by past presidents. The event included a prominent display of military hardware with tanks parked near the National Mall and military flyovers by an array of aircraft.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He is now President Donald Trump‘s go-to Mr. Fixit, who in the first hundred days of this administration has revealed himself as perhaps most competent member of the cabinet and its smoothest communicator. On Friday he became the most powerful Secretary of State since Henry Kissinger in 1972 by being appointed national security advisor in addition. But back in 2015 and 2016 , the insurgent populist intent on smashing the establishment Republican Party had this to say, “When they put Marco on to refute [former President Barack Obama's] speech, do you remember that catastrophe?… And he's like this, ‘And we will — I need water. Trump then held a bottle of water aloft and announced, “It's Rubio!” before splashing some on the stage. Not only did Trump prevail, he savaged Rubio, peppering him with insults and trolling Rubio's water bottle gaffe made during a State of the Union response speech. Trump is singing a different tune today, as he continues to pile new hats onto Rubio and has trusted him to take on a Mr. Fix-it role. But Rubio has got even more hats to wear.” Kevin Wagner, a political professor at Florida Atlantic University, said he's not especially surprised to see Rubio and Trump so close today. Past political rivalries often give way to “strategic alliances.” “Politics typically reflects political pragmatism, especially in areas with shared priorities,” he said. If he'd pursued that path, his life would look much different today. But Trump wasn't having it, saying, “Run Marco!” and encouraging him to stay in the race to keep Florida, then considered a swing state, in the Senate's GOP column. “They always got along well behind the scenes,” said Alex Conant, a GOP strategist and a partner at Firehouse Strategies, which worked on Rubio's 2016 campaign. “There was a lot of mutual respect, and Sen. Rubio worked really closely with the first Trump administration on everything from foreign policy to tax reform and pandemic relief. I'm not surprised that he continues to have a really good working relationship [with Trump].” Though Rubio was seen as a more establishment-type candidate that year, he has become firmly embedded in the Trump-influenced New Right movement, embracing Trump's relatively isolationist foreign policy stance and calling for common-good capitalism rather than unfettered free markets. Politics aside, Rubio is held in high esteem by his former colleagues. He was confirmed 99-0 for secretary of state in the Senate, while some of Trump's other Cabinet nominees barely scraped by or were rejected altogether. Rubio has also impressed Trump, wearing so many hats at once that he's become the subject of memes online. Conservative commentator and rumored Kentucky Senate candidate Scott Jennings says Rubio has earned his accolades. “If you talk to people from the White House … they believe Rubio has done a terrific job,” he said on CNN. “He has been a consistent spokesperson for the president's priorities. He did a great job on the El Salvador issue. He did a great job on the student visa issue. It's obvious they have a lot of confidence in him.” Whether that confidence means the Trump administration can overcome its many foreign policy challenges, including a tariff standoff with China, ending the war in Ukraine, and negotiating nuclear talks with Iran, remains to be seen. “While [Rubio's collection of job titles is] not unprecedented, it is unusual and could strain institutional norms,” said Wagner, the FAU professor. “Concentrated responsibility raises questions about the ability of one person to maintain oversight, accountability, and sufficient bandwidth. In the end, Rubio's stylistic contrast with Trump, his relatively straightforward and understated style, may be why the pair complement each other so well, according to University of Central Florida political professor James C. Clark. “In the Senate, his passions were foreign affairs and intelligence. Whether you agree with him or not, he has done his homework and is prepared. He is willing to let others have the limelight.”</p>

President Donald Trump gives a commencement address at the University of Alabama, Thursday, May 1, 2025, in Tuscaloosa, Ala.(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) WASHINGTON (AP) — Two major scientific societies on Friday said they will fill the void from the Trump administration's dismissal of scientists writing a cornerstone federal report on what climate change is doing to the United States. The American Meteorological Society and the American Geophysical Union said they will work together to produce peer-reviewed research documents assessing the current and future national impacts of climate change because a science-based report required by law is suddenly in question and being reassessed by President Donald Trump's White House. Earlier this week, Trump's Republican administration told about 400 scientists working on the National Climate Assessment that they were no longer needed and that the report was being reevaluated. That report, coming once every four to five years, is required by a 1990 federal law and was due out around 2027. Preliminary budget documents show slashing funding or eliminating offices involved in coordinating that report, scientists and activists said. Meteorological society past president Anjuli Bamzi, a retired federal atmospheric scientist who has worked on previous National Climate Assessments, said one of the most important parts of the federal report is that it projects 25 and 100 years into the future. Texas Tech University climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe, also chief scientist at The Nature Conservancy, said the two organizations joining to do this report “is a testament to how important it is that the latest science be summarized and available.” Hayhoe, who was a lead author of reports in 2009, 2018 and 2023, said “people are not aware of how climate change is impacting the decisions that they are making today, whether it's the size of the storm sewer pipes they're installing, whether it is the expansion of the flood zone where people are building, whether it is the increases in extreme heat.” The national assessment, unlike global United Nations documents, highlights what's happening to weather not just in the nation but at regional and local levels. In 2018, during Trump's first term, the assessment was just as blunt, saying: “Climate change creates new risks and exacerbates existing vulnerabilities in communities across the United States, presenting growing challenges to human health and safety, quality of life, and the rate of economic growth.” But University of Illinois climate scientist Donald Wuebbles, who led one of 2018's two national reports, said he worries about what kind of document this new administration will try to issue, if any. “We know this is an extremely important problem. Storms and wildfires don't care if it's a red state or a blue state, Hayhoe said.

Last month, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., blocked key parts of President Donald Trump's executive order on election integrity – a move that underscores how deeply divided the country remains over what "election integrity" really means.. Though the executive order Trump signed was titled, "Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections," the Democratic National Party (DNC), which led a group of plaintiffs in challenging the order in federal court, argued that it was an attempt to encroach on elections and disenfranchise voters. In the end, both sides won out – sort of, and at least for now. Here's what to know about the case in question: President-elect Trump dancing at AmericaFest in Arizona following the election. U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly ultimately left in place three key parts of Trump's executive order, including a provision requiring states not to count mail-in ballots received after Election Day, in a partial victory for the Trump administration. But she sided with Democratic plaintiffs in blocking, for now, both a new proof-of-citizenship requirement for federal voter registration forms and a provision directing election officials to verify the citizenship of would-be voters.

(AP Photo/Chris Pizzello) That's exactly the problem modern presidents face when trying to make lasting policy changes through executive orders – a tactic increasingly favored by both Democrats and Republicans. It's a risky way to govern for two reasons. They also risk being halted in federal courts, where U.S. judges are explicitly tasked with serving as a check on the president, and are free to pause or halt such orders from taking force, should they determine they are outside the scope of the executive branch's authorities. That also doesn't mean that district courts need to have the final say on the matter. The E. Barrett Prettyman United States Court House is seen early in the morning on Dec. 10, 2024, in Washington, D.C.  (David Ake/Getty Images) Kollar-Kotelly stressed last month that voter registration laws and the ability to regulate elections are set by Congress and by individual states, not the executive branch. Both states and Congress can pass laws so long as they do not "needlessly impose" an undue burden on voters under the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. But the executive branch, which does not share in these abilities to make and pass election-related laws, is not entitled to the same standard of legal review, according to the judge. "President Trump will keep fighting for election integrity, despite Democrat objections that reveal their disdain for commonsense safeguards like verifying citizenship," White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in response to the ruling last month. To date, the administration has not appealed the matter, and officials have not said definitively whether they plan to do so.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? That's because the “de minimis” exemption for Chinese imports expired Friday by order of President Donald Trump. Under that exemption, shipments of goods whose total value is less than $800 were exempt from tariffs — a threshold that included for most purchases individual Americans make from China. As of Friday, Chinese imports that would have previously fallen under the de minimis exemption are “subject to a duty rate of either 30% of their value or $25 per item (increasing to $50 per item after June 1, 2025),” according to the White House. Americans will pay the price as retailers pass on increased import costs to consumers. And given how many de minimis shipments arrive in the US every day, that price could be high. Between 2015 and 2024, the volume of de minimis shipments increased from 134 million to nearly 1.4 billion. China accounted for the majority of them by far. In 2023, 62 percent of all de minimis shipments, valued at roughly $33.8 billion, came from China. A few factors might be behind the explosion in de minimis shipments, especially from China. That made it cheaper to import more relatively low-value items. Many of these businesses rely on Chinese suppliers being able to fulfill and send orders to the US cheaply under the de minimis exemption. In anticipation of the exemption ending, Chinese retailers Temu and Shein announced that they are starting to raise prices. Price hikes vary by category of goods, but Bloomberg reported that Shein prices rose by about 10 percent in a two-day span last week. Temu added “import charges” of 145 percent of an item's cost and then announced that it would stop selling goods imported directly from China to US consumers entirely. Some such businesses have had to raise their prices and are now reporting a significant decline in US orders, requiring them to diversify beyond the American market if they can, according to CNBC. But the loss of US customers might also force many small businesses to close entirely. Gold has become a rare safe bet in Trump's economy. Trump's podcasting and new media allies in the “manosphere” don't know what to make of his tariff policy. Everyone likes cheap consumer goods that will get more expensive under Trump's tariffs. Roku, Amazon, and practically every company in the streaming business are inventing new ways to make money off your data.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rescue workers arrive to the scene after a deadly collision between a pickup truck and tour van near Henry's Lake State Park in eastern Idaho on Thursday, May 1, 2025. BOISE, Idaho (AP) — A pickup truck and tour van collision near Yellowstone National Park has killed seven people and injured eight others, Idaho State Police say. The crash happened just before 7:15 p.m. Thursday on a highway near Henry's Lake State Park in eastern Idaho, police said in a press release. Both vehicles caught fire after the crash, the Idaho State Police said in a press release. The van was carrying a tour group of 14 people, and the surviving occupants were taken to hospitals with injuries, police spokesman Aaron Snell said. Air ambulances and emergency paramedics responded to the collision, which remains under investigation. Authorities have not said what led up to the crash. The Fremont County coroner's office had not released the names of those killed as of Friday morning. The Idaho State Police said officials were still working on notifying family members of those killed and injured, so the agency was not yet releasing the names, ages, hometowns or nationalities of the people involved. Merrill said he often sees tourist vans on the highway that leads to Yellowstone National Park. “It is a very dangerous highway because it leads to the main entrance of Yellowstone National Park,” he said. Due to the remote location, Merrill said he anxiously awaited the help of first responders. “It took an unnervingly long time for help to arrive just because of the location,” he said. ___ Dupuy reported from New York City.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Economic developments: China said it is “currently assessing” proposals by the US to begin trade talks. President Donald Trump is also calling on the Fed to lower interest rates after a better-than-expected jobs report. • Trump Cabinet changes: Trump removed Mike Waltz as national security adviser and announced his nomination as UN ambassador in the first major staff change since the president took office. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will temporarily replace him, with the top US diplomat serving in four roles at once. • Harvard funding showdown: Trump said this morning that Harvard University will be stripped of its tax-exempt status, redoubling his threat as a broader chess match is underway over free speech, political ideology and federal funding at the Ivy League school. The White House released a budget blueprint today that would pump more money into defense and homeland security, while taking an ax to programs that the Trump administration has already targeted — including education, foreign aid, environment, health and public assistance programs. The proposal outlines President Donald Trump's vision and provides recommendations to Congress for fiscal year 2026 spending, but lawmakers are not required to follow it. The blueprint is an outline, otherwise known as a “skinny budget,” with a more comprehensive plan expected to be released in coming weeks. The United States designated both a Haitian gang and a coalition of gangs in the country as terrorist organizations today, as Secretary of State Marco Rubio argued they are “a direct threat to US national security interests in the region.” Rubio designated Viv Ansanm, an alliance of gangs on the island nation, and Gran Grif as both foreign terrorist organizations and specially designated global terrorists. The top US diplomat warned that both Haitians and US citizens could face counterterrorism sanctions for “engaging in transactions with members of these groups.” The terrorism designations factor in to President Donald Trump's broader effort to socialize the idea that the US is at war with transnational gangs, which he has used to justify elements of his sweeping immigration crackdown. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney told reporters today that he will meet with President Donald Trump in Washington, DC, on Tuesday, May 6. “So [the meeting will be about] addressing both sets of issues. Asked how he might avoid the same kind of public argument that occurred between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office earlier this year, Carney said he's going into the meeting expecting a “difficult, but constructive” conversation. On Tuesday, Carney said his country would “never” yield to the United States as he declared victory in federal elections, following a campaign overshadowed by relentless provocations and steep trade tariffs imposed by Trump. Democrats are launching a new effort to pressure Republican lawmakers to oppose President Donald Trump's tax and spending cuts package, specifically targeting four Republican lawmakers in some of the most competitive House districts in the country. Bacon, Fitzpatrick and Lawler won districts carried by former Vice President Kamala Harris in last year's election. The effort, involving the Democratic National Committee and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, will include hosting “People's Town Halls” in some of these Republican districts later in the month and encouraging supporters to apply pressure on the GOP representatives online and through email and phone calls to their offices. Democrats have zeroed in on Medicaid as a key messaging issue against Republicans, arguing any cuts to the program would be detrimental to millions of low-income people across the country. That is an increase from current levels of approximately $893 billion. “I'll be supporting a record setting $1 trillion investment in our national defense,” he said at the Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Michigan on Tuesday. “We're going to go $1 trillion, the largest in the world, largest ever in our country, but no other country has invested that much. We have a $1 trillion budget for military this year.” President Donald Trump once again called on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates after a better-than-expected April jobs report was released this morning. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said that “… employment (is) strong, and much more good news, as Billions of Dollars pour in from Tariffs. …  Consumers have been waiting for years to see pricing come down. That's a slower pace of price hikes than February's 2.7% increase. The White House plans to unveil its budget proposal today, targeting education, foreign aid, environmental, health care and other non-defense discretionary spending with $163 billion in cuts, two administration officials told CNN. The proposal — referred to internally as a “skinny budget” because it is an outline, rather than a comprehensive plan — calls for $557 billion in non-defense discretionary spending, one of the officials said. The official said agencies that would face steep cuts include: The budget proposal is essentially a statement of President Donald Trump's priorities to Congress, which must hammer out the details and pass them into law. In his first months in office, Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk have sought to dramatically slash the federal government, laying off federal workers and eliminating functions that don't align with the administration's political views. A busy news week continued heading into this morning as President Donald Trump's sweeping tax and spending cuts package picks up steam in Congress and his administration continues to target migrants. Here's more of the latest news as you get your day started: Rubio's rise: Secretary of State Marco Rubio has ascended as one of Trump's most trusted hands after moving in as interim national security adviser following widespread reports that Trump planned on ousting Mike Waltz from the position. Trump's tax and spending cuts package: House Republicans are starting to put some meat on the bones of their sweeping tax and spending cuts package, or what Trump calls his “big, beautiful bill.” It aims to extend the GOP's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as well as fulfill several of Trump's campaign promises, such as ending taxes on tips. Relabeling cartel and gang members: The Trump administration is considering labeling some suspected cartel and gang members inside the US as “enemy combatants” as a possible way to detain them more easily and limit their ability to challenge their imprisonment. Veterans Day: Trump said he wants to rename Veterans Day, a federal holiday on November 11, to “Victory Day for World War I” in a move to purportedly “start celebrating our victories again.” He also said he wants to celebrate May 8, which is not a federal holiday, as “Victory Day for World War II.” Federal workers: Many federal workers who are used to relative job security are now beset by low morale and deep uncertainty and have decided to quit their jobs. Many of the more than a dozen workers who spoke to CNN describe a culture of fear that now permeates the workforce. Vance on Ukraine war: Vice President JD Vance said the war in Ukraine is “not going to end any time soon” in comments aired on Fox News yesterday evening, just hours after Washington and Kyiv signed a key minerals agreement that has peace in Ukraine among its goals. The US economy added a surprisingly strong 177,000 jobs in April, a slight slowdown from March's downwardly revised 185,000 gains, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Economists were expecting the economy to have added 135,000 jobs last month and that the unemployment rate held at 4.2%, according to FactSet consensus estimates. Radio Free Asia is laying off most of its staff and shutting down many of its news broadcasts and streams, amid a funding battle with the Trump administration. “Every day that we're not broadcasting is a day that will allow adversaries to spread propaganda unchecked,” Voice of America journalist Patsy Widakuswara, the lead plaintiff in one of the cases, told CNN. Half a dozen lawsuits have been filed to reverse the moves. Vast flows of trade between the world's two largest economies are at stake after President Donald Trump hiked tariffs on China this month, making it difficult for some Chinese businesses to continue trading with the US. In response, Beijing has also slapped massive tariffs on American imports. A major shipping loophole expired at one minute past midnight. The de minimis exemption allowed shipments of goods worth $800 or less to come into the US duty-free, often more or less skipping time-consuming inspections and paperwork. A baseline tariff as high as 145%, depending on the carrier, is set to take effect on Chinese imports, potentially more than doubling the cost of all those cheap products that deal-hungry Americans have scooped up. Inching toward trade deals: China says it is “currently assessing” proposals by the US to begin trade talks, in a tone shift that could open the door for negotiations. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Beijing was eager to talk. But Financial Times reported that Šefčovič suggested the Trump administration would need to abandon its 10% across-the-board tariffs on European goods as a precursor to any trade arrangement. Most of Apple's iPhone supply chain is based in China. Apple has shifted some iPhone production to India, and Cook said he expects “the majority of iPhones sold in the US will have India as their country of origin.” President Donald Trump said the administration will be stripping Harvard University of its tax-exempt status. In an early Truth Social post, Trump wrote, “It's what they deserve!” Last month, Trump threatened to strip Harvard of its tax-exempt status, and CNN reported that the Internal Revenue Service was making plans to do so. Earlier this week, Harvard announced it is renaming its “Office for Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging” to “Community and Campus Life.” The university also said it would no longer host or fund affinity group celebrations during commencement, according to The Harvard Crimson. President Donald Trump signed an executive order yesterday directing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to end federal funding for America's two biggest public broadcasters, which have faced a series of attacks from the White House and Republican lawmakers accusing them of biased reporting. It also orders the board to take steps to “minimize or eliminate” indirect funding from other public radio and TV stations that may support NPR or PBS. CPB filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration this week after three of its five board members were terminated by email on Monday. Each year, the CPB disperses $535 million in taxpayer funds to public radio and TV stations. Congress specifically set up the corporation as a private entity “to afford maximum protection from extraneous interference and control,” according to a law passed in 1967. President Donald Trump said yesterday that he would nominate Mike Waltz to serve as United Nations ambassador, shifting from his role as national security adviser. A White House official later told CNN Trump informed Waltz of the changes this morning.</p>

(AP Photo/Aurelien Morissard, left and center, Pavel Bednyakov, right, File) Russian President Vladimir Putin, right, and U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff greet each other prior to their talks at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, April 25, 2025. (Kristina Kormilitsyna, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP, File) Russian soldiers guard a pier where two Ukrainian naval vessels are moored, in Sevastopol, on the Crimean Peninsula, March 5, 2014. What's emerged so far from the Washington-led effort to end the war in Ukraine suggests a deal that seems likely to be favorable to Russia: President Donald Trump has sharply rebuked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, echoed Kremlin talking points, and indicated Kyiv would have to surrender territory and forego NATO membership. What's more, he has engaged in a rapprochement with Moscow that was unthinkable months ago. More recently, Trump has offered mixed signals — social media posts that perhaps Russian President Vladimir Putin is stringing him along — and a deal has yet to materialize. And on Wednesday, Washington and Kyiv signed an agreement granting American access to Ukraine's vast mineral resources that could enable continued military aid to the country under ongoing attacks from Russia. One gain for the Kremlin is that Washington is talking again to Moscow after years of extremely strained ties following its 2022 invasion of Ukraine — and not just about the war, said Nikolay Petrov, senior research fellow with the New Eurasian Strategies Centre think tank. Russia's main state TV channel reported that the meeting between Putin and Trump envoy Steve-Witkoff showed that Moscow and Washington were building “a new structure of the world” together. In this sense, “Putin already got a part of what he sought” — the optics of Russia as a country that is on par with the U.S., Petrov said. Trump has said Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula Moscow illegally annexed in 2014, “will stay with Russia,” and outlines of a peace proposal his team reportedly presented to Kyiv last month apparently included allowing Russia to keep control of other occupied Ukrainian territories. Trump, who had a contentious meeting with Zelenskyy in the Oval Office on Feb. 28, lashed out at him for publicly rejecting the idea of ceding land, and also said that Kyiv was unlikely to ever join NATO. Trump also seemingly puts more pressure on Kyiv than Moscow in trying to reach a peace deal and appears eager to return to a more normal relationship with Russia and its “big business opportunities,” said Sam Greene of King's College London. “Is there any part of this that doesn't look like a win for Russia? But so far, all of this has remained nothing but rhetoric, with terms of a possible settlement still very much “in the air,” says Sergey Radchenko, a historian and a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. Moreover, there are still demands by both Russia and Ukraine that would be hard to reconcile in any kind of peace settlement. Ukraine refuses to cede any land and wants robust security guarantees against future aggression, possibly involving a contingent of peacekeepers -– something a handful of European nations have been discussing and Russia publicly rejects as a nonstarter. It also wants Kyiv to “demilitarize,” or significantly reduce its armed force. Radchenko sees the latter as a major sticking point in peace talks, because a strong, viable army is important for Ukraine to defend itself. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov seemingly raised the stakes further this week by saying that international recognition of regions annexed from Ukraine by Russia was “imperative” for a peace deal. Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have threatened to wash their hands of the peace effort if there is no progress soon. Putin, in an apparent gesture of willingness to keep talking, announced this week a 72-hour ceasefire starting May 8 for Russia's Victory Day holiday that marks the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. Zelenskyy dismissed the gesture as a further attempt by Putin at “manipulation” to string along the U.S., saying a ceasefire should begin immediately and last longer. “When the Trump administration says they'll walk away, we don't know what that means. Does that mean they walk away from negotiations and keep supporting Ukraine?” Greene said. And U.S. Treasury Secretary Sctott Bessent said the mineral deal “signals clearly to Russia that the Trump administration is committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term.” A lot depends on whether Europe can step up and fill any gaps in U.S. aid. If Trump walks away from the peace effort and still pursues normalizing relations with Russia, lifting sanctions, “this will amount to a major breakthrough” for Putin, but it's not a given, Radchenko says. That would be an uphill battle for Trump as “there's a lot of congressional sanctions that are predicated on the war in Ukraine,” Greene notes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Verfassungsschutz justified its decision by claiming that the AfD didn't consider citizens of a “migration background from predominantly Muslim countries” as equal to native Germans. It aims to exclude certain population groups from equal participation in society, subject them to unconstitutional discrimination, and thus assign them a legally devalued status,” the statement read. “This exclusionary understanding of the people is the starting point and ideological basis for ongoing agitation against certain individuals or groups of people, through which they are defamed and despised indiscriminately and irrational fears and rejection are stirred up,” it added, accusing the party of deepening “prejudices, resentment and fears towards this group of people.” Evidence cited by Der Spiegel included Weidel's use of the “right-wing extremist term ‘remigration,'” though the term is commonplace among mainstream right-wing and populist parties across Europe. The agency also cited incidents in which party officials dressed up as deportation pilots or handed out airplane-shaped gummy bears during the federal election campaign. AfD party leaders Alice Weidel and Tino Chrupalla denounced the decision in a joint statement, calling it “defamatory” and a “severe blow to German democracy.” “The AfD, as an opposition party, is now being publicly discredited and criminalized shortly before the change of government,” their statement read, adding, “targeted interference in the democratic decision-making process is therefore clearly politically motivated. The AfD will continue to defend itself legally against these defamations that endanger democracy,” their statement read. +++ Alice Weidel/Tino Chrupalla: "Entscheidung des Verfassungsschutzes ist ein schwerer Schlag gegen die bundesdeutsche Demokratie!" Outgoing German interior minister Nancy Faeser defended the ruling, saying, “The AfD represents an ethnic concept that discriminates against entire population groups and treats citizens with a history of migration as second-class Germans.” She insisted the decision was made with “no political influence.” She said the matter was now black and white. However, a ban on the AfD would be unprecedented in modern Western history. Banning the country's most popular party would be met with massive domestic and international backlash, especially from ally Elon Musk and the Trump administration. Left-wing critics openly accuse it of being a neo-Nazi group.</p>

Tennessee state law enforcement released video showing a 2022 traffic stop involving Kilmar Abrego Garcia, one of the incidents the Trump administration officials have used to justify the removal of the Maryland man who the government has admitted was wrongly deported to El Salvador in March. US officials have argued the traffic stop in November 2022, in which Abrego Garcia was not detained or charged, supports their claims that Abrego Garcia was a member of MS-13 and involved in human trafficking. A redacted police report released to CNN by the highway patrol did not address suspicions of human trafficking. Abrego Garcia's family and his lawyers deny those claims.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Advocates are banking on a new use for federal housing vouchers. There are approximately 275,000 people living unsheltered in the US, with over half of them in California, and the Grants Pass v. Johnson decision has emboldened cities to break up such encampments and expand “interim housing” options, like tiny house shelters and motel rooms, to move people more quickly off the street. Still, the fact that temporary housing units can be erected much more quickly than permanent supportive housing (roughly five months rather than five years) and cheaply ($50,000 to 100,000 per unit rather than $600,000 to $1 million per unit) has provided elected officials with an attractive policy solution to their mounting political problems. In California, where homelessness has become both a defining political liability for elected officials and a national symbol of the state's governance challenges, cities are particularly eager to demonstrate progress on their streets. Perhaps no California politician has been more enthusiastic about the potential of tiny house shelters than San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan, who proposed in 2023 to divert more than a third of his city's housing funds to increase production. (San Jose is the largest city in Northern California, with roughly 1 million residents.) Mahan campaigned for reelection in 2024 on clearing street homelessness, and since winning, he's pledged to build more than 1,000 new temporary housing units by the end of 2025. This more forceful approach is also being embraced in San Francisco, where the newly elected Mayor Daniel Lurie has been expanding interim housing options and moving people more quickly off the streets. “In the past it was only social services-led, and you're just not going to social work your way out of this problem,” Kunal Modi, the mayor's chief of homelessness policy, told me. Elizabeth Funk, the CEO of DignityMoves, a nonprofit that began five years ago to apply “Silicon Valley-style ‘disruptive thinking' to America's homelessness crisis,” has been leading the charge for expanding tiny house shelters in California. She credits the Grants Pass decision for moving things along. “It did give a push,” Funk told me, “because ironically cities were getting off the hook, saying, ‘Well why would we build shelter? Former San Jose Mayor and current US Rep. Sam Liccardo told me he's drafting federal legislation that would let Housing Choice Vouchers, commonly known as Section 8, fund interim housing options — something these rental subsidies currently aren't authorized to support. On homelessness generally, he added, “we just need a more nimble response.” Roughly a third of those cities have been in California. Elected officials have partly justified these new rules as a step toward achieving “functional zero unsheltered homelessness” — a narrower version of the broader policy goal of “functional zero homelessness,” introduced in 2014 by the nonprofit Community Solutions. In 2021, Community Solutions was awarded the MacArthur Foundation's $100 million grant for its work advancing this approach. “Getting to zero for unsheltered street homelessness should be the top priority,” California state Sen. Catherine Blakespear, who is sponsoring one of the state interim housing bills this year, told me. “And I've had a shift in my own thinking about this.” Some homelessness advocates have pushed back on the new usage. “‘Functional zero' is widely recognized in the homeless policy world, but ‘functional zero unsheltered' is not a phrase we recognize because it suggests the possibility that sheltered homelessness is an acceptable state of affairs for folks,” Alex Visotzky, a senior California policy fellow with the National Alliance to End Homelessness, told me. “When you focus on unsheltered only, most of the time you only make things worse because that leads to a logjam in your shelter system where folks can't get out.” Visotzky challenges the assumption that only slow-to-build permanent housing can solve homelessness. While it does take years to build new permanent housing, he stresses that it doesn't take years to get people into permanent housing, through a targeted approach of case management, housing subsidies, and reconnecting people with family and friends. Advocates like Visotzky say they don't oppose interim housing per se, but worry about politicians diverting funds for permanent housing, and preventing people from moving into a real home for even longer. The rush of private business into the tiny house space gives advocates pause too, and they worry what this next era of criminalization will look like. More than one-fifth of people experiencing homelessness currently have a serious mental illness like bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, and the US Department of Justice had found that “the prevalence of unmet behavioral health needs” is a key driver in why “people who experience homelessness tend to have frequent (and often repeat) interactions with law enforcement.” Not all interim housing communities have the support services necessary to help people with serious mental illness, and advocates worry about what will happen if there's just nowhere else for these people to go. In San Francisco, Lurie's mayoral predecessor, London Breed, responded to the Grants Pass ruling by promising to be “very aggressive” on tent encampments, including by threatening criminal penalties. Lurie has kept up Breed's tougher approach, including by more formally embedding their homeless street outreach teams with law enforcement. While campaigning for mayor last year, Lurie partnered with DignityMoves, and featured Elizabeth Funk prominently in his campaign's announcement of his plan to tackle homelessness. Lurie has promised to build 2,500 units of interim housing in his first two years. Modi, the homelessness lead for Lurie's team in San Francisco, told me their first order of business was to focus on revamping their street outreach strategy and opening a new crisis stabilization center, precisely to serve more people with serious health needs. Now, though, their attention is turning to building the new tiny house options. “Right now, the average stay is about eight months, but as we start scaling this interim thing, it's going to get longer, and that needs to be okay,” she told me. “The only reason we want people out fast is because the city has to pay for keeping them in shelter, and cities can't afford that.” They are eyeing the federal government's $3.6 billion voucher program, which currently supports about 2.3 million low-income households. In California last year, over 40,000 voucher recipients never secured housing. The solution, Funk and her colleagues envision, is allowing the federal rental subsidy to help cities cover those annual operating costs, so people can stay housed and federal subsidies aren't wasted because renters couldn't find willing landlords. To move that idea forward, Liccardo, who represents parts of Santa Clara and San Mateo counties, is working on a bill that would clarify that local communities could decide whether voucher holders are allowed to spend their monthly subsidy on staying longer-term in a tiny house or motel option instead of a market-rate apartment. Liccardo blasted Republicans who don't want to spend more money on vouchers, and noted that 60,000 vouchers could disappear by the end of next year if Congress doesn't act. But he praised his conservative colleagues for being open to “greater flexibility” in how the money could be spent. Visotzky said advocates like himself have no qualms about people staying in shelters when there is nowhere else for them to go, but they worry about creating a new category of substandard living. Voters this week approved a first-of-its-kind measure to pay property owners if cities don't address camps. Experts think they've cracked the code for how to actually convert empty office buildings into affordable housing.</p>

We focus on being useful to you — breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? This story was originally published by Grist and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. America's federal public lands are truly unique, part of our birthright as citizens. No other country in the world has such a system. More than 640 million acres, including national parks, forests, and wildlife refuges, as well as lands open to drilling, mining, logging, and a variety of other uses, are managed by the federal government — but owned collectively by all American citizens. Together, these parcels make up more than a quarter of all land in the nation. “Even if you don't own a house or the latest computer on the market, you own Yosemite, Yellowstone, the Grand Canyon, Golden Gate National Recreation Area, and many other natural treasures,” he wrote in 2011. Despite broad, bipartisan public support for protecting public lands, these shared landscapes have come under relentless attack during the first 100 days of President Donald Trump's second term. The administration and its allies in Congress are working feverishly to tilt the scale away from natural resource protection and toward extraction, threatening a pillar of the nation's identity and tradition of democratic governance. “There's no larger concentration of unappropriated wealth on this globe than exists in this country on our public lands,” said Jesse Deubel, executive director of the New Mexico Wildlife Federation, a conservation nonprofit. And the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, led by billionaire Elon Musk, is wreaking havoc within federal land management agencies, pushing out thousands of civil servants. That purge will leave America's natural heritage more vulnerable to the myriad threats these lands already face, including growing visitor numbers, climate change, wildfires, and invasive species. But the speed and scope of the current attack, along with its disregard for the public's support for safeguarding public lands, makes it more worrisome than previous iterations, several public land advocates and legal experts told Grist. The country is “in a much more pro-public lands position than we've been before,” Deubel said. In an article posted to the White House website on Earth Day, the Trump administration touted several “key actions” it has taken on the environment, including “protecting public lands” by opening more acres to energy development, “protecting wildlife” by pausing wind energy projects, and safeguarding forests by expanding logging. The accomplishments list received widespread condemnation from environmental, climate, and public land advocacy groups. That same day, a leaked draft strategic plan revealed the Interior Department's four-year vision for opening new federal lands to drilling and other extractive development, reducing the amount of federal land it manages by selling some for housing development and transferring other acres to state control, rolling back the boundaries of protected national monuments, and weakening bedrock environmental laws like the Endangered Species Act. Nearly every Republican senator went on the record this month in support of selling off federal lands to reduce the federal deficit, voting down a measure that would have blocked such sales. And Utah has promised to continue its legal fight aimed at stripping more than 18 million acres of BLM lands within the state's border from the federal government. Utah's lawsuit, which the Supreme Court declined to hear in January, had the support of numerous Republican-led states, including North Dakota while current Interior Secretary Doug Burgum was still governor. To advance its agenda, the Trump administration is citing a series of “emergencies” that close observers say are at best exaggerated, and at worst manufactured. The email you need to stay informed about Trump — without letting the news take over your life, from senior editor Patrick Reis. A purported “energy emergency,” which Trump declared in an executive order just hours after being inaugurated, has been the impetus for the administration attempting to throw longstanding federal permitting processes, public comment periods, and environmental safeguards to the wind. The action aims to boost fossil fuel extraction across federal lands and waters — despite domestic oil and gas production being at record highs — while simultaneously working to thwart renewable energy projects. Trump relied on that same “emergency” earlier this month when he ordered federal agencies to prop up America's dwindling, polluting coal industry, which the president and his Cabinet have insisted is “beautiful” and “clean.” In reality, coal is among the most polluting forms of energy. Why would you try to reinvigorate a moribund industry that has been declining for the last decade or more? Coal consumption in the US has declined more than 50 percent since peaking in 2005, according to the US Energy Information Administration, largely due to market forces, including the availability of cheaper natural gas and America's growing renewable energy sector. The threat of extreme wildfire — an actual crisis driven by a complex set of factors, including climate change, its role in intensifying droughts and pest outbreaks, and decades of fire suppression — is being cited to justify slashing environmental reviews to ramp up logging on public lands. Following up on a Trump executive order to increase domestic timber production, Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins signed a memo declaring a forest health “emergency” that would open nearly 60 percent of national forest lands, more than 110 million acres, to aggressive logging. The Trump administration recently established a task force to identify what it calls “underutilized lands.” In an op-ed announcing that effort, Burgum and Scott Turner, secretary of Housing and Urban Development, wrote that “much of” the 500 million acres Interior oversees is “suitable for residential use.” Some of the most high-profile members of the anti-public lands movement, including William Perry Pendley, who served as acting director of the Bureau of Land Management during Trump's first term, are championing the idea. Without guardrails, critics argue the sale of public lands to build housing will lead to sprawl in remote, sensitive landscapes and do little, if anything, to address home affordability, as the issue is driven by several factors, including migration trends, stagnant wages, and higher construction costs. Notably, Trump's tariff policies are expected to raise the average price of a new home by nearly $11,000. Chris Hill, CEO of the Conservation Lands Foundation, a Colorado-based nonprofit working to protect BLM-managed lands, said the lack of affordable housing is a serious issue, but “we shouldn't be fooled that the idea to sell off public lands is a solution.” David Hayes, who served as deputy Interior secretary during the administrations of Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton and as a senior climate adviser to President Joe Biden, told Grist that Trump's broad use of executive power sets the current privatization push apart from previous efforts. “This administration is going farther than any other ever has to push the limits of executive power.” Aaron Weiss, deputy director of the Center for Western Priorities, a Colorado-based conservation group, said Trump and his team are doing everything they can to circumvent normal environmental rules and safeguards in order to advance their agenda, with no regard for the law or public opinion. Like Zinke, Burgum invoked Roosevelt in pitching himself for the job. “In our time, President Donald Trump's energy dominance agenda can be America's big stick that will be leveraged to achieve historic prosperity and world peace,” Burgum said during his confirmation hearing in January, referencing a 1990 letter in which the 26th president said to “speak softly and carry a big stick.” Some public land advocates initially viewed Burgum, now the chief steward of the federal lands, waters, and wildlife we all own, as a palatable nominee in a sea of problematic potential picks. A billionaire software entrepreneur and former North Dakota governor, Burgum has talked at length about his fondness for Roosevelt's conservation legacy and the outdoors.Whatever honeymoon there was didn't last long. One hundred days in, Burgum and the rest of Trump's team have taken not a stick, but a wrecking ball to America's public lands, waters, and wildlife. At an April 9 all-hands meeting of Interior employees, Burgum showed off pictures of himself touring oil and gas facilities, celebrated “clean coal,” and condemned burdensome government regulation. Burgum has repeatedly described federal lands as “America's balance sheet” — “assets” that he estimates could be worth $100 trillion but that he argues Americans are getting a “low return” on. “On the world's largest balance sheet last year, the revenue that we pulled in was about $18 billion,” he said at the staffwide meeting, referring to money the government brings from lease fees and royalties from grazing, drilling, and logging on federal lands, as well as national park entrance fees. It's not a big number if we're managing $100 trillion in assets.” In focusing solely on revenues generated from energy and other resource extraction, Burgum disregards that public lands are the foundation of a $1 trillion outdoor recreation economy, never mind the numerous climate, environmental, cultural, and public health benefits. Davis, the author of In Defense of Public Lands: The Case Against Privatization and Transfer, dismissed Burgum's “balance sheet” argument as “shriveled” and “wrong.” “You have to willfully be ignorant and ignore everything of value about those lands except their marketable commodity value to come up with that conclusion,” he said. Shortly after Trump's first inauguration in 2017, then-Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Republican representing Utah, introduced legislation to sell off 3.3 million acres of public land in 10 Western states that he said had “been deemed to serve no purpose for taxpayers.” Chaffetz pulled the bill just two weeks later, citing concerns from his constituents. The first Trump administration continued to weaken safeguards for 35 million acres of federal lands — more than any other administration in history — and offered up millions more for oil and gas development, but stopped short of trying sell off or transfer large areas of the public domain. Public land advocates are hopeful that the current push will flounder. In recent weeks, crowds have rallied at numerous national parks and state capitol buildings to support keeping public lands in public hands. In a time of extreme polarization on seemingly every issue, public lands enjoy broad bipartisan support. The 2025 “Conservation in the West” poll found that 72 percent of voters in eight Western states support public lands conservation over increased energy development — the highest level of support in the poll's history; 65 percent oppose giving states control over federal public lands, up from 56 percent in 2017; and 89 percent oppose shrinking or removing protections for national monuments, up from 80 percent in 2017. Even in Utah, where leaders have spent millions of taxpayer dollars promoting the state's anti-federal lands lawsuit, support for protecting public lands remains high. “Even in all these made-up crises, the American public doesn't want this,” Hill said. “The American people want and love their public lands.” At his recent staffwide meeting, Burgum said Roosevelt's legacy should guide Interior staff in the mission to manage and protect federal public lands. Those two things, management and protection, “must be held in balance,” Burgum stressed. Yet in social media posts and friendly interviews with conservative media, Burgum has left little doubt about where his priorities lie, repeatedly rolling out what Breitbart dubbed the “four babies” of Trump's energy dominance agenda: “Drill, Baby, Drill! The meat industry's war on wildlife, explained in 3 charts. California researchers grapple with losing a landscape they love in real time. The bizarre link between your anti-anxiety drugs and salmon.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) is determined to pass a megabill to codify President Donald Trump's agenda by Memorial Day, but four factions of GOP lawmakers are forcing leadership to find a compromise that can pass the razor-thin GOP majority. The White House held a meeting Thursday with Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA), House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith (R-MO), and House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Brett Guthrie (R-KY) on reconciliation, all given the tough task of appeasing differing special interests within the conference with little to no room for error. are coming together very well,” Johnson said after the meeting. “We are awaiting some final calculations on a few of the tax components, and we expect to be able to complete that work on a very aggressive schedule and quickly send the bill to the president's desk.” After the White House meeting, it was announced that both the Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce committees wouldn't hold their markup hearings until the week of May 12, a week behind leadership's desired schedule. An Energy and Commerce Democratic member anticipated that the markup would take up to 30 hours. Republicans have begun charging forward with a budget process called reconciliation that unlocks Trump's agenda. Committee leaders tasked with leading sections of the reconciliation bill met with lawmakers throughout this week, as several Republicans have expressed concerns over how the GOP can find $1.5 trillion in spending cuts without slashing Medicaid, leaving the House Energy and Commerce markup expected to draw a heated debate. Some centrist Republicans in states like California and New York are also aggressively advocating to increase the $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions, with lawmakers gathering with Johnson this week to pitch numbers and find common ground with no concrete results yet. Standing in the way of Medicaid and SALT Republicans are the fiscal hawks, who have warned Republicans that their support for the bill hinges on finding enough cuts to offset the tax cuts many Republicans want to make permanent, along with Trump's promises of no tax on tips or overtime. These four policy areas put leadership at a massive crossroads between the two ends of the party as they advocate an ambitious passage schedule, aiming for before Memorial Day weekend. Republicans have long complained about former President Joe Biden's 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which was passed through the same reconciliation process that some Republicans want to use to repeal one of Biden's biggest legislative wins. The fight between those who want a full repeal and those who consider it a red line when it comes to their vote on reconciliation heated up Thursday when 38 Republicans sent a letter to Smith arguing that leaving any of the bill in place would “undermine America's return to energy dominance and national security.” Many House Republicans calling for a full repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act also fall under the category of fiscal hawks, whose opposition often leads to many late-night or last-minute negotiations with House leadership to pass spending bills on the floor. Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX), a budget hawk and policy chairman for the Freedom Caucus, has said his vote will most likely teeter on whether the massive bill includes a full Inflation Reduction Act repeal. “We should fully repeal the Inflation Reduction Act,” Roy wrote on X. “The billions in green tax credits are a scam and can be traded (boondoggle). Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), who signed on to the letter calling for a full repeal, is an expected holdout as he consistently votes “no” on spending bills. However, a full repeal would serve as a red line for many centrist GOP House members, whose districts have benefited from some of the clean energy tax credits included in the Inflation Reduction Act. More than 20 of these centrist members sent a letter to Smith earlier this month stating they want to keep the clean energy tax credits that came from the act, arguing a full repeal could quickly increase utility bills. “We request that any proposed changes to the tax code be conducted in a targeted and pragmatic fashion that promotes conference priorities without undoing current and future private sector investments which will continue to increase domestic manufacturing, promote energy innovation, and keep utility costs down,” the 21 members wrote in the letter. Medicaid has been a point of contention for House GOP leadership in the reconciliation process well before the first budget framework was passed in late February. Several swing district and state lawmakers have been concerned that the $880 billion in proposed Energy and Commerce Committee cuts will likely run right through Medicaid. Leadership has spent weeks trying to assure centrist Republicans that there will not be cuts to Medicaid or other beneficiary programs on which their constituents rely. But getting everyone in one room is proving to be difficult. Many members were tied up this week with other reconciliation markup hearings, and several centrist Republicans, such as Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R-NJ), did not make it to meetings on Medicaid and SALT with Guthrie. Van Drew told reporters he heard the turnout “wasn't huge.” Earlier this month, 12 centrist Republicans wrote a letter to leadership and Guthrie saying they oppose any cuts to Medicaid that would reduce coverage for vulnerable populations. “As Members of Congress who helped to deliver a Republican majority, many of us representing districts with high rates of constituents who depend on Medicaid, we would like to reiterate our strong support for this program that ensures our constituents have reliable healthcare. The letter was signed by Van Drew and Reps. David Valadao (R-CA), Don Bacon (R-NE), Rob Bresnahan (R-PA), Juan Ciscomani (R-AZ), Jen Kiggans (R-VA), Young Kim (R-CA), Rob Wittman (R-VA), Nicole Malliotakis (R-NY), Nick LaLota (R-NY), Andrew Garbarino (R-NY), and Jeff Hurd (R-CO). Although meetings this week have not tipped the scale in any direction, centrists remain confident consensus can be found. “I remain optimistic about how things look, because I know leadership understands the importance of having all parts of the Republican coalition together on this reconciliation bill, so I expect that they'll take that into account as they implement these instructions,” Hurd told the Washington Examiner on Thursday. A handful of fiscal conservative members have made clear their votes are contingent on the budget bill not adding to the national deficit. You better ask for a whole heck of a lot, ask for $8 [trillion] or $9 trillion,” Rep. Tim Burchett (R-TN) told reporters Thursday. “We have $300 billion of spending between defense and border and in the packages, so we gotta find even more savings,” Roy said Thursday. Republican lawmakers from high-tax blue states like New York, California, and New Jersey have outsize power to force changes to the $10,000 SALT cap during reconciliation because of the House's ultra-slim Republican majority. But Ryan had a sufficiently large majority that he didn't need their votes. Now, Johnson can only afford to lose three votes, depending on attendance. While all parties to negotiations are expressing optimism that an agreement will be reached, Malliotakis told reporters on Friday that the matter likely won't be resolved until next week. Members of the self-described SALT caucus also met with Johnson on Thursday evening. Lawler has a bill to raise the cap to $100,000 for individuals and $200,000 for couples, although that is well above what will likely be accepted. Raising the SALT cap has been panned by many lawmakers in red states. “I don't support continuing to subsidize blue state high-tax jurisdictions,” Roy, the Texas Republican, told reporters. But the SALT caucus isn't just being so aggressive on holding the line because they think it's good policy; getting a bigger SALT cap is very much an issue of political survival for the SALT caucus. Many of them are in toss-up districts and could be tossed out of office in 2026 if they don't deliver on their promises to raise the cap.</p>
