                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Twenty-five years later, legendary former Bulgarian international Hristo Stoichkov is preparing to watch eight-time Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi and Inter Miami CF at this summer's expanded FIFA 2025 Club World Cup, along with returning participants Seattle Sounders FC. How far Major League Soccer has come. And one week after that, [we] won the [US] Open Cup. "Peter Nowak, the big captain, Ante Razov, Josh Wolff, Chris Armas, Jesse Marsch, DaMarcus Beasley, Carlos Bocanegra, Zach Thornton - the whole team, so unbelievable. It's not the first time I have [said] thank you, thank you very much [to] MLS. Along with his obvious talent, which earned him the 1994 Ballon d'Or award, Stoichkov added a hard-nosed mentality to a team that won the MLS Cup-U.S. Open Cup double two years prior, helping the Fire add a second USOC title to their trophy cabinet by scoring the opening goal in the 2000 final. After three years, Bradley left for New York, cuing Stoichkov to spend the final season of his legendary career with D.C. United. Both cities still hold a special place in his heart. But as a former FC Barcelona player, Stoichkov also has a newfound connection to Inter Miami's Messi-led project that includes fellow Blaugrana alums Luis Suárez, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba. And sometimes I see games in Washington [D.C.] because I ended my career in Washington [D.C.] and I have strong affection for both Chicago Fire and D.C. United. Every game, because I'm a man of soccer. I can't go a minute without watching soccer. It's been years since I've played, but I like seeing whether the younger players of today will be better than we were during my years in MLS.” Although most Fire players lived in downtown Chicago when Stoichkov joined, the team trained nearly two hours away in Lake Forest, requiring players to sit in traffic for hours as they drove to and from practice. Obviously, the programs that MLS has in place to grow the game and give opportunities to young players are fantastic. I think the work Commissioner Don Garber is doing with each team, making sure each team has their own stadium and training facilities - for a player, these things are fantastic and help the game grow. "I think MLS will grow even more. It'll grow because, if I'm not mistaken, there are more than 250 US players currently playing in foreign countries. That's a fantastic figure because it means that so many players don't fit in MLS, so you have to negotiate with other teams. For me, MLS is currently one of the strongest leagues. Obviously, the greatest player of all time is playing in MLS – that would be Lionel Messi." As the official host team for the Club World Cup, Inter Miami will play in the tournament's inaugural game against Egyptian side Al Ahly FC on June 14 at Hard Rock Stadium. The 2023 Leagues Cup champions and reigning MLS Supporters' Shield winners see this as a prime opportunity to further prove themselves on the global stage. Seattle, the league's first-ever Club World Cup participant in 2022, also qualified via that year's Concacaf Champions Cup (née League) title. The Sounders will compete in Group B, along with Brazilian powerhouse Botafogo and European juggernauts Atlético Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain. Despite Seattle's daunting group-stage draw, Stoichkov insists the Rave Green have a fighting chance to reach the knockout stages. Go out and enjoy it," he said. "Soccer is very simple: win 1-0 and don't let the opponent score a goal and tie the game. Look, for a young player on a team that's made history in MLS, it's about going out, enjoying yourself and competing against other players, seeing how you measure up. "Everybody is picking their favorites to win, right? Seattle won't be an easy team to play against… these teams need to be careful with them because they don't know them." For Stoichkov, the same could be applied to Miami, who'll face Al Ahly (Egypt), Palmeiras (Brazil) and FC Porto (Portugal) in Group A. According to the Bulgarian icon, those unfamiliar with MLS would be well advised to take the Herons and Seattle seriously this summer. "Soccer in the United States is a lot better than many people think.”</p>

While Liverpool still hold out faint hope of keeping him, the reality is that Real Madrid are preparing to finalise his signing imminently. However, Liverpool are aware that he would be leaving without generating a transfer fee. While not mandatory, Liverpool would expect a small compensation fee in return for releasing Alexander-Arnold early. In total, Alexander-Arnold's early release could cost Real Madrid between €1.5 and €2 million. Once that is done, the final stage for Madrid would be formal registration. Although Dani Carvajal may be available, he is returning from a long injury spell. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment. And while Guler's deal might still be a bargain, there were many variables that Real Madrid had to include in the deal, which, if net, could increase the transfer value by €10 million. The variable revolves around Guler playing his 50th match for Real Madrid which has handed Fenerbahce a useful economic boost. The Turkish international has now reached that milestone after appearing in Real Madrid's most recent game against Barcelona. With 10 goals and eight assists, Guler still has a long way to go. But the playmaker is slowly making a mark and Real Madrid certainly won't mind paying an additional €4 million for his services. Upon reaching this milestone, it appears Fenerbahce have the option to demand a friendly with Real Madrid, which could be a lucrative opportunity for the Turkish giants to make some additional cash. It must also be noted that Fenerbahce have retained a 20% sell-on fee clause in Guler's contract, although it appears unlikely that Real Madrid would want to offload the Turkish international anytime soon despite links to other clubs.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The FA's latest annual report contains a warning that new global competitions such as Fifa's Club World Cup risk devaluing the FA Cup — and that player fatigue could affect the performance of Thomas Tuchel's England team. These changes have the potential to significantly reduce the downtime available to elite players, affecting their recovery and overall wellbeing. “The introduction of more global competitions risks devaluing traditional domestic tournaments, such as the FA Cup, and may affect the performance of our national teams due to increased player fatigue and reduced time for international squad training. These factors could have financial implications for us.” Fifa's new club competition takes place in the United States this summer, with Manchester City and Chelsea taking part. Nicholas said in 2023 he thought it was time for the game to be played elsewhere and that his three Old Etonian stepsons agreed. However, Nicholas has now told MCC's “historic fixtures” group he is “not in the business of culling fixtures”, that the members would ultimately decide their future and that his stepsons may have changed their view. He told The Times this week: “We remain in contact with both schools. Documents in the British court case involving John Textor, the Crystal Palace co-owner who is being sued by Bruno Lage, the Portuguese manager who was head coach of his Brazilian club, Botafogo, make interesting reading. Textor's submission to the court admits he signed the “alleged contract” in July 2023 but claims it is an “unenforceable agreement in law” and was merely an opportunity for Lage to negotiate to be the Palace or Lyon manager. The Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, appears to have taken a social media aide to accompany and film him at the Pope's funeral in Rome this week. Newcastle United have taken legal steps to ensure that fans can access St James' Park via a small strip of land just outside the East Stand that is not owned by the club. A company called St James Terrace Land, whose sole director, Robert Kalbraier, also runs a property firm, bought the land in April last year for £180,000 and since then a large metal container and a wooden fence have appeared and then been removed from the site. Sky Sports News is planning to have fewer staff presenters, with more working as freelancers, and a number of redundancies are likely — including some well-known faces — after a consultation process. Its news team is also set to be restructured, with reporters told they will need to provide more “original newsgathering”. Sky Sports News insists the move is not to save money but rather to deliver the news more quickly and be more creative.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States mens' and women's national teams will soon be back in action, with Emma Hayes' side set to play two friendlies at the end of May, and Mauricio Pochettino's men prepped to start their Gold Cup run in June. In this week's roundtable, FOX Sports soccer reporters Doug McIntyre and Laken Litman look ahead to the upcoming international windows and look back at the last week in American soccer. Johnny Cardoso scored his fourth goal of the La Liga season last week. Also, few USMNT jobs should be safe after last month's losses to Panama and Canada. In the latter defeat, U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino pulled starting midfield trio Tyler Adams, Weston McKennie and Christian Pulisic — arguably his three most important players — off the field with 30 minutes remaining and the Americans down a goal. As for Musah, Poch has deployed him mostly as a winger or fullback, and the 22-year-old hasn't gotten off AC Milan's bench since manager Sérgio Conceição pulled him 22 minutes into a 2-2 tie with Fiorentina on April 5. If Pulisic moves back to his usual spot on the the wing with the U.S., it wouldn't shock me to see Cardoso, who has also been unlucky with injuries since Pochettino took over, finally get an extended look alongside Adams and McKennie. Will he make the World Cup squad next summer? It probably helped Aaronson and a few other regulars who just missed out not to be involved last month, given how poor the U.S. was over the two games. The 24-year-old runs and flights — two qualities that were sorely lacking in Los Angeles. The Philadelphia Union product is also a better player than he was when he last played in the Prem in 2022-23. He's also added some muscle to his frame, which should make him more physically prepared for the Premier League this time around. Pochettino recently watched Watford take on Burnley in the Championship, presumably to scout left back Caleb Wiley. Keep in mind that Burnley, which was also promoted this weekend, also has an American in forward Luca Koleosho, although Koleosho would need to petition FIFA for a one-time switch of association from Italy in order to rep the U.S. I don't believe that has happened to date. As for Wiley, the Nations League games showed how thin the USMNT is at left back behind Antonee "Jedi" Robinson. With Kristoffer Lund apparently not in Pochettino's plans, right-footed Joe Scally filled in for Jedi against the Panamanians, while Columbus's Max Arfsten manned the left corner versus Canada. The 20-year-old Wiley, who is on loan from Chelsea until the end of the season, is at least as deserving of a look there along with fellow 2024 Olympian John Tolkin of Bundesliga side Holstein Kiel. The Women's Champions League final is set with Barcelona taking on Arsenal at Jose Alvalade Stadium in Lisbon, Portugal on May 24. Do the underdog Gunners have a chance to upset two-time defending champion Barça? Lyon wasn't particularly dangerous in its attack, which was a surprise on its own given the talent the squad has, while Arsenal ended up winning the second leg match 4-1 with goals from Mariona Caldentay, Alessia Russo and Caitlin Foord. Will that trio be enough vs. big bad Barca? Barcelona, which has won three of the last four Champions League titles, has a lethal attack that just gashed Chelsea 8-2 on aggregate. Arsenal's defense, which stars USWNT outside back Emily Fox, has a major challenge ahead as it will try to stop (or at least slow down) a squad that features stars like Aitana Bonmati, Salma Paralluelo, Alexia Putellas and Claudia Pina. Chelsea's defense, which includes USWNT center back Naomi Girma, had no response for those players. Trinity Rodman is out indefinitely as she works through pesky back issues, Mallory Swanson has not yet played for the Chicago Stars this season due to personal reasons, and Sophia Wilson is expecting her first child this year. Of course Hayes would love to have a full strength roster for every camp and every friendly, but she's also focused on growing and developing the player pool so that when playmakers like the "Triple Espresso" are unavailable, there are plenty of choices to come in and fill the void. Some players have already proven they can take on that role, including Alyssa Thompson, Catarina Macario and Ally Sentnor, all of whom were quite impressive during the most recent USWNT camps. She was invited to the USWNT's April camp as a training player, and will likely be called into the full squad later this month. Hayes is filling out the depth of her squad quite nicely despite not having some of her biggest stars. Are there any new players who could receive a call up? The new faces here are actually familiar ones. Fishel should return to the fold now that she's building minutes with Chelsea and scored her first goal in more than a year. She was a training player during the April window, and given her relationship with Hayes (who briefly coached her at Chelsea before joining the USWNT), it would seem like a natural inclusion to this roster. Croix Bethune also recently returned to the pitch following an injury. The Washington Spirit midfielder was named 2024 NWSL Rookie of the Year and won a gold medal at last summer's Paris Olympics. She had a setback that derailed her return, but last weekend Bethune played 10 minutes in the Spirit's 3-0 loss to Gotham. It would make sense if Hayes called her up as a training player later this month. She previously wrote for Sports Illustrated, USA Today and The Indianapolis Star. She is the author of "Strong Like a Woman," published in spring 2022 to mark the 50th anniversary of Title IX. Doug McIntyre is a soccer reporter for FOX Sports who has covered United States men's and women's national teams at FIFA World Cups on five continents.</p>

Vicky comes to U.S. Soccer from Tottenham Hotspur in England's Women's Super League, where she served as first team senior assistant head coach since 2021. “We are thrilled to welcome Vicky Jepson to our Youth National Team staff,” said Tracey Kevins, the U.S. Soccer Head of Development for the Women's and Girls' YNTs. Her leadership will be instrumental in driving our U-20 program, which serves as a crucial step in our National Team pathway.” During Jepson's time in North London, Spurs reached their first-ever FA Cup Final and Jepson earned her UEFA Pro License in June of 2024, becoming one of 17 female coaches to have completed the course with the England Football Association. “Working alongside the incredible leadership of Tracey, (U.S. Soccer Sporting Director) Matt Crocker and of course a serial winner in Emma Hayes is an amazing opportunity. Before joining Spurs, Jepson served as manager at Liverpool Women, having earlier held the role of assistant manager, where she was named FA Female Development Coach of the Year. She spent more than 10 years at Liverpool in various youth development roles and then with the First Team. “I'm truly honored and excited to start my next chapter with the U.S. Soccer Federation," said Jepson. “I'm well aware of the great work that has been done in the past, that is being done currently under Emma and Tracey, and I know there are some ambitious plans for the future. There is such a rich pool of talent in the USA and I'm so proud to be part of the players' journey to senior international football.” Jepson has experience working on the international level as well. Head coach positions for the U.S. U-23 WNT and U.S. U-18 WNT remain open but are slated to be filled in the near future.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This newly branded competition organized by FIFA this summer is seen as the great solution for a much more disappointing 24/25 season than initially desired by the white supporters. In the context of this tournament, which brings together the best clubs on the planet, a transfer offer has been recorded that could reunite Real Madrid with a recent legend. According to information handled by the Saudi media '365Scores', Cristiano Ronaldo could change teams in the coming weeks to attend this tournament held in the United States. From Saudi Arabia, they report that Cristiano Ronaldo would be in the sights of Al-Hilal, a team participating in the Club World Cup and set to face Real Madrid. Al-Hilal's attempts to secure the signing of the now captain of Al-Nassr, one of their most important players, have failed according to information published by 'Fichajes.com'. With Cristiano Ronaldo's rejection of Al-Hilal's advances, the possibility of the former '7' white and Real Madrid crossing paths again is eliminated. That reunion, moreover, would have occurred in the first match of the Club World Cup for both teams, a match on June 18, 2025. The end of Cristiano Ronaldo's soccer career is framed in a record of great prestige: he could be the first player to officially reach 1,000 goals. One of the important competitions to achieve this figure was the Asian Champions League, a tournament from which Al-Nassr was recently eliminated in their semifinal clash against Kawasaki. For now, he has rejected the opportunity to reunite with Real Madrid in the 2025 Club World Cup.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Will the former Bayern Munich coach jump to a club after the next Men's World Cup? Germany men's national team coach Julian Nagelsmann recently extended his contract past the 2026 World Cup and through EURO 2028 — but the former Bayern Munich man will reportedly have an out, if a club wants to take it. From Sky Sport DE journalist Florian Plettenberg, as captured by @iMiaSanMia: The clause is valid for summer 2027. Nagelsmann will certainly lead the national team at next year's World Cup. Nagelsmann's extension through 2028 always raised some eyebrows. Would the young coach really take such a long stay with a national team, after the intensity of a yet-undecided World Cup tournament? It is certainly conceivable, but the presence of a manageable release clause opens up options. Should Germany rock in 2026 it would not be out of the question to see Nagelsmann have his pick of prized club gigs — Elsewhere, Hansi Flick is reported to be taking his FC Barcelona stay year-by-year...as shared by The Athletic's Barça reporter Pol Ballús. It's far out but could all the remontadas happen — Nagelsmann back to Bayern and Flick back to the German men's national team? Hansi Flick in talks to sign a one-year contract extension at Barça. Full focus on games remaining and potential trophies to win. ▪️ Flick has rejected to sign a longer extension. Check your inbox for a welcome email.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donovan had been in New York for a media brunch promoting the upcoming Club World Cup that's set to take place across 12 venues in the U.S. beginning June 14 in Miami. “I can feel it anecdotally, and then I can feel it just in the attention around [the sport],” Donovan said. “We could spend 10 years growing the sport organically … but one iconic moment next summer takes it exponentially higher,” Donovan said about any momentum for soccer in the U.S. “There's nothing that can replicate that, and that's part of the reason why I'm so passionate about when our national team doesn't play well or doesn't play proud. Donovan, who played in three World Cups for the United States and was named by The Guardian as the greatest male U.S. soccer player of all time in 2015, explained that the biggest thing for the United States to be successful in 2026 is playing with “pride.” Though the major focus is on 2026, Donovan is excited for Americans to get a taste of the Club World Cup this summer. MetLife Stadium will host matches, including the championship game. The American soccer great believes, similar to March Madness, that fans would fall in love with teams they'd never been exposed to until now. “I've just learned with fandom, like there's no one reason someone becomes a fan,” Donovan said. Sometimes you go to watch another team, and then all of a sudden, that team catches your eye.” Among the notable teams in the Club World Cup are Manchester City, Chelsea, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, along with Saudi giant Al Hilal.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>(KRON) — San Jose's own and two-time FIFA Women's World Cup champion and two-time Olympic soccer gold medalist Brandi Chastain visited East Palo Alto on Thursday for “Move Your Body, Calm Your Mind Day.” FIFA World Cup could bring half a billion dollars to Bay Area: CA senator “Move Your Body, Calm Your Mind Day” brought more than 250 kids to celebrate the importance of movement, mindfulness and play. Participants took part in activities such as Zumba dancing, games of pickleball and soccer, crafts, cooking, and yoga. “Our students had so much fun celebrating alongside and learning from leaders like First Partner Jennifer Siebel Newsom and Brandi Chastain, an iconic World Cup and Olympic soccer star,” added Jenny Obiaya, CEO of Boys & Girls Clubs of the Peninsula. Chastain has the Bay Area in her blood. She attended Davis Junior High School in San Jose and played for its boys' soccer team when there was no girls' team. “Move Your Body, Calm Your Mind” was formed in 2023 by the Governor's Advisory Council on Physical Fitness and Mental Well-Being, the California Department of Health Care Services, and the California Department of Public Health.
