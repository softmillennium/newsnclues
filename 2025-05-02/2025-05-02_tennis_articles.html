                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shortly after, news broke that Sinner had accepted a three-month suspension from tennis, which would see him miss the first four Masters 1000 tournaments of the year. As Sinner's preparation ramps up, one of his closest friends on the ATP Tour has fulfilled a promise he made earlier this year. When news broke of Sinner's suspension earlier this year, his Italian teammate, Lorenzo Sonego, told la Repubblica he would be happy to train with him as soon as possible. “Obviously, Jannik [Sinner] can always count on me,” he said. “The wait will only increase his desire.” Keeping his promise to the world number one, Sonego trained with Sinner in Monte-Carlo recently, sharing a picture on social media. Sinner and Sonego have played one another five times previously on the ATP Tour, with the former coming out victorious on all five occasions. The pair have only played one Grand Slam match against each other, at the US Open two years ago, when Sinner advanced to the third round with a straight-sets win. Sinner and Sonego have also played doubles together at several ATP tournaments, but are yet to win a title together. Having missed three months due to suspension, Sinner will be eager to return with a big win at his home event. Six-time champion Djokovic won't take to the court in Rome, having struggled in his previous two clay-court appearances. Question marks surrounding the fitness of Carlos Alcaraz remain prominent after he skipped the Madrid Open due to injury, and defending champion Alexander Zverev has yet to show any consistent form in 2025. The path to a maiden Italian Open title looks clearer than ever for Sinner, as he will no doubt be roared on by the crowd in Rome. Sinner will return to action at the 2025 Italian Open, which begins on Monday, May 5.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A recent report has discussed plans being considered by Iga Swiatek and her team which would involve the world No 2 taking an extended break from tennis after Roland Garros by skipping the grass-court season, in favour of an extended US Open build-up. “As we hear unofficially, everything will depend on the results in Rome and Paris,” Onet stated. “In the event of a defeat, [Iga] Swiatek may consider giving up playing on grass, there are not many points to lose here, and use this time for a longer vacation, to return to hard courts with new strength and properly prepare for the US Open. “But Team Swiatek will wait until the very end with this decision.” “For sure, I want to have some days off, especially because I didn't have [any] after Stuttgart,” commented the WTA world No 2. WTA Rankings Winners & Losers Madrid Open: Gauff rises, Swiatek & Pegula suffer blows, Sabalenka dominant ‘Iga Swiatek has unravelled – it's like the computer is malfunctioning' Despite grass not being Swiatek's favoured surface, her coach – Wim Fissette – made clear that a focus in 2025 would be improving on quicker surfaces, such as grass. “A bit more behind the baseline and still trying to play her heavy spin balls because that's where she is so difficult to play because she plays with so much spin, and the ball bounces off your racket. “I feel sometimes when it goes fast, she tries to play faster than her opponent, which is not really her game, so she should stay true to herself on the faster surfaces. Iga Swiatek's biggest problem has been identified after a "shocking performance" at the Madrid Open.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iga Swiatek and her team are planning to take drastic measures following her disappointing defeat to Coco Gauff. The pair met in Thursday's Madrid Open semi-final, where Gauff demolished the reigning champion 6-1 6-1 in a little over an hour. It's been a tough season for Swiatek, who has not even reached a final, and confessed that she struggled to find her form throughout the fortnight in Madrid. Following her one-sided defeat to Gauff on Thursday, in which she hit 28 unforced errors and won only two games, Swiatek admitted that she needed a break. “For sure, I want to have some days off, especially because I didn't have [any] after Stuttgart. There were questions over whether Swiatek would turn up at the Italian Open next week to defend her crown. Just in    Andy Murray snubbed by Mirra Andreeva despite tennis star's 'beautiful' comment This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. If she suffers more disappointing losses, the five-time Grand Slam champion may reportedly skip the entire grass season, including Wimbledon, to take an extended vacation before turning her attention to the US Open and North American hard-court swing. Grass is Swiatek's weakest surface, and the 23-year-old has just 130 points to defend on it. In 2024, she did not play any regular tour events on the grass, only competing at Wimbledon, where she reached the third round. It has also emerged that Swiatek's grandfather passed away ahead of the Madrid Open, and the world No. Swiatek has not spoken publicly about her loss, but her team confirmed the news to Polish media outlets. The Pole will return to action in Rome next week and benefits from a first-round bye as one of the top seeds, meaning she won't need to play her opening match until later in the week. 2 will then head to Paris as she bids to win the French Open for a fourth time in a row and the fifth overall. But, if things don't go to plan on the clay, fans may not get to see her at the All England Club this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jack Draper expressed his concern for something that is becoming a growing issue on the ATP Tour. There was little turnaround between some tournaments last season and the introduction of two-week Masters 1000 events has been divisive to say the least. After making the Madrid Open semi-finals, the British number one has had his say on a topic that continues to be a big talking point. Though Jack Draper is still one of the younger players on tour, he has gained several years of experience on the circuit. He experienced when each Masters 1000 event was one week, before they were changed to two-week tournaments in 2024. Ahead of the 2024 Laver Cup, he said: “Many believe that this is a good calendar, but others think there are too many mandatory tournaments and there will probably be years with even more. Right now there are many players injured due to the calendar and other factors, but at some point, there will be players who will have to skip tournaments because they have to take care of their bodies, families, and other aspects of life besides tennis.” But during her pre-Madrid Open press conference, Aryna Sabalenka spoke up in favour of the longer WTA 1000 events. “I prefer two-week tournaments because having a day off between matches allows you to relax more, go out to dinner with your team, and explore the city,” Sabalenka said. “Maybe in a few years I won't be so interested in that and prefer to spend more time at home, but right now, that's my mentality.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Like any world-class athlete, the competitor inside Casper Ruud is constantly looking for more. There's a special kind of mindset required to stay elite, one that pushes boundaries, makes hard sacrifices and asks questions that ultimately lead back to, ‘How can I get better? During a phone interview just before Indian Wells, the former world No. I'm privileged, but it's a bit scary to get to that point and feel like you're too comfortable in the situation you're living,” he said.

I'm privileged, but it's a bit scary to get to that point and feel like you're too comfortable in the situation you're living,” he said. Expanding further, Ruud explained, “I think that's a human mistake to find yourself in the comfort zone too often. If that circle keeps growing bigger in the areas where it isn't now, it's a good thing.”At the time, Ruud had come off a “surprise” final showing at the Dallas Open before a stomach bug prevented him from any hope of taking his 2024 Acapulco runner-up effort one step further.

I think that's a human mistake to find yourself in the comfort zone too often. Twelve months after advancing to the Monte Carlo final and winning his first ATP 500 trophy in Barcelona, Ruud went 3-2 in his return to those tour stops. It's human nature to go through periods where head and heart aren't on the same page. While Casper the tennis player was eager to test his boundaries, Casper the person wasn't in sync with that ambition.“I've been kind of feeling not great mentally this year,” Ruud revealed to press on Thursday.“It just came down to me feeling like I'm running in this hamster wheel and I'm never kind of getting anywhere, or you're just stuck in it and I needed to kind of jump out of it a little to review where I was going and how I was feeling.”The 26-year-old came to terms that life on the road had taken its toll. Recognizing he needed help, Ruud noted he now has an outlet to discuss what's going on.“I've seeked help, which has really worked for me,” he said.In having—and trusting—that resource, a more familiar-looking Casper has resurfaced at the Mutua Madrid Open. “I've been kind of feeling not great mentally this year,” Ruud revealed to press on Thursday.“It just came down to me feeling like I'm running in this hamster wheel and I'm never kind of getting anywhere, or you're just stuck in it and I needed to kind of jump out of it a little to review where I was going and how I was feeling.”The 26-year-old came to terms that life on the road had taken its toll.

Casper Ruud opened up about navigating mental health challenges ❤️‍🩹#MMOpen pic.twitter.com/YB7ul1Dtop His past two victories over Taylor Fritz and Daniil Medvedev marked his first two Top 10 wins of the year, and should the No. 14 seed defeat Francisco Cerundolo on Friday, an immediate Top 10 return awaits Ruud next week.🖥️📱 Click here for live coverage on TennisChannel.com (estimated start time 10 a.m., Friday, May 2)“I'm happy to feel more joy and feel like I'm in a better place, I guess, and feel like I'm waking up every day with a smile on my face,” he said. Tennis is not just about hitting the balls well or being quick around the court, but it's also a very, very mindful game. In learning about Ruud's mental health admission, it perhaps adds greater context to the classy move in line with his character made Thursday. After reigning Madrid women's champion Iga Swiatek fell to Coco Gauff, 6-1, 6-1, and thus extending her hunt for a first title since clinching a Roland Garros three-peat last June, the Norwegian expressed empathy and support for the Pole on his X account.“Hey @iga_swiatek keep your head up. Like millions of other people, I love watching you play. Like millions of other people, I love watching you play. Hey @iga_swiatek keep your head up🙏🙏Like millions of other people I love watching you play. When Ruud and I spoke a couple months ago about the concept of backing up results, he wasn't focused on the burden of his 2024 clay-court output to come.“You can't really think about points, points, points all the time. You have to enjoy each match and take it one at a time as well,” he commented.For someone navigating an everlasting hamster wheel, that outlook hits differently today. As getting out of bed with a sense of purpose and a beaming disposition are the points on the board that decide how one can get better.

The victory, sealed in just 77 minutes, sets up a final-four clash with Lorenzo Musetti at 7pm on Friday, live on Sky Sports, after the Italian's 6-4 6-3 quarter-final victory over Gabriel Diallo. "The next part of my game was just getting strong, getting more capable physically to do the things I know I can do and bully these guys. My forehand is doing a lot of damage, and I want to keep it up," Draper added. "I have been doing everything in all areas pretty well and am excited to keep on going.

Gauff and Swiatek had met 14 times previously, with the head-to-head heavily in favour of the five-time Grand Slam champion Swiatek at 11 wins to three, with Gauff never having beaten the Pole on clay. But Swiatek's frustration grew as Gauff stormed back from 0-1 down to win 11 games in a row and 12 of the last 13. Swiatek looked rattled, her composure cracking as the match spiralled out of her reach and in a rare lapse of composure, she was hit with a code violation for an audible obscenity. Maybe it wasnt her best level," Gauff said. Watch the ATP and WTA Tours, as well as the US Open, live on Sky Sports in 2025 or stream without a contract on NOW.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Winning a Grand Slam is considered the highest achievement in tennis, but some players are never able to repeat their triumphs. However, that doesn't mean they are not part of history. Many “one-Slam wonders” include iconic names such as Gastón Gaudio and the beloved Jana Notvona. Meanwhile, others become legends of their country, such as Francesca Schiavone. Known for her clay-court strength and rare one-handed backhand in the WTA Tour, she followed her French Open title with another final appearance in 2011. Schiavone turned professional in 1998 and competed for over 20 seasons. 4 in January 2011 and made 70 Grand Slam main draw appearances. Few players matched her durability or consistency across two decades on tour. “I wanted to win Roland Garros and become top 10,” she later told The Sit Down podcast. She nearly defended her title in 2011 but lost the final to Li Na. In 2011, she also played the longest recorded women's singles match at a Grand Slam, defeating Svetlana Kuznetsova 6–4, 1–6, 16–14 in 4 hours and 44 minutes at the Australian Open. Schiavone finished her career with eight WTA singles titles — including Roland Garros — and seven runner-up finishes. She was also a cornerstone of Italy's Fed Cup success. Representing her country, Schiavone helped secure three Fed Cup titles in 2006, 2009, and 2010. (L-R) Flavia Pennetta, Roberta Vinci, Sara Errani and Francesca Schiavone of Italy pose with the trophy following their Fed Cup team victory in 2010 (Photo by Jeff Gross/Getty Images) Her style stood out in an era of baseline power. With a one-handed backhand and creative point construction, she often succeeded against more physically dominant players. Schiavone announced her retirement at the 2018 US Open, closing a 20-year professional career. “I tried to do something that for me is very important, to leave something in this sport,” she said at the time. I have won this fight,” she shared on social media. In a later interview with the WTA, she said, “I'm healthy now. As of January 2025, she is coaching young Austrian player Lilli Tagger. “And to enjoy life, even if I'm always running.” Schiavone's Grand Slam win may define her in headlines, but her full legacy includes national team glory, career longevity, and a determined return from illness… All built on the same resilience that once took her to the top. She also works as an entertainment journalist at Spoiler US, focusing on the film industry, series, reality TV, and celebrity news. With a diverse background that includes reporting on sports, fashion, and culture, she brings a rich and varied perspective to her current roles. Natalia holds a Bachelor's degree in Communication and Media from the Universidad Central of Venezuela (UCV) and has over eight years of experience in digital media.
