                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DOM Joly hopes Scots can help him tackle tin foil hatters on his bonkers book tour – after travelling the world to learn all sorts of conspiracies. The comedian, best known for Trigger Happy TV, set out on a global journey to pen a unique guide into some of the most weird and wonderful theories. “If someone comes along they're always focused on a single issue. Whereas a lot of conspiracists in America live almost entirely remote existences online so no one tells you you're talking s**e.” A Reddit user once shared a joke about the small nation and it was quickly picked up by some impressionable people. But 20 per cent of people took it seriously and the conspiracy is that in 1917 Russia and Japan invented a country called Finland and that it's actually just sea so that they could have the fishing rights. “So they claim when I fly to Finland I'm landing in a remote part of either Sweden or Russia and that all four million inhabitants of Finland are crisis actors like a massive Truman Show. “I found the bloke who started it and he said he was told that Finland didn't exist because Russia and Japan conspired to invent the country so that they could have all the fish, which was then transported to Japan for sushi. “Clearly that's BS ecause I just flew there, right? I couldn't 100 per cent prove to you now that Finland exists. I could probably prove 99 per cent that it does and it's that one per cent where all conspiracy theories live.” He's also heard how Paul McCartney was cloned in 1966; how Avril Lavigne stopped performing 10 years ago and was replaced by a woman called Melissa; and that Prince Philip killed Diana by going to the tunnel in Paris and putting in an industrial laser to blind the car driver. But Dom reckons conspiracy theories can best be broken down into three big causes — the assassination of JFK, 9/11 and Coronavirus. He also thinks the advent of YouTube and social media has emboldened dangerous characters who are profiting from things they don't even believe in. The comic said: “I can pinpoint the exact moment when they went from being harmless and fun to more dangerous and it was when Kellyanne Conway, who was Donald Trump's spokeswoman in 2016, used the term ‘alternative facts'. “And the moment you have alternative facts, frankly we're f***ed. During lockdown I was stuck in my room and spending too much time online and I noticed the rise in conspiracies. “Conspiracies tend to happen a lot when everything's in turmoil and the economy's bad and people get troubled, and I started to talk to these people a lot or argue with them “And I just couldn't work out whether they were genuinely believing this stuff or were just doing it for clicks. I don't think many were harming anyone, except for that erosion of truth. But it's the grifters that I really have a problem with. “The people like Alex Jones who literally are making money by claiming the kids killed in school shootings are actors, then the parents get hassled online and they have to move house and stuff. Main festival events will be live at Dumfries House. Events in the main three venues will also be live-streamed. However, there are some conspiracy theories that even Dom was swayed by. He explained: “I'm not sure UFOs are a conspiracy. But UFO means unidentified flying object and it doesn't necessarily mean aliens. I think there is some sort of phenomenon that maybe we're not aware of, but it seems very odd because all they seem to do — if they do exist — is land in Alabama and probe toothless rednecks. He added: “Weirdly, as much as I had a massive problem with the anti-vax people because I think they did a lot of damage to vulnerable people by frightening them, I have questions about the idea that Covid started as a bat in a wet market in Wuhan, when weirdly the largest coronavirus research facility in China is like half a mile from that market. “It seems quite a coincidence and I think it's not beyond the realms of possibility that it was a lab leak, and that the Chinese government might try and shut that down. Then it gets turned into this massive conspiracy that it's being used as a bio-weapon and that it's not affecting Jewish people or Chinese people, which was one of the conspiracies, and that vaccines are being used by Bill Gates to put a microchip in your brain. So all these things maybe start with a kernel of something and then turn into insane theories.” Now they can all meet up and that gives them power.” Dom Joly is appearing at Boswell Book Festival on May 10, tickets can be booked boswellbookfestival.co.uk.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For the most part, the various proclamations have fallen well short, with countless false alarms ranging from alien radio signals to UFO fragments beneath the Pacific giving most a healthy dose of skepticism when evaluating new "evidence" of alien lifeforms. And yet, studies find that belief in extraterrestrial life is at an all-time high, with nearly a quarter of Americans stating that they'd seen a UFO with their own eyes. The team obtained this evidence using NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, a telescope designed to study the earliest periods of the universe and a key cog in astronomers' search for life beyond our planet. This evidence, it argues, suggests K2-18b, a sub-Neptune planet nearly nine times larger than Earth and 124 light-years away, may be covered by a hydrogen-rich ocean full of organisms like phytoplankton. If confirmed, it would be the first proof of extraterrestrial life and a major leap in man's understanding of the cosmos. Used by NASA to discover over 3,000 new exoplanets, an easy way to understand it is to imagine a solar eclipse in miniature: as a planet orbits a star, it reaches a point where it passes directly between its star and the satellite, temporarily blocking some of the starlight reaching the telescope. Interestingly, the light changes color as it passes through the atmosphere, allowing scientists to measure its size, temperature, and chemical composition. This isa strong indicator that the planet could be hospitable. This time, looking at a different set of wavelengths, Madhusudhan found stronger evidence — up to a supposed 99.7% certainty  — that K2-18b's atmosphere contained two gases typically generated by lifeforms like algae: dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide. While scientists applauded Madhusudan's work, they also remain skeptical. Others, like Director of the Seti Institute's Carl Sagan Center Nathalie Cabrol, expressed concern over the data itself, it comes with several caveats. Stephen Schmidt, an astronomer at Johns Hopkins, likewise noted to the Scientific American that the findings were "pretty noisy," possibly a result of "statistical fluctuations." The researchers, for their part, state that there is a .3% chance of statistical error, well below the 0.00006% typically required of scientific discoveries. While dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide are formed on Earth exclusively by living organisms, it doesn't mean they cannot be made abiotically. In fact, scientists have found several instances of such, even once discovering them on a lifeless comet. One paper posited that an inhospitable magma ocean could also produce these gases on K2-18b. Madhusudan, for his part, cautioned that additional observations were required to confirm his team's results, particularly the need to investigate the potential abiotic production of dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide. With these caveats in mind, the Cambridge study's lasting impact may be that it kicks off an exciting era of experiments centered on K2-18b. Whether it results in the ultimate discovery, however, remains to be seen.</p>

Upcoming film “Hi-5” has unveiled new stills of Ahn Jae Hong ahead of its premiere!

“Hi-5” is a comic action adventure that tells the story of five individuals who unexpectedly gain different superpowers through organ transplants and get entangled in events involving those who seek to exploit their abilities.

Ahn Jae Hong takes on the role of Ji Seong, an aspiring writer who, after receiving a lung transplant, acquires remarkable lung capacity that enables him to unleash powerful winds. He is well-versed in superhero-style stories and plays a key role in forming the Hi-5 team as he searches for others who have developed similar supernatural powers through transplants.

He also shares a sibling-like bond with high school student Wan Seo (Lee Jae In) and a playful, teasing dynamic with his same-aged friend Gi Dong (Yoo Ah In).

In the newly released stills, he is seen wearing a bobbed hairstyle that seems ready to be swept by the wind. One photo shows him with a pain relief patch on his wrist, while another features him wearing goggles, piquing curiosity about what kind of events he will become entangled in.

 

Speaking about his hairstyle, Ahn Jae Hong shared, “Since the character controls the wind, I wanted my hair to clearly reflect the movement of the wind.” He added, “Along with showcasing the superpower, I wanted to portray the character's personality and growth.”

Director Kang Hyung Chul also praised his portrayal, commenting, “Ji Seong is a character who, through ‘Hi-5,' comes to discover both the value of his power and himself.”

“Hi-5” is set to hit theaters on June 3.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thrilling new play based on the global horror phenomenon makes North American debut in limited run at STC. Shakespeare Theatre Company has announced the addition of a strictly limited two-week engagement of the thrilling new play, Paranormal Activity: A New Story Live on Stage, a special add-on production for the 25/26 season. The haunting thriller is written by celebrated playwright Levi Holloway, whose Tony-nominated Grey House premiered on Broadway in 2023. The production is directed by Felix Barrett, pioneering founder and artistic director of the acclaimed Punchdrunk — whose immersive Sleep No More played more than 5,000 performances in a record-breaking 14-year run. Synopsis: James and Lou move from Chicago to London to escape their past… An original story set in the world of the terrifying Paranormal Activity film franchise, this thrilling new play will haunt you long after the lights go out. Paranormal Activity's sold-out UK premiere was hailed “a delicious mix of fear and excitement” (North West End) — urging “make sure you have someone's hand to hold” (Yorkshire Times). “Writing Paranormal Activity: A New Story Live on Stage, collaborating with Felix Barrett in London — working to create an actual nightmare — has been a dream,” said playwright Holloway. They'll find it here, right alongside all the mischief we've made to trouble their sleep.” Tickets will go on sale to the general public later this summer. By arrangement with Paramount Pictures and Simon Friend Entertainment Under the leadership of Artistic Director Simon Godwin and Executive Director Angela Lee Gieras, STC tells vital stories in audacious forms, stories that are Shakespearean in the deepest sense, even if they are not written by Shakespeare.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Doctors at Iran's Isfahan University of Medicine recently documented the case of a 23-year-old male whose head dropped to a 90-degree angle because his neck muscles could no longer support it. such as an unusually large head, but doctors at an Iranian university recently reported a previously undocumented case of CKS caused by years of substance abuse. The 23-year-old  unnamed patient was described as “hailing from a socioeconomically disadvantaged background,” with “a significant medical history of major depressive disorder and substance abuse, including addiction to heroin, opium, and amphetamines.” Doctors at the Isfahan University of Medicine wrote that “after every episode of amphetamine use, the patient consistently maintained a fixed kyphotic neck position for extended periods, leading to a progressive alteration in his cervical alignment.” Cranial nerve testing yielded normal results, as did muscle strength and autonomic function tests, but a CT scan revealed a severe kyphoscoliosis deformity affecting the patient's C3, C4, and C5 vertebrae. After assessing the severity of his condition, doctors opted for a three-stage surgical solution to remove the deformed bone and realign his neck in a proper position. Doctors reported that the 23-year-old patient had tried various traditional and herbal remedies, but none had alleviated his symptoms, so he eventually sought medical attention. “We discovered that drug abuse contributed to the uncommon development of severe complicated cervical kyphosis,” the Iranian doctors wrote in their case report. “The drug does not have a direct effect on musculoskeletal changes. Instead, there is an indirect effect: When the patient uses the drug, they remain in a certain position for a long time, and over months, this results in musculoskeletal changes that lead to kyphoscoliosis.” The previously undocumented connection between severe substance abuse and dropped head syndrome has been given the name “intoxicated syndrome”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new photo claiming to show a 1,000-foot-wide UFO in the American Southwest has been released by unidentified aerial phenomenon disclosure activists — but critics claim the “disclosure” is more of an embarrassing mistake. Controversial former Department of Defense employee and activist Luis “Lue” Elizondo hosted a UAP Disclosure Fund-organized panel during which he released an alleged photo of a “1,000-foot”-wide, silver, disc-shaped flying saucer. “Captured near Four Corners at FL20 — estimated 600 – 1,000 ft in diameter, silver-hued, disc-shaped,” the UAP Disclosure Fund posted on X. ✈️ NEW PHOTO (civilian pilot)Captured near Four Corners at FL210—estimated 600-1,000 ft in diameter, silver-hued, disc-shaped.Released moments ago by @LueElizondo during our “Science, National Security & Innovation” panel. “Several speakers confirmed [Department of Defense] and [Intelligence Community] hold hundreds of similar UAP images + sensor files still classified,” the advocacy group alleged, adding, “It's time for full declassification and open scientific analysis.” Critics were quick to challenge the presentation — with many eagle-eyed debunkers claiming the photo merely showed irrigation circles that are common in desert climates. ⬅️LEFT: a photo of a "UFO" presented by UFO lobbyists to credulous members of Congress today➡️RIGHT: a photo of normal irrigation circlesThe UFO lobby asked @RepLuna, @RepEricBurlison and @RepTimBurchett for $1 billion in taxpayer funds to hunt UFOs. Elizondo has previously come under fire for presenting evidence of UAPs or UFOs that were later debunked — with the Pentagon pushing back against claims that alien life is present on Earth. The UAP Disclosure Fund panel included US Reps. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) and Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.) and Harvard astrophysicist Professor Avi Loeb for a discussion Thursday in Washington, DC. Astrophysicist and nuclear engineer Eric Davis, another member of the panel, claimed during the event that there are four types of alien species that have visited planet Earth, namely “grays,” “Nordics,” “reptilian” and “insectoid.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On the eve of Australia's national poll to determine its next leader, two hunks of meat were dangled above a murky pool. Attached to one line, the picture of prime minister, Anthony Albanese. In the water lurked a 36-year-old saltwater crocodile called Speckles. So it's only fitting Speckles was once again put to the test, this time with chunks of buffalo meat. “That is a form of interpreting portents to work out what is going to happen in the future.” Once again Speckles predicted the fall of a government – only this time, he was decisive. In 2022, the 4.8 metre saltie predicted, via plucked chook, that Albanese would defeat then prime minister Scott Morrison. “But they took control of their own lives.” Which is another tradition that Anne-Marie Condé, senior curator at the Museum Of Australian Democracy At Old Parliament House, hopes lives on in the modern world. And this sense of ownership over the democratic process means that “we can have a little fun with it if we want to”. “It's fun watching crocodiles decide who might be the next prime minister,” Condé says. “But you know what: your vote does count, it's not a random thing. “So it's great if people can have a bit of think before they vote to how they want to use that vote – because the outcome will determine the future of us all.”</p>
