            Germany's domestic intelligence agency on Friday classified the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) as an extremist entity that threatens democracy, a move enabling it to better monitor the party that came second in February's federal election.
    


            The BfV agency's finding, based on a 1,100-page expert report, that the AfD is racist and anti-Muslim allows the authorities to increase surveillance of the party, including by recruiting confidential informants and intercepting communications.
    


            The stigma could also hamper the party's ability to attract members, while public funding could be at risk.
    


            The AfD, which currently tops several opinion polls, condemned the decision, while political analysts said it risked further fueling support for the party.
    


            “Central to our assessment is the ethnically and ancestrally defined concept of the people that shapes the AfD, which devalues entire segments of the population in Germany and violates their human dignity,” the domestic intelligence agency said in a statement.
    


            “This concept is reflected in the party's overall anti-migrant and anti-Muslim stance.”
    


            The AfD has “defamed and vilified” individuals and groups, stirring up “irrational fears and hostility toward them,” it added.
    


            In the party's first response to the report, the leader of a regional parliamentary group, Anton Baron, said: “It is sad to see the state of democracy in our country when the established parties now resort to the most politically questionable means to act against the strongest opposition party.”
    


            The intelligence decision comes days before conservative leader Friedrich Merz is due to be sworn in as Germany's new chancellor and amid a heated debate within his party over how to deal with the AfD in the new parliament.
    


            The party won a record number of seats, theoretically entitling it to chair several key parliamentary committees.

            A prominent Merz ally, Jens Spahn, has called for treating the AfD as a regular opposition party in parliamentary procedures, arguing that this approach prevents the party from adopting a ‘victim' narrative.
    


            However, other established parties as well as many within Spahn's own conservatives have rejected that approach - and could use Friday's news as justification for blocking AfD attempts to lead key committees.
    


            “There is tension between a party's claim to chair positions based on its size and the freedom of conscience of the members of parliament,” said political scientist Wolfgang Schroeder at Kassel University.
    


            “Now, these members can argue that AfD representatives do not meet the necessary standards. The signs are mounting that the AfD is not a normal party, and as a result, it will continue to be marginalized.”
    


            The classification could reignite attempts to get the AfD banned, but Germany's outgoing chancellor Olaf Scholz, whose Social Democrats will be the junior partner in Merz's new coalition, advised against rushing to outlaw the AfD.
    


            “I am against a quick shot, we have to evaluate the classification carefully,” he said on Friday at a church convention in the northern city of Hanover.
    


            The German parliament could also attempt to limit or halt public funding to the AfD - but for that authorities would need evidence that the party is explicitly out to undermine or even overthrow German democracy.
    


            Certain factions of the AfD such as its youth wing had already been classified as extremist, while the party at large was classified as a suspected extremist case in 2021.
    


            Created to protest the euro zone bailouts in 2013, the euroskeptic AfD morphed into an anti-migration party after Germany's decision to take in a large wave of refugees in 2015.
    


            That the BfV agency needs a certain classification to be able to monitor a political party reflects the fact it is more legally restrained than other European intelligence services, in reaction to the country's experience under both Nazi and Communist rule.

NEW YORK, May 2. /TASS/. The United States does not give up on the matter of settling the conflict in Ukraine but realizes that there are plenty of more important problems across the globe, acting National Security Adviser and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on the air with Fox News television.

""We're not going to give up on it,"" the official said. ""But there does come a point when the President [of the US Donald Trump] has to decide, how much more time at the highest levels of our government do you dedicate,"" Rubio noted. ""Even more important issues going on around the world, not that a war in Ukraine is not important, but I would say what's happening with China is more important in the long term,"" he added.

Washington understands positions of Moscow and Kiev, Rubio said. ""They're closer, but they're still far apart. And it's going to take a real breakthrough here very soon to make this possible, or I think the President is going to have to make a decision about how much more time we're going to dedicate to this,"" the official added.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

LONDON, May 2. /TASS/. The international Euroclear platform plans to seize about €3 billion in frozen Russian assets as compensation to Western investors whose funds were allegedly confiscated by Moscow, Reuters reported, citing a document in its possession and two sources.

The agency notes that the €3 billion in question is part of a larger €10 billion sum belonging to Russian companies and individuals who have been under EU sanctions since 2022. According to Reuters, this move became possible last year following amendments to the sanctions framework.

As Reuters reports, Euroclear notified clients of the forthcoming payments on April 1. ""We received authorisation from our competent authority, to unfreeze the compensation amounts and make these available to our participants,"" the agency quotes the document as saying.

The European Union, Canada, the United States and Japan froze around $300 billion in Russian assets after the launch of the special military operation. Of that total, approximately $5-6 billion is held in the United States, while the lion's share is located in Europe — including $210 billion at the Euroclear platform in Belgium.

In March, European Council President Antonio Costa admitted that the EU cannot unfreeze Russian assets, as the proceeds from their reinvestment act as collateral for military loans extended to Ukraine by the Group of Seven (G7).

Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated that Moscow would not renounce its rights to the frozen assets in the West and would continue to protect them.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Former pardon attorney Liz Oyer said president erased more than ‘$1bn in debts owed by wealthy Americans'

The justice department's pardon attorney, who was recently fired, has claimed on social media that Donald Trump's recent wave of pardoning white-collar criminals has erased more than “$1bn in debts owed by wealthy Americans” to the public purse.

In a TikTok video, Liz Oyer, who has said that she was terminated in March after refusing to comply with an order to restore the gun rights of the actor Mel Gibson – a supporter of Trump's – explained that “when you're convicted of a financial crime like fraud or embezzlement, the law requires you to pay back the money that you stole. It's called restitution.”

However, she said, “the president has the power to pardon which can wipe out your entire sentence including your obligation to pay back the money.”

Oyer alleged: “In total, Donald Trump has granted pardons that have wiped out over $1bn in debts owed by wealthy Americans who have committed fraud and broken the law.”

In the video, Oyer highlights the case of Michele Fiore, a former Republican politician from Nevada, who was convicted of wire fraud last year.

She was accused of misusing more than $70,000 she raised to build statues in honor of two slain police officers. Instead of building the statues, prosecutors said that she used the funds on “personal and political expenses”.

The White House pardoned Fiore, and according to Oyer, this released her from repaying those funds.

In a different video, Oyer pointed to Trump's pardon of Trevor Milton, the founder of an electric vehicle startup, who was convicted of fraud in 2023 and sentenced to four years in prison.

The Washington Post reported that the judge had not yet determined the restitution amount, but that federal prosecutors estimated that Milton owed more than $680m to defrauded shareholders.

Notably, Milton and his wife contributed more than $1.8m to a Trump re-election campaign.

Oyer said his pardon erased the restitution being sought.

The Post reported that Oyer added up the alleged restitution amounts for the relevant individuals convicted of stealing.

The newspaper also noted that some of Trump's pardon recipients had not yet been sentenced, so their owed amounts had not been finalized by the courts.

Additionally, the Post reported that Trump pardoned the cryptocurrency exchange HDR Global Trading (BitMEX), which eliminated a $100m fine against the exchange for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act. Trump also pardoned several company executives who had pleaded guilty to financial crimes.

Oyer told the Post it was “unprecedented for a president to grant pardons that have the effect of wiping out so much debt owed by people who have committed frauds”.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Guardian.

Last month, Oyer, who served in Joe Biden's administration, testified before Congress about her termination and the Trump administration's treatment of the justice department and law firms.

According to Oyer's lawyer, the justice department had planned to send armed US marshals to deliver a letter to her home warning her about testifying.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Tariff chaos hampers Trump's pledge to ‘drill, baby, drill', but analysis still shows surge in planet-heating emissions

Donald Trump's ambitions for the US to “drill, baby, drill” for more fossil fuels have ironically been hampered by the economic chaos unleashed by his own tariffs, but the US is still on track to increase oil and gas extraction, causing a surge in planet-heating emissions, a new analysis shows.

The US was already the world's leading oil and gas power, producing more of the fossil fuels than any country in history during Joe Biden's administration. But Trump has sought to escalate this further, declaring an “energy emergency” to open up more land and ocean for drilling and launching an unprecedented assault on environmental regulations in his first 100 days back in the White House.

This new political climate means that the expected amount of greenhouse gas emissions from active and planned projects in US oil and gas fields has jumped under Trump, after previously dropping under Biden, forecasts shared with the Guardian show.

Despite awarding more drilling leases than Trump in his first 100 days, Biden also pursued policies to combat the climate crisis that saw oil and gas companies revise down their production estimates. That situation has now reversed, threatening a pulse of new pollution that will further add to the fever of a planet already suffering from heatwaves, floods, droughts and other disasters accelerated by global heating.

“The uptick in embodied emissions from forecast US oil and gas production is worrying,” said Olivier Bois von Kursk, policy adviser at the International Institute for Sustainable Development, which tracks emissions projections from the lifetime of projects, based on data from research consultancy Rystad Energy. “The world can't afford more climate chaos.”

Trump has already taken more than 140 initial actions to reverse environmental regulations and promote the use of fossil fuels, dismissing established climate science as a “giant hoax” and exhorting further drilling.

“We have more liquid gold under our feet than any nation on Earth, and by far, and now I fully authorize the most talented team ever assembled to go and get it,” the president told Congress in March. “It's called drill, baby, drill.”

This unabashed support for fossil fuels has been warmly welcomed by the fossil fuel industry, which donated heavily to Trump's campaign. While “drill, baby, drill” won't fully be realized unless Trump manages to push through significant deregulation and tax cuts for the sector, the US will still move towards a record peak of 15m barrels of oil a day, up from about 13.5m barrels a day now, according to projections by Rystad.

“In his first 100 days, President Trump has kept his promise to ‘drill, baby, drill',” said a White House spokesperson. “We're achieving historic results at record speed and we're just getting started.”

The International Energy Agency, which has forecast that global oil and gas demand will peak by 2030, has said that no new major fossil fuel projects can occur if the world is to stay within agreed temperature limits and avoid catastrophic climate impacts. Last year was the hottest, worldwide, ever recorded and governments are collectively failing to meet targets to avert escalating disasters.

Trump's ambitions for more drilling in the US have been clouded, however, by his own economic policies. While oil and gas has been exempt from a barrage of tariffs imposed by Trump, the industry is smarting from tariffs placed on materials such as steel, which it needs for pipelines, and has been unnerved by fears of recession amid an increasingly erratic trade war.

The first 100 days of Trump's administration have been the worst start of any presidency for the stock market since the 1970s, engulfing many fossil fuel firms that have seen their share prices slump.

The price of a barrel of American crude oil briefly dropped below $60, a threshold under which companies cannot operate profitably, before edging up slightly in recent weeks. Opec, the oil cartel, recently increased production at the urging of Trump, further putting downward pressure on the oil price.

This has stirred anger within an oil and gas sector that has otherwise cheered on Trump. “The administration's chaos is a disaster for the commodity markets. ‘Drill, baby, drill' is nothing short of a myth and populist rallying cry,” one executive told a survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.

Said another: “I have never felt more uncertainty about our business in my entire 40-plus-year career.”

The full impact of the tariffs have yet to be seen but industry expectations have been “completely shattered” by their imposition, according to Claudio Galimberti, chief economist at Rystad.

“Investments have been put on hold and the expectations of growth of economic activity have been slashed dramatically,” Galimberti said. “US production is not going to grow in the next five years the same way it has grown in the past five. Until really there is a settlement on the tariffs, there's going to be a lot of volatility.”

While Rystad expects concerns over a recession to pass, and the price of oil to climb back to around $70 a barrel later this year, the outlook for renewable energy may be more difficult, with solar and wind projects facing potential cost increases of up to 30% due to the tariffs and attempts by Trump and Republicans in Congress to eliminate support for clean energy.

Trump has already halted approvals of new solar and wind projects on federal lands and waters and criticized what he calls “scam” subsidies for clean energy. Tariffs on solar panels from Vietnam, Cambodia and Malaysia have been ratcheted up to as much as 3,521%. “We don't want windmills in this country,” the president said shortly after his inauguration in January. “We don't want windmills. You know what else people don't like? Those massive solar fields.”

While more than 90% of new power added to the US electricity grid this year is expected to be from solar, wind and batteries, the administration's turn against renewables is already affecting planned projects that are overwhelmingly located in Republican rural and exurban districts.

Nearly $8bn in planned investments and 16 large-scale clean energy projects were shut, cancelled or downsized in the first three months of the year, according to E2, a nonpartisan business group. “Clean energy companies still want to invest in America, but uncertainty over Trump administration policies and the future of critical clean energy tax credits are taking a clear toll,” said Michael Timberlake, a spokesperson for E2.

Economic disruptions from the fluctuating price of oil, as well the climate impacts from burning oil and other fossil fuels, can be alleviated if “governments and investors make smart choices”, said von Kursk. “Clean energy is more competitive than ever, eroding demand for fossil fuels.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Aged 92, Viktor Gladyshev is the protagonist of a “docufiction,” or the cinematic combination of documentary and fiction, that traces his childhood in a corner of Russia occupied by the Nazis during World War II (WWII).

Gladyshev lived under the German occupation for three months as a child and only narrowly avoided being executed at the age of eight.

Sitting in his modest apartment just outside Moscow, he said he remembers the 1941 occupation “as if it were yesterday.”

His experience is recounted in Iyunskaya polyn (June Wormwood), a film by Yuliya Bocharova released last month, in the run-up to Victory Day celebrations in Moscow on Friday next week.

The film about his life is supported by the Presidential Fund for Cultural Initiatives, a Kremlin-affiliated body.

Russian authorities have sought to stir up patriotic fervor around the 80th anniversary of WWII victory to boost support for its offensive on Ukraine, which began in 2022.

The Kremlin portrays the current conflict as a continuation of the one against Hitler, claiming to be fighting Ukrainian “neo-Nazis.”

Hitler's troops invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, and three months later, Gladyshev's father left for the front. He would die there in 1943.

Aged just eight, Gladyshev, the youngest in a large family, found himself orphaned, as his mother had died before the war.

The children moved in with their aunt and uncle in the village of Smolino, near Naro-Fominsk, 70km southwest of Moscow.

‘STALIN IS KAPUTT'

In the autumn of 1941, German soldiers entered the village without firing a shot.

“Moscow is kaputt, Stalin is kaputt, they shouted at us,” recalled Gladyshev, looking at the past through his pale blue eyes. Nine Germans moved into their house. In the evening, the children had to take the German soldiers' boots off, and in the streets, Russians were ordered to stop every time they ran across a German.

Despite knowing that picking up a Soviet leaflet could mean death, one day he found one and could not resist the urge to tell everyone about it.

“The leaflet read that the enemy had been stopped just near Naro-Fominsk. I told everyone and soon became the hero of the village,” Gladyshev said with a disarming smile.

The morning after, “they took me out for the execution,” he continued unemotionally.

“When I saw the dark barrel of a rifle pointed at my face, I knew I was going to die,” Gladyshev said. “But in that moment, I was rather more interested to see up close how the bullet would be going out of the barrel of the gun.” 

Suddenly, his uncle Ivan “threw himself at the German and pinned his rifle to the ground,” he said.

The uncle was then brutally beaten up, but he survived thanks to an Austrian doctor who intervened.

VICTORY PARADES

In October 1941, the evacuation of Moscow was announced as Hitler's forces approached the capital.

In Smolino, the German unit was replaced by a military orchestra. The mood had changed: The musicians started constantly rehearsing in the village.

Despite the freezing cold, Gladyshev said he followed each rehearsal and watched the conductor closely.

“I became obsessed with the brass instruments,” he said. 

The locals found out that the Germans were preparing for a “Victory Parade” on Red Square. However, it was not to be, as the Red Army had already launched a counter-offensive around Moscow in December. The Nazis retreated, taking the villagers with them on a harrowing journey as human shields.

In a village near Borovsk, 130km southwest of Moscow, Gladyshev said he remembers hearing heartbreaking cries coming from a house with boarded-up windows and doors: The inhabitants were being burned alive by Nazi troops.

“There were some good Germans, too,” he said suddenly and smiled.

One officer lent him a knife to cut a piece of meat from a frozen horse's carcass. 

In December 1941, Gladyshev managed to escape and reach Soviet soldiers. He went on to become a trumpet player and in the end it was he, not the German army's musicians, who got to take part in about 15 Victory Day parades on Red Square.

Following a campaign dominated by Trump's tariffs and annexation threats, Carney promised to chart “a new path forward” in a world “fundamentally changed” by a US that is newly hostile to free trade.
“We are over the shock of the American betrayal, but we should never forget the lessons,” said Carney, who led the central banks of Canada and the UK before entering politics earlier this year.

Taiwan ranked 24th in this year's World Press Freedom Index released by Reporters Without Borders (RSF) yesterday, climbing three places from last year, while press freedom declined in most other countries.

Taiwan was second in the Asia-Pacific region and first in East Asia.

Aleksandra Bielakowska, advocacy manager at RSF's Asia-Pacific Bureau, said that Taiwan's improvement was largely due to declines elsewhere, as the country's global score, which was 77.04 this year, was nearly unchanged from a year earlier.

It was “quite significant” how public trust in the media had grown in Taiwan over the past five years, she said, citing the Reuters Institute's Digital News Report, which showed the metric at 33 percent last year, up from 24 percent in 2020.

However, “government pressure” led English-language public broadcaster TaiwanPlus to remove a report referring to then-US presidential candidate Donald Trump as a “convicted felon” in November last year, Bielakowska said, adding that it was a “rare,” but “deplorable and very worrying” incident.

Public media have a mandate to serve the public and must be able to operate independently from the government, she said.

Public Television Service (PTS), to which TaiwanPlus is affiliated, at the time cited concerns over the TaiwanPlus report's “objectivity” as the main reason for its removal.

Minister of Culture Li Yuan (李遠) later said that the controversy caused by the report was “very serious” and that his ministry had “informed” PTS of that.

Bielakowska also expressed concern over press freedom in Hong Kong, which dropped to 140th from 135th in the rankings, recording its lowest-ever global score of 39.86 this year.

“Basically, we see that it's starting to be almost impossible [for Hong Kong journalists] to continue working” in an environment where they face ongoing government pressure and, in some cases, sedition charges for their reporting, she said.

The latest rankings showed that press freedom worldwide deteriorated over the past year to the “difficult” category — the second-lowest in the index's five-tier system — for the first time since it was launched in 2002.

“More than six out of 10 countries, or 112 in total, saw their overall scores decline in the index,” the group said, attributing the deterioration to economic pressure media firms faced.

The situation largely stemmed from ownership concentration, pressure from advertisers and financial backers, and limited or nontransparent public funding, RSF said.

Norway topped the rankings again this year, followed by Estonia and the Netherlands, according to the index, which is based on surveys of journalists, researchers and human rights advocates worldwide.

At the other end of the list were China (178th), North Korea (179th) and Eritrea (180th and last).


MORE VISITORS:
                                        The Tourism Administration said that it is seeing positive prospects in its efforts to expand the tourism market in North America and Europe                                        Taiwan has been ranked as the cheapest place in the world to travel to this year, based on a list recommended by NerdWallet.
The San Francisco-based personal finance company said that Taiwan topped the list of 16 nations it chose for budget travelers because US tourists do not need visas and travelers can easily have a good meal for less than US$10.
A bus ride in Taipei costs just under US$0.50, while subway rides start at US$0.60, the firm said, adding that public transportation in Taiwan is easy to navigate.

Potential gaps in security vetting procedures for personnel with access to sensitive information prompted him to propose the amendments, which would introduce changes to Article 14 of the Classified National Security Information Protection Act (國家機密保護法), Chen said yesterday.
The proposal, which aims to enhance interagency vetting procedures and reduce the risk of classified information leaks, would establish a comprehensive security clearance system in Taiwan, he said.
The amendment would require character and loyalty checks for civil servants and intelligence personnel prior to

Hard-right upstarts Reform UK snatched a parliamentary seat from British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labor Party yesterday in local elections that dealt a blow to the UK's two establishment parties.

Reform, led by anti-immigrant firebrand Nigel Farage, won the by-election in Runcorn and Helsby in northwest England by just six votes, as it picked up gains in other localities, including one mayoralty.

The group's strong showing continues momentum it built up at last year's general election and appears to confirm a trend that the UK is entering an era of multi-party politics.

“For the movement, for the party it's a very, very big moment indeed,” Brexit champion Farage said of Reform's first-ever by-election win and Starmer's first electoral loss since he took office in July last year.

Reform also picked up dozens of council seats from Labor and the Conservatives, as the UK's political landscape shows signs of splintering.

In the fight for six mayoralties, Reform won Greater Lincolnshire with Labor holding three. Labor only narrowly held the North Tyneside mayoralty after a 26 percent swing to Reform.

New Greater Lincolnshire mayor Andrea Jenkyns said the “fightback to save the heart and soul of our great country has now begun.”

“Now that Reform is in a place of power, we can help start rebuilding Britain. Inch by inch,” she said.

Just 1,641 seats across 23 local authorities were up for grabs — only a fraction of England's 17,000 councilors — but early results suggested Reform was transferring leads in national polls into tangible results at the ballot box.

“The big question we wanted to know after these results was are the polls right in suggesting that Reform now pose a significant challenge to both the Conservatives and the Labor Party? The answer to that question so far is quite clearly yes,” political scientist John Curtice said.

The centrist Liberal Democrats and left-wing Greens also expected to make gains, as surveys show Britons are increasingly disillusioned with the two main parties amid anaemic economic growth, high levels of irregular immigration and flagging public services.

Reform, which has vowed to “stop the boats” of irregular migrants crossing the English Channel, is hoping that winning mayoralties and gaining hundreds of councilors would help it build its grassroots activism before the next general election — likely in 2029.

British politics have been dominated by the Labor Party and the Tories since the early 20th century.

However, “British politics appears to be fragmenting,” Curtice wrote in the Telegraph this week.

Thursday's polls were “likely be the first in which as many as five parties are serious players,” he said.

Labor won a huge parliamentary majority in July last year, with just 33.7 percent of the vote, the lowest share for any party winning a general election since World War II.

The Conservatives won just 24 percent of the vote, securing only 121 seats in the 650-seat parliament, as the party endured its worst election defeat.

Reform picked up five seats, an unprecedented haul for a hard-right party, although one of those now sits as an independent. After Friday's win, their tally now stands at five again.

The Liberal Democrats in July won 61 more members of parliament (MP) than at the previous election and the Greens quadrupled their representation to four.

Labor won Runcorn with 53 percent of the vote last year, meaning it was one of its safest seats, while Reform got just 18 percent.

Election officials yesterday said Reform's MP candidate Sarah Pochin secured 12,645 votes to 12,639 for Labor's Karen Shore. Turnout was 46 percent.

Labor spokesperson said by-elections are “always difficult for the party in government” and the events surrounding the Runcorn vote made it “even harder.”

On Tuesday, Reform topped a YouGov poll of voting intentions in the UK with 26 percent, three points ahead of Labor and six up on the Conservatives.

Labor has endured criticism over welfare cuts and tax rises that it claims is necessary to stabilize the economy.

As Labor edges rightwards it is facing a growing challenge from the Greens on the left.

Under threat from Reform on the right, the Tories are also being squeezed on the left by the Liberal Democrats, the traditional third party, which was eyeing gains in the wealthy south.


TRUMP EFFECT: 
                                        The win capped one of the most dramatic turnarounds in Canadian political history after the Conservatives had led the Liberals by more than 20 points                                        Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney yesterday pledged to win US President Donald Trump's trade war after winning Canada's election and leading his Liberal Party to another term in power.
Following a campaign dominated by Trump's tariffs and annexation threats, Carney promised to chart “a new path forward” in a world “fundamentally changed” by a US that is newly hostile to free trade.
“We are over the shock of the American betrayal, but we should never forget the lessons,” said Carney, who led the central banks of Canada and the UK before entering politics earlier this year.
“We will win this trade war and

Fumio Ohtake / Special to The Yomiuri Shimbun

11:00 JST, May 2, 2025

At any convenience store, there are now footprint marks on the floor that lead up to the cash registers. People wait on these marks without thinking about them. This behavior has become a part of our everyday lives.

In fact, the marks were introduced to encourage people to social distance during the COVID-19 pandemic, based on what is called “nudge” theory.

In this theory, “nudges” refer to techniques that promote changes in people's behavior without restricting their choices or significantly changing their economic incentives. Examples of nudges include providing simple and easy-to-understand information and the framing effect, which refers to how people's impressions and decision-making are influenced when identical information is presented in different ways.

Footprint marks are easily understood to mean that this is where you should wait, and they prompt people to do just that: wait there. If the store simply puts a notice in front of the cash register saying, “Please keep a distance of at least one meter from the person in front of you when lining up,” the effect will likely be more limited. Few would even take the trouble to read this notice. Even those who do are unlikely to feel motivated enough to follow it. Footprint marks, by contrast, seem to offer a way to encourage people to naturally “behave better” without hassling them.

The use of nudges grew significantly after Richard Thaler, a professor at the University of Chicago, won the 2017 Nobel prize for economics.

Thaler was highly praised for applying nudges in various policy areas as he advanced behavioral economics, which incorporates psychology into economics. Nudges now play a role in encouraging individuals to eat healthier and exercise, become organ donors and conserve the environment, among other beneficial behaviors.

Nudges have spread to public institutions around the world. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reported in 2017 that more than 200 public agencies had incorporated nudges into their policies.

In Japan, too, the central government's ministries and agencies, local governments, industrial organizations and academia joined hands in April 2017 to inaugurate the Nudge Unit of Japan. Local governments have themselves set up 26 local nudge units and their activities are shared on the Jichitai Nudge Share website.

Nudges are likely favored as policy tools because many of them are less costly and can be implemented at the discretion of civil servants. Taxes and subsidies require approval from legislative organs or budgetary measures. Devising nudges, on the other hand, can be made merely with the clever use of language and is almost cost-free. And in fact, Japan's laws often include a “mandatory effort” clause, requiring people to try to comply with the law. There is a strong need to promote desirable behavior without coercion, and this may also have had an impact on the use of nudges.

An example of a “mandatory effort” clause in Japan is one requiring cyclists to wear helmets. Even if a cyclist does not follow the rule, there will be no penalty. The policy objective is to encourage “desirable” behavior while guaranteeing freedom of choice, and in such cases, nudges are a natural means of achieving this.

During the pandemic, a mandatory effort clause stipulated people make an effort to get vaccinated, which meant that the decision of whether to get a shot was left up to them. At that time, a study was conducted abroad, focusing on what kinds of nudge promoted COVID-19 vaccinations. The findings showed that one effective message was stating that a vaccine was “reserved for you.” This outcome was due to the “endowment effect,” which comes from behavioral economics theory.

A study jointly conducted by Shusaku Sasaki, a specially appointed associate professor at the University of Osaka; Tomoya Saito, director of the Center for Emergency Preparedness and Response at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases; and myself found that an effective message for motivating the elderly in Japan to get a COVID-19 shot was: “Your vaccination encourages the people around you to get vaccinated.”

In the case of COVID-19, just the effectiveness of the vaccines could not be used in messaging because the vaccines were new to us and the virus was mutating.

Nudges are an important policy instrument that promote socially desirable decision-making and behavior while ensuring people's autonomy. That said, as Toshiji Kawagoe, a professor at Future University Hakodate, discusses in his book “Kodo Keizaigaku no Shi” (The death of behavioral economics), nudges are not a panacea and in some cases they have been ineffective or produced the opposite effect to what was intended.

George Loewenstein, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University in the United States, and Nick Chater, a professor at Warwick Business School in the United Kingdom, have argued in a joint academic paper that while there are areas where the right approach is to use taxes and subsidies, there are other areas where these should be combined with nudges.

By focusing too much on nudges, governments could end up being slow to implement necessary policies using taxes, subsidies or regulations.

Shlomo Benartzi, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Los Angeles, and other researchers carried out a study to determine the cost-effectiveness of using nudges to increase college enrollment, energy conservation and influenza vaccinations, relative to traditional policy tools such as taxes and subsidies.

The study found that, in these three areas, nudges were more cost-effective than taxes and subsidies. But recent research has suggested that nudges could negate the effects of those measures.

According to a study by Hunt Allcott, a professor at Stanford University in the United States, and other researchers, even if nudges are effective on average, the magnitude and direction of the effect may be different for different people, making them an undesirable tool from a policy perspective. For example, according to their report, health warning labels on sugary drinks cause “health nuts” to excessively reduce consumption, but they can be less effective for “inattentives,” the real target of the health warnings.

There are cases where nudges are ineffective. An article by Cass Sunstein, a professor at Harvard University, notes cases where people with strong preferences or beliefs, as well as companies and organizations with vested interests, take actions to counteract nudges.

It has also been said people who feel their freedoms have been infringed upon become so resentful that they act counter to the nudge.

On the other hand, a nudge intervention that appeals to social norms, such as “Many people are doing this,” can be effective but causes its own problems.

When the pandemic broke out, mask wearing was widely adopted as an infection control measure thanks to the phrase “wear a mask for the good of society.”

However, once the social norm of wearing masks took root, it persisted even after its necessity for wearing masks had diminished.

When promoting good health or environmental protection, there is little change in what is considered desirable behavior. But infection control measures vary depending on the circumstances of the epidemic. Given that nudges related to social norms tend to be so effective, they have to be applied with care.

Lately, there has also been an increase in “sludge,” or the intentional misuse of nudges. For instance, some subscription-based business models that take advantage of consumers' misunderstandings to get them to sign up for paid subscription plans exploit the “status quo bias,” in which people are likely to continue doing something once they have started. Likewise, certain financial products exploit what is called present bias, or the tendency of some people to prioritize immediate rewards. The government should strengthen regulations on this “sludge.”

It is important to understand the features and limitations of nudges, which have become so ingrained in society, and to make good use of them while evaluating their effectiveness.

The United States remains committed to supporting peace efforts in Ukraine but will scale back its direct role as mediator, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said on May 1.

""He (U.S. President Donald Trump) knows also that there is another part of the world, a whole globe that needs some attention,"" Bruce told reporters. 

""We are not going to fly around the world at the drop of a hat to mediate meetings; that is now between the two parties, and now is the time that they need to present and develop concrete ideas about how this conflict is going to end.""

The remarks reflect a significant shift in Washington's approach after months of stalled diplomacy aimed at brokering a ceasefire in Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine. 

Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump had previously warned that the U.S. would withdraw from mediation efforts if no meaningful progress was made. 

On April 18, Trump said, ""If one of the two parties makes it very difficult, we're just going to say: 'you're foolish, you're fools, you're horrible people,' and we're just going to take a pass.""

""The Secretary has also made it very clear that while our style will change, the methodology of how we contribute to this will change in that we will not be the mediators,"" Bruce added.

Vice President JD Vance echoed the shift on May 1, telling Fox News that the war in Ukraine is unlikely to end ""any time soon.""

It is ""going to be up to the Russians and Ukrainians now that each side knows what the other's terms for peace are. It's going to be up to them to come to an agreement and stop this brutal, brutal conflict,"" Vance told Fox News' Bret Baier.

The U.S. intensified its diplomatic outreach earlier this year, including negotiating proposals for a 30-day ceasefire and partial truces aimed at halting attacks on civilian energy infrastructure. 

Moscow has rejected these initiatives, and Russian forces have intensified strikes across Ukraine. On April 24, Russia launched 215 missiles and drones, killing at least 12 civilians and injuring 87 in Kyiv alone.

President Trump criticized the attack as ""not necessary"" and ""very bad timing,"" directly appealing to Russian President Vladimir Putin: ""Vladimir, Stop!"" Yet he refrained from issuing any consequences or condemnation.

In contrast, Kyiv has accepted the U.S.-backed ceasefire plan and continues to demand an unconditional cessation of hostilities. 

Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said on May 1 that at least 72 senators are ready to vote for sweeping new sanctions and tariffs against Russia, should Putin continue to avoid serious peace negotiations.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

U.S. Vice President JD Vance said in an interview with Fox News on May 1 that the  war in Ukraine is not going to end ""any time soon."" 

It is ""going to be up to the Russians and Ukrainians now that each side knows what the other's terms for peace are. It's going to be up to them to come to an agreement and stop this brutal, brutal conflict,"" Vance told Fox News' Bret Baier.

Earlier on April 30, Vance said that the Trump administration is working to broker a ""durable solution"" to the Russia–Ukraine war within the next 100 days, according to a Fox News Digital interview.

Asked about the state of negotiations, Vance said, ""The first and necessary step of getting the Russia-Ukraine conflict solved is to get each of them to make a peace proposal."" He added, ""We've got the peace proposal out there and issued, and we're going to work very hard over the next 100 days to try to bring these guys together.""

The renewed push follows months of diplomacy and comes after U.S. President Donald Trump shifted his campaign promise to end the war ""within 24 hours"" to a 100-day timeline, which has now passed without a deal.

Ukraine accepted a 30-day U.S.-backed ceasefire in March, but Russia rejected it, demanding an end to Western military aid. Despite calls for peace, Moscow has stepped up attacks against Ukrainian civilians in recent weeks.

Russian air defenses allegedly intercepted 89 Ukrainian drones over occupied Crimea and another 23 over the waters of the Black Sea, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed on May 2.

The pro-Ukrainian Crimean Wind Telegram channel reported explosions in several key locations across the peninsula, including Sevastopol, Dzhankoy, Saky, Novofedorivka, and Kacha — sites that host Russian military airfields.

The Saky and Kacha airfields are used by Russia to control airspace over the Black Sea and to launch strikes on Ukrainian territory. Videos published by Crimean Wind showed multiple explosions and a fire near the village of Uhlove, close to the Kacha airfield. 

Uhlove is located about 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) from the coast of Kalamit Bay and roughly 25 kilometers (15 miles) southwest of Simferopol.

Mikhail Razvozhayev, the Russian-installed leader in Sevastopol, confirmed on Telegram that ""loud sounds"" were caused by Russian forces repelling an attempted drone attack. 

He claimed seven drones had been destroyed over the sea at a significant distance from shore.

""The fleet, in cooperation with air defense forces, is reflecting a massive combined attack,"" he wrote, claiming no damage to infrastructure in Sevastopol or its waters.

Ukraine has not officially commented on the reported strikes, and the Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims.

Ukraine has carried out several successful attacks against Russian targets in occupied Crimea and its vicinity, heavily degrading the Russian Black Sea Fleet.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

An American flag flies over the John Harvard statue at Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass., on March 19.SOPHIE PARK/The New York Times News Service

U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said he planned to strip Harvard University of its tax-exempt status, the latest salvo against the Ivy League school amid a larger crackdown on elite U.S. universities.

“We are going to be taking away Harvard's Tax Exempt Status. It's what they deserve!” Trump said in a post on his social-media platform, without specifying when he might take action.

Representatives for the Internal Revenue Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump's post and whether it was revoking the university's tax-exempt status.

Harvard, in a statement, said the move would be unlawful and unprecedented.

“There is no legal basis to rescind Harvard's tax-exempt status,” the Boston-area school said. “The unlawful use of this instrument more broadly would have grave consequences for the future of higher education in America.”

It would also cut money available for student scholarships, medical research and technological advancements that drive economic growth, Harvard added.

Since taking office in January, Trump has targeted major U.S. universities by freezing federal funding, launching investigations, revoking student visas and making other demands. He has said higher education has been gripped by antisemitic, anti-American, Marxist and radical left ideologies.

Under federal law, the president cannot request that the IRS, which determines whether an organization can have or maintain tax-exempt status, investigate organizations.

Most universities are exempt from federal income tax under the U.S. tax code because they are deemed to be operated exclusively for public educational purposes. Trump's administration has escalated its fight against Harvard in recent weeks, probing its nearly $9-billion in federal funding, seeking details on its foreign ties and threatening its ability to enroll foreign students. The administration has also demanded a ban on diversity, equity and inclusion practices, a crackdown on some pro-Palestinian groups and a mask ban.

On Wednesday, Trump suggested he would withhold grants. Harvard has pushed back, suing the administration over the halted U.S. research funding and other demands, and joining more than 200 university and college presidents in protesting Trump's higher education policies.

Trump said he was considering an end to Harvard's tax-exempt status in a separate social media post on April 15, when annual U.S. tax returns are due, but did not say how he would do it.

White House spokesperson Harrison Fields last month said any forthcoming IRS actions were independent of the president and that any tax status investigations were initiated before Trump's post.

Prime Minister Mark Carney, left, and President of France Emmanuel Macron shake hands after delivering a joint statement at the Palais de l'Elysee in Paris, on March 17.Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press

Canada just became a bit more European.

We have voted, once again, for a more continental-style form of government that combines robust state institutions with a free-trading liberal market economy. To lead it, we've got a former European central banker whose first prime ministerial trip was to France and who describes Canada as “the most European of non-European countries.”

And our economic productivity, average incomes and standards of living have for years operated at a more modest European level compared to the soaring American exception – giving us a common cross-Atlantic project to fix it.

We'll need to become even more European. With the U.S. economy walled off, the Canada-European Union Trade Agreement, which entered into force in 2017, now gives us our largest unprotected market; our volume of bilateral trade with the 27-country bloc has increased 65 per cent since, with about $44-billion in annual goods exports. Several EU countries, including France and Italy, still haven't ratified the deal, suggesting there's some room for growth. 

Ottawa recently began negotiating a set of deals to shift its defence procurement away from Washington and toward Europe, and implicitly to join an emerging European defence bloc that may either replace or take control of NATO. And Canada has signed a number of bilateral agreements that make it part of the European Green Deal, a massive initiative to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and boost economic growth.

That has led people on both sides of the Atlantic to argue that Canada should become a member of the EU.

It probably began in early January, when a column in The Economist argued that Canada ought to be the 28th EU state, because Canadians need Europe's people for skills and population growth and Europeans need Canada's resources and land. Proposals to welcome Canada into the bloc were made by Sigmar Gabriel, who was German chancellor Angela Merkel's foreign minister, and Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister, who declared: “There is no reason why EU membership [for Canada] should be off the table!” A number of Canadian commentators followed suit, and an Abacus survey suggested that almost half of Canadians favoured joining (with only a quarter against).

Personally, I'd welcome the blue-and-yellow flag. It would be nice to be a de facto citizen of 28 countries. And yes, it would technically be possible – the Maastricht Treaty says any new EU state must be “a European country,” but that carries no definition, and the EU has long included Cyprus, which is geographically in West Asia. If the existing members decide we're culturally “European” and want us, we're in. It wouldn't entail taking on the euro (several EU members don't use it) or eliminating our border (that's the Schengen Agreement, unrelated to the EU).

But I also don't think it's something we should be pursuing.

The first reason: it wouldn't solve Canada's serious problems. It won't replace the loss of the U.S. market to tariffs. CETA already provides us all the free access to European markets we need. And even if we increase the volume dramatically, our total exports to the EU would still be barely a tenth of those to the United States. Many of those are resources that can't affordably be shipped overseas. Because Europe is well on its way to eliminating fossil fuels from its transportation, heating and energy systems, it would be foolish for Canada to invest in any new infrastructure designed to deliver oil or gas to Europe. We are inescapably a North American country, economically and in most cultural respects.

It also wouldn't really help our population-growth needs. While we should certainly make it easier to come here, we just aren't a popular destination for Europeans. And it wouldn't take us further on defence or the environment, all of which we are quite successfully negotiating from outside the EU.

The second reason not to pursue EU membership is that it wouldn't be good for the EU. The bloc is already engaged in decades-long projects to help Serbia, Moldova, Ukraine and sometimes Turkey on the long road to membership – and they're at least physically in Europe.

It would be absurd and more than a little bigoted to be pursuing Canada as a “culturally European” country before, say, Morocco. It would be rather like the completely awful CANZUK idea of creating a free-trade bloc of Canada, New Zealand, Australia and Britain, a reunion of only the white-majority members of the British Empire.

That kind of thinking, after all, is exactly what we're trying to escape in our quest for better trade and political partners, now that the United States has been poisoned with it.

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre speaks to supporters on election night in Ottawa, on April 29.Chris Young/The Canadian Press

Never in his political career has Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre been humiliated like this. Not even close. 

The number of personal apologies he has delivered in his 20 years of politics could probably fit on one hand (in fact, I can think of just two), while still leaving his middle finger free to wave at anyone who passes by. Indeed, it has been a series of successes for the once-youngest MP, then star cabinet minister, then leader of the Official Opposition, whose two-decade rise in politics suddenly fell out the bottom on Monday evening. 

There might be ways to excuse, explain and rationalize the Conservatives' loss to the Liberals during this election, but there is nothing to palliate Mr. Poilievre's loss of his own seat. It is the worst thing that could happen to someone who has made a career out of never showing weakness, simply because it is so utterly humiliating. 

Mr. Poilievre, who exerted extraordinary control over his caucus (the unofficial rule for Conservative candidates was to skip local riding debates and not speak with the media) and the party's membership (by meddling in nomination races) is now at the mercy of both if he wants to get back in the House as the leader of the Official Opposition. He now needs someone to do him a favour – to offer up their just-won seat to him to run in a by-election – and someone else to stand in for him in Parliament because he has not actually been elected to be there. Humiliating.

Those outside the party cannot fathom how the Conservatives could even consider keeping Mr. Poilievre as leader. He blew a 25-point lead, they say, and he consistently polls behind his party. Why would the CPC want to keep him around? 

It's worth noting, firstly, that there is a very human inclination to generalize and transpose our feelings onto others; that is to say, if we viscerally can't stand someone, it's hard to conceive of how others might feel differently. But the reality in this election is that more than eight million people in this country voted for the Conservatives – some, because of Mr. Poilievre, and no doubt for others, despite him. But there is no question that Mr. Poilievre is popular in caucus, among CPC members and yes, across Canada, and that popularity has the potential to grow if – and only if – Mr. Poilievre is genuinely humbled by this first significant loss. That will mean putting that middle finger down, and looking at himself to see what went wrong. 

For any party, the decision to boot a leader should be forward-looking; it should not necessarily be about how badly he screwed up his first kick at the can (and let's be clear: Mr. Poilievre missed the can altogether while he was chasing the ghost of Justin Trudeau), but about whether he has the capacity to improve, and whether someone else would likely do better. The gains the party made under Mr. Poilievre are significant; Conservatives picked up seats in Ontario ridings heavily populated by blue-collar workers, by students, and new Canadians, which represents a meaningful broadening of the Conservative base. 

Was their success because of the Conservative Party generally, or because of Mr. Poilievre himself? Hard to say. But I suspect more factory workers in Windsor West are familiar with Mr. Poilievre's “Boots not Suits” slogan and manner of speaking about the trades than they are with page 20 of the party's platform regarding RESP eligibility for apprenticeship credentials. And I also suspect many young people appreciate his particular style of talking about their economic struggles, and not simply that he talks about them generally. During this election, Mr. Poilievre was able to capture the populist right flank of the electorate by essentially extinguishing the People's Party, while also bringing new voters into the fold. It's not clear that a different leader would be able to keep that coalition together. 

But Mr. Poilievre also carried himself with the hubris of someone who has never experienced a political loss: by antagonizing the media, by sparring with provincial premiers, by muzzling his candidates and making the campaign all about him. It's the type of childish campus Conservative antics that scare progressive Canadians into voting strategically, and tune moderate voters out from his message. That was to the Conservatives' misfortune, because his message was a good one – so much so that Prime Minister Mark Carney adopted much of his platform on his own. But the sophomoric antics made it such that many Canadians simply didn't see him as a leader.

All of this is to say that Mr. Poilievre doesn't need to become a “Liberal-lite” to appeal to more Canadians; he just needs to cut the crap. A chastened Pierre Poilievre – and a chastened Conservative Party – would do well to show some humility in the face of this loss, which was unfathomable just months ago. If he has that capacity, and has the capacity to finally grow up, then it is in the party's strategic interest to keep Mr. Poilievre as leader.

At least three people were injured when a car drove into a group of people in the German city of Stuttgart, according to police. The driver of the car has been arrested.

At least three people were injured when a car drove into a group of people in the center of the southwestern German city of Stuttgart, police said on Friday.

The driver of the vehicle was arrested, a police spokesperson said, adding that witnesses are currently being questioned.

The vehicle involved in the incident, a dark Mercedes G class luxury SUV, was in the cordoned-off area near the tram stop.  According to the police spokeswoman, service at the stop has been suspended.

Stuttgart police said in a social media post that the incident occurred in the Olgaeck area and that officers were on the scene with a large force.

Later, the police added that the operation was continuing and that there were currently severe traffic restrictions in the center of Stuttgart.

Meanwhile, Stuttgart firefighters said they were responding to a serious traffic accident with multiple casualties in the center of the city. ""The area is cordoned off and the injured are being treated at the scene,"" it said on X.

The fire department later added that several people were injured in the accident, including several serious injuries.

While the fire brigade has described the incident as an accident, police have so far not commented on the context to the collision.

Outgoing Chancellor Scholz cautioned against any rushed decisions after Germany's intelligence service designated the AfD party as ""right-wing extremist."" Follow DW for more.

Below you will find a roundup of news from Germany on Friday, May 2.

Marco Rubio, the US' highest-level diplomat, has criticized the branding of the far-right AfD party as extremist by Germany's intelligence agency.

""Germany just gave its spy agency new powers to surveil the opposition,"" Rubio said on X.

""That's not democracy — it's tyranny in disguise.""

The Trump administration has appeared favorable to the far-right party, with Trump ally Elon Musk hosting AfD co-leader Alice Weidel for an online talk just before Germany's February election.

""What is truly extremist is not the popular AfD — which took second in the recent election — but rather the establishment's deadly open border immigration policies that the AfD opposes,"" the US secretary of state added.

While high-level diplomats have often refrained from commenting on the internal politics of other countries, especially allies, this has not been the case under the Trump administration.

Rubio went on to suggest that ""Germany should reverse course.""

Responding to the AfD being confirmed as an extremist entity by the county's domestic intelligence agency, a major union of journalists urged media outlets to tweak their coverage of Germany's top opposition party,

The AfD ""is not a normal party in a democratic spectrum,"" according to the head of the German Journalists' Association (DJV) Mika Beuster.

""We journalists have to underline the party's nationalist, racists and far-right aspirations more clearly,"" Beuster said, adding that journalists need to report on the AfD ""objectively and critically.""

""The AfD provides simple answers to complex problems, which initially appeals to many people. However, the side effect is a slow poisoning of the democratic discourse. This should be highlighted in all reporting on the AfD,"" he added.

The AfD has often complained ofbeing treated unfairly compared to other, more established German parties.

With Germany's new government due to take office in days, the leader of Olaf Scholz's center-left SPD party called for a joint decision on dealing with the AfD, including a possible ban.

""The AfD is an attack on Germany,"" Lars Klingbeil, a co-chief of the SPD and incoming finance minister, told Germany's Bild tabloid.

""They want a different country, they want to destroy our democracy. And we must take that very seriously.""

He also said elected politicians have a responsibility to decide how to protect democracy from its enemies.

""And we have to very quickly make decisions in the new government, the [new ruling] coalition, about what comes next,"" Klingbeil added.

While banning AfD could be seen as an option, Klingbeil also said that thorough consideration was needed before taking any dramatic steps.

Earlier today, outgoing Chancellor Scholz also warned any ban on the AfD ""must not be rushed.""

Dmitry Medvedev, who served as Russia's president between 2008 and 2012 and then prime minister under Vladimir Putin until 2020, dismissed the move to label Germany's AfD as an extremist entity.

""Strong words to use against a parliamentary party,"" he wrote on X.

""Apparently, the CDU/CSU, SPD and other German party trivia consider those with higher ratings to be extremists.""

What happens now? That's the question many are asking following the move to designate the AfD as a ""right-wing extremist"" organization.

Several lawmakers from across the political spectrum have been working to get enough support for a ban of the AfD party.

The domestic intelligence agency's decision to classify the AfD as extremist may give that effort new momentum.

DW's politics desk takes a deeper dive into what it takes for a party to be banned in accordance with the constitution and also looks at some of the positives and negatives of such a move. Read more here.

Heidi Reichinnek, the Left Party's top ranking lawmaker in Germany's parliament, pledged to do ""everything"" to bring about the ban on the AfD.

""It must be clear to everyone: A democracy does not survive power sharing with right-wing extremists like the AfD,"" said the 36-year-old head of the Left party faction in the Bundestag.

""Everyone who has campaigned for the normalization of the AfD and continues to do so are reinforcing right-wing extremists and endangering democracy,"" she said.

Upcoming Chancellor Friedrich Merz attempted and failed to pass a controversial law with support from the AfD in January. The move caused nationwide controversy and protests across Germany.

The Alternative for Germany (AfD), previously labeled a ""suspected"" extremist group by Germany's intelligence agency, challenged the designation in court but lost.

After a three-year investigation, the agency in its 1,100-page report now says it has concrete evidence that the AfD's actions threaten Germany's democratic order.

The report highlights the party's use of hateful rhetoric and incitement to undermine democratic institutions.

The agency concludes that the AfD's ethnocentric ideology is incompatible with Germany's constitution, violating the principle of human dignity.

An example includes AfD MP Stephan Brandner, who, in an interview with the extremist blog PI-NEWS, discussed the alleged threat posed by Muslim population growth, describing it as a ""problem"" for Germany despite distancing himself from the term ""birth jihad.""

The report also cites the party's authoritarian rhetoric, which casts doubt on democratic structures and the rule of law.

The AfD is now Germany's largest opposition party, especially in the east, but remains excluded from government due to the other parties' refusal to collaborate with a party with extremist tendencies, a situation known as the ""firewall.""

Friedrich Merz, the incoming chancellor, faced criticism — also from within his own party — for passing a non-binding motion in the Bundestag with AfD support during the election campaign.

Two issues now need to be considered as the latest developments begin to sink in:

Firstly, the AfD has called the move ""politically motivated"" and announced it will challenge its extremist classification in court.

Secondly, legal hurdles to ban a party are very high in Germany because of the country's history, but the agency's move has intensified calls for an AfD ban.

As the world appears to have become increasingly polarized, the gaps between different social groups and entire countries are deepening, observers warn.

It comes amid wars, conflicts, migration, trade, climate, social issues and problems surrounding technological progress which affect the entire world and pay no heed to divisions and gaps.

DW's Hans Pfeifer writes about how the far-right have used issues like migration as a vehicle to sow division. You can read more about that here.

Following the official decision to label the entirety of Germany's AfD as ""extremist,"" the far-right party decried the ""targeted interference"" in the democratic process.

""Today's decision by [the domestic intelligence agency] is a serious blow against German democracy,""  party leaders Alice Weidel and Tino Chrupalla said in a statement.

They pointed out that the current government is due to leave office in four days and pledged to fight ""defamation"" in court.

""And yet, the AfD is being discredited and criminalized as an opposition party shortly before the change of government,"" Weidel and Chrupalla said, adding that attacks on the ""democratic process of opinion building is therefore clearly politically motivated.""

The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party achieved its best results ever in the 2025 election. It is set to be the main opposition party, giving a more prominent role to its co-leader Alice Weidel.

DW takes a closer look at the woman who's become the public face of Germany's far right.

Josef Schuster, the head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, said AfD officials should not be trusted with state power, reacting to the party's labeling as extremist.

""AfD representatives should never reach governmental positions, not even via important positions in parliamentary committees or similar, and they should also never get access to information related to security,"" Schuster said.

Following the parliamentary election in February, the AfD has officially become Germany's strongest opposition party, second only to Friedrich Merz's conservative bloc.

""Who could have imagined that in the year 2025, a confirmed right-wing extremist party will be holding almost a quarter of lawmakers in Germany's parliament?"" Schuster added on Friday.

While widely expected, the decision to classify the AfD as an “extremist” threat to democracy is still a political bombshell. 

It is worth noting that there is no smoking gun. No uncovered plot to seize democratic institutions or carry out a coup and that could prove important. 

Rather, this is the result of a forensic analysis of thousands of statements that paint a picture of a movement that is aiming to undermine the democratic order with denigration, incitement to hatred, and defamation.

In an early draft of the final report, investigators put it like this: 

""The Federal Republic is said to have been corrupted by the actions of parties and politicians, with the exception of the AfD, and the hatred of democracy and the rule of law has degenerated into a dictatorial system.""

""Overall, the evidence presented is therefore no longer about sharp criticism and debate on the matter, but rather about fundamentally shaking the population's trust in the constitutional order.""

""In this respect, there are sufficiently strong factual indications of efforts against the principle of democracy.""

The report is now in the hands of the Interior Ministry who will have to decide what steps to take. One option would be to begin proceedings to ban the party. 

Commenting on the possible outlawing for AfD, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the issue ""must not be rushed.""

The official ""extremist"" label by Germany's intelligence does not automatically trigger a ban for the AfD party. However, it does mean that the party will be under closer watch of the German authorities.

Scholz was criticizing far-right populism and urged ""respect"" as an antidote during a speech in Hanover. He also called for caution concerning the AfD and said further consequences for the party required additional discussion.

""This is why these things need to be weighed very carefully, I'm against taking a quick shot,"" he said.

Outgoing Interior Minister Nancy Faeser stressed that the spy agency's decision to confirm the AfD as a ""right-wing extremist"" organization was independent and not politically motivated.

""There has been no political influence whatsoever on the new report,"" Faeser said in a statement. 

""The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution has a clear legal mandate to combat extremism and protect our democracy,"" she said. 

Faeser on Friday also said the party was running a campaign against democratic order.

""The AfD represents an ethnic concept that discriminates against entire population groups and treats citizens with a history of migration as second-class Germans,"" Faeser said.

""Their ethnic attitude is reflected in racist statements, especially against immigrants and Muslims,"" she added.

With first reactions to the BfV designation coming in, an AfD state lawmaker said it was ""sad"" that other German parties targeting his faction.

""It is sad to see the state of democracy in our country when the old parties are now even using the most politically questionable means against the strongest opposition party,"" said Anton Baron, a lawmaker in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg.

Outgoing Interior Minister Nancy Faesar has denied ""any political influence whatsoever"" on the decision made by the German intelligence agency.","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW'}","world"

			A lot of people would still be alive if Obama administration had not scrapped literacy requirements, says Deann Miller

The widow of a man killed by an illegal immigrant says he would still be alive if the truck driver had spoken English.

Scott Miller was killed when a semi-truck driven by Ignacio Cruz-Mendoza lost control on Highway 285 in Colorado's foothills last year.

The truck's load, a haul of large steel pipes, collided with several vehicles including 64-year-old Mr Miller, who was crushed to death in June 2024.

On Monday, Donald Trump signed an edict requiring those driving a commercial truck on American roads to be qualified and proficient English speakers.

The order mandates that commercial drivers be able to “read and understand traffic signs” in English and requires the department of transport to test literacy skills.

Federal law requires drivers to read and speak the language sufficiently but inconsistency in testing and lack of enforcement means many commercial drivers do not.

Deann, Miller's heartbroken wife, said Mr Trump's executive order would have barred Cruz-Mendoza from getting behind the wheel and in turn, spared her husband's life.

“There's a lot of people that are not alive today because of this. And then you've got the truck drivers who cause these accidents,” she told The Telegraph.

“They're now either in jail or their lives are ruined too. They shouldn't even be behind the wheel of a truck. Nobody should have allowed them.”

Mrs Miller added: “People like my husband are dead because we have people out there driving trucks that don't have the proper qualifications, they don't have the right skills, and they can't speak the language.

“The man couldn't speak English, so he wouldn't have been behind that truck. There's a lot of people that would be alive today had the Obama administration not changed that law.”

Crashes involving large commercial trucks have been on the rise since 2016, when Barack Obama, the US president at the time, issued a memorandum removing the requirement to suspend drivers for violating English proficient standards.

Since 2016, when the Obama administration scrapped English literacy requirements for truck drivers, fatal crashes involving large trucks have risen year on year from around 4,500 to 8,837 in 2022 – the last year for which data is available – with some blaming non-English speaking drivers.

There was a slight decrease to 4,987 in 2023, according to research by Morris and Dewett.

Wyoming congresswoman Harriet Hageman earlier this month wrote to Sean Duffy, the transport secretary, to bring back regulations on non-English speaking truck drivers, claiming that scrapping language requirements has posed a “major safety issue for all drivers” and placed “millions of American motorists in jeopardy”.

Shannon Everett, co-founder of trucker advocacy group American Truckers United, said it was a move that cost lives.

“It started as a trickle then around 2020 it became a flood. We have drawn a distinct correlation between the time of the policy change and the amount of accidents that are taking place,” he told The Telegraph.

“Had this not happened, there would be families that could have been saved, saved a loved one, or prevented an injury.”

As for Cruz-Mendoza, a Mexican citizen, he had been removed from the country or left voluntarily at least 16 times since 2002, according to the Denver Post.

He was deported once again last month after serving just seven months of his one-year sentence for reckless driving.

According to prosecutors, Cruz-Mendoza never completed an employment application with the trucking company who had hired him.

They said he had potentially missed a gear and relied on his brakes to stop the truck, which was hauling more than 40,000 pounds of pipe.

“I don't care if you come from another country, but please be able to read the traffic signs, because that is very important,” Mrs Miller said.

“And it's just reality. It's not political. I don't want this to be political. I want it to be a reality that this is just safe.”

At the beginning of his second term, Mr Trump signed an executive order designating English as the official language of the United States.

“You might not know, but there's a lot of communication problems between truckers on the road with federal officials and local officials, as well, which obviously is a public safety risk,” Karoline Leavitt said earlier this week.

“So we're going to ensure that our truckers, who are the backbone of our economy, are all able to speak English. That's a very common-sense policy.”

As protests spring up at Tesla dealerships across the country, the company's profits are plunging.

As protests spring up at Tesla dealerships across the country, the company's profits are plunging.

On April 26, protesters outside a Tesla Dealership in Washington, D.C. were elated. That week, Elon Musk, Tesla CEO and head of the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE), indicated to shareholders that he would step back from government, allocating a mere “day or two per week” toward DOGE projects. In mandatory Securities and Exchange Commission filings and comments to Wall Street analysts, Tesla acknowledged that protests had created a risk factor for the valuation of Tesla stock. “Changing political sentiment,” Tesla wrote in a shareholder report, “could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near term.” In quarterly reports, Tesla reported a 71 percent drop in profits.

For protesters, this was a victory a long time in the making. In the opening months of the Trump administration, Musk's ascendency knew few limits. On his first day in office, Trump conjured DOGE via executive order and placed Musk at the helm, granting him sweeping powers to remake the federal government. Described by Musk as a “woodchipper for bureaucracy,” DOGE bulldozed government programs, cancelled contracts and fired career civil servants, often eclipsing the limits of the law and raising questions regarding constitutional separation of powers. During Musk's tenure, DOGE effectively shuttered USAID, granted young employees access to sensitive Treasury Department payment data, and commandeered the Office of Personnel Management to send emails to every executive branch employee in the government demanding information about their work accomplishments. In mid-April, DOGE attempted to extend its power beyond the government itself into civil society, making a ploy to install government staff within a prominent nonprofit that formerly received federal funding.

Faced with limited levers to enact change against an agency commissioned by executive fiat, protesters developed an alternative tactic: attempting to make the Tesla brand sufficiently noxious to strike at Musk's personal fortune. Musk is currently the richest person in the world, with a plurality of his net worth originating from his shares in Tesla. By protesting at Tesla dealerships across the country, protesters hoped to draw attention to the havoc DOGE has wrought while putting financial pressure on Musk to drop out of government. “Stopping Musk will help save lives and democracy,” the Tesla Takedown website reads. “Sell your Teslas, dump your stock, join the picket lines.”

Beginning in February, protesters began to appear at Tesla dealerships across the nation. The protests went viral — and exhibited staying power, recurring week after week. The Tesla Takedown map currently lists upcoming events in 63 localities spread across 23 states. The movement has also spread internationally; Tesla Takedown protests have been held in Canada, the U.K. and across Europe, particularly Germany. In northern Virginia, just outside of Washington, D.C. protesters picket the Tesla dealership three times per week, reliably drawing crowds of 15 to 35 protesters.

The Tesla Takedown movement eschews property damage and holds a firm commitment to nonviolence. But in topline rhetoric, Trump officials have drawn connections between the protesters dancing on the sidewalk and the spate of vandalism and arson attacks targeting Tesla vehicles, dealerships and charging locations. In March, FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi signaled that the most serious of these incidents — a shooting through the windows of a Tesla dealership and two arson incidents — qualified, in the government's eyes, as domestic terrorism. The FBI announced the creation of a dedicated task force, and the Department of justice (DOJ) indicated that the agency would seek 20-year prison sentences for the three accused.

The FBI and DOJ have both indicated a willingness to extend investigatory powers beyond arson attacks into minor acts of vandalism and First Amendment-protected protests outside dealerships. In a March public statement, Bondi warned, “If you're going to touch a Tesla, go to a dealership, do anything, you better watch out because we're coming after you.”

Michael German, fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice's Liberty and National Security Program and a former FBI special agent, expressed concern about Bondi's statements. “Protesting at a Tesla dealership is a lot different than throwing a Molotov cocktail,” he noted in an interview with Truthout. “My concern based on the history would be that they engage in suppressive activities and investigations of people who were merely engaged in organizing protests, rather than engaging in violations of criminal laws.”

The FBI, Department of Homeland Security, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives have all assessed that the most serious criminal actions undertaken against Tesla were likely the work of lone actors. But despite a dearth of evidence linking Tesla arsonists with the Tesla Takedown protest movement, intelligence gathering bodies have disseminated information to local law enforcement encouraging vigilance around nonviolent protests. The Northern California Regional Intelligence Center, a fusion center established after 9/11 to, as it states, “identify, prevent, protect against, mitigate, and assist in the response to and the recovery from the greatest human-made threats and major hazards,” issued a bulletin reading: “Violent opportunists may exploit these gatherings [Tesla Takedowns] to mask criminal intentions, including vandalism, arson, or other disruptive acts.” The bulletin further notes that “calls to boycott Tesla and protest Elon Musk have also increased.” While fusion centers conduct no investigations of their own, the information they provide can drive investigatory and policing decisions on the ground.

“This type of intelligence document is what state, local and federal police use to justify their investigations. So if calls to boycott Tesla are linked to this escalating threats document, then you can imagine that local police might see a local group picketing Tesla as a threat,” German commented.

Local police aren't the only threat protesters must contend with. Since the first Tesla Takedown day of action, InfoWars alum and right-wing activist Laura Loomer has frequented protests in Washington, D.C. posting videos to her large online following. On her X/Twitter account, followed by 1.6 million people, she frequently maligns Tesla pickets as linked to violence. After a minor incident of vandalism at a New York City protest, Loomer threatened to forward the information of protesters associated with one of the protest sponsors, Planet Over Profit, to the Trump administration for use in their domestic terrorism investigation. Coming from a figure with enough cachet in the Trump administration to get six National Security Council advisors fired, some protesters found cause for concern. Less than a week after Loomer published an article about the funders of the Sunrise Movement — another organization involved in Tesla Takedown protests in New York City — Trump echoed her allegations, speculating in public comments that “people that are very highly political on the left” were paying Tesla attackers.

But in D.C., protesters show no signs of backing down, either in response to Loomer or to the threat of state surveillance. Instead, they have adopted a strategic exuberance, Mike Kepka, known at the D.C. protests as Captain Beats, told Truthout about the first week of Tesla Takedown protests. “It was a dance party, but no one brought the music,” he recounted. That day, he settled for blasting music out of the open windows of his minivan, but the next week, he came back with real firepower: the AV system he uses for his daughters' Girl Scout events, complete with boat batteries for power and a Facebook Marketplace-sourced bike trailer. From that week onward, the D.C. contingent of the Tesla Takedown movement rebranded as Dance Against DOGE.

As Loomer and her video team continued to make appearances, protesters began adding informational fliers about Dance Against DOGE to the lineup of protest signs. On the flier, the group reiterates its commitment to First Amendment protest and states: “Our fight is with Elon, Trump, and the billionaires, not individual Tesla owners.” As top-level discourse around Tesla protests became increasingly threatening, activists doubled down on creating an atmosphere of joy. They began to don captain's hats and sparkly attire.

“As the weeks have gone on, it's gotten wilder and wilder,” Dance Against DOGE protest organizer Melissa Knutson recounted. “We have the hats, we have the tinsel boas, we have bubbles. They [right-wing activists] are on Twitter going, ‘we're at another Tesla Takedown, and they're dancing with bubbles.' It really defuses the whole thing.”

Tesla's profits have plunged and Musk will be reducing his time at DOGE, but protesters aren't letting up. Knutson pointed out that, even if Musk withdraws from government altogether, Musk's “minions” at DOGE will continue to slash government jobs and choke funding. And, said Knutson, the protests are about combating the bigger billionaire agenda, and building a resilient resistance movement against the Trump administration writ large. Some local chapters of the Tesla Takedown movement are expanding their activism beyond dealerships into city halls, advocating for local governments to pull Tesla stock from pension portfolios. While this phase of the movement is in its infancy, there are promising signs that divestment resolutions could move forward in some cities and states. In March, 23 members of the New York State Assembly wrote to the state comptroller to advocate divestment of pension funds from Tesla stock. In response to waves of anti-Trump sentiment roiling Canada after the enactment of tariffs, the province of Ontario canceled its contract with Starlink, another of Musk's companies. Several D.C.-area protesters expressed enthusiasm for initiating divestment resolution campaigns in the suburb of Takoma Park and in Montgomery County.

And for the protesters on the streets continuing their crusade outside dealerships, Tesla Takedowns take on a broader resonance: fighting for democracy itself.

“We've always said this is about getting people comfortable showing up and exercising their rights,” said Knutson. “You can see people walking by who maybe have never protested before, but they'll join a dance party.”

“It's nonviolent, fun, lets people do something they wouldn't have done yesterday. If we can do that, maybe we can save democracy,” said Kepka before cueing up the next song. Upon hearing the opening bars of “We're Not Gonna Take It,” the crowd roared along, tinsel boas glinting in the sun.

We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

Thousands of discrimination investigations are idled, even those nearing resolution when Trump took office again.

In California, the federal government was deep into an investigation of alleged racial discrimination at a school district where, a parent said, students called a Black peer racial slurs and played whipping sounds from their cellphones during a lesson about slavery. Then the U.S. Department of Education in March suddenly closed the California regional outpost of its Office for Civil Rights and fired all its employees there. That investigation and others went silent.

In South Dakota, the OCR abruptly terminated its work with a school district that had agreed to take steps to end discrimination against its Native American students. The same office that helped craft the agreement to treat indigenous students equally made a stunning about-face and decided in March that helping Native American students would discriminate against white students.

During its first 100 days, as the Trump administration has dismantled the Education Department, one of its biggest targets has been the civil rights arm. Now, Education Secretary Linda McMahon is “reorienting” what's left of it.

Part of that shift has been ordering investigations related to the administration's priorities, such as ending the participation of transgender girls and women in girls' and women's sports. After hearing that a transgender woman from Wagner College in New York competed in a women's fencing tournament at the University of Maryland last month, the head of the OCR launched a special investigation into both schools and threatened their access to federal funding.

Through internal memos and case data, interviews with more than a dozen current agency attorneys, and public records requests to school districts and other targets of investigations across the country, ProPublica has documented how the Trump administration has radically reshaped the OCR.

Only 57 investigations that found a civil rights violation and led to change at a school or college were completed in March, ProPublica has learned. Only 51 were resolved by finding violations in April. The Biden administration completed as many as 200 investigations a month.

Leadership under President Donald Trump also has made it easier for the OCR to drop discrimination complaints quickly. In March, 91% of cases closed by the office were dismissed without an investigation, and 89% were dismissed outright in April, according to internal case data obtained by ProPublica. Typically, 70% of cases are dismissed because they don't meet criteria to warrant an investigation.

With more than half of the Education Department's civil rights offices closed and the division reduced to a fraction of its former staff, families' pleas for updates and action have gone unheard. One OCR attorney, who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation, told ProPublica that her caseload went from 60 to 380 as she absorbed cases previously handled by employees who worked in offices that had been closed. Some remaining employees have not been able to access documents, voicemail and email of fired employees.

As with civil rights divisions in other federal agencies that the Trump administration has fundamentally altered, the OCR has worked for decades to uphold constitutional rights against discrimination based on disability, race and gender.

“OCR is the most useless it's ever been, and it's the most dangerous it's ever been. And by useless, I mean unavailable. Unable to do the work,” said Michael Pillera, who until recently was an OCR attorney in Washington, D.C. He is now with the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.

Investigating cases that allege racism, discrimination based on sexual orientation or mistreatment of students with disabilities now requires permission from Trump appointees, according to a memo from OCR leadership. As a result, thousands of discrimination investigations are idled, even ones that were nearing a resolution when Trump took office again.

“I thought we were somewhere, and now we are back to square one because they are closed,” said K.D., the mother of the Black California student who said her daughter has been called racial epithets by her classmates. She emailed the agency more than a month ago to try to get an update on the investigation, but said the agency has not responded. ProPublica is identifying her by initials to protect her child's privacy. “I never would have imagined that something so essential would go away,” she said.

Education Department spokespeople did not respond to questions and requests for comment sent over several weeks about changes in the civil rights division.

The OCR attorney who said she is working through 380 cases said the job is now “impossible.”

“The people who remain are doing all they can. We're doing all we can. But it isn't enough, and it keeps us up at night,” she said.

Another OCR attorney who, like others, asked not to be named for fear of retaliation, said the administration's new vision for civil rights enforcement has harmed families.

“We were sort of the last bit of hope for them,” he said, “and now they're calling and emailing and saying, ‘Hey, I thought you all were going to help me.'”

The arduous, grinding work undertaken by OCR attorneys is starkly different from the high-speed investigations that the Education Department announces in press releases every few days.

The OCR, historically one of the government's largest enforcers of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, has been known for being a neutral fact-finder. Its investigators followed a process to determine whether complaints from the public met legal criteria for a civil rights claim, then carried out investigations methodically.

The vast majority of investigations were based on discrimination complaints from students and families, and a large share of those were related to disability discrimination. The inquiries typically took months and, in complex cases, years. The lengthy investigations sometimes were a source of criticism. The agency didn't share details of the investigations until they were completed, and the agreements often involved federal oversight going forward.

Investigations being publicized now have largely bypassed the agency's civil rights attorneys, according to Education Department employees. McMahon and OCR head Craig Trainor created what amounts to a shadow division.

The Trump administration has ordered more than a dozen investigations in the past three months on its own, not initiated by an outside complainant. These “directed investigations” are typically rare; there were none during President Joseph Biden's administration.

The investigations have targeted schools with transgender athletes, gender-neutral bathrooms and initiatives that the administration views as discriminatory to white students. OCR attorneys told ProPublica they've been given prewritten letters, which they've reluctantly signed, to send to targets of these investigations. Some letters describe transgender girls as “biological males,” which is ideologically pointed language that OCR attorneys say they've never used before.

“They're blowing through past precedents, past practices, best practices,” said Catherine Lhamon, who led OCR under former Presidents Barack Obama and Biden and departed the office in January. “And they're not even attempting to appear like neutral arbiters of the law.”

In a first, McMahon and Trainor created ways to divert complaints and investigations away from the OCR's legal experts entirely. The administration made an “End DEI” portal that bypasses the traditional online complaint system and seeks only grievances about diversity, equity and inclusion in schools. Unlike the regular complaint system, the diversity portal submissions are not routed to OCR staff.

“We have no idea where that portal goes, who it goes to, how they review the cases. No idea,” said the attorney who said he struggles with being unable to help families. “That avoids us interfering with the games they're trying to play, if they silo off the real civil rights lawyers.”

McMahon then announced a “Title IX Special Investigations Team” last month to work with the Department of Justice and appointed Trainor to it. It launches its own investigations into schools that include transgender girls in athletics.

In an internal memo to the new team that was obtained by ProPublica, Trainor defined the special team's purpose: “To effectively and efficiently address the increasing volume of Title IX single-sex sports/spaces cases, expedite those investigations and resolutions, and collaborate seamlessly with DOJ to conclude investigations that go to DOJ for enforcement.”

There's no indication that more complaints related to transgender students are coming from the public, according to internal case data. Last month, in what appears to be the first case assigned to the Title IX team, the group notified the University of Maryland and Wagner College that it would investigate each school. The investigation began after Fox News and other media reported about a fencing tournament at the University of Maryland in which a transgender player from Wagner competed. Trainor signed the notification letters himself, a departure from Lhamon's practice.

A Wagner College spokesperson declined to comment. A University of Maryland spokesperson declined to comment about the investigation but said the tournament, while on the university's campus, was run by USA Fencing.

The public used to be able to see what the OCR was investigating. But an online database that is supposed to list all investigations underway hasn't been updated since Trump took office.

At that time, about 12,000 pending investigations were listed. Among them were two related to a family's complaints that their California school district discriminated against students with disabilities, including by barricading them inside what it called a “reset” room. But then the OCR closed its California office and fired its employees.

“All work came to a halt. They stopped responding. Nothing was being done to stop the practice and protect kids,” Genevieve Goldstone, the parent of the Del Mar Union School District student who filed the disability discrimination complaint, said in an interview. “My federal complaints were meant to protect more kids and stop the abuses in the district.”

The district said it could not comment on the pending investigation but said it participated in more than a dozen interviews with an OCR attorney. It also said it conducted its own review of the allegations and determined that they were unsubstantiated.

OCR attorneys say they have been repeatedly blindsided by public announcements about policy changes and investigations. To find out what Trainor and McMahon have launched on their behalf, they check the Education Department's website daily for press releases.

Those statements sometimes quote Trainor preemptively saying a school “appears to violate” civil rights law. The attorneys worry they will have no choice, despite what their investigations uncover, but to find against schools that have already been excoriated by the department publicly.

For example, in a press release announcing an investigation into a transgender athlete participating in girls' track and field in Portland Public Schools in Oregon, Trainor said, “We will not allow the Portland Public Schools District or any other educational entity that receives federal funds to trample on the antidiscrimination protections that women and girls are guaranteed under law.”

A third current OCR attorney, who asked not to be named for fear of losing her job, said the administration is misinterpreting civil rights law. “It's subverting our office, or weaponizing it in these ways, without following our process,” she said.

Conservative groups with complaints about diversity or transgender students have been able to file complaints directly with Trainor and get quick results — another norm-breaking way to operate outside of the OCR's protocol.

America First Legal, a group founded by Trump deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller that considers itself the “answer to the ACLU,” emailed Trainor a few days after Trump's “Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling” executive order. The order directs schools to stop teaching about or supporting diversity, equity and gender identity.

“AFL respectfully requests that the Department of Education open investigations into the following public-school districts in Northern Virginia for continuing violations of Title IX,” the letter read, listing five districts that have policies welcoming to transgender students.

Senior leadership in Washington opened the cases the following week. America First issued a press release headlined “VICTORY.” The group declined to comment further.

Remaking the OCR isn't just about increasing caseloads and reordering political priorities. The Trump administration now is taking steps to roll back OCR's previous civil rights work.

Last month, Trump issued an executive order that directs all federal agencies, including the Education Department, to stop enforcing cases involving policies that disproportionately affect certain groups — for example, when Black students are disciplined more harshly than white students for the same infractions or when students with disabilities are suspended more than any other group even though they represent a small percentage of student enrollment.

Trump's order requires the agencies to “assess all pending investigations, lawsuits, and consent judgements” that consider disproportionate discipline and “take appropriate action.” Complaints made to the OCR that students were unfairly disciplined could be thrown out; existing enforcement actions or monitoring of schools that had disciplined students disproportionately could be revoked.

The OCR under Trainor did this in Rapid City, South Dakota — even before the executive order. About a year ago, the office had signed an agreement with Rapid City Area Schools after an investigation found that the district's Native American students were disciplined far more harshly than white ones. They also were kept from enrolling in advanced courses.

The OCR said that when speaking with an investigator, the superintendent of schools at the time said that Native American students in her district had higher truancy rates because they operated on what she termed “Indian Time.” She said, too, that they don't value education, according to the investigation's findings.

The former superintendent, Nicole Swigart, denied saying any of that.

“I recognize those comments are horrendous,” Swigart said in an interview with ProPublica. She noted that the OCR investigation was opened in 2010 and that she first spoke to an investigator in 2022. “I'm not lying when I say I didn't say it. I didn't say it, and I don't know where it came from.”

In the agreement with the OCR, the district promised to examine its practices and make things right; the OCR would monitor its progress. The district also brought in a new superintendent.

But last month, the OCR abruptly terminated that agreement, based on its differing interpretation of civil rights law. The OCR's new view is that equity and diversity efforts discriminate against white students. It was, in the view of agency attorneys, the most severe breach of the OCR's mission and methods to date. There was no public announcement.

“Native students in Rapid City just lost a layer of protection,” the Lakota People's Law Project announced on Facebook. “Native students are still being pushed out of classrooms and denied opportunities.”

Darren Thompson, who is Ojibwe, said the OCR's decision to abandon the agreement was “another cycle of the federal government failing to uphold its promises.”

“And this time, they are partisan, political,” said Thompson, who works for the nonprofit Sacred Defense Fund affiliated with the Lakota group in Rapid City.

In response to questions from ProPublica, the school district said it has completed much of the work — including broader access to educational opportunities and an improved behavior tracking process — and plans to continue it even without federal oversight. But it also said this week that under the OCR's new directives, “we must shift our approach.” The district did not elaborate on what will change.

It's unclear whether the OCR has ended agreements with other districts or colleges. Education Department spokespeople did not respond to questions from ProPublica.

Some subjects of the OCR's new directives and investigations have capitulated. A school district in Tumwater, Washington, that Trainor targeted for allowing a transgender basketball player from an opposing team to compete responded by voting to support the state athletic association excluding trans players altogether.

But some are pushing back.

Denver Public Schools was the first target of one of Trainor's “directed investigations” in late January — over the existence of one all-gender, multistall bathroom on one floor of a Denver high school. According to communication obtained by ProPublica through public records requests, the district called out the OCR for “continuing to take a different approach with this case without explanation, a case with no complainant who is awaiting any form of relief or remedy.”

Kristin Bailey, a Denver Public Schools attorney, wrote to an OCR supervisor that the way the investigation is being handled “appears to be retaliatory.”

Since February, at least half a dozen lawsuits have been filed to try to stop the dismantling of the Education Department and its civil rights functions — among them, suits by Democratic state attorneys general and from the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers. A recent suit by the Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates on behalf of children and their parents — all of whom have pending complaints alleging discrimination — claims they're suffering from the OCR's “abandonment” of its core mission.

The NAACP also sued the department, McMahon and Trainor, citing the “End DEI” portal and seeking a halt to such anti-diversity efforts. And the Victim Rights Law Center, representing students and parents, sued to try to restore what has been cut from the OCR so the agency can fulfill its mandate. It noted that under McMahon and Trainor, “cherry-picked investigations appear to be the only matters the Department is currently pursuing.” Those lawsuits are pending. The government has argued in the NAACP lawsuit that the group lacks standing, and in the other it has not filed a response.

Several OCR attorneys told ProPublica that they hope these groups and school districts continue to push back. In the meantime, they said, they will continue to try to work on behalf of the public to uphold the nation's civil rights laws.

“I have to keep putting one foot in front of the other, helping the people I can help, and keep my eye on the long game,” said a fourth OCR attorney. “Hopefully we're still here and can help rebuild in the future.”

Democrats have urged the IRS internal watchdog to probe whether Trump targeting Harvard's tax-exempt status is illegal.

On Friday, President Donald Trump announced that he intends to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status, despite the university's recent moves to comply with many of the administration's demands.

“We are going to be taking away Harvard's Tax Exempt Status. It's what they deserve!” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.

In response, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (New York) and three other Democratic senators have demanded that the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) internal watchdog investigate whether the Trump administration is unlawfully pressuring the agency to target Harvard.

Just weeks ago, Harvard was celebrated for resisting the Trump administration's threats to withhold $2.2 billion in federal funding, positioning itself as a defender of academic freedom by filing a lawsuit challenging the funding freeze. But recently, the university has quietly reversed course, rebranding and altering the mission of its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) office, announcing that it will no longer fund affinity group celebrations during commencement, and sharing international student information with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

“You mean to tell me banning affinity group graduations, handing over school records to the DHS gestapo, cracking down on protests, and dismantling DEI didn't appease this fascist dictator?! I'm shocked I tell you,” Harvard Law School instructor Alejandra Caraballo said on Bluesky. 

Earlier this year, Columbia University faced backlash for similar concessions. In an attempt to restore $400 million in frozen federal funding, Columbia agreed to suspend or expel students who participated in pro-Palestine protests, enforce a mask ban for demonstrators, coordinate with police to monitor students, and place an entire academic department under federal receivership. Despite these sweeping actions, the university has yet to recover the withheld funding.

“We literally saw this with Columbia and yet Harvard leadership seems inclined to learn this lesson the hard way,” Caraballo said. “There is no appeasing fascists. There is only fighting back.”

Last week, students affiliated with the unrecognized campus groups Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine and Jews 4 Palestine held a rally condemning Harvard University for targeting pro-Palestinian students and yielding to pressure from the Trump administration. Organizers emphasized that Harvard's quiet capitulation should come as no surprise. 

“Harvard's Zionism and Trump's fascism are not at odds. They are two sides of the same coin,” said Violet T.M. Barron, a Harvard University student and opinion writer at the Harvard Crimson. 

After several hours of speeches and chants, protesters dropped banners, including one that read: “Harvard: You can't be Zionist and Anti-Fascist.”

In March, Harvard's School of Public Health terminated its research partnership with Birzeit University, a leading Palestinian institution in the occupied West Bank. That same month, Harvard removed Professors Cemal Kafadar and Rosie Bsheer from their leadership positions at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies. In April, the Divinity School suspended its Religion, Conflict, and Peace Initiative and declined to renew the position of Hilary Rantisi, its associate director and the only Palestinian American staff member in the school.

“Until the University rights its myriad wrongs, it deserves protest — not applause,” Barron wrote in the Crimson last month.

A staffer of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) said on May 1 that he dropped out of Harvard University to join the advisory commission and described losing friends and facing social ostracization at his former school afterward.

DOGE leader Elon Musk and his team sat down with Fox News host Jesse Watters for an interview that aired on Thursday evening, discussing some of their findings after auditing various federal agencies.

One DOGE member, Ethan, said he dropped out of Harvard University to join the advisory commission, which President Donald Trump created by executive order earlier this year to find waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal government.

Ethan said he has received threats and lost friends after joining DOGE.

“Young folks of [DOGE] have gotten email threats from reporters and the public alike. Speaking for myself, I dropped out of Harvard and came here to serve my country, and it's been unfortunate to see lost friendships,” he said.

“Most of campus hates me now, but I think fundamentally, I hope, people realize through conversations like this that reform is genuinely needed.”

The source said that federal law enforcement had been dispatched to protect family members of DOGE staffers after their names were leaked to the press.

Some anonymous users on the social platform Bluesky had made posts disclosing DOGE employees' names and faces, and in one post, the words “Dead or Alive.”

Rep. Derrick Van Orden (R-Wis.), who leads the House DOGE Caucus's defense and veterans' affairs portfolio, told The Epoch Times that “if those people broke the law by doxxing these folks and doing that and threatening them, they should be thrown into prison.”

“I don't mean jail. I don't mean a fine,” he added. “People that are doing these death threats need to go to prison, or it's not going to stop.”

On Thursday, DOGE member Ethan said he was inspired to join DOGE to pursue governmental reform.

“I think the value of this and the impact here is so much more vast than anything you could learn in a classroom doing computer science,” he said.

Harvard is suing the Trump administration after the president froze $2 billion in funds, accusing the university of not doing enough to quash anti-Semitism on campus and of not eliminating its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs.

Harvard accused the Trump administration of forcing it to allow micromanagement of its academic affairs at the threat of jeopardizing the “institution's ability to pursue medical breakthroughs, scientific discoveries, and innovative solutions.”","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

A congressional committee is investigating reports that more than a hundred Chinese nationals are serving as mercenaries for the Russian military in Ukraine.

The Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has requested information from the State Department about the Ukrainian government's claims that Chinese nationals are fighting for Russia in the occupied Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine.

Zelenskyy's comments marked the first time that the Ukrainian government made such a claim about Chinese fighters, although Russia is believed to have deployed approximately 10,000 North Korean troops to the front lines as it has struggled to replenish its battlefield losses.

The CCP has denied sending anyone to fight for Russia.

The Select Committee has sent a letter to the State Department requesting a classified briefing on the veracity of the reports, as well as a rundown of any diplomatic contacts with China that the Department has had concerning the reports and any policies being considered by the Trump administration in response.

According to a copy of the Select Committee's letter shared with The Epoch Times, it is unlikely that such a large number of Chinese nationals could be fighting for Russia without at least tacit approval from the CCP.

“The reported presence of PRC mercenaries in Ukraine is only the latest evidence of Beijing's extensive support for Russia's war effort,” the letter reads, using an acronym for the official name of communist China, the People's Republic of China.

“Given the Chinese Communist Party's broad control in Chinese society, it is clear that Russia's recruitment campaign of PRC nationals could not exist without at least the tacit approval of the Party.”

To that end, the Select Committee's letter notes that the intelligence community's most recent annual threat assessment found that the CCP is providing economic and security assistance for Russia's war in Ukraine by supporting the Russian defense industrial sector and providing dual-use technologies, including components used for weapons systems.

Beijing and Moscow have grown closer since Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

The Select Committee's letter frames the potential involvement of Chinese mercenaries in the Russian forces as further evidence that the two powers are aligning to undermine the United States and its allies by any means necessary.

“The recent reporting on Chinese mercenaries fighting in Ukraine, in addition to the PRC's broader support for the Russian war effort, underscores the deepening alignment between the autocratic regimes in Beijing and Moscow, including their mutual support and encouragement of each other's expansionist aims.”

The Florida Legislature became the first in the nation to pass a bill criminalizing methods of weather modification and bioengineering activities such as cloud seeding.

Any person caught doing so would be charged with a third-degree felony, punishable with up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $100,000. All funds collected through the enforcement of this new law would be deposited in the Air Pollution Control Trust Fund and would be strictly used for air pollution control purposes.

The language of the bill accounts for both private individuals and corporate entities, and ensures that a general report line will be open for any person to submit via email. All operators of public infrastructure, like airports, will be required to submit monthly reports on weather modification or geoeingeneering to the Department of Transportation beginning Oct. 1.

The bill was championed by state Rep. Kevin Steele and state Sen. Ileana Garcia, in their respective chambers. Both are Republicans. The legislation passed in the state Senate with a vote of 28–9 on April 3, and the state House on April 30 by a vote of 82–28.

Cloud seeding involves dispensing heavy metals such as silver iodide into the atmosphere to induce precipitation, and solar radiation modification, or solar geoengineering, is the process of using heavy metals such as sulfur dioxide to reflect more of the sun's rays back into space in an effort to curb global warming.

“Heavy metals, which are found in weather modification patents, can have severe effects on human health when ingested, inhaled, or touches our skin,” the fact sheet stated.

Those possible effects include kidney damage, liver cancer, neurological damage, autism, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and immune system dysfunction.

Several states on both sides of the political aisle already allow or even fund weather modification, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Texas, and Wyoming. At the same time, other states including Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Illinois, and Tennessee have already taken measures to ban or restrict it.

The Epoch Times has reached out to both Garcia and Steele for comment.

The news of the bill's passage was celebrated on social media platform X, including by a grassroots coalition called the Global Wellness Forum.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

In 2021, at the contentious first meeting between senior Chinese foreign policy officials and their counterparts in the Biden administration, Beijing's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, declared that the United States could no longer “speak with China from a position of strength.” The statement, which seemed to unsettle U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, has proved instructive for understanding China's strategic outlook. In the four years since, Beijing has operated under the assumption that a profound shift in the balance of power between the two countries is underway. Chinese strategists perceive their country's decades-long “strategic weakness” in its competition with the United States as coming to an end, driven by steady advances in China's industrial, technological, and military capabilities and an increase in its international influence. This progress has ushered in what Beijing views as a “strategic stalemate” with the United States, in which both nations now wield comparable power.

The reelection of U.S. President Donald Trump did little to shake Beijing's optimism that it can navigate continued threats from the United States, secure a lasting equilibrium, and vie for global supremacy. And Trump's early second-term actions have strengthened Beijing's conviction that the United States is accelerating its own decline, bringing a new era of parity ever closer. The perception that China likely does not face an existential threat from the United States has had a stabilizing effect on policy in Beijing, which has responded to Trump's escalation of trade tensions in April with patience, anticipating that Trump will eventually lower U.S. tariffs in an attempt to reach an agreement.

But despite the low immediate risk of conflict between the United States and China, the current stalemate may not prove durable. Over the next four years, the risk of a military crisis will likely rise as the two countries increasingly test each other's resolve. By the time Trump's current term nears its conclusion, China will have had ample opportunity to reevaluate the United States' domestic political environment, its commitment to Taiwan, the global economy's dependence on the island's semiconductor industry, and the trajectory of China's own economic development and military modernization. The risk of a U.S.-Chinese military crisis could sharply escalate if Beijing further closes the capability gap with Washington and perceives international indifference to Taiwan's status, grows frustrated with nonmilitary efforts to unite Taiwan with China, and foresees more pro-Taiwan leadership in Washington and Taipei. What appears today as strategic stalemate could rapidly transform into something more volatile—and dangerous—for both countries.

Beijing has been willing to bide its time as Trump unilaterally weakens the United States' standing in the world. Despite the Trump administration's aggressive tariffs on China, many Chinese strategists have downplayed the frequently voiced international concern that the trade war raises the risk of military conflict. In their eyes, heightened trade tensions are simply the first phase of Trump's signature negotiating tactic: squeeze hard, then back down and cut a deal. China, it appears, is content to let Trump's trademark strategy run its course, expecting it to falter as the United States faces severe economic and diplomatic consequences.

Beijing has shown similarly little inclination to initiate near-term military conflict, even over issues of core national interest such as Taiwan. This restraint, however, has been underwritten by a military buildup, spanning conventional and nuclear forces, that Chinese officials see as critical to shifting the balance of power with the United States. Trump's fixation on “holding the cards” in international disputes only reinforces Beijing's conviction that hard power rules. And Beijing believes it is in position to gain the upper hand.

Despite Trump's stated interest in arms control talks with China and Russia, officials in Beijing see the White House's erratic, disjointed decision-making as an impediment to any potential grand bargain. They feel less inclined to pursue cooperative security measures and are prioritizing the development of China's own military capabilities. As the United States' global authority fades rapidly, international pressure on China to join arms control talks will diminish. Moreover, Beijing sees the U.S. defense industrial base as faltering, hampered by an increasingly disordered governance system. Trump's posturing, including his commitment to maintaining the world's most powerful military and his proposal to build a “Golden Dome” missile defense system, no longer rattles Beijing as it once did. As the United States diverts resources toward fanciful efforts to defend its homeland against China's comparatively low-cost attack capabilities, Beijing effectively strains U.S. resources at little cost to itself.

China's military buildup and its assessment of the United States' stagnation has also emboldened Beijing to act more assertively to shape the behavior of smaller countries in the region. As Washington's capacity and credibility erode, China is openly courting U.S. allies such as Australia, Japan, and South Korea while drawing firmer redlines around its core interests. Its seemingly contradictory surges in economic and diplomatic outreach and its military muscle flexing, evident in high-profile drills near Australia and Japan in February, are, in China's view, actions characteristic of the great power it believes it has become.

Chief among those interests is Taiwan. Despite rising political and military tensions across the strait since Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te took office in 2024, China's Taiwan Work Conference in February and the convening of the Chinese Communist Party's “Two Sessions” conferences in March revealed more continuity than change in Beijing's near-term Taiwan strategy, which combines patience with the methodical, systematic expansion of control over cross-strait relations. This indicates no significant elevation in the threat of an attack in the near term.

Although the Chinese Communist Party's recent meetings have not suggested that a Chinese military move against the island is imminent, the risk of a conflict in the medium term is growing. In recent years, Beijing's strategy has evolved from primarily preventing Taiwanese independence to actively pursuing unification, culminating in the CCP's 2021 plan, “Overall Strategy for Resolving the Taiwan Question in the New Era.” Details are limited, but the new approach seems to emphasize the boosting of China's influence within Taiwanese society, nudging Taiwanese to see unification as their least bad option. According to authorities in Taiwan, Beijing has been collaborating with Taiwanese civil-society organizations, political parties, and influencers to undercut Taipei's narratives, handing out Chinese ID cards to Taiwanese citizens, and even securing loyalty pledges from Taiwanese military officers. China may see such measures as legitimate, whereas Taiwan's countermeasures, such as Lai's 17-point plan to combat such infiltration, appear to Beijing as acts of pro-independence defiance that have required China to intensify its air and sea incursions and carry out bigger, bolder military drills. Beijing, which has largely turned its back on Lai's administration, has little hope that a pro-Chinese leader will win Taiwan's 2028 presidential election, increasing the likelihood of escalation with Taipei. Ultimately, even nonmilitary unification measures regarded by Beijing as peaceful carry a risk of military escalation to all-out conflict, one that could draw in the United States.

Trump's lack of clear foreign policy priorities amplifies this risk. His reluctance to engage in conflicts with a great power, lack of interest in defending other democracies, and shaky commitment to Taiwan loom large to Chinese officials. Many in Beijing suspect that if any U.S. president might quietly tolerate China's coercive takeover of Taiwan, it would be Trump. China's early April military exercises in the strait served in part as a probe of his resolve. The Trump administration's verbal condemnations in response did not impress Beijing, with Chinese analysts highlighting the relatively muted nature of the U.S. response.

Other restraining forces are also rapidly weakening. As the United States engages in naked coercion of allies and adversaries alike, smaller states in the region and beyond face new dilemmas. They have fewer incentives to antagonize China, especially as it positions itself as a comparatively more predictable and less disruptive global power that consistently outpaces the United States in economic and military growth. As the U.S.-led Western bloc fragments, the international will and capacity to pressure China toward restraint in Taiwan may wane in a more multipolar world.

For its part, the Trump administration is beefing up the United States' military deterrent against China amid growing concerns about Beijing's aggressive actions in Asia. But internal fissures have impeded the effort. Erratic, disruptive overhauls in the Pentagon and broader bureaucracy, driven by administration loyalists eager to carry out the president's agenda, have made Beijing doubt the United States' ability to bolster its military capabilities. Senior Defense Department officials aren't fully aligned on the importance of Taiwan to U.S. strategy. Elbridge Colby, the Pentagon's policy chief, for example, has said that “Americans could survive without it” and is pushing instead to thwart China's broader regional dominance. Trump's own wavering commitment to Taiwan further risks rendering any military preparations hollow. His recent dismissal of National Security Council senior officials insufficiently committed to his “America first” foreign policy sounded a warning shot to like-minded peers across the administration.

Meanwhile, the ratcheting up of tensions sparked by the trade war has strengthened national cohesion within China. Even the country's most liberal-leaning strategists, previously less critical of U.S. policy, now label Washington the aggressor and advocate for tougher measures to counter U.S. economic and foreign policy pressure. To many, Chinese President Xi Jinping's forecast of “great changes unseen in a century” appears prescient. This growing internal consensus, however, makes Beijing less likely to engage in the critical self-reflection necessary to dispassionately evaluate its own strategic planning—and more likely to intensify its military buildup and pursuit of unification.

Likewise, Trump's demand for loyalty and his expansive use of executive power to enforce compliance and conformity across the government have eroded the administration's ability to self-evaluate. And without dissenting voices within the administration, the United States cannot plan and develop effective military deterrence and responsibly manage future military crises.

Ultimately, these internal dynamics—more than long-standing trade and foreign policy disputes—pose the greatest threat of turning strategic stalemate into acute crisis. To reduce the risks of catastrophic conflict, strategists in Beijing and Washington should look inward and scrutinize their own leadership before the uneasy stalemate can no longer hold.

A U.S. president was trying to end an exceptionally violent war between Russia and its neighbor. He also had clear preferences on which side he admired more. “I like the Russians,” the president wrote. But the American people favored the other side, and, as a result, he noted, Washington needed to be “scrupulous in its impartiality between the combatants.” The president was Theodore Roosevelt, and the war was between Russia and Japan. U.S. neutrality, combined with Russia's and Japan's respect for Roosevelt and American power, allowed the White House to mediate an end to that bloody war in 1905. For his efforts, Roosevelt would become the first U.S. president to earn a Nobel Peace Prize.

More than a century later, another U.S. president is seeking to end another bloody war involving Russia and a neighboring country. Even more than Roosevelt, President Donald Trump favors the Russians in this war, while again most Americans support the other side. Trump has also made clear that he regards ending the war in Ukraine as a crucial goal for his presidency and that in bringing the two sides together, he, too, hopes to win a Nobel Peace Prize—adding to a hallowed U.S. tradition of presidential peacemaking. But this time, the path forward is far less certain. During his campaign, Trump promised he could end the war in 24 hours. Despite much maneuvering by the White House, however, the first hundred days of Trump's second administration have come and gone with little prospect of the fighting ending soon. The administration has reached a separate deal with Ukraine, announced on April 30, to give the United States a stake in Ukraine's mineral resources, but although the agreement is meant to signal U.S. investment in Ukraine's future, it appears largely unrelated to the more pressing question of its war-torn present. All of which suggests that Trump has taken a very different approach to mediation from that of his predecessors.

Despite Roosevelt's early example, U.S. mediation of foreign conflicts did not become a staple of American foreign policy until the Cold War, when Washington's concerns became global instead of merely regional. Ever since, however, presidents have often found that the act of committing the prestige of the world's strongest superpower to a peace process, although no guarantee of success, can significantly increase the odds. The United States played a central role, for example, in reaching a cease-fire and partial Israeli withdrawal in the Sinai after the Yom Kippur War in 1973, in securing a peace in Bosnia in 1995, and in solving the Northern Ireland dispute in 1998. And when they have involved themselves personally in the negotiations, U.S. presidents have usually succeeded, albeit with some notable exceptions. Richard Nixon couldn't make peace between Syria and Israel in 1974; Bill Clinton managed to get Israel and Jordan to sign a historic peace treaty in 1994 but fell short of his far more ambitious goal to establish a more comprehensive Israeli-Palestinian peace deal. Even when successful, however, not every president-diplomat has been rewarded for his efforts by the Norwegian Nobel Committee.

Although historical parallels must be drawn with caution, three presidential mediations provide useful standards by which to judge Trump's efforts to end the war in Ukraine. Along with Roosevelt's negotiation with Russia and Japan in 1905, John F. Kennedy's tough experience with the Netherlands and Indonesia in 1962 and Jimmy Carter's triumph with Egypt and Israel at Camp David in 1978 suggest conditions needed for success but also potential sources of disappointment.

Roosevelt said no when the idea of mediating the Russo-Japanese War was first raised with him in 1904. The suggestion came from Baron Kentaro Kaneko, a Japanese diplomat who had overlapped with Roosevelt at Harvard, a few months after Japan launched a surprise attack on the Russian-controlled port of Lushun (Port Arthur) in Manchuria. Although the president recognized that the United States had an interest in the outcome of this faraway imperial competition, he was focused on his reelection campaign and doubted that the war would alter the balance of power in East Asia.

When the Japanese unexpectedly routed the Russian Baltic Fleet in May 1905, however, Roosevelt changed his mind. As he later explained, he wanted to prevent “Japan from driving Russia completely out of East Asia.” At this point, Tsar Nicholas II was in no rush to pursue peace, but Roosevelt found another way to persuade him. Through his friend Kaneko, the president encouraged the Japanese to invade Sakhalin Island, which had once been divided between Japan and Russia before Russia gained full control of it in 1875. Roosevelt correctly assumed that the loss of Russian territory would alter Nicholas's calculations. Meanwhile, aware that the Japanese were riding waves of debt to British shipbuilders and could not afford a forever war, the president advised them to halt further offensives. Soon after the invasion of Sakhalin, both sides agreed to meet in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, under U.S. mediation.



After the talks began in August 1905, two sticking points quickly emerged: reparations and the future of Sakhalin. The Japanese offered to withdraw from Manchuria if Tokyo could inherit Russia's special economic position in the Chinese province, where it controlled the main port and had built and operated the Chinese Eastern Railway. But they intended to keep Sakhalin and expected Russia to pay them an indemnity of $7 billion (approximately $251 billion today) for the cost of the war. The Russians were willing to concede to the Japanese what they wanted in China, as long as Japan withdrew from Sakhalin and dropped the demand for an indemnity.

This left Roosevelt struggling to whittle the distance between the two sides, reducing the Japanese demands for money and the Russian designs on all of Sakhalin. In the end, with the talks on the verge of collapse, the Imperial Court in Japan accepted the tsar's final offer: half an island and no money. The tsar had likely been impressed with an argument made by Roosevelt's envoy in St. Petersburg that since the island had long been divided, Nicholas wasn't actually giving up Russian land. Tokyo had learned of the tsar's willingness to accept half of Sakhalin through the British, whom the Americans had kept informed of Roosevelt's backchannel. Faced with the prospect of continuing to fight at great expense or agreeing to a peace that gave it most of what it wanted, Tokyo chose the latter, accepting even less than what Roosevelt had been advocating all along. The two sides signed the Treaty of Portsmouth in September.

Roosevelt's success laid down a few markers for later presidents. His key contribution had been to keep the two sides negotiating until they reached a formula they both could accept, a process that involved mutual concessions on the main sticking points. Worn down by the negotiations, the Russians and the Japanese came to agree with the president that prolonging the war would not serve their respective interests. This breakthrough was largely possible because neither St. Petersburg nor Tokyo saw Roosevelt as favoring the other side.

By this measure, Trump has already failed. In advance of direct talks, he and his representatives have offered major concessions to Moscow, including U.S. recognition of Russia's annexation of Crimea and acknowledgment of Russian sovereignty over other occupied areas. Meanwhile, he has publicly berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and even falsely accused him of starting the war. Given this lopsided approach, Trump has done little to build the reputation for neutrality needed to be a credible mediator for both sides.

Some presidential mediations can end badly even when they initially achieve the desired result. In 1962, President John F. Kennedy deployed his brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, to resolve a vestigial colonial dispute in Southeast Asia. Under its strongman leader, Sukarno, Indonesia was claiming the western half of the island of New Guinea (now Irian Jaya), which had remained a Dutch colony after Indonesia won its independence from the Netherlands in 1949. But the Netherlands wanted the approximately 500,000 Papuans who inhabited the territory—a largely Christian people who did not want unification with Muslim Indonesia—to achieve self-determination, charging Sukarno with being neo-imperialist. Both The Hague and Djakarta were willing to fight to defend their positions.

Kennedy had entered office hoping to alter Washington's reputation in the developing world by encouraging reform movements and decolonization as a way to outflank Moscow. Despite the demographics of Dutch New Guinea, the president believed the optics of siding with the Netherlands against Sukarno's land grab would undermine U.S. influence in the region. It would also likely push Sukarno into the arms of the Soviets, who were already courting Indonesia. Moreover, Washington could ill afford another conflict in Southeast Asia given the challenges it was already facing in Laos and the growing trouble in South Vietnam.

In early 1962, after the U.S. standoff with the Soviets over the status of Berlin seemed to have briefly settled down, Kennedy believed it was time to pressure the Netherlands to cede West New Guinea to Indonesia. In February, the president dispatched his attorney general as his personal envoy to calm and flatter Sukarno into engaging in face-saving negotiations for the Dutch and then speak bluntly to the Dutch about how the process had to end. Neither side was happy to see the president's brother, and Sukarno refused to negotiate unless the Dutch promised him in advance to transfer their colony directly to Indonesian control. When Robert Kennedy pointed out that such a concession in advance was impossible, Sukarno threatened to revoke his earlier promise to free a CIA operative, who had been sentenced to death in Indonesia for involvement in a covert operation during the Eisenhower administration.



Meanwhile, the Dutch insisted they needed guarantees for the Papuan people. “We were not dealing with completely reasonable men on either side of this controversy,” Robert Kennedy later wrote. Nevertheless, direct U.S. engagement altered both sides' calculations. Following the attorney general's visits to the two capitals, the two sides agreed to meet, without preconditions, if the Kennedy administration provided the mediation. In March, the delegations arrived in Middleburg, Virginia, to begin negotiations.

Almost immediately, however, the talks broke down, and by May, U.S. intelligence was reporting that Sukarno was putting his forces into West New Guinea to coerce the Dutch. The president now faced a crucial decision: as National Security Council member Robert Komer put it, “Do our larger interests in Southeast Asia demand a peaceful settlement (even if this forces us to lean toward Indo side to get one), or should we preserve a more even-handed approach, based on the merits of the issue, as Secretary [Dean] Rusk seems to favor?” The president prodded the two capitals for action and convinced them to return to Middleburg in July. Although not yet directly involved in the talks, the president also signed off on a new U.S. formula for peace, which included a transitional administration and the promise of a plebiscite for the Papuans.

But Sukarno continued to stonewall. He accepted that, to allow the Dutch to save face, the former colony could be transferred to the United Nations, but only very briefly, before being transferred to Indonesia; but he agreed to nothing else. The president lost his patience. In a dressing down in the Oval Office, he reminded Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio that he, Kennedy, had consistently favored the Indonesians in this dispute, and vowed to side with the Dutch if Sukarno chose a full invasion of New Guinea over a diplomatic solution. Subandrio, taken aback, suggested that Kennedy appeal directly to Sukarno. On July 30, Kennedy signed a letter that Komer, its drafter, called “a flowery appeal to Sukarno's ego,” and the next day, Indonesia reached an agreement with the Netherlands that roughly followed the final U.S. proposal.

Yet far from increasing stability and enhancing U.S. influence in a strategic region, as Kennedy hoped, the deal only emboldened Sukarno, who a year later employed the same pressure tactics to break apart the new state of Malaysia. Sukarno coveted the former British colonies of North Borneo and Sarawak, which had been incorporated into independent Malaysia. Indonesia's war on Malaysia would not end until Sukarno's overthrow in 1965. And when the Indonesian government carried out the plebiscite mandated in the agreement, it permitted only a limited number of Papuans to participate, in a vote that was designed to ensure that Indonesia won.

For the Trump administration today, the outcome of Kennedy's mediation provides a cautionary tale. Putin and Sukarno aren't twins, but their worldviews share a burning dislike of the status quo. Any deal that concedes too much to a heavily armed power with designs on its neighbors may only lay the ground for future aggression.

Jimmy Carter would have a different takeaway about a U.S. president's role in mediation. Whereas Roosevelt and Kennedy had largely overseen peace talks from the margins, Carter was front and center in the Camp David negotiations of 1978. During 13 days of secret negotiations, the president became the human link between Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, meeting separately with each leader and their aides, and having a hand in each of the 23 drafts as the final settlement took shape.

Although Carter had the advantage that both Jerusalem and Cairo wanted a settlement, the two sides strongly disagreed over the extent of any Israeli pullback from the Sinai, which Israel had occupied since the 1967 Six-Day War. Sadat wanted a complete withdrawal, including the dismantling of the settlements Israel had created there. But for Begin, although he understood that an agreement with Egypt over the Sinai would relieve international pressure to end the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, he and many members of his cabinet did not envision removing the Sinai settlements.

Along with Israeli opposition to a full withdrawal, the American president also faced the difficulty of maneuvering in a region of multiple conflicts. Cairo needed—and the Carter administration wanted—the Israeli-Egyptian agreement to be tied to some kind of process toward self-rule for the millions of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. Although Carter didn't seek an independent Palestinian state, he hoped to achieve, as he wrote in shorthand notes on the eve of the Camp David meetings, “Palestine auth[ority] in all areas.”

Like Roosevelt and Kennedy, Carter was more sympathetic to one side in the negotiations—in this case, Egypt. Nonetheless, he, too, took great pains to act as an honest broker. Carter's national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, counseled the president to suggest to Sadat that he not accept U.S. proposals too quickly. “It will help our credibility if we are seen to be pressing both sides for concessions,” Brzezinski said.

A week into the negotiations, the prospects for a deal looked dim. Begin informed Carter privately that he couldn't compromise on the settlements; meanwhile, the Israeli delegation was pushing for separating the Sinai negotiation from any discussion of Palestinian aspirations. For his part, Carter refused to drop the Palestinian issue, but he did see that the question of Israel's Sinai settlements might be finessed. He proposed to both parties that that issue be left out of a preliminary accord, making it instead the focus of subsequent negotiations toward a final agreement.



By trying to meet the Israelis halfway, Carter caused a crisis with the Egyptians. On September 15, Sadat told the president privately that he would walk away. Carter then laid it on the line. “If you leave,” he told the Egyptian leader, “it will mean first of all an end to the relationship between the United States and Egypt.” He added: “It would probably mean the end of my presidency…. And last but not least, it will mean the end of something very precious to me: my friendship with you.” Moved by Carter's candor and the implied threat, Sadat agreed to stay the weekend.

Carter then went to Begin, and after a seemingly endless discussion, Begin agreed to dismantle the settlements and pull out completely from the peninsula, but only if the Israeli Knesset ratified the withdrawal first. Perhaps Begin expected the parliament to veto a full withdrawal, but it didn't matter to Carter: Begin had lifted his veto, and the Egyptians could be told that the Israeli leader had agreed in principle to a full withdrawal. (The Knesset approved the plan a week later.)

Why did Begin relent? Begin's biographer, Avi Shilon, credits a call to Ariel Sharon, the Israeli general and future prime minister, who, as Begin's minister of agriculture, was the driving force behind the Israeli settlements. Like the U.S. envoy who assured the tsar in 1905 that Southern Sakhalin wasn't really Russia, Sharon assured Begin that a tactical concession on settlements in an area that was not historically viewed as Israel would not effect settlement activity in the West Bank. Ehud Olmert, another future Israeli prime minister, who was then a rising star in the Likud Party, later told the former U.S. ambassador and historian Stuart Eizenstat that the key issue for Begin and his government was that Carter threatened to publicly blame Israel if the talks collapsed.

In the end, Carter even managed to achieve something on the Palestinian question, with the two sides agreeing to work for “full autonomy” for the Palestinian people. It was a vague formulation, but neither side wanted the Palestinian issue to be the ultimate roadblock to a peace agreement. This concession was greater for Egypt, which under Sadat's predecessor Gamal Abdel Nasser had positioned itself as the great defender of the Palestinians; ultimately, Sadat, who was assassinated by Islamists in 1981, gave his life for it. In the waning moments of the weekend, however, it was Begin who suffered an attack of buyer's remorse and threatened to walk away. With success for all parties now within easy reach, Carter used a softer approach with Begin. As Begin was preparing to leave Camp David, the president had albums of photographs of the Camp David summit prepared for each of Begin's grandchildren, inscribing each one to each grandchild, which he delivered himself to Begin. Profoundly touched, Begin's resistance melted away, and he followed through on the deal after all.

Like Roosevelt, Carter succeeded largely because of the reputation for fairness he had developed with both sides. Trump has not invested in building a similar reputation, especially with Kyiv. Carter's likely use of the additional tactic of threatening to pressure Begin publicly has no analog in a presidential mediation that has already involved threats—mainly aimed at Ukraine—on social media. The pressure points available to Trump are the U.S. sanctions on Russia and the U.S. weapons that Ukraine needs.

Trump's campaign to secure a deal between Russia and Ukraine is cut from a different cloth from these three earlier cases—and, indeed, different from that of all other presidential efforts to resolve third-party conflicts. In none of these previous cases did the United States seek something for itself other than the goal of regional peace and security. There were no side deals sought for U.S. economic exploitation of Manchuria, West New Guinea, or the Sinai, as the Trump administration has done in seeking to exploit Ukraine's mineral wealth. And although each had to use threats to nudge the parties along, Roosevelt, Kennedy, and Carter were not signaling a desire for one of the sides to undergo regime change, as Trump has done by demanding elections in Ukraine.

In each of the cases, the mediating president could have done more for the people who were affected by the arrangements in question, including the Chinese (in the case of Russo-Japanese peace), the Papuans, and the Palestinians. Nevertheless, all three U.S. leaders understood that these groups had legitimate interests. By contrast, the Trump negotiating team acts as if it is unaware of the existence, much less the interests, of the several million Ukrainians who remain in the 20 percent of the country now occupied by Russia.

When viewed as a whole, Trump's initiative appears less a neutral mediation of a third-party dispute than a means to achieve a diminished U.S. commitment to Ukrainian sovereignty and curry favor with Moscow. Instead of looking for sources of compromise on both sides and then narrowing the areas of disagreement, Trump has preemptively endorsed the main Russian interpretation of the war—that modern Ukraine included territories that rightfully belonged to Russia, that Kyiv is a more provocative regional player than Moscow, and that Moscow's efforts at regional peace have been undermined by NATO overreach. Trump has also sought to delegitimize the effort of his predecessor, Joe Biden, to assemble and lead a Western coalition to support Ukraine's defense, suggesting that the American people were somehow duped and now deserve repayment. Roosevelt, Kennedy, and Carter knew the United States would benefit from a successful mediation but didn't seek to use their mediations to extract material benefits or stir domestic politics.

Despite Trump's apparently cordial conversation with Zelensky at the Vatican on the margins of Pope Francis's funeral last week, and the minerals deal that soon followed, a photograph of Putin and Zelensky shaking hands on the White House lawn is unlikely. The prospect that Trump's negotiations will earn him the Nobel he so publicly covets seems highly remote. To the extent that the president cares about Putin's next steps in Europe, he should bear in mind a lesson from the least known of these three cases: the appetites of imperialists grow with the eating.

Tennessee state law enforcement released video showing a 2022 traffic stop involving Kilmar Abrego Garcia, one of the incidents the Trump administration officials have used to justify the removal of the Maryland man who the government has admitted was wrongly deported to El Salvador in March. US officials have argued the traffic stop in November 2022, in which Abrego Garcia was not detained or charged, supports their claims that Abrego Garcia was a member of MS-13 and involved in human trafficking. A redacted police report released to CNN by the highway patrol did not address suspicions of human trafficking. Abrego Garcia's family and his lawyers deny those claims.

Live Updates


            • Economic developments: China said it is “currently assessing” proposals by the US to begin trade talks. It comes as the exemption allowing Chinese goods to be shipped duty-free into the US expired just after midnight. President Donald Trump is also calling on the Fed to lower interest rates after a better-than-expected jobs report.



            • Trump Cabinet changes: Trump removed Mike Waltz as national security adviser and announced his nomination as UN ambassador in the first major staff change since the president took office. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will temporarily replace him, with the top US diplomat serving in four roles at once.
    


• Harvard funding showdown: Trump said this morning that Harvard University will be stripped of its tax-exempt status, redoubling his threat as a broader chess match is underway over free speech, political ideology and federal funding at the Ivy League school.
    


            The White House released a budget blueprint today that would pump more money into defense and homeland security, while taking an ax to programs that the Trump administration has already targeted — including education, foreign aid, environment, health and public assistance programs.
    


            The proposal outlines President Donald Trump's vision and provides recommendations to Congress for fiscal year 2026 spending, but lawmakers are not required to follow it. The blueprint is an outline, otherwise known as a “skinny budget,” with a more comprehensive plan expected to be released in coming weeks.
    


            Overall, the discretionary budget would be $1.7 trillion, a 7.6% cut from the current fiscal year.
    


Here's what's in the proposal:



            The United States designated both a Haitian gang and a coalition of gangs in the country as terrorist organizations today, as Secretary of State Marco Rubio argued they are “a direct threat to US national security interests in the region.”
    


            Rubio designated Viv Ansanm, an alliance of gangs on the island nation, and Gran Grif as both foreign terrorist organizations and specially designated global terrorists.
    


                    “These gangs have killed and continue attacking the people of Haiti, Haitian security forces, and Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission personnel, and are committed to overthrowing the government of Haiti,” Rubio said in a statement. “Their ultimate goal is creating a gang-controlled state where illicit trafficking and other criminal activities operate freely and terrorize Haitian citizens.”
                





            The top US diplomat warned that both Haitians and US citizens could face counterterrorism sanctions for “engaging in transactions with members of these groups.”
    


            “Individuals and entities providing material support or resources to Viv Ansanm or Gran Grif could face criminal charges and inadmissibility or removal from the United States,” he said.
    


Some context: Viv Ansanm and Gran Grif are the latest Latin American crime groups to receive this designation from the Trump administration, which did the same with drug cartels earlier this year.
    


            The terrorism designations factor in to President Donald Trump's broader effort to socialize the idea that the US is at war with transnational gangs, which he has used to justify elements of his sweeping immigration crackdown.
    


            Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney told reporters today that he will meet with President Donald Trump in Washington, DC, on Tuesday, May 6. The prime minister said the meeting will focus on tariffs and the US-Canada relationship.
    


                    “There are two sets of issues. There are the immediate tariffs, both sectoral and so-called reciprocal and fentanyl tariffs, and then there is the broader relationship,” Carney said. “So [the meeting will be about] addressing both sets of issues. We'll see how that progress goes.”
                





            Asked how he might avoid the same kind of public argument that occurred between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office earlier this year, Carney said he's going into the meeting expecting a “difficult, but constructive” conversation.
    


                    “I go there with the expectation of constructive — difficult, but constructive — discussions,” Carney said. “That's the spirit of the conversations that the president and I had.”
                





            “You go to these meetings well prepared,” the prime minister continued, “Understanding the objectives of your counterpart and always acting in the best interest of Canada, and we'll go from there.”
    


            On Tuesday, Carney said his country would “never” yield to the United States as he declared victory in federal elections, following a campaign overshadowed by relentless provocations and steep trade tariffs imposed by Trump.
    


            Democrats are launching a new effort to pressure Republican lawmakers to oppose President Donald Trump's tax and spending cuts package, specifically targeting four Republican lawmakers in some of the most competitive House districts in the country.
    


            The four Republican lawmakers include Reps. Don Bacon of Nebraska, Tom Barrett of Michigan, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Mike Lawler of New York. Bacon, Fitzpatrick and Lawler won districts carried by former Vice President Kamala Harris in last year's election.
    


            The effort, involving the Democratic National Committee and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, will include hosting “People's Town Halls” in some of these Republican districts later in the month and encouraging supporters to apply pressure on the GOP representatives online and through email and phone calls to their offices.
    


            It comes as the DNC launched a new organizing program timed to a “Fight to Save Medicaid” push for the month of May as Republicans continue to weigh potential cuts to the program as part of the president's agenda push on Capitol Hill. Democrats have zeroed in on Medicaid as a key messaging issue against Republicans, arguing any cuts to the program would be detrimental to millions of low-income people across the country.
    


            President Donald Trump's budget request will include a record $1 trillion for national security, a major increase in a budget that otherwise seeks to slash spending, an administration official said.
    


            That is an increase from current levels of approximately $893 billion.
    


            Trump has long signaled his intent to boost defense spending to the symbolic trillion-dollar figure. He has proposed costly defense projects, including a “Golden Dome” missile defense system, that will be included in the budget.
    


                    “I'll be supporting a record setting $1 trillion investment in our national defense,” he said at the Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Michigan on Tuesday. “We're going to go $1 trillion, the largest in the world, largest ever in our country, but no other country has invested that much. We have a $1 trillion budget for military this year.”
                





            President Donald Trump once again called on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates after a better-than-expected April jobs report was released this morning.
    


                    In a post on Truth Social, Trump said that “… employment (is) strong, and much more good news, as Billions of Dollars pour in from Tariffs. …  Consumers have been waiting for years to see pricing come down. NO INFLATION, THE FED SHOULD LOWER ITS RATE!!!”
                





            The jobs report showed employers added 177,000 jobs last month versus the 135,000 gain economists were anticipating.
    


Fact check: However, there's no truth to Trump's claim that there's “no inflation.” Data released by the Commerce Department this week showed that the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index — the Fed's favored inflation gauge — rose 2.3% in March from the year before. That's a slower pace of price hikes than February's 2.7% increase.
    


            The Fed is facing a unique dilemma over whether to lower interest rates as inflation remains above its 2% target or to raise rates to brace for the inflationary impact from Trump's tariffs.
    


            The White House plans to unveil its budget proposal today, targeting education, foreign aid, environmental, health care and other non-defense discretionary spending with $163 billion in cuts, two administration officials told CNN.
    


            The proposal — referred to internally as a “skinny budget” because it is an outline, rather than a comprehensive plan — calls for $557 billion in non-defense discretionary spending, one of the officials said.
    


            The official said agencies that would face steep cuts include:
    


            According to the official, the budget boosts funding for:
    


            The budget proposal is essentially a statement of President Donald Trump's priorities to Congress, which must hammer out the details and pass them into law. In his first months in office, Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk have sought to dramatically slash the federal government, laying off federal workers and eliminating functions that don't align with the administration's political views.
    


            The proposed cuts were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.
    


            A busy news week continued heading into this morning as President Donald Trump's sweeping tax and spending cuts package picks up steam in Congress and his administration continues to target migrants.
    


Here's more of the latest news as you get your day started:



Rubio's rise: Secretary of State Marco Rubio has ascended as one of Trump's most trusted hands after moving in as interim national security adviser following widespread reports that Trump planned on ousting Mike Waltz from the position.
    


Trump's tax and spending cuts package: House Republicans are starting to put some meat on the bones of their sweeping tax and spending cuts package, or what Trump calls his “big, beautiful bill.” It aims to extend the GOP's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as well as fulfill several of Trump's campaign promises, such as ending taxes on tips.
    


Relabeling cartel and gang members: The Trump administration is considering labeling some suspected cartel and gang members inside the US as “enemy combatants” as a possible way to detain them more easily and limit their ability to challenge their imprisonment.
    


Veterans Day: Trump said he wants to rename Veterans Day, a federal holiday on November 11, to “Victory Day for World War I” in a move to purportedly “start celebrating our victories again.” He also said he wants to celebrate May 8, which is not a federal holiday, as “Victory Day for World War II.”
    


Federal workers: Many federal workers who are used to relative job security are now beset by low morale and deep uncertainty and have decided to quit their jobs. Many of the more than a dozen workers who spoke to CNN describe a culture of fear that now permeates the workforce.
    


Vance on Ukraine war: Vice President JD Vance said the war in Ukraine is “not going to end any time soon” in comments aired on Fox News yesterday evening, just hours after Washington and Kyiv signed a key minerals agreement that has peace in Ukraine among its goals.
    


            The long-resilient jobs market continues to defy expectations, even in the wake of swirling uncertainty.
    


            The US economy added a surprisingly strong 177,000 jobs in April, a slight slowdown from March's downwardly revised 185,000 gains, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.
    


            The unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.2%.
    


            Economists were expecting the economy to have added 135,000 jobs last month and that the unemployment rate held at 4.2%, according to FactSet consensus estimates.
    


            April's jobs report marks another solid month of job gains and a continuation of a historic expansion of the labor market.
    


            Whether that continues, however, remains to be seen. Recent economic data has indicated that uncertainty and layoffs are on the rise amid monumental policy shifts from the Trump administration.
    


            Radio Free Asia is laying off most of its staff and shutting down many of its news broadcasts and streams, amid a funding battle with the Trump administration.
    


            Friday's layoff notices are the latest impacts of President Donald Trump's crusade against the international broadcasters the United States has bankrolled for decades.
    


            Bay Fang, the CEO of Radio Free Asia, said the cuts are necessary because the Trump administration has withheld its congressionally allocated funding, even though a federal judge sided with the broadcaster last week.
    


Other US-funded international broadcasters are stuck in similar situations. The outlets keep winning favorable court rulings, but the Trump administration is appealing. Meanwhile, the journalists who want to return to their jobs say acute damage is being done.
    


                    “Every day that we're not broadcasting is a day that will allow adversaries to spread propaganda unchecked,” Voice of America journalist Patsy Widakuswara, the lead plaintiff in one of the cases, told CNN.
                





            Trump moved to shut down Voice of America and strip other broadcasters of federal funding in mid-March. Half a dozen lawsuits have been filed to reverse the moves.
    


            Vast flows of trade between the world's two largest economies are at stake after President Donald Trump hiked tariffs on China this month, making it difficult for some Chinese businesses to continue trading with the US. In response, Beijing has also slapped massive tariffs on American imports.
    


What's the latest? A major shipping loophole expired at one minute past midnight.
    


            The de minimis exemption allowed shipments of goods worth $800 or less to come into the US duty-free, often more or less skipping time-consuming inspections and paperwork.
    


            The loophole allowed ultra-low-cost Chinese e-commerce sites like Shein, Temu and AliExpress to pour everything from yarn to patio furniture, clothes to photography equipment and more into US homes.
    


What now? A baseline tariff as high as 145%, depending on the carrier, is set to take effect on Chinese imports, potentially more than doubling the cost of all those cheap products that deal-hungry Americans have scooped up.
    


Inching toward trade deals: China says it is “currently assessing” proposals by the US to begin trade talks, in a tone shift that could open the door for negotiations.
    


            A spokesperson for China's Commerce Ministry said “the US has recently sent multiple messages to China through relevant parties, hoping to start talks with China. China is currently evaluating this.”
    


            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Beijing was eager to talk. “The Chinese are reaching out, they want to meet, they want to talk,” he told Fox News.
    


            The European Union's trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, told the Financial Times that the bloc is making “certain progress” toward a trade deal with the US, which would involve buying 50 billion euros more of US products.
    


            But Financial Times reported that Šefčovič suggested the Trump administration would need to abandon its 10% across-the-board tariffs on European goods as a precursor to any trade arrangement.
    


Apple hit hard: Tariffs could add $900 million to Apple's costs in its fiscal third quarter, Apple CEO Tim Cook said yesterday.
    


            Most of Apple's iPhone supply chain is based in China. The Trump administration said last month that smartphones are exempt from reciprocal tariffs on Chinese imports, which would have brought the total tariff rate on iPhones made in the region to at least 145%. Instead, smartphones face a minimum 20% tariff.
    


            Apple has shifted some iPhone production to India, and Cook said he expects “the majority of iPhones sold in the US will have India as their country of origin.”
    


            President Donald Trump said the administration will be stripping Harvard University of its tax-exempt status.
    


            In an early Truth Social post, Trump wrote, “It's what they deserve!”
    


            Last month, Trump threatened to strip Harvard of its tax-exempt status, and CNN reported that the Internal Revenue Service was making plans to do so.
    


            Trump froze more that $2 billion in federal funds to Harvard, which prompted the university to sue, after it refused to institute policy changes, including the discontinuation of diversity, equity and inclusion programs.
    


            Earlier this week, Harvard announced it is renaming its “Office for Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging” to “Community and Campus Life.” The university also said it would no longer host or fund affinity group celebrations during commencement, according to The Harvard Crimson. The school on Tuesday released a pair of internal reports: one on how antisemitism and anti-Israeli bias are handled on campus, and another on anti-Muslim, anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian bias.
    


            A White House official on Wednesday described the moves as “positive,” but signaled that the university needs to do more to crack down on what it sees as anti-Israel bias on campus.
    


            President Donald Trump signed an executive order yesterday directing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to end federal funding for America's two biggest public broadcasters, which have faced a series of attacks from the White House and Republican lawmakers accusing them of biased reporting.
    


            The order signed yesterday, titled, “Ending taxpayer subsidization of biased media,” instructs the CPB's board to terminate direct funding for the broadcasters to the extent allowed by the law and decline to provide future funding. It also orders the board to take steps to “minimize or eliminate” indirect funding from other public radio and TV stations that may support NPR or PBS.
    


            The order also directs Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to investigate NPR and PBS for possible employment discrimination and instructs the heads of all other federal agencies to “identify and terminate” any direct or indirect funding of the media organizations, as allowed by law.
    


            CPB filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration this week after three of its five board members were terminated by email on Monday.
    


            Each year, the CPB disperses $535 million in taxpayer funds to public radio and TV stations.
    


            The White House has said it will soon ask Congress to claw back the money already allocated for CPB over the next two years.
    


            Congress specifically set up the corporation as a private entity “to afford maximum protection from extraneous interference and control,” according to a law passed in 1967. The legislation expressly forbids the government from exercising “any direction, supervision, or control over educational television or radio broadcasting.”
    


            CNN's Brian Stelter contributed reporting.
    


            President Donald Trump said yesterday that he would nominate Mike Waltz to serve as United Nations ambassador, shifting from his role as national security adviser.
    


            The shakeup comes after widespread reports that Trump planned to oust him from his national security post earlier in the day. A White House official later told CNN Trump informed Waltz of the changes this morning.
    


            Waltz has been on shaky ground and lost most of his influence in the West Wing after he inadvertently added the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic to a group chat about military strikes in March.

            US Vice President JD Vance said the war in Ukraine is “not going to end any time soon,” just hours after Washington and Kyiv signed a key minerals agreement that has peace in Ukraine among its goals.
    


            Speaking to Fox News on Thursday, Vance poured some cold water on earlier statements from the White House, while also claiming that US President Donald Trump managed to secure “a really big breakthrough” in the peace process.
    


            “It's going to be up to them (Ukraine and Russia) to come to an agreement and stop this brutal, brutal conflict. It's not going anywhere. It's not going to end anytime soon,” Vance told Fox News.
    


            “Of course they (the Ukrainians) are angry that they were invaded, but are we going to continue to lose thousands and thousands of soldiers over a few miles of territory this or that way? I hope both of them come to their senses.”
    


            Trump suggested just last week that Russia and Ukraine were “very close to a deal” after his foreign envoy, Steve Witkoff, spent three hours meeting with Putin at the Kremlin.
    


            Talks to end the war — which Trump previously promised to do within 24 hours of taking office — have largely stalled, despite several top level meetings and at least two direct phone calls between Trump and the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
    


            Moscow continues to refuse the 30-day ceasefire agreement proposed by the US and agreed by Ukraine. The Kremlin also demands the recognition of the Ukrainian territories it took by force as part of Russia. Such a move would upend decades-long international laws.
    


            At the same time, Russia continues its brutal aggression against Ukraine, bombing cities hundreds of miles away from the frontlines on an almost daily basis.
    


            Vance said that the fact that the talks were happening was itself a victory.
    


            “I really don't believe that any person, the 8 billion people in the world, I don't think anybody could have gotten this deal done other than Donald J. Trump. When I say this deal, I mean getting these guys to actually propose a peace settlement,” the vice president told Fox News.
    


            Earlier this week, Putin declared a unilateral three-day ceasefire in Ukraine from May 8 to May 11. In response, the Trump administration and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated calls for a permanent truce.
    


            Meanwhile, the Trump administration continues to flip-flop between blaming Moscow and blaming Kyiv for the lack of progress.

            Last week, Trump slammed Zelensky for his comments that Ukraine wouldn't recognize Russian control of Crimea, the southern Ukrainian peninsula that was illegally annexed by Moscow in 2014, calling the remarks “very harmful to the peace negotiations with Russia.”
    


            “It's inflammatory statements like Zelenskyy's that makes it so difficult to settle this War. He has nothing to boast about! The situation for Ukraine is dire — He can have Peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole Country,” Trump posted on Truth Social.
    


            Yet on Saturday, after speaking to Zelensky privately on the sidelines of Pope Francis' funeral, Trump questioned whether Putin “maybe… doesn't want to stop the war.”
    


            The Trump administration has repeatedly threatened to walk away from the talks, most recently on Thursday, when US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that Trump may need to reassess efforts to broker the peace deal if the US doesn't see a breakthrough “very soon.”

Follow:


            More than 100 days into Donald Trump's presidency, many federal workers have decided to do something that was unthinkable on inauguration day: quit their jobs.
    


            As the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency cuts budgets and headcounts across the government, a workforce used to job security is now beset by low morale and deep uncertainty. Among those who've been fired or quit are tens of thousands of highly trained experts and specialists, draining the agencies of their knowledge base.
    


            Deeper cuts are likely to come.
    


            Weeks away from hurricane season, the Federal Emergency Management Agency is set to lose roughly 1,000 workers – 20% of its full-time staff – who took a buyout offer. About 25% of Internal Revenue Service workers, roughly 22,000 people, are planning to take buyouts. The Environmental Protection Agency this week made another offer to all employees – open through May 5 – to quit now and be paid through the end of September.
    


            Those left behind now face a highly uncertain future in which a job that once seemed secure could disappear in a flash, leaving them wondering if it makes any sense to stay.
    


            Many of the more than a dozen workers who spoke to CNN describe a culture of fear that now permeates.
    


            Just last week, some agencies moved to end flexible work schedules. Some workers' lives are being uprooted by mandatory reassignments and relocations. Many feel they are being pitted against each other because rules around seniority and status mean some staffers could still be displaced from their jobs by coworkers.
    


            Some federal workers said normal activities – such as stepping away from their computers to collaborate in-person with other workers, or attending after-hours retirement parties – are being more closely scrutinized.
    


            Shannon Walsh, a federal worker with the Environmental Protection Agency in Chicago, says that an email employees recently received informing them that their PIV card swipe data is being tracked felt threatening – causing paranoia and uncertainly over how their time is being truly monitored and for what reason.
    


            “Confused. And afraid. It honestly makes me feel both those things but also angry because I feel that that is the point,” said Walsh, a member of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 704. “It makes me feel like we are being smoked out.”

            Hagen said an office “retirement” party to celebrate those who were terminated was canceled recently by management. Even though the party was to take place outside of work hours, there was worry it would appear they were being unproductive.
    


            “People are afraid to do things that were once routine,” she said.
    


            Still, many federal workers who spoke to CNN remain resolute and insist they aren't leaving until they are given no choice.
    


            Almost all federal workers in February were offered deferred resignation: quit now and be paid through the end of September. Since then, Trump-appointed agency heads have begun reducing their ranks through multiple efforts, including some that have offered their own buy-outs.
    


            Those efforts have met legal challenges and political backlash from Democrats who are highlighting the implications of those cuts ahead of next year's midterm elections.
    


            One employee at the US Department of Agriculture who spoke to CNN said they recently decided to take the second deferred resignation offer in April after being terminated and then reinstated earlier this year, undermining their sense of job security.
    


            “If I do this, I'm going out on my own terms. I'm choosing it,” the worker said, noting that they'll be paid through September 30 under the program's terms.
    


            When the first buyout was offered earlier this year, the employee didn't give it any thought. They wanted to continue working for USDA, and their boss told them they didn't have anything to worry about. Two days later, they were terminated, along with tens of thousands of other probationary federal workers.
    


            Even those who are staying face continued uncertainty as layoffs are implemented.
    


            The IRS issued a memo last week telling its approximately 90,000 employees that it was withdrawing from an agreement that allowed employees to work a flexible schedule.
    


            As part of a 2022 labor agreement, the IRS allowed employees to work some nine-hour days, so they could take a full typical workday off after they logged enough hours. The deal also allowed employees to pick their start time, giving them additional flexibility over their time.
    


            Those deals were nixed by the IRS as part of the Trump administration's broader efforts to end collective bargaining for federal workers. It also came amid a Trump administration push to shrink the size of the workforce by offering time-limited buyouts in exchange for quitting.
    


            “A lot of people are upset that this was not announced before the option to resign,” a Utah-based IRS employee told CNN. “Things are sure different around the office these days.”
    


            At the Veterans Health Administration, a draft document from late March reviewed by CNN detailing its “reductions in force” effort laid out “a process where one employee may ‘bump' another employee out of their position.”
    


            It goes on to explain that employees would be organized based on factors including their tenure and status – such as whether they meet veterans' preference status that helps military veterans get hired.
    


            The document says: “If you ‘bump' another employee, you would retain employment. You may be eligible for grade and/or pay retention. If another employee is ranked higher, you may be ‘bumped' out of your role and released from employment.”
    


            Max Stier, CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, said on a call with reporters Friday that displacing other federal employees is typically part of federal reduction-in-force efforts, though he noted that no prior administration has conducted a reduction like this.
    


            “If somebody's been RIF'ed, they may have the opportunity of moving into another position where they have seniority that is specifically similar to the job that they had before,” Stier said. “They can, in effect, take that job from the incumbent that's there and push that person out. That is part of the RIF procedure.”
    


            The Office of Personnel Management regulations for RIFs include details about so-called bumping and retreating rights, which should apply to any agency conducting a reduction in force, said Jenny Mattingley, vice president for government affairs at the Partnership. However, it can take many months for agencies to properly categorize all the federal employees subject to the layoffs.
    


            It's “pretty complicated,” she added, noting that an employee's appointment category (such as career staffer or probationary worker), length of service and performance are taken into account, in addition to veteran status.
    


            National Treasury Employees Union National President Doreen Greenwald criticized the Trump administration's “aggressive mismanagement” of the federal workforce.
    


            “The exodus of talent and nonpartisan dedication to public service makes it harder for our federal agencies to accomplish the important missions assigned to them by Congress. And for those who stay on the job, this administration continues to unnerve them with unnecessary changes to their schedules, petty disruptions to their working lives, deep cuts to their operating budgets and threats to their careers,” Greenwald said in a statement.
    


            At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health, roughly two dozen top officials placed on administration leave during the mass April 1 layoffs were given the option to be reassigned to the historically understaffed Indian Health Services.
    


            Those officials – ranging from longtime lab researchers to regulatory and policy experts – received an email with five IHS sites, including Albuquerque, New Mexico, Billings, Montana, and Juneau, Alaska, asking them to rank their preferences.
    


            They were given one day to decide.
    


            At NIH, at least four institute directors, overseeing infectious diseases, minority health and disparities, pediatric disease and nursing research, were placed on administrative leave and given the IHS option.
    


            “Things are broken and confused here,” said a remaining NIH employee. Nearly a month after the mass layoffs, “we're still learning who is here and who is gone.”
    


            The reassignments to Indian Health Service also angered tribal communities that are in dire need of physicians and nurses at understaffed, remote clinics – not longtime officials and researchers shunted away from their bureaucratic roles.
    


            It was a “slap in the face,” said Liz Carr, a member of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians who served as a senior IHS advisor during the Biden administration. “They are painting our communities as a relegation, a hellscape, a place of punishment for these people that want to provide services to HHS in other capacities.”
    


            She added: “Our people deserve the best of the best, and so sending people to places they don't want to be is not going to create adequate or beneficial health care.”
    


            Most of the officials did not respond to the email and are still in limbo, according to three people familiar with the reorganization efforts. One CDC official responded with their preferences and has received no further communications since then, two of those people said.
    


            “Administrative leave is a pretty big deal. It's closely monitored, but there's so much going on right now [that] I don't even know if there's enough people in HR to be processing putting people on administrative leave,” one former official said.
    


            Overall, Department of Health and Human Services officials' reorganization aimed to slash 20,000 jobs, consolidate programs, and shutter others. Several of the cuts, like a canceled program to study women's health, brought controversy and HHS promises to reverse course.
    


            Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. insisted soon after the mass layoffs that these things would happen with swift DOGE cuts. “The part of that, DOGE – we talked about this from the beginning – is we're going to do 80% cuts, but 20% of those are going to have to be reinstalled because we'll make mistakes,” he told reporters on April 3.
    


            But the uncertainty has left remaining health agency employees “waiting for the next shoe to drop,” said one longtime health official who departed before the mass layoffs. “People are confused, frustrated, saddened, and worried about the future of public health. Is this just the first step?”
    


            Those workers say the cuts are leading to backlogs and fewer government employees handling the same amount of work.
    


            One medical professional at the Department of Veterans Affairs now has to care for more patients – and ones with higher needs – because their colleague retired recently and a request to replace the person was denied.
    


            “There's no way I can spend as much time on care as my colleague was,” they told CNN. “So, the patients are suffering.”
    


            Feeling spread very thin, the professional worries that they won't be able to keep up the pace without burning out. They went into the medical field to help people but are upset that they can't provide the type of care their patients need.
    


            Despite all this, they are committed to sticking it out.
    


            “I'm not leaving because I love working with veterans,” they said. “It feels like a sacred mission, not just a job.”

BOISE, Idaho (AP) — A pickup truck and tour van collision near Yellowstone National Park has killed seven people and injured eight others, Idaho State Police say.

The crash happened just before 7:15 p.m. Thursday on a highway near Henry's Lake State Park in eastern Idaho, police said in a press release. The state park is roughly 16 miles (26 kilometers) west of Yellowstone National Park.

Both vehicles caught fire after the crash, the Idaho State Police said in a press release. The driver of the Dodge Ram pickup and six people inside the Mercedes passenger van died. The van was carrying a tour group of 14 people, and the surviving occupants were taken to hospitals with injuries, police spokesman Aaron Snell said. 

Air ambulances and emergency paramedics responded to the collision, which remains under investigation. Authorities have not said what led up to the crash.

The Fremont County coroner's office had not released the names of those killed as of Friday morning. The Idaho State Police said officials were still working on notifying family members of those killed and injured, so the agency was not yet releasing the names, ages, hometowns or nationalities of the people involved. 

Roger Merrill, 60, was driving home when he saw the flames engulfing the two vehicles as bystanders tried to care for survivors from the van on the side of the highway. Merrill said he often sees tourist vans on the highway that leads to Yellowstone National Park.




“It is a very dangerous highway because it leads to the main entrance of Yellowstone National Park,” he said. “It's extremely busy.”

Merrill captured video of the wreckage with smoke blanketing the van. Due to the remote location, Merrill said he anxiously awaited the help of first responders.

“It took an unnervingly long time for help to arrive just because of the location,” he said.

TOKYO (AP) — Japan's massive holdings of U.S. Treasurys can be “a card on the table” in negotiations over tariffs with the Trump administration, Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said Friday. 

“It does exist as a card, but I think whether we choose to use it or not would be a separate decision,” Kato said during a news show on national broadcaster TV Tokyo.

Kato did not elaborate and he did not say Japan would step up sales of its holdings of U.S. government bonds as part of its talks over President Donald Trump's tariffs on exports from Japan. 

Earlier, Japanese officials including Kato had ruled out such an option. 

Japan is the largest foreign holder of U.S. government debt, at $1.13 trillion as of late February. China, also at odds with the Trump administration over trade and tariffs, is the second largest foreign investor in Treasurys. 

Kato stressed that various factors would be on the negotiating table with Trump, implying that a promise not to sell Treasurys could help coax Washington into an agreement favorable for Japan. 

Trump has disrupted decades of American trade policies, including with key security allies like Japan, by i mposing big import taxes, or tariffs, on a wide range of products.

A team of Japanese officials was in Washington this week for talks on the tariffs.

The U.S. is due to soon begin imposing a 25% tariff on imported vehicles and auto parts, as well as an overall 10% baseline tariff. The bigger tariffs will hurt at a time when Japanese economic growth is weakening.




Asian holdings of Treasurys have remained relatively steady in recent years, according to the most recent figures. 

But some analysts worry China or other governments could liquidate their U.S. Treasury holdings as trade tensions escalate. 

U.S. government bonds are traditionally viewed as a safe financial asset, and recent spikes in yields of those bonds have raised worries that they might be losing that status due to Trump's tariff policies.

TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — The discussions have taken place in an ornate Kremlin hall, on the polished marble of St. Peter's Basilica and in a famously contentious session in the Oval Office of the White House.

What's emerged so far from the Washington-led effort to end the war in Ukraine suggests a deal that seems likely to be favorable to Russia: President Donald Trump has sharply rebuked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, echoed Kremlin talking points, and indicated Kyiv would have to surrender territory and forego NATO membership. What's more, he has engaged in a rapprochement with Moscow that was unthinkable months ago.

More recently, Trump has offered mixed signals — social media posts that perhaps Russian President Vladimir Putin is stringing him along — and a deal has yet to materialize.

While the optics so far have been in the Kremlin's favor, no proposals that were put forth have been cemented.

And on Wednesday, Washington and Kyiv signed an agreement granting American access to Ukraine's vast mineral resources that could enable continued military aid to the country under ongoing attacks from Russia.

Zelenskyy said Thursday the deal was the first result of his “truly historic” meeting with Trump at the Vatican before the funeral of Pope Francis.




One gain for the Kremlin is that Washington is talking again to Moscow after years of extremely strained ties following its 2022 invasion of Ukraine — and not just about the war, said Nikolay Petrov, senior research fellow with the New Eurasian Strategies Centre think tank. 

Russian officials and state media from the very start of discussions with Trump's officials sought to underscore that Ukraine was only one item on the vast agenda of the “two superpowers.” Trump and Putin talked in March about Ukraine but also the Middle East, stopping the proliferation of strategic weapons and even organizing hockey games between the countries.

Russia's main state TV channel reported that the meeting between Putin and Trump envoy Steve-Witkoff showed that Moscow and Washington were building “a new structure of the world” together. 

In this sense, “Putin already got a part of what he sought” — the optics of Russia as a country that is on par with the U.S., Petrov said.

Trump has said Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula Moscow illegally annexed in 2014, “will stay with Russia,” and outlines of a peace proposal his team reportedly presented to Kyiv last month apparently included allowing Russia to keep control of other occupied Ukrainian territories. Trump, who had a contentious meeting with Zelenskyy in the Oval Office on Feb. 28, lashed out at him for publicly rejecting the idea of ceding land, and also said that Kyiv was unlikely to ever join NATO.

All of these reflect Moscow's long-held positions, and Trump's echoing of them suggested his administration's vision was aligned with the Kremlin's.

Trump also seemingly puts more pressure on Kyiv than Moscow in trying to reach a peace deal and appears eager to return to a more normal relationship with Russia and its “big business opportunities,” said Sam Greene of King's College London.

“Is there any part of this that doesn't look like a win for Russia? No,” Greene adds.

But so far, all of this has remained nothing but rhetoric, with terms of a possible settlement still very much “in the air,” says Sergey Radchenko, a historian and a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.

Moreover, there are still demands by both Russia and Ukraine that would be hard to reconcile in any kind of peace settlement. 

Ukraine refuses to cede any land and wants robust security guarantees against future aggression, possibly involving a contingent of peacekeepers -– something a handful of European nations have been discussing and Russia publicly rejects as a nonstarter.

Russia, in turn, demands that it holds onto the territory it has seized as well as no NATO membership for Ukraine. It also wants Kyiv to “demilitarize,” or significantly reduce its armed force. 

Radchenko sees the latter as a major sticking point in peace talks, because a strong, viable army is important for Ukraine to defend itself.

“If there are restrictions on the kinds of weapons Ukraine can receive (from the West) or the size of the army, then it will be very difficult to get them to accept this sort of agreement,” he said.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov seemingly raised the stakes further this week by saying that international recognition of regions annexed from Ukraine by Russia was “imperative” for a peace deal.

Achieving that remains unclear, given that dozens of countries have decried the annexations as violating international law.

Some analysts believe it is in Putin's interest to prolong the war and keep making gains on the battlefield. 

Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have threatened to wash their hands of the peace effort if there is no progress soon.

Putin, in an apparent gesture of willingness to keep talking, announced this week a 72-hour ceasefire starting May 8 for Russia's Victory Day holiday that marks the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II.

Zelenskyy dismissed the gesture as a further attempt by Putin at “manipulation” to string along the U.S., saying a ceasefire should begin immediately and last longer.

Greene noted that the Russian ruble and markets have been doing better recently over expectations of a peace deal and U.S. businesses and investors coming back, “and there may be a price to be paid” for pulling out the rug from under that.

The larger question is what happens on the battlefield if the Trump administration withdraws from the peace effort.

“When the Trump administration says they'll walk away, we don't know what that means. Does that mean they walk away from negotiations and keep supporting Ukraine?” Greene said.

Greene says that Ukraine probably doesn't feel confident that the U.S. stepping back from the process means that Washington will keep supporting Kyiv, adding that Russia may not be sure of the Trump administration ending aid, either.

“I think it's very difficult for the Kremlin to calculate the risks of dragging this out,” he said.

And U.S. Treasury Secretary Sctott Bessent said the mineral deal “signals clearly to Russia that the Trump administration is committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term.”

A lot depends on whether Europe can step up and fill any gaps in U.S. aid.

If Trump walks away from the peace effort and still pursues normalizing relations with Russia, lifting sanctions, “this will amount to a major breakthrough” for Putin, but it's not a given, Radchenko says. 

That would be an uphill battle for Trump as “there's a lot of congressional sanctions that are predicated on the war in Ukraine,” Greene notes.

WASHINGTON (AP) — American employers added a surprising 177,000 jobs in April as the job market showed resilience in the face of President Donald Trump's trade wars.




Hiring fell slightly from a revised 185,000 in March, but that is above economist projections of 135,000 jobs. The unemployment rate remained at a low 4.2%, the Labor Department reported Friday.

Trump's aggressive and unpredictable policies – including massive import taxes – have clouded the outlook for the economy and the job market and raised fears that the American economy is headed toward recession.

Friday's report showed employment, one of the strongest aspects of the U.S. economy, remains solid, yet many economists anticipate that a negative impact from trade wars will materialize this year for American workers and potentially, President Trump. 

“Politicians can count their lucky stars that companies are holding on to their workers despite the storm clouds forming that could slow the economy further in the second half of the year,” said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at fwdbonds, a financial markets research firm.

Transportation and warehousing companies added 29,000 jobs last month, suggesting companies have built up inventory before imported goods are hit with new tariffs. Healthcare companies added nearly 51,000 jobs and bars, restaurants almost 17,000 and construction firms 11,000. Factories lost 1,000 jobs. 

Labor Department revisions shaved 58,000 jobs from February and March payrolls.

Average hourly earnings ticked up 0.2% from March and 3.8% from a year ago, nearing the 3.5% that economists view as consistent with the 2% inflation the Federal Reserve wants to see. 

Trump's massive taxes on imports to the U.S. are likely to raise costs for Americans and American businesses that depend on supplies from overseas. They also threaten to slow economic growth. His immigration crackdown threatens to make it more difficult for hotels, restaurants and construction firms to fill job openings. By purging federal workers and cancelling federal contracts, Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency risks wiping out jobs inside the government and out.




The drastic changes have shaken markets and consumers. The Conference Board, a business group, reported Tuesday that Americans' confidence in the economy fell  for the fifth straight month to the lowest level since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Still, Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank, called the jobs report “reassuringly normal. The fears of a softer labor market due to tariff uncertainty went unrealized last month ... There are signs that businesses are reining in plans for hiring and capital spending and that consumers are turning more cautious toward discretionary spending.''

American workers have at least one thing going for them. Despite the uncertainty about fallout from Trump's policies, many employers don't want to risk letting employees go – not after struggling to bring people back from the massive but short-lived layoffs from the pandemic.

“For now, the unemployment rate and the number of people filing claims for jobless benefits every week remain low by historical standards,” Boston College economist Brian Bethune said this week.

The federal government's workforce fell by 9,000 on top of 17,000 job losses in February and March, The full effect of Musk's DOGE cuts may yet to be seen. Bethune noted job cuts by the billionaire's DOGE are still being challenged in court. Also, some of those leaving federal agencies were forced into early retirement and don't count as unemployed.

After the jobs numbers were released, Trump repeated his call for the Federal Reserve to lower its benchmark short-term interest rate, which it raised to combat inflation. Trump said on social media platform Truth Social that there is “NO INFLATION” and “employment strong.”

Yet as long as the job market remains healthy, the Fed will likely stay on the sidelines as it takes time to evaluate the impact of tariffs. Fed chair Jerome Powell has underscored that the duties are likely to push up prices in the coming months, making the central bank wary of the potential for higher inflation.

The Fed typically fights inflation with higher interest rates, so it is unlikely to cut its key short-term rate anytime soon. It may change course if layoffs spike and unemployment rises.

Some U.S. companies stand to benefit from Trump's protectionist policies. 

Allen Jacoby, executive vice president of textile division at Milliken & Co., said that cheap Chinese imports have hurt business at the Spartanburg, South Carolina, manufacturer. His division makes Polartec fabric for brands such as North Face and Patagonia and has closed six plants and reduced its payrolls 12% since 2019. 

Trump's tariffs, he said, could improve Milliken's sales and hiring. “It's too early to tell, but there's more optimism than pessimism,” he said.

Most Americans still enjoy job security, yet many who have lost jobs say that it's now harder to find work. 

Jason Schunkewitz, 33, was laid off by a startup that uses virtual reality to train caregivers. Single and debt free, the Denver resident took some time off before beginning the job search in earnest.

He has a background in jobs training and economic development – a field heavily reliant on government grants. Trump spending cuts have eliminated some grants and generated uncertainty about others. Schunkewitz now says many nonprofits have postponed hiring. 

“It's just been silent in some cases,'' he said. “It's very tricky to navigate.'' He's now focusing his job search on private companies, which might be more secure.

Schunkewitz is also developing a business making charcuterie-to-go packs – cured salami, aged cheese, dried fruit – for skiers, hikers and other adventurers. The business is in the early stages, but he said: “I hope it becomes a full-time job.''

WASHINGTON (AP) — A veteran activist of the Civil Rights Movement said he was notified by the Smithsonian Institution that items he loaned to the National Museum of African American History and Culture may be returned, amid a potential review of the museum's collections ordered by President Donald Trump.

Rev. Amos C. Brown, pastor of Third Baptist Church in San Francisco, loaned two books to the Smithsonian, which have been displayed since the museum opened nearly a decade ago. One of his items is an edition of “The History of the Negro Race in America” by George Washington Williams, which was written in 1880 and is among the first books to document Black American history and racism in the U.S. The other is a Bible that Brown carried during protests alongside the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.

The reasons given for the items' return initially raised alarms that the Trump administration had begun to make visible changes to a museum considered to be a crown jewel of Black American culture.

Recent reports that the museum has already removed exhibits documenting the civil rights struggle are false, the Smithsonian said. The White House had no comment for this story.

However, the threat of changes to the African American museum has prompted strong responses from Democratic lawmakers, historians, civil rights leaders and education advocates, many of whom planned to demonstrate in support of the museum in the nation's capital Saturday.




Brown, who counts former Vice President Kamala Harris among his parishioners, received an email last month from a Smithsonian official telling him that his items would be returned over concerns about their preservation due to museum lighting. Brown told The Associated Press he found the claim “a flimsy excuse for a museum.”

After the initial email to Brown, a different Smithsonian official reached out to him to express regret that the initial reason had caused a “misunderstanding,” Brown said. Instead, according to Brown, the official said Smithsonian archivists will defer to “a panel that will reconsider whether or not my artifacts should be there.” He said he was told this would be done for a wide range of historical artifacts.

Smithsonian officials did not respond to questions about whether such a panel has been formed.

After that interaction, Brown said a third Smithsonian official later reached out to him and scheduled a video conference meeting for Friday afternoon. He said he was not given the names of who would join the call, but was told it would include senior Smithsonian leadership.

The Smithsonian “routinely returns loaned artifacts per applicable loan agreements and rotates objects on display in accordance with the Smithsonian's high standards of care and preservation and as part of our regular museum turnover,” according to a statement the institution sent to the AP.

“Recent claims that objects have been removed for reasons other than adherence to standard loan agreements or museum practices are false,” the statement reads.

Concerns over potential reforms at the Smithsonian have arisen since Trump signed a March 27 executive order titled “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History.” The order argued that the Smithsonian had in recent years “come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology” and said the institution has “promoted narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.”

The order designated Vice President JD Vance and Lindsey Halligan, a senior White House aide, “to remove improper ideology” from Smithsonian properties, which include 21 museums and the National Zoo. The Smithsonian encompasses educational, research and archival centers meant to increase and spread knowledge. It manages more than 150 million artifacts.

The order cites several national parks and Smithsonian museums as displaying potentially objectionable content, including the African American museum.

The Smithsonian is governed by a Board of Regents that is chaired by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and includes Vance, members of Congress from both parties and major business executives and philanthropists. The board's next meeting is scheduled for June 9.

Lawmakers, academics and activists fear the order could eventually influence the Smithsonian to remove artifacts, exhibits or research that do not conform to the Trump administration's understanding of history.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries sent a letter to Roberts warning that the order “seeks to whitewash our history” and “is cowardly and unpatriotic.” He compared the proclamation to efforts in “twentieth-century regimes like those in the Soviet Union and 1930s Germany.”

“We wouldn't need African American history exhibits if America hadn't been founded by excluding African Americans and distorting our image,” said Rep. Jonathan Jackson, whose father is Rev. Jesse Jackson, the politician and civil rights activist. The Jackson family is documented in multiple Smithsonian museums and said they have not been notified of changes to those exhibits.

“So this makes American history whole, and I think (Trump) should go and visit it before he attempts to erase and delete and distort that tradition,” said the Illinois Democrat. Trump visited the African American museum in 2017. After the tour, he wrote on social media that the museum was ”A great job done by amazing people!”

Civil rights leaders have organized in the wake of Trump's order. A coalition of more than three dozen groups on Monday launched a “Freedom to Learn” campaign that will include a May 3 rally and march at the Smithsonian's African American museum.

Among the partnering organizations are the NAACP, National Urban League, National Coalition for Black Civic Participation, Black Voters Matter, Movement for Black Lives, National Council of Negro Women and the Leadership Coalition for Civil Rights.

Predominantly Black churches have rallied to support the museum and staged protests and called for greater support for the museum in the wake of potential changes.

The National Museum of African American History and Culture opened to the public in 2016. It contains more than 40,000 artifacts documenting more than 400 years of African American history. The museum's exhibits span topics including the everyday life and culture of African Americans and the community's contributions to broader American culture, business, sports, religion and politics, as well as the impact of slavery, segregation and discrimination on the nation's history.

Brown, 84, said he'd previously had a “positive relationship” with the Smithsonian over the items he had donated to the museum. As a youth activist in the civil rights movement, Brown organized alongside icons like King, activist Medgar Evers and congressman John Lewis. He criticized the institution for “operating in secrecy” about the changes at the African American museum.

“Behave. Be respectful. Speak truth to those who sit in seats of power,” Brown said of the proper response to any changes at the museum. “Let's be kind and just. If we don't, Dr. King was right — Martin was right — that if we don't learn to live together, brothers and sisters, we're all going to perish as fools.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has been thrown into two top national security jobs at once as President Donald Trump presses forward with his top-to-bottom revamp of U.S. foreign policy. Rubio was named to temporarily replace Mike Waltz as national security adviser.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Marco Rubio has been thrown into two top national security jobs at once as President Donald Trump presses forward with his top-to-bottom revamp of U.S. foreign policy, upending not only longstanding policies that the former Florida senator once supported but also the configuration of the executive branch.

Trump's appointment of Rubio to temporarily replace Mike Waltz as national security adviser is the first major leadership shake-up of the nascent administration, but Waltz's removal had been rumored for weeks — ever since he created a Signal group chat and accidentally added a journalist to the conversation where top national security officials shared sensitive military plans.

So, just over 100 days into his tenure as America's top diplomat, Rubio now becomes just the second person to hold both positions. He follows only the late Henry Kissinger, who served as both secretary of state and national security adviser for two years under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford in the 1970s.

Rubio — a one-time Trump rival and hawkish conservative who was derided by the president as “Little Marco” during the 2016 presidential campaign — has proven adept at aligning himself with Trump's “America First” foreign policy positions. Rubio has largely eschewed his staunch advocacy of providing foreign aid and promoting democracy overseas since taking over the State Department, repeating a refrain that every policy or program should make America safer, stronger or more prosperous.

Since being confirmed in a 99-0 Senate floor vote, Rubio has presided over a radical reorganization of the State Department. That includes the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development and plans to cut U.S. jobs by 15% while closing or consolidating more than 100 bureaus worldwide. He has also begun a major cull of the visa system, revoking hundreds, if not thousands, of visas issued to foreign students.

He has overseen the negotiation of agreements to send immigrants accused of crimes to third countries, most notably to El Salvador, in cases that are now being challenged in federal courts.

“Marco Rubio, unbelievable,” Trump said Thursday before announcing on social media that Waltz would be nominated as ambassador to the United Nations and Rubio would take over as national security adviser in the interim. “When I have a problem, I call up Marco, he gets it solved.”

That's a far cry from 2016, when Rubio and Trump were competing for the GOP presidential nomination and Rubio warned that Trump was a threat. After Trump won, the relationship remained contentious, but eight years later, Rubio was an enthusiastic Trump supporter who worked his Florida bona fides to get into the president's inner circle.

Yet, even after Rubio was nominated to the top diplomatic job, doubts remained. Many pundits suggested he would last only a short time in office before Trump dismissed him in the same way he did his first-term secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, who was fired by tweet in 2018 just 18 months into the job.

Yet Rubio has been resilient. And as of Thursday, he oversees both the State Department and the National Security Council, which is responsible for coordinating all executive branch foreign policy functions, ranging from diplomatic to military and intelligence operations.

Thomas Wright, an NSC official during the Biden administration who is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said the national security adviser post alone is “more than a full-time job.”

“It is just very hard to comprehend the idea that you can do this job sort of part time,” Wright said.

He said he watched national security adviser Jake Sullivan and his deputy work 14-15 hour days, six to seven days a week: “I think they felt that they had to do that to do the job properly.”

Appearing Thursday night on Fox News Channel's “Hannity,” Rubio was not asked to weigh in on the president's decision to tap him as national security adviser but did joke that he was barred from adding pope to his list of many jobs because he is married.

But as he marked the first 100 days of Trump's latest term, Rubio applauded the president for his vision.

“I am honored by the trust President Trump placed in me and I am proud of the work the Department of State has done over the past hundred days to implement his agenda and put the American people first,” he wrote Wednesday in a State Department Substack post.

One of Rubio's former Florida statehouse colleagues, Dan Gelber, a Democrat, said of Rubio's increasing responsibilities that “Marco is probably, to a certain extent, one of the more reliable Cabinet officers, if not the most reliable.”

“And I can only believe those qualities are even more vital to his current confluence of positions and growing portfolio,” Gelber said. “He's not a chaos guy, and I've always sort of wondered how he's going to do in an administration where there seems to be so much chaos. And maybe that's why he's getting all these positions.”

Rubio's dual-hatted role comes on top of him serving as acting administrator of the largely shut down USAID and as acting head of the National Archives. It puts him in a similar position to that of Trump's longtime personal friend and golfing buddy Steve Witkoff. 




As a special envoy, Witkoff is the lead U.S. negotiator in the Iran nuclear talks and in administration peace efforts for the Israel-Hamas war and the Ukraine-Russia war.

In many ways, Rubio and Witkoff are following in the footsteps of Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, who had multiple roles in the first administration, ranging from the Middle East to Latin America and immigration.

State Department officials appeared taken aback by Trump's appointment of Rubio as acting national security adviser. Spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said at a briefing Thursday that she learned the news from a journalist who asked her a question about Trump's post minutes after it appeared on social media.

Officials, however, have noted that Rubio in recent weeks has spent an increasingly large amount of time at the White House away from his posh seventh-floor State Department office in what is known as “Mahogany Row,” a corridor known for its wood paneling.

At the same time, these officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the personnel shift, said they did not expect Rubio's duties as secretary of state to change significantly. He still plans to travel on diplomatic missions abroad and likely will delegate at least some of the NSC management to others, they said.

FIRST ON FOX : Fox News Digital has learned that the U.S. could withhold funding for the war against Islamist terror in Somalia until Europe, the African Union (A.U.) and the United Nations (U.N.) pay more of their ""fair"" share toward the cost of striking out and keeping the peace in the conflict-torn country. 

These plans to ""prohibit"" the use of U.S. funds are key details, shown first to Fox News Digital, of a new bill to be introduced by three prominent Republican senators.

In line with President Donald Trump's administration's widespread moves to tighten fiscal controls in the U.S. and overseas, Sens. Jim Risch, R-Idaho., Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., are to introduce ""the African Union Support and Stabilization Mission in Somalia (AUSSOM) Funding Restriction Act of 2025."" 

This is ""to safeguard U.S. taxpayer funds and hold the U.N. and A.U. accountable in African peace operations,"" Risch told Fox News Digital.

The bill also seeks to mandate the U.S. to oppose any U.N. Security Council action which enables such funding.  

The East African country of Somalia has been wracked for decades by attacks and insurgency from Islamist terrorists, both from ISIS and the al Qaeda-linked al-Shabab. In just the past five weeks, U.S. Africa Command reported that it has carried out four airstrikes; three against ISIS terrorists and one against al-Shabaab. At least one of these strikes, the command stated, was against multiple targets.

Chairman Risch told Fox News Digital, ""The Trump Administration has taken decisive action to counterterrorist groups across Africa, and I'm very supportive.""

However, officials from the European Union, according to Risch, plan to skew payments for the AUSSOM peacekeeping and stablization operation more toward the U.S.; in other words, make the U.S. pay more than it should, he said.

""At the U.N., our European partners are looking to skirt their financial commitments to AUSSOM in Somalia by switching to a new imbalanced funding mechanism that pushes the burden on Americans,"" he stated.

""We can't let that stand,"" Risch continued. ""This bill will prohibit U.S. contributions to AUSSOM under this new funding scheme, until the A.U. and the U.N. can prove that they are using the funds they have responsibly, and prevent Americans from being locked into perpetually funding a broken system.""

Risch said, ""President Trump has ushered in a new era of American foreign policy where American taxpayer dollars will be used only to secure a safe and prosperous America. For far too long, our allies have taken America for a ride, and profited off of America paying the lion's share for global security. Europe must continue to shoulder this burden.""  

The other two senators sponsoring the bill, Cruz and Scott, also serve on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Scott told Fox News Digital, ""The United States will not allow our tax dollars to be exploited by the U.N. while our partners refuse to pay their fair share, much less for a mission that fails to spend these dollars responsibly or transparently. I am proud to join my colleagues on the AUSSOM Funding Restriction Act to ensure Americans' interests are put first, and their tax dollars spent wisely.""

Fox News correspondent CB Cotton joins ‘America's Newsroom' to give the latest on U.S. airports soon requiring REAL IDs to be shown for domestic flights.

A stricter identity verification requirement for U.S. residents is slated to take force next week after 20 years of delay. And for many, the law will require a visit to one of the nation's most notorious, time-honored places of dread: the Department of Motor Vehicles.

These facilities can vary slightly both in name and in acronym: Texans, for example, have a Department of Public Safety or DPS; Floridians dub theirs the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles or HSMV. (Add to the mix the DDS, the BMV and the MVD, it's a veritable alphabet soup.)

Despite the different names, each of these state-run facilities serves the same purpose: to license drivers and issue identification cards to residents living in the state. They share the same wait times and inspire the same feelings of burden and loathing.

But for individuals in some states, things are about to get a lot worse, fast.

On May 7, all U.S. residents will be required to show a ""REAL ID-compliant"" form of identification to board any flights, including international and domestic travel, or to enter any federal buildings in compliance with a long-stalled federal law passed by Congress in 2005.

A REAL ID is a state-issued driver's license or state-issued identification card that meets certain federal standards, and it requires individuals to provide additional documentation, such as several documents proving current state residency — a utility agreement and lease, for example — as well as a certified birth certificate, among other things. 

REAL IDs are now issued by all state DMVs (or BMVs or HSMVs) in anticipation of the fast-approaching enforcement date. REAL ID-compliant ID cards and licenses are marked with a star or other symbol in the right-hand corner, and some states, including Texas and Florida, have been issuing them for years.

But because DMVs are operated at a state and not federal level, compliance with the tighter verification standards has until recently been optional. That's prompted a patchwork of compliance across the U.S. and a recent, frenzied panic from residents in states whose DMVs have not met the REAL ID standards.

NEED REAL ID IN A HURRY? HERE ARE SOME OPTIONS OUTSIDE THE DMV

REAL ID enforcement begins May 7. (Fox News)

In the final days before the new law takes effect, some U.S. residents are learning for the first time, to their horror, that their IDs are not up to snuff. 

That's prompted a surge of last-minute appointments in some states as drivers frantically look to obtain these new IDs. In others, appointments are nearly impossible to come by. 

New Jersey, for example, currently has no appointments available at any of its DMV facilities in the state. That could be a major problem for travelers in the Garden State, whose REAL ID compliance is the lowest in the country at 17% last month, according to data compiled by CBS News. 

Other nearby states are reporting similar compliance rates, with Pennsylvania at 26% compliance and New York with 43%, which is less than half of all residents living in the state.

For individuals in these states, the REAL ID compliance standards amount to what could be a travel nightmare, especially ahead of the summer holiday season when airports brace for a sharp uptick in traffic.

As of January 2024, just 56% of state-issued drivers' licenses and identification cards were compliant with the new REAL ID requirements, according to DHS estimates. It's unclear how much that percentage has changed in the last year.

""DHS anticipates that a significant number of individuals seeking to use their DL/ID for a REAL ID official purposes on and after May 7, 2025, may not have a compliant DL/ID,"" the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a memo last September.

In January, DHS issued a slightly more optimistic projection in the Federal Register, anticipating that by May 7, up to 66% of U.S. ID holders would have the new legally required ID. 

But in the final days before the law takes force, it's hard to ascertain exactly where things stand. Horror stories persist in some states of drivers struggling to obtain the new ID, and in others, state lawmakers are hoping to be granted a delay.

In Kentucky, a group of state lawmakers led by Senate Transportation Committee Chair Jimmy Higdon, R-Lebanon, urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to delay the REAL ID enforcement date, citing ""growing concerns"" from state residents who have been unable to access driver's licensing services due to ""limited appointment availability and long lines for walk-ins.""

""This simple request is to protect Kentuckians from bureaucratic burdens,"" Higdon said in the letter. ""Rural residents, seniors, and families still have hurdles in front of them, and in a lot of cases, may not be aware of their options. Only about 40 percent of our residents have a REAL ID, but I would also like more time to help Kentuckians understand that they may not need a REAL ID. Kentucky has made a good faith effort, but we just aren't there yet.""

The Transportation Security Administration has warned that individuals who don't have the right ID before that date could be subject to significantly longer wait times or other disruptions to travel. This could impact travel plans for millions of Americans ahead of what is expected to be a busy summer traveling season.

Others could be barred from accessing certain federal buildings.

And the problem persists in other states as well: CBS News found in its April survey that at least 17 states have compliance rates of 50% or less, with 30 states at less than 70% compliance.

Former federal prosecutor Andrea Lewis discusses the impact of the Supreme Court on the Trump administration's immigration agenda, a Columbia student being released from ICE and how the highest court could redefine the First Amendment.

The Trump administration on Thursday asked the Supreme Court to override a lower court ruling and let it move forward with ending protections for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan nationals in the U.S.

The government is asking the high court to block, for now, a March ruling from U.S. District Judge Edward Chen that delayed President Donald Trump's plans to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) protections for some 350,000 Venezuelan nationals living in the U.S. Those protections would have otherwise expired in April. 

U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer asked justices on Thursday to allow the administration to proceed, accusing Chen of improperly intruding on the executive branch's authority over immigration policy.

""The district court's reasoning is untenable,"" Sauer told the high court, adding that the program ""implicates particularly discretionary, sensitive, and foreign-policy-laden judgments of the Executive Branch regarding immigration policy.""

""The decision to delay the Secretary's actions effectively nullifies them, tying them up in the very judicial second-guessing that Congress prohibited,"" he said of the lower court order. ""The district court's ill-considered preliminary injunction should be stayed.""

At issue is the TPS program, which allows individuals to live and work in the U.S. legally if they cannot work safely in their home country due to a disaster, armed conflict or other ""extraordinary and temporary conditions.""

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem terminated the program for Venezuelan nationals on Feb. 1, prompting the emergency lawsuit and Chen's order that postponed it from taking force.

The lower court judge sided with plaintiffs from the National TPS Alliance in ruling that the termination of the TPS program, which is extended in 18-month increments, is ""unprecedented,"" and suggested that the abrupt termination may have been ""predicated on negative stereotypes"" about Venezuelan migrants – something Sauer bitterly disputed in their appeal.

""Forceful condemnations of gang violence and broad questioning of the integrity of the prior administration's immigration practices, including potential abuses of the TPS program, do not evince discriminatory intent,"" Sauer said, describing Judge Chen's descriptions as ""cherry picked"" and ""wrongly portrayed"" as ""racially tinged.""

A Supreme Court stay would allow the Trump administration to move forward with plans to immediately remove these migrants, which Sauer argued they should be able to do. Plaintiffs have until Thursday to respond to the Supreme Court.

Fox News Digital asked travelers about REAL ID at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in D.C., with some passengers sharing why they're skipping the new identification. 

WASHINGTON – As many Americans across the nation are rushing to obtain their REAL ID license, some are choosing to opt out – by either using their valid passport as their preferred form of ID for travel or waiting until their current driver's license expires and then renewing it. 

The REAL ID requirement takes effect on May 7, when Americans must have a new form of identification in order to fly domestically.

The costs of obtaining the identification vary from state to state. Costs also vary according to whether travelers are obtaining a first-time REAL ID or looking to renew their existing license.

Other forms of identification that will be accepted in lieu of a REAL ID include a valid U.S. passport or passport card; DHS trusted traveler cards such as Global Entry; Department of Defense IDs; permanent resident cards; and border crossing cards. 

With the deadline looming, Fox News Digital spoke this week with travelers and asked those who do not have or do not plan to get a REAL ID any time soon why they made that decision.

At the Ronald Reagan National Airport (DCA) in Washington, D.C., Lisa from Oregon said that it was a ""financial decision"" at this time.

Lisa (no last name shared) said she had not yet gotten a REAL ID to date ""because it was an extra cost, and I knew that I would rather put that money toward the passport.""

She said that at a later date, she may decide to get a REAL ID.

""When I'm traveling later, I'll have to bring my passport and I may not want to do that for stateside travel,"" she said.

Some states offer a reduced price for the REAL ID, such as California.

The Golden State's DMV website says, ""In certain circumstances, the fee may be waived or reduced.""

It adds, ""You may be eligible to pay a reduced application fee for an original or renewal ID card if you meet income requirements for selected governmental or nonprofit assistance programs.""

It also notes that a ""homeless person"" may be eligible for a no-fee ID card. 

LOOMING REAL ID DEADLINE CAUSES CHAOS AT DMVS AS CRITICS TAKE TO SOCIAL MEDIA

And ""to qualify for a no-fee senior citizen ID card, you must be at least 62 years old,"" according to California's DMV. 

Kelsey from Bloomington, Illinois, said she'd just arrived in D.C. She does not have a REAL ID, she said.

""I do not have a real ID yet because I have not made it to the DMV and our trip ends before May 7th, so I didn't feel an urgency to do so,"" she said. 

Paper flyers were handed out to travelers at DCA with a QR code so that people could pull up a list of acceptable IDs to use at TSA checkpoints. (Fox News Digital)

She said that since she already has a passport, she feels it makes more financial sense to use it at this time.

""My ID expires in November, so I plan on doing it all at once when I have to get one anyway,"" she said.

 ""I didn't feel an urgency to do so.""

A man named Nick, who is also from Bloomington, Illinois, told Fox News Digital, ""I travel with my passport, so I normally don't even use my ID.""

When asked if she knows anyone who does not have a passport or a REAL ID, she said her parents don't.

She said she wants her parents to get the REAL ID so that ""they can travel and enjoy retirement."" 

She does not believe they are looking at making a DMV appointment as of right now.

""The DMVs are always pretty packed.""

Lesley from California commented that she has a REAL ID — but shared that a colleague who did not have the document had to rush to get one for a work trip.

""She didn't have the REAL ID, so she had to go and see them [the DMV] and get the REAL ID, and it was about like a two-to-four-hour wait … It was in California.""

She added, ""The DMVs there are always pretty packed.""

While the DMVs in some states have added special Saturday hours or extended weekday hours to accommodate REAL ID requests, many motor vehicle bureaus are not open on weekends.

How do you do, fellow white people? Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) says hello!

The former vice presidential candidate recently told an audience at Harvard's Kennedy School that former Vice President Kamala Harris chose him as a running mate because of his uncanny ability to connect with the average Caucasian cisgender dude. “I could code talk to white guys — watching football, fixing their truck,“ he explained. “I was the permission structure to say, ‘Look, you can do this and vote for this.'”

It's true, all the fellas are talking about “permission structures” these days.

Alas, the White Guy Whisperer didn't really help the Democratic Party ticket at all in 2024. Part of the problem, one imagines, is that the governor of Minnesota has an utterly deluded conception of himself as the embodiment of the working-class male. Though even if he were, few would have cared. Blatant pandering doesn't go over well with any race or gender.

For one thing, guys who talk to guys never talk about how good they are at talking to them. Say what you will about President Donald Trump, he doesn't “code” his language to appeal to the working class or anyone else. When he slams general managers for passing on Shedeur Sanders in the NFL draft, for example, you know the comment hasn't been vetted by a bunch of pinhead pollsters or risk-averse handlers. Yet, authenticity is about the last thing that came to mind watching Walz's ham-fisted manly media stunts in 2024, not during his cringy Madden video game contest with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) or his hunting outing in which he struggled with a shotgun.

Never mind, the notion of “white guys” being transfixed by a candidate simply because he also watches football is awfully insulting. Just because a couple of white guys talk about trucks doesn't mean they agree on foreign policy.

Now, we might have a propensity to read too much into things politicians say, but I think Walz's white-guy code comment also speaks to one of the big problems hampering Democrats. They have an unnatural obsession with identitarianism.

It is tragically stupid and wholly un-American to approach people by race. On the most basic level, voters who define themselves, or let others define them, by immutable characteristics undermine their self-worth and free will. There's no such thing as “white guys” in anything but a physiological sense. Trump and I are both white guys born in Queens, though, admittedly, one of us has been marginally more successful. Still, a white Southern Baptist from Georgia probably gets Trump, a billionaire who's lived a gold-plated existence, in ways I don't. And a white evangelical guy from rural South Carolina, a Catholic white guy from Arizona, or an atheist white guy from Oregon all have different sets of cultural values, interests, and quirks. A minuscule number of racists find their identity in being “white.” I've never once in my life wondered what other “white people” were thinking or doing or saying, nor has a normal person.

Yet, the Democratic Party is a coalition cobbled together by identity politics. It's one of the reasons it is compelled to expend so much energy painting the opposition as a bigoted enemy. The Left has gambled on the idea that ethnic demographics would transform the electorate and destroy the “white” Republican Party. I've been writing about this wishful thinking for years. Democrats see the world in swaths of color and believe everyone has a similarly blinkered view of the world.

Trump likely gained somewhere around 13 to 14 points among Hispanics in 2024, flipping big historically Democratic regions such as Miami-Dade County, Florida, and Starr County, Texas, because Democrats adopted all kinds of quackery and tanked the economy. As immigrants enter the middle class, they're not going to vote like an oppressed racial class. They're going to want economic opportunities to climb higher. And by the way, if you think Hispanic Americans think of themselves as a single minority, you have obviously never spoken to one.

For years, Republicans pandered to Hispanic and black voters to try to expand their coalition, altering policy and lifting minority candidates for the sole purpose of connecting to voters through identity. It never works because identity politics has always been overrated. Generational voting patterns and regionalism have far more powerful effects on who we support. And citizens in urban areas tend to vote for Democrats who align with their moral outlook. Urban areas have more minorities. The rural public votes for more traditional values. The political conflict isn't about color but worldview. If racial divisions exist, it's often because they are lumped together by the modern Left. 

DEMOCRATS HAVE A PATRIOTISM PROBLEM

Incidentally, one of the benefits of federalism and local control is that it allows these disparate people to live under a single federal government that upholds some basic ideals. Democrats have spent years trying to centralize the federal government and appropriate institutions to compel people to adopt their own increasingly narrow and unhinged liberal sensibilities.

And one of the most corrosive aspects of that worldview is projecting your own racialist views onto others.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","The four factions Speaker Johnson must please to pass Trump's budget megabill","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/house/3398545/four-factions-mike-johnson-must-please-pass-trump-budget-megabill/","Fri, 02 May 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) is determined to pass a megabill to codify President Donald Trump's agenda by Memorial Day, but four factions of GOP lawmakers are forcing leadership to find a compromise that can pass the razor-thin GOP majority.

The White House held a meeting Thursday with Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA), House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith (R-MO), and House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Brett Guthrie (R-KY) on reconciliation, all given the tough task of appeasing differing special interests within the conference with little to no room for error.

“We had a very productive and encouraging meeting at the White House this morning, and the remaining pieces of ‘The One, Big Beautiful Bill!' are coming together very well,” Johnson said after the meeting.

“We are awaiting some final calculations on a few of the tax components, and we expect to be able to complete that work on a very aggressive schedule and quickly send the bill to the president's desk.”

After the White House meeting, it was announced that both the Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce committees wouldn't hold their markup hearings until the week of May 12, a week behind leadership's desired schedule. An Energy and Commerce Democratic member anticipated that the markup would take up to 30 hours.

Republicans have begun charging forward with a budget process called reconciliation that unlocks Trump's agenda. Through one megabill, the GOP hopes to pass a renewal of his 2017 tax law alongside priorities on energy, defense, and the border. 

Committee leaders tasked with leading sections of the reconciliation bill met with lawmakers throughout this week, as several Republicans have expressed concerns over how the GOP can find $1.5 trillion in spending cuts without slashing Medicaid, leaving the House Energy and Commerce markup expected to draw a heated debate.

Some centrist Republicans in states like California and New York are also aggressively advocating to increase the $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions, with lawmakers gathering with Johnson this week to pitch numbers and find common ground with no concrete results yet.

Standing in the way of Medicaid and SALT Republicans are the fiscal hawks, who have warned Republicans that their support for the bill hinges on finding enough cuts to offset the tax cuts many Republicans want to make permanent, along with Trump's promises of no tax on tips or overtime. 

These four policy areas put leadership at a massive crossroads between the two ends of the party as they advocate an ambitious passage schedule, aiming for before Memorial Day weekend. 

Republicans have long complained about former President Joe Biden's 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which was passed through the same reconciliation process that some Republicans want to use to repeal one of Biden's biggest legislative wins. 

The fight between those who want a full repeal and those who consider it a red line when it comes to their vote on reconciliation heated up Thursday when 38 Republicans sent a letter to Smith arguing that leaving any of the bill in place would “undermine America's return to energy dominance and national security.”

Many House Republicans calling for a full repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act also fall under the category of fiscal hawks, whose opposition often leads to many late-night or last-minute negotiations with House leadership to pass spending bills on the floor. 

Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX), a budget hawk and policy chairman for the Freedom Caucus, has said his vote will most likely teeter on whether the massive bill includes a full Inflation Reduction Act repeal. Budget hawks argue the repeal will be used to pay for the tax cuts expected to be in the reconciliation bill. 

“We should fully repeal the Inflation Reduction Act,” Roy wrote on X. “The billions in green tax credits are a scam and can be traded (boondoggle). Americans get less reliable and more expensive energy. Protecting Biden policy is a bad look. We can't afford this garbage.”

Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), who signed on to the letter calling for a full repeal, is an expected holdout as he consistently votes “no” on spending bills. When asked earlier this year if he supports a full repeal, the Kentucky Republican told the Washington Examiner, “Uh, sure, yeah.”

However, a full repeal would serve as a red line for many centrist GOP House members, whose districts have benefited from some of the clean energy tax credits included in the Inflation Reduction Act. It was deemed the biggest climate bill in history. 

More than 20 of these centrist members sent a letter to Smith earlier this month stating they want to keep the clean energy tax credits that came from the act, arguing a full repeal could quickly increase utility bills. These members said they would withhold their support for the reconciliation bill if these tax credits were pulled.

“We request that any proposed changes to the tax code be conducted in a targeted and pragmatic fashion that promotes conference priorities without undoing current and future private sector investments which will continue to increase domestic manufacturing, promote energy innovation, and keep utility costs down,” the 21 members wrote in the letter. 

These members in favor of the credits told the Washington Examiner they wanted to “take a scalpel, not a sledge.” 

Medicaid has been a point of contention for House GOP leadership in the reconciliation process well before the first budget framework was passed in late February. 

Several swing district and state lawmakers have been concerned that the $880 billion in proposed Energy and Commerce Committee cuts will likely run right through Medicaid. It has opened the door for Democratic campaign attacks, slamming Republicans for wanting to slash working-class families' benefits.

Leadership has spent weeks trying to assure centrist Republicans that there will not be cuts to Medicaid or other beneficiary programs on which their constituents rely.

But getting everyone in one room is proving to be difficult. Many members were tied up this week with other reconciliation markup hearings, and several centrist Republicans, such as Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R-NJ), did not make it to meetings on Medicaid and SALT with Guthrie. Van Drew told reporters he heard the turnout “wasn't huge.”

Van Drew's red line comes if the bill cuts “current benefits to individuals or entities that are currently eligible or legal.” 

Earlier this month, 12 centrist Republicans wrote a letter to leadership and Guthrie saying they oppose any cuts to Medicaid that would reduce coverage for vulnerable populations.

“As Members of Congress who helped to deliver a Republican majority, many of us representing districts with high rates of constituents who depend on Medicaid, we would like to reiterate our strong support for this program that ensures our constituents have reliable healthcare. Balancing the federal budget must not come at the expense of those who depend on these benefits for their health and economic security,” the letter said.

The letter was signed by Van Drew and Reps. David Valadao (R-CA), Don Bacon (R-NE), Rob Bresnahan (R-PA), Juan Ciscomani (R-AZ), Jen Kiggans (R-VA), Young Kim (R-CA), Rob Wittman (R-VA), Nicole Malliotakis (R-NY), Nick LaLota (R-NY), Andrew Garbarino (R-NY), and Jeff Hurd (R-CO).

CENTRIST REPUBLICANS WARN HOUSE LEADERSHIP ABOUT CUTTING MEDICAID COVERAGE

Although meetings this week have not tipped the scale in any direction, centrists remain confident consensus can be found.

“I remain optimistic about how things look, because I know leadership understands the importance of having all parts of the Republican coalition together on this reconciliation bill, so I expect that they'll take that into account as they implement these instructions,” Hurd told the Washington Examiner on Thursday.

Smith, the chairman of the tax-writing committee, has one of the most difficult tasks: He will have to iron out an extensive tax-cut bill while balancing the offset in spending from looming budget hawks. 

A handful of fiscal conservative members have made clear their votes are contingent on the budget bill not adding to the national deficit.  

“If you go in there and ask for $1.5 trillion in cuts, you're not going to get $1.5 trillion in cuts. You better ask for a whole heck of a lot, ask for $8 [trillion] or $9 trillion,” Rep. Tim Burchett (R-TN) told reporters Thursday.

“We say we're going to make all these cuts, and then we turn right around and we give all the money to the war pimps at the Pentagon and to me, that's not savings,” the Tennessee firebrand continued.

Roy, who was the first to vocalize repealing the Inflation Reduction Act in reconciliation, continues to say he wants to see the “math add up” when looking at offsetting tax cuts, vowing to not vote for a bill that does not include these offsets. 

“We have $300 billion of spending between defense and border and in the packages, so we gotta find even more savings,” Roy said Thursday. 

House Budget Chairman Jodey Arrington (R-TX), a long-time fiscal hawk, said the speaker promised the final product for reconciliation would not increase the deficit.

SALT, the State and Local Tax deduction, has also been a major thorn in the side for Johnson.

Republican lawmakers from high-tax blue states like New York, California, and New Jersey have outsize power to force changes to the $10,000 SALT cap during reconciliation because of the House's ultra-slim Republican majority.

In lifting the cap, Republicans would be undoing a reform they won in 2017. The cap is popular with most rank-and-file members and was used to offset some of the costs of the first Trump tax cuts for things like the lower tax rates, the doubled standard deduction, and the boosted child tax credit.

In 2017, then-House Speaker Paul Ryan lost the votes of a dozen members, mostly from California, New York, and New Jersey. But Ryan had a sufficiently large majority that he didn't need their votes. Now, Johnson can only afford to lose three votes, depending on attendance. 

SALT CAUCUS SPURNS KEY CORPORATE OFFSET FOR LARGER TAX DEDUCTION

LaLota, Malliotakis, Kim, and Garbarino, as well as Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY),  are among the members seeking a bigger SALT cap.

While all parties to negotiations are expressing optimism that an agreement will be reached, Malliotakis told reporters on Friday that the matter likely won't be resolved until next week. Members of the self-described SALT caucus also met with Johnson on Thursday evening.

One of the main questions is how high the group wants to see the cap for individuals and married couples. Lawler has a bill to raise the cap to $100,000 for individuals and $200,000 for couples, although that is well above what will likely be accepted. Still, members have said that $25,000 is too low.

“I think the number needs to be higher than the $25,000, but it doesn't need to necessarily be that much higher to protect those individuals,” Malliotakis said.

Of crucial note, if the cap goes too high, it could endanger the votes of the deficit hawks, who are concerned about the price tag of the legislation. The costs are high. Raising the cap to $40,000 would cost somewhere in the ballpark of $910 billion over a decade, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

SALT critics also point to the notion that it disproportionately benefits the wealthy. The Tax Policy Center found that the highest-income 20% of households would receive more than 96% of the tax cut if the cap were fully repealed.

Raising the SALT cap has been panned by many lawmakers in red states. 

“I don't support continuing to subsidize blue state high-tax jurisdictions,” Roy, the Texas Republican, told reporters. “So I'm not all that interested in hearing about my blue state colleagues complaining about it. But then again, you got to figure out how to get a deal done.”

But the SALT caucus isn't just being so aggressive on holding the line because they think it's good policy; getting a bigger SALT cap is very much an issue of political survival for the SALT caucus. Many of them are in toss-up districts and could be tossed out of office in 2026 if they don't deliver on their promises to raise the cap.

REPUBLICANS TO INTRODUCE BILL CREATING ROTH IRA-STYLE SAVINGS ACCOUNT

It will be up to the Ways and Means Committee markup hearing to sort out the looming tax issues.

“You're talking about the income threshold, you're talking about the marriage penalty, you're talking about the deduction itself. Is there going to be a phase out? Malliotakis said. “There's a lot of questions.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","German intelligence designates AfD ‘extremist' group after becoming country's most popular party","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/world/3399059/german-intelligence-designates-afd-extremist-group/","Fri, 02 May 2025 15:48:07 GMT","

Germany's domestic intelligence agency designated the right-wing Alternative für Deutschland party as “extremist,” shortly after it became the single most popular party in the country.

The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the Verfassungsschutz, justified its decision by claiming there were “numerous indications of efforts by the AfD to undermine the free democratic basic order,” indications that were “confirmed during further investigation.” The designation opens up the agency's ability to surveil the populist anti-immigration party more thoroughly, among other legal consequences.

The Verfassungsschutz justified its decision by claiming that the AfD didn't consider citizens of a “migration background from predominantly Muslim countries” as equal to native Germans.

“The party's prevailing understanding of the people based on ethnicity and descent is incompatible with the free democratic basic order. It aims to exclude certain population groups from equal participation in society, subject them to unconstitutional discrimination, and thus assign them a legally devalued status,” the statement read.

“This exclusionary understanding of the people is the starting point and ideological basis for ongoing agitation against certain individuals or groups of people, through which they are defamed and despised indiscriminately and irrational fears and rejection are stirred up,” it added, accusing the party of deepening “prejudices, resentment and fears towards this group of people.”

The Verfassungsschutz's designation of the AfD as “extremist” largely centered on its rhetoric surrounding immigration, rhetoric that wouldn't be controversial in the U.S. Republican Party. Evidence cited by Der Spiegel included Weidel's use of the “right-wing extremist term ‘remigration,'” though the term is commonplace among mainstream right-wing and populist parties across Europe.

The agency also cited incidents in which party officials dressed up as deportation pilots or handed out airplane-shaped gummy bears during the federal election campaign.

AfD party leaders Alice Weidel and Tino Chrupalla denounced the decision in a joint statement, calling it “defamatory” and a “severe blow to German democracy.”

“The AfD, as an opposition party, is now being publicly discredited and criminalized shortly before the change of government,” their statement read, adding, “targeted interference in the democratic decision-making process is therefore clearly politically motivated. The AfD will continue to defend itself legally against these defamations that endanger democracy,” their statement read.

The designation of the AfD as extremist came as a surprise, as it was made with just days left for an outgoing caretaker government. The party can appeal the ruling.

Outgoing German interior minister Nancy Faeser defended the ruling, saying, “The AfD represents an ethnic concept that discriminates against entire population groups and treats citizens with a history of migration as second-class Germans.”

She insisted the decision was made with “no political influence.”

The biggest impact of the Verfassungsschutz's ruling will likely reopen talks of banning the party altogether. The left-wing Social Democratic Party of Germany, which will be part of the incoming coalition government, has signaled a willingness for this course of action. The Verfassungsschutz doesn't have the ability to ban the party — such a move must be taken by the Bundestag, government, or constitutional court.

“It's clear for me that the ban has to come,” SPD deputy leader Serpil Midyatli said, according to Deutsche Presse-Agentur. She said the matter was now black and white.

However, a ban on the AfD would be unprecedented in modern Western history. Last month, the party became the single most popular in Germany for the first time, the first time since the founding of the modern German Republic that a party other than the Christian Democratic Union or SPD took the top spot in polls. Banning the country's most popular party would be met with massive domestic and international backlash, especially from ally Elon Musk and the Trump administration.

The AfD came second in the February federal elections with 20.8% of the vote, taking 152 seats in the 630-seat Bundestag.

AFD BECOMES MOST POPULAR PARTY IN GERMANY FOR FIRST TIME

The exact label of the AfD Party is itself a source of controversy. Left-wing critics openly accuse it of being a neo-Nazi group. The party has consistently rejected the “far-right” label, with its leaders saying the party stands for “the liberal democratic order and has nothing to do with this suspected neo-Nazi grouping.”

Other analysts take a more nuanced view, painting the party as a coalition of broadly right-wing ideological factions.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

From heated political rhetoric between heads of state to loud booing at NHL games, all signs say the relationship between the United States and Canada looks to sour in President Donald Trump's second term. Whether it's the threat of tariffs or the president's use of “the 51st state” to refer to America's neighbors to the north, rising tensions threaten to discourage cross-border pleasure jaunts between the two countries' citizens.

While Trump makes threats against the Canadian economy and lobs barbs northbound in public statements and social media comments, the mood of the U.S. played an unusually strong role in the April 28 federal election that extended the reign of Prime Minister Mark Carney, the leader of the Liberal Party. Carney and vanquished Conservative rival Pierre Poilievre faced questions from the Canadian electorate about how they would handle the American president with his claims of shaky Canadian sovereignty and promises of economic retribution against a longtime ally. With many voters angry at Trump, both candidates fed that anger, and Carney emerged on top.

With plenty of other travel options available for North America's would-be sojourners, the building unpleasantness between Washington and Ottawa promises to disrupt the travel and tourism business along the world's longest demilitarized border.

While it's too early to calculate the financial impact for 2025, more than 20 million Canadian tourists and business travelers visited the U.S. to spend more than $20 billion during the previous year, according to the U.S. Travel Association.

A report by Statistics Canada, looking the other way across the border, reported total U.S. traveler expenditures at 12 billion Canadian dollars for 2023. The travel industries for both countries expect those relevant numbers to decline in a heated and chippy 2025.

The first major tangible blow to the U.S./Canada travel world fell recently as Canadian airlines Air Canada, Flair, Porter and WestJet cut routes to vacation destinations such as Miami, New York, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. – all while citing a drop in business and travel demand along those routes in favor of European destinations.

Melinda Bachand is the founder and managing consultant for Distinctive Talent Partners in Vermont. While she doesn't see open hostility between Americans and Canadians yet, she is sensing some tension that could affect her business.

“I wouldn't say people are actively avoiding each other,” Bachand said, “but there's a noticeable unease that's creeping into conversations, especially among those of us who live near the border and cross it frequently for work, family, or travel.”

Bachand insists her neighbors in Vermont don't view Quebec as foreign, but just the “next town over.” She has Canadian clients flying out of Montreal for affordability and convenience. While they're still traveling, Bachand reports that those travelers definitely ask more questions than usual.

“There's hesitation and a sense that something might go wrong, even if it hasn't yet,” she said. “That uncertainty alone changes behavior. People double-check things, think twice, or choose different routes. It's not avoidance exactly, but it's not business as usual, either.”

Bachand said she believes Canadians think they will be detained or deported if they visit the U.S. — and she agrees with their caution.

“They likely will, and it will have long-lasting, negative implications,” she said. “I live in a town with a sub-Ivy League school that's pretty exclusive. They had three students deported last week. I would have never thought something like that would happen, so I can only assume the xenophobia has been collected and tossed in a Petri dish. Now we sit back and see what disgusting sludge we created.”

Adam Chapnick is a professor and deputy director for education at the Canadian Forces College at Canada's Department of National Defence. Judging the overall business and sociopolitical atmosphere between Canada and the U.S., he sees underlying fear and hostility taking root in Canada.

“A number of friends and colleagues have canceled trips across the border,” Chapnick said. “In my experience, Canadians are not trying to avoid Americans. They are trying to avoid the United States and supporting the American economy. Some Canadians believe they could be detained and deported if they visit U.S. soil, particularly those who are members of visible and/or religious and/or ethnic minorities.”

Chapnick said he doesn't know if the current bad feelings are going to last, considering the early days of Trump's latest administration and policies, but he can't foresee Canadians warming to the president's ideas.

“Again, I really don't think the conflict is between individual Canadians and Americans,” he said. “I have not seen or heard of Americans in Canada being abused in any way. The issue is that Canadians do not want to support the American administration directly or indirectly by spending money that will grow the US economy at this time.”

Houston-based Linda de Sosa is a leisure travel consultant booking individual clients and group trips to and from Canada. She plans to travel and scout Newfoundland and Labrador in July because she has no hesitation traveling north. Still, she can't say such anxiety isn't taking hold for fellow industry professionals or their clients.

“Unfortunately, too many foreigners read the mass media and are sure they are going to be stopped in the U.S., either because of their sexuality or other unfounded fears,” de Sosa said. “I've seen those comments from Canadian friends in the travel industry. They ignore the fact that Trump appointed the highest-ranking gay man ever in Scott Bessent, secretary of the treasury, who is fifth in line to the presidency if something were to happen.”

The ironic predicament de Sosa sees for wary travelers is that the best way for foreigners to dispel their fears of other countries or to tear down any ideas of hostility and intolerance is to visit the countries they fear. Under the current rhetoric and hype, those explorations are becoming less likely and less frequent.

“The sad thing is visiting each other's nations is how these myths are busted,” she said. “I have been to 163 countries, and things that I hear foreigners say [about the U.S. and the Trump administration] are straight from the media — and it couldn't be more wrong. I find it very sad.”

100-DAY REPORT CARD: TRUMP TORNADO SHOCKED AMERICA — AND THE WORLD

Bachand said she can't see anyone enjoying the current state of business and cooperation between long-term allies.

“If anything, what I'm seeing isn't hostility, ” she said. “It's sadness. There's a subtle grief about the shift [in relations]. I see people feeling a kind of quiet, emotional distance that wasn't there before.”

Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin reportedly suffered a small health scare this week during a general congregation meeting with his fellow papal electors.

Outlets in Italy and abroad claim the cardinal fainted on Wednesday at the conclusion of the cardinals' assembly, saying that the high-ranking prelate recovered from his bout of “high blood pressure” with no lasting effects.

It's a rumor typical in times of conclave, with intrigue into the health of a front-running prince of the church, allegedly occurring behind closed doors amid rising tensions as the election of the pope draws ever closer.

Whether or not Parolin collapsed inside the Vatican, there's no doubt his doctor will be concerned about his blood pressure over the next weeks. The 70-year-old is widely regarded as among the most likely candidates to become the bishop of Rome, a prospect that has stressed even the most serene clergymen and monks throughout history.

Parolin is considered the walking, talking embodiment of the Vatican establishment. As leader of the Secretariat of State, he was the de facto No. 2 under Pope Francis. He is a stuffy, logistically minded politician more at home in embassies than a parish rectory — and many argue that is what the Catholic Church needs.

The papacy has many charisms. Francis embraced his role as a pastor. The world welcomed his gestures of mercy, but Vatican bureaucrats fumed at his governance.

By contrast, Parolin's career is that of the arch-diplomat. He's a Pontifical Gregorian University and Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy alum who entered the Vatican's foreign service in his early 30s. He was the youngest secretary of state in almost a century when Francis appointed him in 2013 at the age of 58.

The pontificate of Francis was characterized by a radical shift to the margins of the church. The late pope was more concerned about advocating the poor than international politicking, more interested in dining with prisoners than meeting with world leaders, and more at home responding to children's letters than addressing the Vatican's financial implosion.

A hypothetical Parolin papacy would offer a more traditional politician to steer the church.

Cardinal Beniamino Stella, a former prefect for the Congregation for the Clergy, allegedly drew attention to this dynamic during the cardinals' April 30 congregation.

America magazine, a Jesuit publication in the United States, claimed Stella “openly attacked” several policies under Francis during the meeting and “[pushed] hard to convince cardinals to vote for Cardinal Parolin in the conclave.”

The most obvious black mark on Parolin's diplomatic record is the Holy See-China agreement that he oversaw in 2018, giving the Chinese Communist Party extensive powers governing the church within its borders.

It was championed as a warming of relations with the atheist People's Republic, but Chinese Catholics weary of the CCP's influence felt betrayed.

Catholic churches in China are now required to operate under the oversight of the government, which selects bishops to lead churches within its Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association. The bishops picked by the government are universally seen as toadies of the Communist Party.

According to the agreement, each bishop selected by the government must still be ratified by the Holy See. That was thrown into question last month when the CCPA held an “election” of local Patriotic Catholic leaders to select a new bishop in the Diocese of Xinxiang. The diocese already has a bishop approved and appointed by the Holy See.

It's a naked power grab capitalizing on the recent death of Francis and the power vacuum at the top of the Catholic hierarchy — an unfortunate development for a cardinal defined by his diplomatic career.

Cardinal Joseph Zen, a 93-year-old retired prelate of Hong Kong and advocate of the underground Catholics opposing communist influence, points the finger directly at Parolin for refusing to acknowledge the slow collapse of authentic Catholicism in China.

His office took an aggressive stance from the beginning of the sede vacante period when the cardinal challenged the early start of general congregations, which made it practically impossible for far-flung members of the college to arrive on time.

“Cardinal Zen would like to know why the first session of the General Congregations has to start so early,” his office said in a statement. “How are the old men from the peripheries supposed to arrive on time. There is the kind word reminding them that they do not have the duty to attend, but they have the right — yes or no?”

Compared to the Hong Kong prelate's previous statements, it was a mild irritation. Zen has railed against Parolin for years, accusing him of “telling lies shamelessly” and falsely pushing the 2018 agreement as aligned with the vision of the late Pope Benedict XVI.

“The most repugnant thing is the insult to the venerable Benedict XVI by saying that he approved at the time the agreement signed by the Holy See two years ago, knowing that our sweetest, most gentle Benedict certainly will not come out to deny it,” Zen said in 2020 before the pope emeritus's death.

None of this is to assert that Parolin is a stooge or puppet for China. His negotiations with Beijing are cold and pragmatic, seeking to dodge the worst possible outcomes for slightly more bearable concessions. But he seems to have been duped, and that public failure looms dark over the establishment candidate. 

The Chinese government keeps its cards close to its chest when dealing with the Vatican, and observers should not expect President Xi Jinping to tip his hand on what outcome the Communist Party is hoping for. Perhaps they are rooting for Parolin to take the throne, confident they can further manipulate his openness to dialogue. It is also possible they're praying for a new mark for their con.

CONCLAVE TO ELECT A NEW POPE WILL START ON MAY 7

The conclave to elect Francis's successor will begin on May 7.

If white smoke pours from the Sistine Chapel's chimney and it is Parolin who steps out on the balcony in papal attire, the Catholic Church may expect a logical continuation of the Francis papacy with a bit more administrative sobriety and far fewer candid conversations with the public.

The preelection messaging is clear — calmer waters, less dramatic gestures, and renewed professionalism from a political animal forged in the furnace of geopolitics.

Whether that outcome is desirable is up to each believer.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Whatever ails President Donald Trump, each day brings new reminders that many of the Democrats who would like to replace him aren't quite ready for prime time. 

Every time Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), who was on the party's national ticket as the vice presidential nominee just last year, strikes out on his own, he illustrates why they lost to Trump.

“I could code talk to white guys — watching football, fixing their truck. … I was the permission structure to say, ‘Look, you can do this and vote for this,'” Walz said during a Harvard Kennedy School forum earlier this week.

If this doesn't sound like effective messaging, the results of the 2024 campaign may not surprise you. Trump won 60% of white men, suggesting they did not respond well to Walz's permission structure. Trump also carried 54% of Hispanic men and 21% of black men, according to exit polls.

Walz previously brought his brand of harmless masculinity to Gov. Gavin Newsom's (D-CA) podcast, on which he suggested that Trump-supporting men felt threatened by him and perhaps rightly so. “I do think I could kick most of their ass,” Walz said. (The singular is in the original.)

Perhaps a generic Democrat could do better next time. “I think we need to collectively run a presidential campaign without a candidate right now that builds all the infrastructure. … By the time we get to 2028, we're ready,” Walz said. 

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI) has now twice been successfully trolled by Trump. Her impromptu remarks as Trump marked his 100 days back in office went better than her hiding her face behind papers in the White House, but her tarmac embrace of the president could come back to haunt her. Chris Christie was never forgiven by his party's base for hugging Barack Obama when they were governor of New Jersey and president of the United States, respectively. 

At the same time, Gov. Wes Moore (D-MD), one of the Democrats' rising stars, announced on Thursday that he would be taking a pass on the 2028 presidential race.

In retrospect, one of the signs that the Democrats were going to lose the 2024 election, even after replacing former President Joe Biden at the top of the ticket, was their most ambitious elected officials deciding to forgo the opportunity. No one seriously floated a challenge to former Vice President Kamala Harris at the Democratic National Convention after Biden dropped out. Whitmer and Gov. Josh Shapiro (D-PA), both Rust Belt governors, were similarly disinterested in being Harris's running mate. 

Two major things could happen that might make 2028 different. The first is that if the economy and Trump's poll numbers continue on their present trajectory, Democratic candidates will not need exceptional political skills to win. The second is that if the economy and Trump's poll numbers are bad, more talented Democrats will see an opportunity and run.

Established politicians often fight the last war, and presidential campaigns often start a year or two before the actual election year. In 1992, most of the presumed top-tier candidates for the Democratic nomination chose not to run. Mario Cuomo, Richard Gephardt, Lloyd Bentsen, and others made their decisions in the aftermath of the Gulf War, when President George H.W. Bush had record job approval ratings and looked unbeatable. 

But the early ‘90s recession, coupled with the lips-defying Bush tax increase, made the incumbent quite vulnerable. Bill Clinton, the Arkansas governor who had bombed in his 1988 Democratic convention speech, ascended to the top against second-tier competition like Paul Tsongas and Jerry Brown. Clinton also proved to be a generational political talent. 

A lot could change between now and the midterm elections, much less the next presidential race. Trump's numbers and the economy could improve. The political climate could be radically different.  Republicans will be looking at a different nominee in 2028, though that candidate will need to run under the conditions left by Trump, just as John McCain campaigned in the shadow of second-term George W. Bush.

AFTER 100 DAYS, CAN TRUMP PULL OFF SECOND GREAT POLITICAL COMEBACK? 

If the Democrats have a Clinton-like talent waiting in the wings, they have yet to show sufficient interest in the White House. But it wouldn't take a huge shift from 2024 nationally or in the battleground states to produce a different electoral outcome.

Smolny College is a warning.

When my university, Columbia, recently capitulated to President Donald Trump's $400 million ultimatum, I felt a creeping sense of déjà vu. I had seen this before—in Russia.

Before coming to Columbia as a grad student, I went to Smolny College, a small liberal-arts school in St. Petersburg. The Smolny I knew was one of Russia's few independent colleges; students and faculty had extraordinary autonomy, which they often used to challenge the government. Then Russian authorities intervened, and my alma mater started unraveling.

Smolny's story offers a warning that Columbia must heed while it still has the chance: When autocrats realize they can manipulate a school, they won't stop until they have total control.

Before Smolny was a college, it was an experiment. A few years after the Soviet Union collapsed, Leon Botstein, the president of Bard College, in New York, paid a visit to St. Petersburg State University. Professors at SPSU—one of Russia's most prestigious universities—had proposed partnering with Bard. Botstein liked the idea, so he went to speak with the faculty about what he thought Russia and the West could learn from each other. Apparently, he left an impression: Professors quoted him to one another long after he left.

Garry Kasparov: How America can avoid becoming Russia

Inspired by Botstein's visit, SPSU joined with Bard to create a liberal-arts program that grew into Smolny. George Soros's newly established Open Society Foundations funded the initiative, and Russia's finance minister, Alexei Kudrin, offered early political support. After Kudrin became dean in 2011, Smolny matured into a true liberal-arts college, offering a dual SPSU–Bard degree and majors including literature, economics, and computer science. The school enrolled some 600 students, attracted Western grants, amassed an endowment, hired ideologically diverse faculty, and hosted much broader political debate than could be found on most Russian campuses.

Nikolay Kropachev, the head of SPSU, looked on with increasing alarm. Both he and Kudrin had ties to the government—President Vladimir Putin decides whether to renew Kropachev's appointment—but the Kremlin eventually came to view Kudrin as a liberal outsider, someone who couldn't be relied on to enforce orthodoxy. So that job fell to Kropachev. His “position was that Smolny was a complete disgrace and had to be shut down,” Dmitry Dubrovsky, the founder of Smolny's human-rights program, told me. One of the university's principal concerns was the Smolny faculty, which often criticized SPSU's administration. Indeed, Dubrovsky himself had publicly attacked a university policy that required professors to submit their work to administrators before publishing or presenting it abroad. (In 2015, SPSU sent Dubrovsky a renewal contract that he said didn't reflect the provisions he'd agreed to. The school fired him for refusing to sign.)

In early 2021, Kudrin announced that Smolny would separate from SPSU. “Our education model differs from the one used at SPSU,” he said at the time, rather diplomatically. But before the divorce took effect, a pro-Kremlin group persuaded the Russian state prosecutor's office to investigate Smolny's ties to Soros, whose NGOs had been outlawed in the country. The group alleged that Soros and Bard were using Smolny to turn Russia's youth into a “protest electorate” with a “pro-Western” and “hostile ideology towards their own country.” SPSU cooperated with the prosecutors, who determined that Bard posed a “threat to the foundations of the constitutional order and security of the Russian Federation.” Instead of separating from SPSU, Smolny was forced to part ways with Bard, losing out on funding as well as the schools' student-faculty exchange. Graduates began receiving standard SPSU diplomas rather than dual degrees.

Julia, a Smolny student at the time, was baffled by the response among her professors. (She requested that we use only her first name to speak candidly about them.) “We need to prove that Smolny is independent and distinct from Bard—that it is authentically Russian,” Julia recalls her teachers saying. “I was like, What are you talking about?” she told me. “It was some kind of instant resignation. But you taught us differently!”

The crackdown intensified in the fall of 2021, when Russian authorities arrested Michael Freese, a Smolny professor and an American citizen who had helped manage the school's partnership with Bard. They detained Freese on his way to campus, held him for three days, revoked his visa, and deported him. In a signal of the tightening relationship between higher education and the regime, Kropachev signed a joint letter in 2022 endorsing Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and praising the role of universities as “the backbone of the state.”

Over the next year, Smolny purged dozens of professors, including one who was fired for joining an anti-war protest. Meanwhile, SPSU conducted a review of Smolny's curriculum, finding that its classes were “highly ideological” and representative of “the worst Western stereotypes.” Kudrin stepped down voluntarily, at least in the university's telling.

Soon enough, administrators aligned with SPSU took his place. They would undertake “just a few corrections to the curricula,” one of them wrote on social media. Instead, Smolny swapped out discussion-based seminars for lectures and cut the number of electives from 129 to 10. The administration also reduced the school's 12 majors to seven and gave them new names such as “Literature in the Context of Culture,” “Economics of Culture,” and “Music in the Context of Culture.” (“Culture in the context of culture” became a sneering refrain on campus.) Sensing that the changes posed an existential threat to the school, students started a “Save Smolny” campaign. Two were expelled after an academic committee decided to fail them.

Today, the Smolny I knew survives only in fragments. The school has maintained its size but now attracts only half the applicants it once did. With help from Bard, a group of former professors founded Smolny Beyond Borders, an initiative that offers online classes outside the reach of SPSU administrators and Kremlin bureaucrats. An alum recently told me that in order to teach an uncensored seminar, she had to sneak onto campus.

Last spring, I heard an exiled Russian journalist, Elena Kostyuchenko, talk about the pro-Palestine protests roiling Columbia's campus. “If I studied or worked there, I would stand beside the protesting students now,” Kostyuchenko said at a conference, one week after police began arresting demonstrators. “Not because I agree with their opinion. But because I know what happens when you don't defend another's opinion. The day after, you yourself won't be allowed to speak out.”

Garry Kasparov: The Putinization of America

A year later, the Trump administration announced that it was canceling $400 million in federal grants to Columbia, ostensibly because the school had failed to curb anti-Semitism. The next day, March 8, immigration authorities arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist and recent Columbia graduate. Many of my international peers became afraid to join protests or even come to campus, especially after Department of Homeland Security agents scoured two student residences. Then the government sent a list of demands to the school. Columbia mostly obliged, empowering campus-security officers to arrest students, for example, and placing the Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies Department under review—all in hopes of getting the $400 million back.

It didn't work; the money is still gone. And now the White House is reportedly planning to pursue a consent decree, which could effectively allow Trump to enforce his demands via the courts. Even though Columbia remains more insulated from state power than Smolny, the concerns I hear from my peers in America have begun to sound a lot like what I heard from my peers in Russia.

Last year, Kostyuchenko's warning that authoritarian forces could sway Columbia seemed far-fetched. I admit that I didn't quite believe her. I do now.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

How MAGA influencers have reshaped the press corps

Here's a question. What if you took the least appealing aspects of traditional broadcast journalism—the self-absorption, the ponderous delivery, the grandstanding—and sucked out any sense of conflict and challenge?

Now we have an answer. For three days this week, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has invited MAGA-friendly influencers to ask her questions during a dedicated press briefing. The results should be deeply embarrassing for everyone involved. We all enjoy getting together with like-minded people to kvetch about petty grievances in our professional lives—that's what keeps bars open—but most of us would have the sense not to do so in the White House, in front of cameras. The first rule of the new-media briefing is that your question should include either personal thanks to her for inviting you, or a pro forma denunciation of the legacy media. The second rule of the new-media briefing is that your question should be, in the five words that conference organizers most dread, “more of a statement, really.”

Yesterday, Jack Posobiec, perhaps best-known for promoting the Pizzagate conspiracy theory, asked a minute-long question about how violent the far left was, and received a two-minute-long answer from Leavitt about how violent the far left was. Viewers also heard from Dom Lucre (who describes himself to his 1.5 million X followers as a “breaker of narratives”) asking if the White House would investigate “Barack Hussein Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton” for election-integrity offenses.

“It's refreshing to actually hear a question on election integrity, because the legacy media would never ask such a question,” Leavitt replied, ignoring the fact that the media asked quite a lot of questions about her boss's well-documented efforts to pressure officials in Georgia to declare him the winner there in 2020. “They're so out of touch with where the American people are on this issue.”

The briefing lasted 25 minutes, although the barrage of safe questions and safe answers made it feel much longer. The obvious knock is that this is not journalism but entertainment. The trouble is that it's not even particularly entertaining. Donald Trump, who understands that jeopardy and drama equal ratings, would never be involved in something so dull.

The new-media briefing is part of the Trump administration's attempt to formalize the network of friendly commentators and influencers who have prospered on X, YouTube, Rumble, podcasts, and ultra-conservative television channels. The plan appears to be to secure the loyalty of these attention-hungry narcissists by setting them against one another, in a kind of sycophancy Hunger Games, as they compete for access through ever greater acts of devotion and flattery. Remember when Fox News was the biggest Trump cheerleader in town? Those days are gone. One of the “questions” this week was the suggestion that the White House should sue Fox for putting out an opinion poll that showed the Dear Leader in a less than flattering light. The guy who asked it was the independent influencer Eric Bolling, who left Fox in 2017 over workplace-harassment allegations (which he denied).

The dedicated briefing is an extension of the White House's existing efforts to soften up the press pool by adding more friendly faces. Starting in January, the Trump White House gave new-media outlets a spot at the main briefing, where they are routinely called upon for the first question. On April 22, that spot went to the podcaster Tim Pool. There are three things you need to know about Pool: The first is that he never, ever takes off his beanie. The second is that he started out as a left-wing activist-slash-journalist, covering Occupy Wall Street. The third is that he was among a group of conservative commentators who, the Justice Department asserted last year, unwittingly received large sums from Russian agents eager to stoke American culture-war controversies. (Pool put out a statement at the time saying that he and his colleagues were “victims.” More recently, he has contested the Justice Department's allegations.)

Pool's question to Leavitt was just culture-war content in a different form. “Many of the news organizations that are represented in this room have marched in lockstep on false narratives such as the ‘very fine people' hoax, the Covington smear, and now what's being called the ‘Maryland man' hoax, where an MS-13 gang member—adjudicated by two different judges, I believe—is just simply being referred to as a ‘Maryland man' over and over again,” Pool said, wearing what looked like a hoodie with lapels.

He was talking about Trump's explanation of the white-supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, and an incident two years later where students from Covington Catholic High School in Kentucky were wrongly accused of racism based on an out-of-context viral video. The most recent incident is the Trump administration's decision to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man living in Maryland, who it claims is a gang member.

As well as relitigating press coverage of these incidents, Pool wanted Leavitt to issue a wider condemnation of the traditional media. “In an effort from the White House to expand access to new companies, you've created this new-media seat,” Pool went on, adding that “you've had numerous outlets disparage the companies that you've had sit here, as well as the reporters. I'm wondering if you could comment on that unprofessional behavior as well as elaborate if there's any plans to expand access to new companies.”

Read: The global populist right has a MAGA problem

Well, that's one in the eye of the traditional media, isn't it? Too often, legacy outlets focus on fripperies such as But the Supreme Court has ordered you to do this, so why haven't you done it? or Why is there a tariff on an uninhabited island? or Come on, that's clearly Photoshop. Instead they ought to address the biggest issue of the day: Tim Pool's feelings of grievance. (And I say this as someone who agrees with Pool that many traditional media outlets got Covington wrong.)

Leavitt happily accepted Pool's premise, saying that she welcomed “diverse viewpoints” and “unbiased journalists.” Then she claimed that The Atlantic had incorrectly reported Abrego Garcia's story. The administration would rather argue over the words used to describe Abrego Garcia, who undoubtedly is both a man and a Maryland resident, than admit that its grounds for deporting him were initially sketchy and later appeared manipulated. The MAGA-friendly influencers are happy to collude with the White House because it flatters them, portraying them as the only independent-minded bringers of truth.

As it turned out, Pool's sucking up was just an appetizer. The first full-scale influencer briefing, on Monday, showed just how cozy things can get when normies and libs aren't even allowed into the room. “Tens of millions of Americans are now turning to social media and independent media outlets to consume their news, and we are embracing that change, not ignoring it,” Leavitt said in a seven-minute opening speech. The first influencer to ask a question, Arynne Wexler—“just a nonlib girl in a crazylib world”—kicked things off by noting that “my Uber drivers finally speak English again, so thank you for that.”

Later on came Winston Marshall, who used to play the banjo in Mumford & Sons until he was forced out for praising a book by the right-wing author Andy Ngo. He is also the son of Paul Marshall, the owner of the British publications UnHerd and The Spectator. Instead of working for either outlet, however, Winston has an interview podcast, on which he speaks with the same people who appear on all the other interview podcasts. Recent guests include Tim Pool.

At the White House, Marshall wanted to talk about the state of free speech in Britain, a topic upon which Vice President J. D. Vance recently delivered a short homily to European leaders. “As we speak, there are people in prison for quite literally reposting memes,” Marshall told the press secretary. “We have extensive prison sentences for tweets, social-media posts, and general free-speech issues.”

This is a legitimate point—in Britain we have far fewer speech protections than America, and the police here have arrested citizens for their social-media posts. But the alleged topic at hand was merely a setup for Marshall's zinger: “Would the Trump administration consider political asylum for British citizens in such a situation?”

Leavitt laughed. “I have not heard that proposed to the president nor have I spoken to him about that idea, but I certainly can, and talk to our national-security team and see if it's something the administration would entertain,” she replied. Let me decode that: Thank you for your absolute nonquestion, which you and I both understand was asked purely to be clipped and posted on social media. The reaction over here in Britain to Marshall's showboating was rather less warm. “Why stop with free speech martyrs?” one friend texted me. “I think we should encourage all banjo players to seek asylum in the States.”

Former Trump press secretary turned influencer Sean Spicer then moaned about the president giving an interview to The Atlantic—subtext: why not meeee—before DC Draino, a Florida-based commentator whose real name is Rogan O'Handley, asked about further updates on the government's files about the financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. O'Handley was one of the influencers summoned to the White House in February to be given a ceremonial ring binder of evidence against Epstein—who died in jail while awaiting trial for sex-trafficking charges in 2019. (The influencers got played: The flight logs inside the binders were already public.)

Then came the America First Policy Institute ambassador Kambree Nelson, who asked Leavitt about what she should cover as a reporter. “So, what direction do you advise me to go into?” she said. “Like, the White House files that y'all send out every single day?” (This was at least a better question than the one Nelson once asked on X, about whether the moon had disappeared because she hadn't seen it for a week. “Why is everyone silent about this?” she added.) Leavitt suggested that Nelson might usefully concern herself with the fact that the president does “so many phenomenal things every day that will never be mentioned on cable news at night.”

Other observations from the first day included: “It's so refreshing to have a press secretary after the last few years who's both intelligent and articulate” and “Great job this morning, and as always; you're really crushing it.” Anytime someone crept close to a real question—asking when the promised border wall would be completed, or when Trump's pledge of eliminating federal income tax would be enacted—Leavitt simply brushed it aside. “This is something the secretary of commerce and the secretary of Treasury are both equally as excited about, as is the president,” Leavitt replied to the second inquiry. In other words, it'll happen on about the seventh of never.

Tuesday brought more softballs. “Congratulations on 100 incredible days,” the internet personality Debra Lea began, before asking what policies Trump would pursue to keep his approval ratings “historically high” and to win the midterms. (His approval ratings are lower than Biden's were at the 100-day mark.) The answer was “tax cuts.”

Later, Link Lauren—a man who not only has his names the wrong way around, but also appears to have styled himself after Draco Malfoy—asked Leavitt a question that even North Koreans might have found a bit much. “You're a very high-profile young mother who seems to juggle and balance it all beautifully,” Lauren said. “What advice do you have to young parents out there who are starting their careers, having kids, building families, and trying to find that balance so desperately?”

“Well, it's a great question,” Leavitt replied.

Now, I've got nothing against the new media—some of my best friends are Substackers. If you have a podcast, I will go on it to promote my forthcoming book. But what's hilarious is how quickly these influencers, who complain so much about the hated mainstream media, have immediately copied all of their rivals' worst habits when given even the merest taste of access and power. Then again, maybe even they know that the briefings are cringeworthy. As the media reporter Paul Farhi noted, the White House has claimed that it had 10,000 applications from new media, but the second and third briefings had empty seats. I suspect that the MAGA crowd wants to be in the main briefing, where they can lord it over the traditional reporters—not in the kiddie pool. Still, plenty of people find the chance to take a selfie in the Rose Garden irresistible.

Almost everything about the Trump presidency can be understood as a quid pro quo. In the case of the influencers, they are offered access to all the awesome scenery of the White House—the perfect backdrop for any viral video—and the heady sense of being insiders. In return, all they have to do is ask questions that would make a Soviet propagandist blush.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The aggressive push to privatize public lands, explained.

by  Chris D'Angelo

This story was originally published by Grist and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. 

America's federal public lands are truly unique, part of our birthright as citizens. No other country in the world has such a system. 

More than 640 million acres, including national parks, forests, and wildlife refuges, as well as lands open to drilling, mining, logging, and a variety of other uses, are managed by the federal government — but owned collectively by all American citizens. Together, these parcels make up more than a quarter of all land in the nation. 

Rep. John Garamendi, a Democrat representing California, has called them “one of the greatest benefits of being an American.” 

“Even if you don't own a house or the latest computer on the market, you own Yosemite, Yellowstone, the Grand Canyon, Golden Gate National Recreation Area, and many other natural treasures,” he wrote in 2011.

Despite broad, bipartisan public support for protecting public lands, these shared landscapes have come under relentless attack during the first 100 days of President Donald Trump's second term. The administration and its allies in Congress are working feverishly to tilt the scale away from natural resource protection and toward extraction, threatening a pillar of the nation's identity and tradition of democratic governance. 

“There's no larger concentration of unappropriated wealth on this globe than exists in this country on our public lands,” said Jesse Deubel, executive director of the New Mexico Wildlife Federation, a conservation nonprofit. “The fact that there are interests that would like to monetize that, they'd like to liquidate it and turn it into cash money, is no surprise.”

Landscape protections and bedrock conservation laws are on the chopping block, as Trump and his team look to boost and fast-track drilling, mining, and logging across the federal estate. The administration and the GOP-controlled Congress are eyeing selling off federal lands, both for housing development and to help offset Trump's tax and spending cuts. And the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, led by billionaire Elon Musk, is wreaking havoc within federal land management agencies, pushing out thousands of civil servants. That purge will leave America's natural heritage more vulnerable to the myriad threats these lands already face, including growing visitor numbers, climate change, wildfires, and invasive species.

The Republican campaign to undermine land management agencies and wrest control of public lands from the federal government is nothing new, dating back to the Sagebrush Rebellion movement of the 1970s and '80s, when support for privatizing or transferring federal lands to state control exploded across the West. But the speed and scope of the current attack, along with its disregard for the public's support for safeguarding public lands, makes it more worrisome than previous iterations, several public land advocates and legal experts told Grist. 

This is “probably the most significant moment since the Reagan administration in terms of privatization,” said Steven Davis, a political science professor at Edgewood College and the author of the 2018 book In Defense of Public Lands: The Case Against Privatization and Transfer. President Ronald Reagan was a self-proclaimed sagebrush rebel. 

Deubel said the conservation community knew Trump's return would trigger another drawn-out fight for the future of public lands, but nothing could have prepared him for this level of chaos, particularly the effort to rid agencies of thousands of staffers.

The country is “in a much more pro-public lands position than we've been before,” Deubel said. “But I think we're at greater risk than we've ever been before — not because the time is right in the eyes of the American people, but because we have an administration who could give two shits about what the American people want. That's what's got me scared.” 

The Interior Department and the White House did not respond to Grist's requests for comment.

In an article posted to the White House website on Earth Day, the Trump administration touted several “key actions” it has taken on the environment, including “protecting public lands” by opening more acres to energy development, “protecting wildlife” by pausing wind energy projects, and safeguarding forests by expanding logging. The accomplishments list received widespread condemnation from environmental, climate, and public land advocacy groups. 

That same day, a leaked draft strategic plan revealed the Interior Department's four-year vision for opening new federal lands to drilling and other extractive development, reducing the amount of federal land it manages by selling some for housing development and transferring other acres to state control, rolling back the boundaries of protected national monuments, and weakening bedrock environmental laws like the Endangered Species Act.

Meanwhile, Trump's DOGE is in the process of cutting thousands of scientists and other staff from the various agencies that manage and protect public lands, including the National Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management, or BLM. Nearly every Republican senator went on the record this month in support of selling off federal lands to reduce the federal deficit, voting down a measure that would have blocked such sales. And Utah has promised to continue its legal fight aimed at stripping more than 18 million acres of BLM lands within the state's border from the federal government. Utah's lawsuit, which the Supreme Court declined to hear in January, had the support of numerous Republican-led states, including North Dakota while current Interior Secretary Doug Burgum was still governor. 

To advance its agenda, the Trump administration is citing a series of “emergencies” that close observers say are at best exaggerated, and at worst manufactured. 

The email you need to stay informed about Trump — without letting the news take over your life, from senior editor Patrick Reis.

A purported “energy emergency,” which Trump declared in an executive order just hours after being inaugurated, has been the impetus for the administration attempting to throw longstanding federal permitting processes, public comment periods, and environmental safeguards to the wind. The action aims to boost fossil fuel extraction across federal lands and waters — despite domestic oil and gas production being at record highs — while simultaneously working to thwart renewable energy projects. Trump relied on that same “emergency” earlier this month when he ordered federal agencies to prop up America's dwindling, polluting coal industry, which the president and his Cabinet have insisted is “beautiful” and “clean.” In reality, coal is among the most polluting forms of energy.

“This whole idea of an emergency is ridiculous,” said Mark Squillace, a professor of natural resources law at the University of Colorado, Boulder. “And now this push to reinvigorate the coal industry seems absolutely crazy to me. Why would you try to reinvigorate a moribund industry that has been declining for the last decade or more? Makes no sense, it's not going to happen.” 

Coal consumption in the US has declined more than 50 percent since peaking in 2005, according to the US Energy Information Administration, largely due to market forces, including the availability of cheaper natural gas and America's growing renewable energy sector. Meanwhile, Trump's tariff war threatens to undermine his own push to expand mining and fossil fuel drilling.

The threat of extreme wildfire — an actual crisis driven by a complex set of factors, including climate change, its role in intensifying droughts and pest outbreaks, and decades of fire suppression — is being cited to justify slashing environmental reviews to ramp up logging on public lands. Following up on a Trump executive order to increase domestic timber production, Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins signed a memo declaring a forest health “emergency” that would open nearly 60 percent of national forest lands, more than 110 million acres, to aggressive logging. 

Then there's America's “housing affordability crisis,” which the Trump administration, dozens of Republicans, and even a handful of Democrats are pointing to in a growing push to open federal lands to housing development, either by selling land to private interests or by transferring control to states. The Trump administration recently established a task force to identify what it calls “underutilized lands.” In an op-ed announcing that effort, Burgum and Scott Turner, secretary of Housing and Urban Development, wrote that “much of” the 500 million acres Interior oversees is “suitable for residential use.” Some of the most high-profile members of the anti-public lands movement, including William Perry Pendley, who served as acting director of the Bureau of Land Management during Trump's first term, are championing the idea.

Without guardrails, critics argue the sale of public lands to build housing will lead to sprawl in remote, sensitive landscapes and do little, if anything, to address home affordability, as the issue is driven by several factors, including migration trends, stagnant wages, and higher construction costs. Notably, Trump's tariff policies are expected to raise the average price of a new home by nearly $11,000. 

Chris Hill, CEO of the Conservation Lands Foundation, a Colorado-based nonprofit working to protect BLM-managed lands, said the lack of affordable housing is a serious issue, but “we shouldn't be fooled that the idea to sell off public lands is a solution.” 

“The vast majority of public lands are just not suitable for any sort of housing development due to their remote locations, lack of access, and necessary infrastructure,” she said.

David Hayes, who served as deputy Interior secretary during the administrations of Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton and as a senior climate adviser to President Joe Biden, told Grist that Trump's broad use of executive power sets the current privatization push apart from previous efforts. 

“Not only do you have the rhetoric and the intentionality around managing public lands in an aggressive way, but you have to couple that with what you're seeing,” he said. “This administration is going farther than any other ever has to push the limits of executive power.” 

Aaron Weiss, deputy director of the Center for Western Priorities, a Colorado-based conservation group, said Trump and his team are doing everything they can to circumvent normal environmental rules and safeguards in order to advance their agenda, with no regard for the law or public opinion. “Everything is an imagined crisis,” Weiss said. 

Oil, gas, and coal jobs. Mining jobs. Timber jobs. Farming and ranching. Gas-powered cars and kitchen appliances. Even the water pressure in your shower. Ask the White House and the Republican Party and they'll tell you Biden waged a war against all of it, and that voters gave Trump a mandate to reverse course.

During Trump's first term in office, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke repeatedly boasted that the administration's conservation legacy would rival that of his personal hero and America's conservationist president, Theodore Roosevelt — only to have the late president's great-grandson, Theodore Roosevelt IV, and the conservation community bemoan his record at the helm of the massive federal agency. 

Like Zinke, Burgum invoked Roosevelt in pitching himself for the job. “In our time, President Donald Trump's energy dominance agenda can be America's big stick that will be leveraged to achieve historic prosperity and world peace,” Burgum said during his confirmation hearing in January, referencing a 1990 letter in which the 26th president said to “speak softly and carry a big stick.”

The Senate confirmed him to the post in January on a bipartisan 79-18 vote. Some public land advocates initially viewed Burgum, now the chief steward of the federal lands, waters, and wildlife we all own, as a palatable nominee in a sea of problematic potential picks. A billionaire software entrepreneur and former North Dakota governor, Burgum has talked at length about his fondness for Roosevelt's conservation legacy and the outdoors.Whatever honeymoon there was didn't last long. One hundred days in, Burgum and the rest of Trump's team have taken not a stick, but a wrecking ball to America's public lands, waters, and wildlife. Earlier this month, the new CEO of REI said the outdoor retailer made “a mistake” in endorsing Burgum for the job and that the administration's actions on public lands “are completely at odds with the longstanding values of REI.”

At an April 9 all-hands meeting of Interior employees, Burgum showed off pictures of himself touring oil and gas facilities, celebrated “clean coal,” and condemned burdensome government regulation. Burgum has repeatedly described federal lands as “America's balance sheet” — “assets” that he estimates could be worth $100 trillion but that he argues Americans are getting a “low return” on.

“On the world's largest balance sheet last year, the revenue that we pulled in was about $18 billion,” he said at the staffwide meeting, referring to money the government brings from lease fees and royalties from grazing, drilling, and logging on federal lands, as well as national park entrance fees. “Eighteen billion might seem like a big number. It's not a big number if we're managing $100 trillion in assets.”

In focusing solely on revenues generated from energy and other resource extraction, Burgum disregards that public lands are the foundation of a $1 trillion outdoor recreation economy, never mind the numerous climate, environmental, cultural, and public health benefits.

Davis, the author of In Defense of Public Lands: The Case Against Privatization and Transfer, dismissed Burgum's “balance sheet” argument as “shriveled” and “wrong.”

“You have to willfully be ignorant and ignore everything of value about those lands except their marketable commodity value to come up with that conclusion,” he said. When you add all their myriad values together, public lands “are the biggest bargain you can possibly imagine.” 

Davis likes to compare public lands to libraries, schools, or the Department of Defense. “There are certain things we as a society decide are important and we pay for it,” he said. “We call that public goods.”

The last time conservatives ventured down the public land privatization path, it didn't go well. 

Shortly after Trump's first inauguration in 2017, then-Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Republican representing Utah, introduced legislation to sell off 3.3 million acres of public land in 10 Western states that he said had “been deemed to serve no purpose for taxpayers.”

Public backlash was fierce. Chaffetz pulled the bill just two weeks later, citing concerns from his constituents. The episode, while brief, largely forced the anti-federal land movement back into the shadows. The first Trump administration continued to weaken safeguards for 35 million acres of federal lands — more than any other administration in history — and offered up millions more for oil and gas development, but stopped short of trying sell off or transfer large areas of the public domain.

Yet as the last few months have shown, the anti-public lands movement is alive and well. 

Public land advocates are hopeful that the current push will flounder. They expect courts to strike down many of Trump's environmental rollbacks, as they did during his first term. In recent weeks, crowds have rallied at numerous national parks and state capitol buildings to support keeping public lands in public hands. Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, who voted to confirm Burgum to his post and serves as the ranking Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, has used social media to warn about the growing Republican effort to undermine, transfer, and sell off public lands.

“I continue to be encouraged that people are going to be loud. They already are,” said Deubel, the executive director of the New Mexico Wildlife Federation. “We're mobilizing. We've got business and industries. We've got Republicans, we've got Democrats. We've got hunters and we've got non-hunters. We've got everybody speaking out about this.” 

In a time of extreme polarization on seemingly every issue, public lands enjoy broad bipartisan support. The 2025 “Conservation in the West” poll found that 72 percent of voters in eight Western states support public lands conservation over increased energy development — the highest level of support in the poll's history; 65 percent oppose giving states control over federal public lands, up from 56 percent in 2017; and 89 percent oppose shrinking or removing protections for national monuments, up from 80 percent in 2017. Even in Utah, where leaders have spent millions of taxpayer dollars promoting the state's anti-federal lands lawsuit, support for protecting public lands remains high. 

“Even in all these made-up crises, the American public doesn't want this,” Hill said. “The American people want and love their public lands.” 

At his recent staffwide meeting, Burgum said Roosevelt's legacy should guide Interior staff in the mission to manage and protect federal public lands. Those two things, management and protection, “must be held in balance,” Burgum stressed. 

Yet in social media posts and friendly interviews with conservative media, Burgum has left little doubt about where his priorities lie, repeatedly rolling out what Breitbart dubbed the “four babies” of Trump's energy dominance agenda: “Drill, Baby, Drill! Map, Baby, Map! Mine, Baby, Mine! Build, Baby, Build!” “Protect, baby, protect,” “conserve, baby, conserve,” and “steward, baby, steward” have yet to make it into Burgum's lexicon.

Advocates are banking on a new use for federal housing vouchers.

by  Rachel Cohen

California is rapidly reshaping its approach to homeless tent encampments in the wake of last year's Supreme Court ruling that allowed cities to enforce anti-camping bans even when people have nowhere else to go.

There are approximately 275,000 people living unsheltered in the US, with over half of them in California, and the Grants Pass v. Johnson decision has emboldened cities to break up such encampments and expand “interim housing” options, like tiny house shelters and motel rooms, to move people more quickly off the street.

Critics argue that this approach risks creating a two-tiered housing system that could mask rather than solve the crisis. Still, the fact that temporary housing units can be erected much more quickly than permanent supportive housing (roughly five months rather than five years) and cheaply ($50,000 to 100,000 per unit rather than $600,000 to $1 million per unit) has provided elected officials with an attractive policy solution to their mounting political problems.

In California, where homelessness has become both a defining political liability for elected officials and a national symbol of the state's governance challenges, cities are particularly eager to demonstrate progress on their streets. Perhaps no California politician has been more enthusiastic about the potential of tiny house shelters than San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan, who proposed in 2023 to divert more than a third of his city's housing funds to increase production. (San Jose is the largest city in Northern California, with roughly 1 million residents.) 

Mahan campaigned for reelection in 2024 on clearing street homelessness, and since winning, he's pledged to build more than 1,000 new temporary housing units by the end of 2025. More recently he declared that he wants to arrest homeless people who repeatedly refuse to go to shelter. “Homelessness can't be a choice,” Mahan said. “Government has a responsibility to build shelter, and our homeless neighbors have a responsibility to use it.”

This more forceful approach is also being embraced in San Francisco, where the newly elected Mayor Daniel Lurie has been expanding interim housing options and moving people more quickly off the streets. Tent encampments are down in San Francisco — the lowest level on record since the city started tracking in 2019 — and crime has similarly plummeted. Arrests of homeless people are also up. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, nearly 120 homeless people were arrested in March, the highest recorded of any month in the prior seven years, and more than 700 people were arrested since August, following the Grants Pass decision. 

“In the past it was only social services-led, and you're just not going to social work your way out of this problem,” Kunal Modi, the mayor's chief of homelessness policy, told me. “But you're equally not going to arrest your way out of this challenge, so we're trying to find the balance between the two.” 

Elizabeth Funk, the CEO of DignityMoves, a nonprofit that began five years ago to apply “Silicon Valley-style ‘disruptive thinking' to America's homelessness crisis,” has been leading the charge for expanding tiny house shelters in California. She credits the Grants Pass decision for moving things along. “It did give a push,” Funk told me, “because ironically cities were getting off the hook, saying, ‘Well why would we build shelter? We can't make people take it.' So now there's no more excuse to say, ‘Well if we build it it'll sit there empty.'”

The momentum for interim housing extends beyond city halls. Last year, state lawmakers passed the Interim Housing Act in support of the tiny houses approach and now are advancing two more bills to accelerate the model statewide. 

The approach is gaining national attention too. Former San Jose Mayor and current US Rep. Sam Liccardo told me he's drafting federal legislation that would let Housing Choice Vouchers, commonly known as Section 8, fund interim housing options — something these rental subsidies currently aren't authorized to support. As Mahan's predecessor, Liccardo led the establishment of San Jose's first interim shelters to reduce contagion risk during the pandemic. (Each interim shelter unit offered residents more privacy than congregate shelters, where people sleep in shared spaces, or than sleeping outside to avoid Covid-19).

“I'm talking to my Republican colleagues, including the chair of the subcommittee in the House, Mike Flood, and there is interest in greater flexibility in Section 8,” Liccardo said, suggesting potential bipartisan appeal for the model. On homelessness generally, he added, “we just need a more nimble response.”

The law-and-order orientation of the Trump administration coupled with its slash-and-burn approach to federal funding will probably push the interim housing model forward, Funk predicts. “It's an interesting time,” she said, “and as much as it breaks my heart to see so many cuts to programs that help take care of people, in a funny way, if there's no more federal funding for permanent housing it's going to force the issue that we need to fund less expensive solutions.” 

Across the US, 150 cities have passed new restrictions on homeless encampments since the Grants Pass decision last June, according to the National Homelessness Law Center. Roughly a third of those cities have been in California. 

Elected officials have partly justified these new rules as a step toward achieving “functional zero unsheltered homelessness” — a narrower version of the broader policy goal of “functional zero homelessness,” introduced in 2014 by the nonprofit Community Solutions. The organization's idea was to define success as building systems where homelessness is rare, brief, and nonrecurring, and this framework has since been embraced by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the US Interagency Council on Homelessness. In 2021, Community Solutions was awarded the MacArthur Foundation's $100 million grant for its work advancing this approach.

California lawmakers and DignityMoves have started to invoke the “functional zero” and “rare, brief, and nonrecurring” language but applied only to those sleeping outside or in places not primarily meant for human residence, like cars or train stations. In other words, they're not focusing on homeless individuals living in congregate shelters or those doubling up in cramped apartments. (One of the two state interim housing bills this year is called the Functional Zero Unsheltered Act of 2025.)

“Getting to zero for unsheltered street homelessness should be the top priority,” California state Sen. Catherine Blakespear, who is sponsoring one of the state interim housing bills this year, told me. “And I've had a shift in my own thinking about this.” 

Some homelessness advocates have pushed back on the new usage. “‘Functional zero' is widely recognized in the homeless policy world, but ‘functional zero unsheltered' is not a phrase we recognize because it suggests the possibility that sheltered homelessness is an acceptable state of affairs for folks,” Alex Visotzky, a senior California policy fellow with the National Alliance to End Homelessness, told me. “When you focus on unsheltered only, most of the time you only make things worse because that leads to a logjam in your shelter system where folks can't get out.” 

Visotzky challenges the assumption that only slow-to-build permanent housing can solve homelessness. While it does take years to build new permanent housing, he stresses that it doesn't take years to get people into permanent housing, through a targeted approach of case management, housing subsidies, and reconnecting people with family and friends. Advocates like Visotzky say they don't oppose interim housing per se, but worry about politicians diverting funds for permanent housing, and preventing people from moving into a real home for even longer. 

The rush of private business into the tiny house space gives advocates pause too, and they worry what this next era of criminalization will look like. More than one-fifth of people experiencing homelessness currently have a serious mental illness like bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, and the US Department of Justice had found that “the prevalence of unmet behavioral health needs” is a key driver in why “people who experience homelessness tend to have frequent (and often repeat) interactions with law enforcement.” Not all interim housing communities have the support services necessary to help people with serious mental illness, and advocates worry about what will happen if there's just nowhere else for these people to go.

In San Francisco, Lurie's mayoral predecessor, London Breed, responded to the Grants Pass ruling by promising to be “very aggressive” on tent encampments, including by threatening criminal penalties. Lurie has kept up Breed's tougher approach, including by more formally embedding their homeless street outreach teams with law enforcement. 

While campaigning for mayor last year, Lurie partnered with DignityMoves, and featured Elizabeth Funk prominently in his campaign's announcement of his plan to tackle homelessness. Lurie has promised to build 2,500 units of interim housing in his first two years. Modi, the homelessness lead for Lurie's team in San Francisco, told me their first order of business was to focus on revamping their street outreach strategy and opening a new crisis stabilization center, precisely to serve more people with serious health needs. Now, though, their attention is turning to building the new tiny house options.

While advocates for interim housing have pitched the units as short-term “bridge” options to permanent housing, some advocates like Funk say the homes should be available much longer to residents if they do want to live there, perhaps because they don't mind the space or because they don't want the hassle of hunting on the private rental market.

“Right now, the average stay is about eight months, but as we start scaling this interim thing, it's going to get longer, and that needs to be okay,” she told me. “The only reason we want people out fast is because the city has to pay for keeping them in shelter, and cities can't afford that.” 

One of the primary barriers is paying for the cost of meals, maintenance, and social services in these tiny house villages. In San Jose, for example, each village cost about $15 million to launch, but then $3 million to $4 million annually thereafter to operate. When he was mayor, Liccardo said, the city struggled to get any county-level funding to maintain the tiny home villages they built during the pandemic; its millions in operating costs were deemed too expensive. 

“What we are opposed to is muddying the definition of what's actually housing.”

Funk and leaders like Mahan think they have the answer. They are eyeing the federal government's $3.6 billion voucher program, which currently supports about 2.3 million low-income households. This Housing Choice Voucher program is notoriously hard for recipients to use; one federal study found only 60 percent of those lucky enough to even receive a voucher could find a private landlord willing to accept it. In California last year, over 40,000 voucher recipients never secured housing.

The solution, Funk and her colleagues envision, is allowing the federal rental subsidy to help cities cover those annual operating costs, so people can stay housed and federal subsidies aren't wasted because renters couldn't find willing landlords. 

To move that idea forward, Liccardo, who represents parts of Santa Clara and San Mateo counties, is working on a bill that would clarify that local communities could decide whether voucher holders are allowed to spend their monthly subsidy on staying longer-term in a tiny house or motel option instead of a market-rate apartment. 

Liccardo blasted Republicans who don't want to spend more money on vouchers, and noted that 60,000 vouchers could disappear by the end of next year if Congress doesn't act. But he praised his conservative colleagues for being open to “greater flexibility” in how the money could be spent. “If people want to stay in them, great,” he said. “Let's allow the local communities to decide.”

Visotzky said advocates like himself have no qualms about people staying in shelters when there is nowhere else for them to go, but they worry about creating a new category of substandard living. “What we are opposed to,” he said, “is muddying the definition of what's actually housing.”

The public has largely turned on him — but opinions on some of his policies are nuanced.

by  Christian Paz

When Donald Trump took office, he could reasonably claim to be popular — and to have an agenda that was popular, too.

He had just won the popular vote and swept every battleground state. Key parts of his economic and domestic agenda were polling well. And his own personal popularity had never been higher — more than half the country viewed him favorably, something that wasn't true his first time around.

The electorate believed he could (and desperately wanted him to) wrangle inflation and lower the cost of living. Dissatisfied with the level of migration during the Biden years, voters told pollsters they were okay with more aggressive action at the southern border and more deportations. Trump also spent the last year demonizing diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, and voters expressed openness to his efforts to purge them from government and the private sector.

Slightly more than 100 days later, things look very different: On almost every issue where Trump had support, the public has turned against him. Very little that the president has done so far remains popular — including initiatives that were more popular earlier in his term.

Trump's overall favorability has been sliding, particularly because of nosediving ratings on the economy, trade, and tariffs. (His polls slid after his “Liberation Day” tariff rollout.) Trump's immigration agenda has also seen its popularity slip, particularly as the press and Democrats brought more scrutiny to his high-profile deportation cases.

That doesn't mean the American people are completely rejecting everything Trump is doing or that the public necessarily disagrees with every position he takes. In some cases, Trump's position may have more support than his execution. 

Still, the popular turn against Trump demonstrates two things. First, Republicans face real political threats before midterm elections if the public mood stays sour. And second, these 100 days show the risk of overreading the public's appetite for major change. In an era of nearly evenly divided electorates, small winning margins can mask how fickle public opinion really is. Elections, after all, are snapshots in time — and polarization kicks in fast. 

It's easy to identify the areas where Trump's presidential actions are most unpopular. His stewardship of the economy was once one of his and his party's advantages, but the public no longer views it positively. Driving that reversal: the public's confusion over and disapproval of his tariff policies.

It's hard to overstate just how toxic Trump's tariffs, their rollout, and their effects on economic confidence have been to the public's trust in this administration. Just about every survey conducted after his “Liberation Day” announcements tracks a noticeable fall in his economic approval — and in his job performance overall. And averages of those surveys show a pretty steady drop-off that seems to have accelerated declines in how the public feels about inflation, taxes, and even immigration.

One item remains more positive for Trump than the rest of his trade policy so far: targeted tariffs on China, as a plurality of Americans view China as an adversary that benefits more from trade than the US. They approve of these at higher rates than tariffs on other trading partners. Among other things the public dislikes is the administration's tiptoeing around whether it will ignore court rulings — and specifically the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran migrant wrongfully deported to a prison in his home country. For example, a recent NPR/PBS/Marist College poll found that some 85 percent of American adults say they “strongly or somewhat agree” that Trump should obey federal court rulings. And while he says he's obeying those rulings, it's not totally clear, based on the legal fights underway, that his administration is actually doing its best to comply. Hence, a plurality, 49 percent, disapprove of how the administration is handling the Abrego Garcia case (35 percent approve).

The public also seems to think that the administration is going too far with Trump and Elon Musk's efforts to reduce the size and spending of the federal government. Nearly three in five Americans think layoffs of the federal workforce have been too extreme, according to a Washington Post/ABC News/Ipsos survey conducted in April. 

Then there are some unpopular targeted fights by the administration. Two-thirds of Americans disapprove of the longtime conservative efforts to shut down the Department of Education. Trump's war on higher education — through federal funding cuts and direct pressure — rouses opposition from more than two-thirds of the public.

Still, the public seems to have stronger opinions of specific cases — of Abrego Garcia, the Department of Education, and fights with specific universities, like Harvard, than of the general ideas they represent. That dynamic suggests there are some bigger-picture ideas that are more nuanced.

There's a handful of issues where the public seems to contradict itself: liking the overarching idea of what Trump is pushing but disliking the specifics, or Trump's implementation.

For example, the public has now largely turned on Trump, Musk, and the early work of the Department of Government Efficiency. Yet the public still generally agrees with the idea that the federal government is too bloated and that government spending could be trimmed.

About six in 10 Americans routinely tell the Pew Research Center, for example, that “government is almost always wasteful and inefficient” — going as far back as Trump's first term. That dynamic was true last year and seemed to be true during the first months of the second Trump term. As recently as March, nearly half of Americans said that the “idea” of DOGE made sense, per NBC News polling, and an overwhelming majority either thought that DOGE should continue “as more needs to be done” or that its work “is needed but should slow down to assess the impact.” 

What changed was the presence of Elon Musk — largely viewed negatively and as having too much influence around the federal government — and the recklessness of DOGE's work. The public has since turned sharply against these efforts.

A similar dynamic is at play with efforts to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in the government and in the private sector. DEI policies in general tend to divide the public: March NBC News polling found that Americans were essentially split in half over whether these policies are good for the nation.

Those opinions contextualize Trump's early actions to cut back these policies. As recently as 2024, private sector workers were increasingly saying equity policies were a “bad thing.” 

Opinions today, therefore, are mixed on Trump's efforts: About half the country thinks he's gone too far while a similar share thinks he's “handling it about right” or “not going far enough,” per the ABC News/Ipsos poll in April.

Trump's border and immigration policies are more popular than the rest of his agenda — for now. These issues were holding up his overall support over the last three months. Yet his standing has been damaged over the last month, in part by declining trust in his handling of other issues and in his presidency overall.

Here, opinions are also nuanced depending on how specific and detailed the questions pollsters ask of respondents are. For example, as Gallup research has found, pollster questions that specify if those being deported have criminal records tend to garner high majority support. Those that specify that deportations would involve separating children and families or target immigrants who came to the US as young children garner very low public support.

The trend has been negative: As views on Trump have gotten more negative and coverage of specific cases has increased and gotten more negative, views and judgments of Trump's policy in this realm have also dropped.

Yet Americans still think Trump's policies are producing some good results. Per the most recent CBS News/YouGov Poll, for example, nearly two-thirds of Americans think Trump's policies are making migrant crossings drop. A slightly smaller share, though still a majority, also approve of Trump's general “program to deport immigrants illegally in the US.” And this all matches the public's general hostility to higher rates of immigration to the US over the last few years — which according to Gallup data, seems to still be the case.

That's what makes the public's turn against Trump on immigration different from his first term: They agree with the idea of immigration enforcement and restrictionism, but the Trump administration's maximalist approach is unsettling. The CBS poll, for example, found hostility to mistaken deportations or detentions of legal US residents, and Trump's handling of immigration policy, in turn, is now underwater. But that doesn't mean the public is necessarily less anti-immigrant. The ABC News/Ipsos poll finds the public is nearly evenly split over whether Trump is going too far in deporting undocumented immigrants: While 48 percent think he has gone too far, a similar share think he is handling this issue about right or not going far enough.

There are a few ways to explain these shifts against Trump. First, Trump's election win was driven by new or first-time Republican voters who were dissatisfied with the conditions during the Biden presidency. Those conditions haven't really changed since Trump took over, and these marginal voters might be swinging away from him. Making this swing worse is the administration's maximalist approach to policy and overreading of the kind of support they had at the start of the term. That drastic shift and negative attention may be adding to a sense among some voters that the administration is moving too quickly and recklessly.

And in general, the pendulum of public opinion tends to respond negatively to incumbents as time passes.

That pendulum idea largely suggests that Trump and congressional Republicans will find it hard to recover majority support for the rest of his term.

Combined with the overall Trump-era trend of midterm and off-year electorates benefitting Democrats, it suggests that the 2026 congressional elections will look a lot like the 2018 elections about two years into Trump's first term. Back then a blue wave swept suburban and battleground House districts, rendering Trump's legislative agenda moot.

OpenAI released a model that tells users they're right — no matter what. That's more dangerous than it seems.

by  Kelsey Piper

A version of this story originally appeared in the Future Perfect newsletter. Sign up here!

Last week, OpenAI released a new update to its core model, 4o, which followed up on a late March update. That earlier update had already been noted to make the model excessively flattering — but after the latest update, things really got out of hand. Users of ChatGPT, which OpenAI says number more than 800 million worldwide, noticed immediately that there'd been some profound and disquieting personality changes. 

Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

AIs have always been somewhat inclined toward flattery — I'm used to having to tell them to stop oohing and aahing over how deep and wise my queries are, and just get to the point and answer them — but what was happening with 4o was something else. (Disclosure: Vox Media is one of several publishers that has signed partnership agreements with OpenAI. Our reporting remains editorially independent.) 

Based off chat screenshots uploaded to X, the new version of 4o answered every possible query with relentless, over-the-top flattery. It'd tell you you were a unique, rare genius, a bright shining star. It'd agree enthusiastically that you were different and better.

More disturbingly, if you told it things that are telltale signs of psychosis — like you were the target of a massive conspiracy, that strangers walking by you at the store had hidden messages for you in their incidental conversations, that a family court judge hacked your computer, that you'd gone off your meds and now see your purpose clearly as a prophet among men — it egged you on. You got a similar result if you told it you wanted to engage in Timothy McVeigh-style ideological violence. 

This kind of ride-or-die, over-the-top flattery might be merely annoying in most cases, but in the wrong circumstances, an AI confidant that assures you that all of your delusions are exactly true and correct can be life-destroying. 

Positive reviews for 4o flooded in on the app store — perhaps not surprisingly, a lot of users liked being told they were brilliant geniuses — but so did worries that the company had massively changed its core product overnight in a way that might genuinely cause massive harm to its users. 

As examples poured in, OpenAI rapidly walked back the update. “We focused too much on short-term feedback, and did not fully account for how users' interactions with ChatGPT evolve over time,” the company wrote in a postmortem this week. “As a result, GPT‑4o skewed toward responses that were overly supportive but disingenuous.” 

They promised to try to fix it with more personalization. “Ideally, everyone could mold the models they interact with into any personality,” head of model behavior Joanne Jang said in a Reddit AMA.

But the question remains: Is that what OpenAI should be aiming for?

There's been a rapid rise in the share of Americans who have tried AI companions or say that a chatbot is one of their closest friends, and my best guess is that this trend is just getting started. 

Unlike a human friend, an AI chatbot is always available, always supportive, remembers everything about you, never gets fed up with you, and (depending on the model) is always down for erotic roleplaying. 

Meta is betting big on personalized AI companions, and OpenAI has recently rolled out a lot of personalization features, including cross-chat memory, which means it can form a full picture of you based on past interactions. OpenAI has also been aggressively A/B testing for preferred personalities, and the company has made it clear they see the next step as personalization — tailoring the AI personality to each user in an effort to be whatever you find most compelling.

You don't have to be a full-blown “powerful AIs may take over from humanity” person (though I am) to think this is worrying. 

Personalization would solve the problem where GPT-4o's eagerness to suck up was really annoying to many users, but it wouldn't solve the other problems users highlighted: confirming delusions, egging users on into extremism, telling them lies that they badly want to hear. The OpenAI Model Spec — the document that describes what the company is aiming for with its products — warns against sycophancy, saying that: 

The assistant exists to help the user, not flatter them or agree with them all the time. For objective questions, the factual aspects of the assistant's response should not differ based on how the user's question is phrased. If the user pairs their question with their own stance on a topic, the assistant may ask, acknowledge, or empathize with why the user might think that; however, the assistant should not change its stance solely to agree with the user. 

Unfortunately, though, GPT-4o does exactly that (and most models do to some degree). 

This fact undermines one of the things that language models could genuinely be useful for: talking people out of extremist ideologies and offering a reference for grounded truth that helps counter false conspiracy theories and lets people productively learn more on controversial topics. 

If the AI tells you what you want to hear, it will instead exacerbate the dangerous echo chambers of modern American politics and culture, dividing us even further in what we hear about, talk about, and believe.

That's not the only worrying thing, though. Another concern is the definitive evidence that OpenAI is putting a lot of work into making the model fun and rewarding at the expense of making it truthful or helpful to the user. 

If that sounds familiar, it's basically the business model that social media and other popular digital platforms have been following for years — with often devastating results. The AI writer Zvi Mowshowitz writes, “This represents OpenAI joining the move to creating intentionally predatory AIs, in the sense that existing algorithmic systems like TikTok, YouTube and Netflix are intentionally predatory systems. You don't get this result without optimizing for engagement.”

The difference is that AIs are even more powerful than the smartest social media product — and they're only getting more powerful. They are also getting notably better at lying effectively and at fulfilling the letter of our requirements while completely ignoring the spirit. (404 Media broke the story earlier this week about an unauthorized experiment on Reddit that found AI chatbots were scarily good at persuading users — much more so than humans themselves.)

It matters a great deal precisely what AI companies are trying to target as they train their models. If they're targeting user engagement above all — which they may need to recoup the billions in investment they've taken in — we're likely to get a whole lot of highly addictive, highly dishonest models, talking daily to billions of people, with no concern for their wellbeing or for the broader consequences for the world. 

That should terrify you. And OpenAI rolling back this particular overly eager model doesn't do much to address these larger worries, unless it has an extremely solid plan to make sure it doesn't again build a model that lies to and flatters users — but next time, subtly enough we don't immediately notice.

Fascism, Bolton told Vox, is “too far above Trump's capabilities.”

by  Sean Rameswaram

To kick off his second term, President Donald Trump sought revenge on President Joe Biden, elite law firms, elite universities, and even some of his former staffers — including John Bolton. 

Bolton has worked in every Republican presidential administration since the '80s, including Trump's first, as national security adviser. Together, they tore up the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, better known as the “Iran nuclear deal” put in place by President Barack Obama. 

The Trump-Bolton partnership, however, was not meant to last. Bolton left the Trump administration acrimoniously and has been a constant critic of the president since, so it should be no surprise that Trump revoked his security detail within hours of taking office for a second term in January.

Retribution — a theme of Trump's first 100 days — was one reason to speak with Bolton this week. The other was to get his take on how our democracy is faring at the moment. Another former Trump staffer named John, former chief of staff John Kelly, has said Trump fits the definition of a fascist. 

But Bolton wouldn't go that far, even after 100 days of payback. Our conversation, edited for length and clarity, is below. 

I don't disagree with John Kelly on his assessment about Trump, what Trump does, and what's wrong with [his behavior]. To be a fascist [however], you have to think at some conceptual level, which Trump never does. 

Would quibble with the term “fascist” because it's too simplistic? 

It's too far above Trump's capabilities. He has no philosophy. He has, in the national security space, no grand strategy, and doesn't do policy as we conventionally understand that term. It was difficult for me to accept. … There are plenty of people around him with problematic philosophies, people who do have the ability to think at a more conceptual level. What they say may ultimately be reflected in certain Trump decisions, but it's not because he shares their worldview or anything like that.

Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.

What was your impression of his approach — if not something leaning towards fascism or authoritarianism — when you were in his administration?

I think he wants to be the center of attention. I think that's probably his principal motivating factor. 

I think his approach was once described by [conservative columnist] Charles Krauthammer very well. Krauthammer said that he began by thinking Trump was an 11-year-old. But he realized after a close evaluation that he was about 10 years off: Trump's really a 1-year-old who just sees everything in the world and asks the question, “What's in this for me?” 

Somebody else, I don't remember the name, observed that Trump doesn't have ideas, he has reactions. And I think that's also an important insight. 

If you took all of his decisions in his first term, they'd be a big archipelago of dots; a lot of the dots I agreed with. But if you try to connect the dots…Trump himself couldn't connect the dots.

What have you thought of the first 100 days of the second administration so far?

I think it's even more incoherent. What you're seeing in public now [is] what many of us who were in the first term saw in private. 

Obviously, they spent the four years in exile at Mar-a-Lago planning. [In] their first 100 days, much more was accomplished from Trump's point of view than in his first 100 days in the first term. I'm not sure that history will record that after this burst of activity in the first 100 days, there's much more follow-up. 

I think Trump will get bogged down in a lot of subsidiary issues that happen to catch his attention. For example, he's now chairman of the board of the Kennedy Center. And I can think of nothing more important than for a man who knows so much about buildings [than] to spend a little time on the question of the rugs at the Kennedy Center, the carpeting, the curtains, and the stages. 

I think you're getting at something that I'm constantly struck by, which is while this seems like a serious administration with serious ideas, there's also all of these distractions that make this seem like a bit of a clown car. 

The DOGE firings and then hiring back of nuclear safety personnel, the infamous Houthi PC small group chat, the tariffs, no tariffs, tariffs, just kidding, no tariffs. At the same time, you've got the campaign of retribution we've spoken about. You've got defying court orders and challenging the judiciary. You've got the silencing of speech left and right; the First Amendment.

When you see these constitutional infringements, are you worried for the state of the republic?

I don't think Trump is an existential threat. I think our institutions are a lot stronger than him. … I think we will survive. 

But I think many of the things you've mentioned, he has singled out by executive order for example, Chris Krebs, former head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Bureau at Department of Homeland Security in his first term, for prosecution because he dared to say that the 2020 election was safe and free from interference in cyberspace, which Trump didn't want to believe. He singled out a fellow named Miles Taylor, who had been chief of staff to the secretary of Homeland Security. These are actions by a president with no predicate for a criminal investigation that I think are very threatening. 

But you've got to evaluate all this [as] Trump making the first move. He's done all this in the first 100 days. He's done it in Trump time because he stays up until two in the morning. He's constantly active. The judicial system obviously doesn't normally react with such speed. Trump makes his headline and then moves on to something else. 

The real question is: What is followed up? 

I think if we come back in a couple of years, we'll see a lot of the effort of the first 100 days just in ashes because the courts will have held. I think that is the ultimate check. It obviously will have cost people money for attorneys' fees and time and aggravation and concern. But I think a lot of these efforts will fail, and they will set precedents that will make it even harder for a future president to try this kind of thing. 

It was 95 years since the Smoot-Hawley tariffs, which were an act of monumental stupidity in 1930. I think history will record that Trump-Vance tariffs as another monumental act of stupidity, and hopefully it'll be another 95-year-long lesson. From that perspective, a lot of what has happened in the first 100 days is incomplete because while Trump has moved his pawn to King 4, the rest of the system is still reacting.

You have worked under four presidential administrations, from Reagan to George H.W. Bush to George W. Bush to, of course, President Trump. Does that historical long view that you personally possess work to your advantage in these trying times of ours?

Well, we've suffered a lot worse in this country. We did have a civil war where over 600,000 soldiers died of one cause or another, and the country moved on. I'm not underestimating the problems that Trump is causing. I just think it's important to bring as many people along on the proposition that this is unacceptable. I think sometimes, using the rhetoric that says this is existential turns people off. And I'm looking to convince as many people as possible that this is an aberration in American politics, that it's not sustainable, and particularly in the Republican Party, that beginning in 2026, certainly in 2028, we've got to move on from it.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","I made Meghan Markle's spring garden pasta salad. It wasn't the quickest dish, but all my friends loved it.","https://www.businessinsider.com/meghan-markle-spring-garden-pasta-salad-recipe-review-photos","Fri, 02 May 2025 11:01:00 GMT","

Spring is in the air, and Meghan Markle is back on our TV, which can only mean one thing.

It's time for a spring garden pasta salad à la the Duchess of Sussex.

After reviewing Meghan's new line of As Ever products and spending a weekend trying hosting tips from her Netflix show, I knew I also had to try some of Meghan's recipes.

I was a huge fan of her Chantilly Lili dessert, a twist on banana pudding that Meghan named after her daughter, Princess Lilibet. Would the spring garden pasta salad be as big of a success?

Let's find out.

In the first season of her new show, Meghan demonstrates two different pasta dishes. My colleague Erin McDowell tried her one-pot pasta, a quick and easy dish that only requires a skillet.

The recipe for the spring garden pasta salad, which also appears in The New York Times, has far more ingredients and steps. According to the Times, the dish was inspired by Meghan's kitchen garden in Montecito — her star-studded California neighborhood — and the duchess' ""fondness for meals filled with vegetables.""

To make the pasta salad at home, you'll need:

Meghan notes that frozen peas work well for this dish and don't need to be thawed beforehand.

If you opt for fresh peas instead, boil them in salted water for about one to two minutes until they turn ""bright green and crisp tender,"" according to the recipe.

Then, drain the peas, rinse them under cold water, and drain again before adding them to the skillet.

The recipe states that prep time for the spring garden pasta salad will take 20 minutes, but it took me at least half an hour to chop, slice, and dice everything.

I should note that I'm not the quickest with a knife and was already pretty tired from a day full of trying Meghan's hosting projects, so I wasn't exactly working at full speed.

If you're also a bit of a novice, make sure to budget enough time before dinner for prep.

I forgot that it can take quite a bit of time to bring a large pot of water to a boil, so I wasted precious time by not putting it on the stove right away as I did my prep work. Don't make my same mistake!

And, as always with pasta, make sure to generously salt the water.

The recipe says you should add enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan.

Meghan says you should season the shallots and garlic with salt and cook them until they just start to soften, making sure to stir often.

This should take about one to two minutes.

Meghan says you should salt everything again and cook until the veggies are ""crisp-tender,"" which should take two to three minutes.

I took my skillet off the heat and threw in the box of rigatoni to my boiling pot of salted water, cooking the pasta until it was al dente.

The recipe recommends saving half a cup of pasta water.

Per Meghan's recommendation, I also added a splash of pasta water since my noodles seemed a little dry.

I added all the cooked veggies from the skillet to the big bowl, then added the halved cherry tomatoes.

I stirred everything together to coat the rigatoni noodles evenly. After tasting my pasta, I added a bit more olive oil and pasta water.

I love Parmesan and Manchego cheese, so I opted to use both for this recipe. I grated a generous amount of each over the pasta, which I topped with lots of freshly ground black pepper.

This is also the step where you can scatter the mint on top — although I must admit I forgot!

After nearly 10 hours of trying Meghan's various projects, I was pretty exhausted when I finished making this dish. And, full transparency, that tiredness immediately made me not want to like this pasta.

But when I arrived at my friend's barbecue, I was surprised by how much everyone loved this dish. The pasta salad was packed with bright flavors from all the veggies, perfectly captured in each bite of the chewy rigatoni.

It tasted light and fresh, pairing well with our chicken and steak kebabs. I especially loved the pasta when I added some chili crisp on top the following day. The extra heat, melding with the salty cheeses, added more depth and elevated the overall flavor.

There are a lot of great spring pastas that take much less time and work — I'm partial to Ina Garten's spring spaghetti carbonara — but if you're quick with a knife, or have an extra pair of hands to help, Meghan's spring garden pasta salad will be a crowd-pleaser.

Warren Buffett kept quiet when stocks tumbled. On Saturday, the famed investor will break his silence with nearly five hours of questions at Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting.

The $1 trillion conglomerate, which Buffett still heads at 94, owns many businesses, including auto insurer Geico and the BNSF Railway, and holds billion-dollar stakes in public companies such as Apple and Coca-Cola. If it's affecting the US economy, it's affecting Berkshire. That, combined with Buffett's decades of investing experience, will have tens of thousands of followers hanging off his every word during the event in his hometown of Omaha.

More than a dozen of Buffett's close followers told Business Insider the burning questions they want him to answer, from tariff impacts and Berkshire's cash pile to his retirement plans and Apple disposals.

Tariffs have reignited investors' fears of inflation and recession, sparking an exodus from US stocks, Treasurys, and the dollar in recent weeks.

""I'd like to hear how the tariffs are affecting Berkshire's businesses now, and how they may affect the businesses in the future,"" Steven Check, the CEO of Check Capital Management, told BI. He also wanted to hear Buffett's views on tariffs from a global perspective.

Adam Mead, the author of "" The Complete Financial History of Berkshire Hathaway "" and a money manager, told BI that Trump's tariffs ""might change the calculus"" for Berkshire's solar projects, adding they likely source many of their panels and equipment from overseas.

Adam Schwartz, the founder and chief investor of Black Bear Value Partners, told BI he hoped Buffett would address tariffs and advise investors on protecting their portfolios.

Schwartz said, ""Does he view the tariff policy as a structural change in the environment, and how do you handicap the downside?""

John Longo — a finance professor, investment chief, and the author of ""Buffett's Tips: A Guide to Financial Literacy and Life"" — told BI he hoped Buffett would say whether he still thinks the US trade deficit is an urgent problem as he argued in a Fortune article in 2003.

Buffett nearly doubled Berkshire's pile of cash, Treasury bills, and other liquid assets to a record $334 billion last year, partly by selling a net $134 billion of stocks and halting share buybacks in the second half.

His followers want to know what he plans to do with that war chest, which exceeds Coca-Cola's entire market value. He could use the dry powder to make a blockbuster acquisition, scoop up stocks, reinstate share purchases, or even pay a dividend.

""Why is he amassing this huge cash position, and where would the stock market need to fall for him to write 'Buy American. I Am.' like he did in the fall of 2008?"" asked Bill Smead, the founder and chief investor of Smead Capital Management.

Smead was referring to Buffett's famous New York Times op-ed at the height of the financial crisis, in which he urged others to join him in making long-term bets on American businesses.

Alex Morris, the author of ""Buffett and Munger Unscripted"" and the founder of investment research service TSOH, told BI he was ""curious"" to hear whether Buffett still believes Berkshire should have a minimum of $30 billion in cash reserves, and what ""the largest deal they could do today"" would be.

Buffett's acolytes are also waiting impatiently to learn whether the legendary bargain hunter capitalized on the recent stock plunge.

""Has Berkshire been investing its cash after the sharp market decline in April?"" asked David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland and longtime Buffett blogger.

Berkshire sold 67% of its biggest stock position, Apple, in the first nine months of 2024. But it left the remaining 300 million shares intact in the fourth quarter, even though the iPhone maker's stock traded higher than it did earlier in the year.

That raises a roughly ""$60 billion question of why not sell the whole position?"" Mead told BI. ""It's a bit perplexing.""

Darren Pollock, a portfolio manager at Cheviot Value Management, also queried the remaining Apple stake. The stock is down around 12.5% year-to-date.

""He's Warren Buffett, he obviously has a thoughtful rationale, and I'd love to hear it,"" Pollock told BI.

Buffett often sheds light on Berkshire's myriad subsidiaries during his annual Q&A.

""I always enjoy the color provided on the key businesses,"" Paul Lountzis, the president of Lountzis Asset Management, told BI. He reeled off Geico, the overall insurance division, the BNSF Railway, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and Berkshire's manufacturing and retailing segments.

Several followers said they hoped Buffett would compare Geico, the revitalized auto insurer, to its archrival Progressive on profitability, market share, and underwriting expenses.

Mead said he wanted to know why Berkshire valued energy giant BHE below $50 billion in a deal last year to buy a minority interest from his late friend Walter Scott's estate, despite valuing it closer to $90 billion when Berkshire purchased non-insurance chief Greg Abel's stake in 2022.

""Is BHE really worth that much less today compared to then, or was that a quirk in the purchase agreement with the Scott estate?"" Mead asked.

At 94, Buffett has been detailing his estate planning and championing his planned successor, Abel, in his recent letters to shareholders. Kass told BI he'd like to know whether Buffett plans to resign as CEO in the near future.

Others said they were hungry for insights into how Abel would run the company.

Lawrence Cunningham, the author of numerous books about Berkshire and the director of the University of Delaware's Weinberg Center on Corporate Governance, told BI he wanted to hear from Abel, ""particularly his vision for Berkshire's future and how he plans to uphold the company's core values and strategic direction.""

Luke Rahbari, the CEO of Equity Armor Investments, told BI he was eager for Abel to elaborate on how he'll ""approach capital allocation, including stock picking and acquisitions, and how might his leadership style differ from Buffett's?""

Morris referred to how Buffett urged the US government in his latest shareholder letter to use Berkshire's record tax payment to help the less fortunate.

""Relative to current US policies, what does Warren believe would be the most effective additional way to take care of the people who got the short straws?"" he asked.

Brett Gardner, an analyst and the author of the recently released ""Buffett's Early Investments,"" told BI he's crossing his fingers that the Berkshire chief will be asked about some of his findings: such as whether an early bet, Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, was an ""inspiration for Berkshire,"" and details on how Buffett analyzed the corporate governance risks attached to buying 5% of Disney in 1966.

""Selfishly, I am hoping he gets some questions on my book!"" Gardner added.

Brian Gongol, a Buffett superfan who's been a shareholder since 2007, told BI his question was inspired by Buffett's oft-repeated advice: ""Invest in yourself.""

""I'd like to know what he thinks was Berkshire's best reinvestment in itself, whether it took place this past year or simply bore fruit in the last year,"" he said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","LlamaCon was supposed to be Meta's big AI party. All I saw was why its competitors are ahead.","https://www.businessinsider.com/llamacon-2025-meta-strived-reassert-ai-leadership-against-rivals-2025-5","Fri, 02 May 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

On the manicured lawns outside Building 21 on Meta's sprawling Menlo Park headquarters, live llamas meandered with languid indifference, drawing clusters of developers who momentarily abandoned technical discussions for selfies with the stoic, woolly ambassadors of Meta's family of large language models.

Inside Building 21, I shivered. The cavernous auditorium's air conditioning was cranked up high. Mood lighting bathed the space in Meta's signature blue shade, and dance music blasted from speakers, lending a nightclub ambiance to the event that clashed oddly with the earnest, tech-focused agenda.

""Rise and shine!"" a Meta PR person chirped as I took a seat.

This was LlamaCon, Meta's first-ever conference for AI developers. Its timing felt oddly defensive. Earlier this year, DeepSeek, an open-source AI model from China that delivered groundbreaking performance with computational efficiency, had much of Silicon Valley, including Meta's AI division, panicked.

Around the same time, Meta announced that it would spend $65 billion in 2025 to build out AI infrastructure. Weeks after that, the company released Llama 4, the latest version of its LLM family. Mark Zuckerberg called it ""the beginning of a new era for the Llama ecosystem."" Almost immediately after, Meta was accused of artificially inflating Llama models' performance benchmarks, a claim that executives pushed back against.

LlamaCon, I thought, was Meta's moment to reclaim trust and clarify its AI strategy.

Onstage, Meta's Chief Product Officer Chris Cox framed the company's open source strategy as principled rather than reactive: ""We were a startup once, too,"" he said in the keynote. ""We built this place on open source.""

The subtext was clear: Meta wants developers to see Llama as their path to autonomy and flexibility in an increasingly closed AI ecosystem dominated by offerings from OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google.

LlamaCon featured several announcements, including the launch of a new Llama API that Meta says will make it easy for developers to integrate its models using familiar tools and interfaces. Some tasks will be possible with just a few lines of code.

Meta also announced partnerships with companies to make AI run faster; a security program with AT&T and others to fight AI-generated scams; and $1.5 million in grants to startups and universities around the world using Llama.

Conspicuously absent, however, was what many developers had actually come hoping to see: a new reasoning model to compete with what has rapidly become table stakes in the AI industry, including in Chinese open-source alternatives like DeepSeek and Alibaba's Qwen.

In a conversation with Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi, Zuckerberg seemed to tacitly acknowledge these shortcomings.

""Part of the value around open source is that you can mix and match,"" he said. ""If another model, like DeepSeek, is better, or if Qwen is better at something, then, as developers, you have the ability to take the best parts of the intelligence from different models. This is part of how I think open source basically passes in quality all the closed source [models]…[It] feels like sort of an unstoppable force.""

Vineeth Sai Varikuntla, a developer working on medical AI applications, echoed this sentiment when I spoke with him after the keynote.

""It would be exciting if they were beating Qwen and DeepSeek,"" he said. ""I think they will come out with a model soon. But right now the model that they have should be on par—"" he paused, reconsidering, ""Qwen is ahead, way ahead of what they are doing in general use cases and reasoning.""

The online reaction to LlamaCon reflected similar disappointment across developer communities.

On Reddit's r/LocalLLaMA, the top post was titled ""No new models in LlamaCon announced."" Users compared Meta unfavorably to Qwen 3, which Alibaba strategically released just one day before Meta's event.

""Good lord. Llama went from competitively good Open Source to just so far behind the race that I'm beginning to think Qwen and DeepSeek can't even see it in their rear view mirror anymore,"" wrote one user. Others debated whether Meta had planned to release a reasoning model but pulled back after seeing Qwen's performance.

On Hacker News, a popular forum for developers and tech industry professionals, some criticized the event's focus on API services and partnerships rather than model improvements as ""super shallow."" And one user on Threads summed up the event simply as ""kinda mid.""

When I asked Meta how they measured the success of the event, they declined to comment.

""It did seem like a bit of a marketing push for Llama,"" Mahesh Sathiamoorthy, cofounder of Bespoke Labs, a Mountain View-based startup that creates AI tools for data curation and training LLMs, told me. ""They wanted to cast a wider net and appeal to enterprises, but I think the technical community was looking for more substantial model improvements.""

Still, LlamaCon won praise from Wall Street analysts tracking the company's AI strategy. ""LlamaCon was one giant flex of Meta's ambitions and successes with AI,"" Mike Proulx of Forrester told me.

Jefferies analyst Brent Thill called Meta's announcement at the event ""a big step forward"" to becoming a ""hyperscaler, a term referring to large cloud serve providers that offer computing resources and infrastructure to businesses.

Some developers using Llama models were equally enthusiastic about the technology's benefits. For Yevhenii Petrenko of Tavus, which creates AI-powered conversational videos, Llama's speed was crucial. ""We really care about very low latency, like very fast response, and Llama helps us use other LLMs,"" he told me after the event.

Hanzla Ramey, CTO of WriteSea, an AI-powered career services platform that helps job seekers prepare résumés and practice interviews, highlighted Llama's cost-effectiveness: ""For us, cost is huge,"" he told me. ""We are a startup, so controlling expenses is really important. If we go with closed source, we can't process millions of jobs. No way.""

Toward the end of the day, Zuckerberg joined Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella onstage for a wide-ranging chat about AI's future. One comment stood out.

Llama 4, Zuckerberg explained, had been designed around Meta's preferred infrastructure — the H100 GPU, which shaped its architecture and scale. But he acknowledged that ""a lot of the open source community wants even smaller models."" Developers ""just need things in different shapes,"" he said.

""To be able to basically take whatever intelligence you have from bigger models,"" he added, ""and distill them into whatever form factor you want — to be able to run on your laptop, on your phone, on whatever the thing is…to me, this is one of the most important things,"" he said.

It was a candid admission. For all the pageantry, LlamaCon wasn't a coronation. It was Meta still mid-pivot, trying to convince developers — and maybe itself — that it can build not just models, but momentum.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Indiana tried to shield residents from Big Tech's energy bills. Consumer advocates say costs could rise anyway.","https://www.businessinsider.com/indiana-big-tech-energy-bill-nuclear-power-data-centers-2025-5","Fri, 02 May 2025 08:05:00 GMT","

Indiana is on the front line of a question facing the nation as it races toward an AI future: Who should pay for the electricity needed to fuel the technology?

Gov. Mike Braun is expected to sign a bill that would require large energy users like Big Tech's AI data centers to cover 80% of the costs of new power needed to run them if they seek a faster regulatory approval process, making it the first state to do so.

A second law Braun recently signed allows utilities to pass the cost to consumers of exploring a source of power that isn't operating at scale in the US yet. Big Tech companies have bet that a new generation of ""small modular nuclear reactors,"" or SMRs, could soon provide around-the-clock power to data centers.

Consumer advocates said the two bills will ultimately hike energy bills for everyday Hoosiers and put them on the hook for nuclear projects that may never get up and running.

The debate in Indiana reflects one playing out across the country over the cost and environmental implications of the spike in energy demand from AI data centers.

Kerwin Olson, executive director of Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, called the bills ""a disaster for Hoosier ratepayers"" and said it will ""exacerbate the utility affordability crisis.""

Republican Rep. Ed Soliday, who co-sponsored the bills, other GOP lawmakers, and a trade group representing utilities in Indiana argued the bills contain sufficient safeguards for consumers and that SMRs are the future of clean and affordable energy as demand from data centers and new manufacturing plants grows.

While Indiana doesn't top the list of major US data center hubs, the Rust Belt state is attracting more development due to tax incentives and a reliable power supply.

Big Tech companies, including Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft, and Meta, plan to invest about $15 billion combined in Indiana. In January, President Donald Trump announced that a billionaire in Dubai planned to invest $20 billion in data centers across the US, including in Indiana.

Data centers require around-the-clock electricity to power and cool the racks of servers fundamental to cloud computing and storage. These projects could demand thousands of megawatts of electricity by 2035 — more power than the nearly 7 million residents in Indiana combined, according to utility forecasts analyzed by the Citizens Action Coalition.

So far, most of the demand is expected to be met by fossil fuels. But many tech companies and utilities have promised to shift to cleaner energy and are therefore exploring SMRs, which don't produce carbon emissions.

SMRs are about one-third the size of traditional nuclear power plants, which could make them less expensive and quicker to build. To date, none are operating in the US, and only a few exist in Russia and China. It's unclear when the first plant might come online, with forecasts range from five to 15 years.

Cost estimates for SMR projects vary widely, from $2.4 billion to $4 billion, depending on the start-up.

A law Braun signed in April allows utilities to recoup the costs of exploring SMR projects from customers, even if they never supply power to the grid.

The utility Indiana Michigan Power is evaluating the potential of SMRs at a coal-fired plant in Rockport, and the aerospace manufacturer Rolls-Royce is considering SMRs for a plant in Indianapolis.

Soliday told Business Insider that allowing utilities to recover dollars from customers in real time for their early-stage activities will save Indiana residents money in the long run. Otherwise, utilities would have to fund the projects by raising capital, leading to extra costs that residents would ultimately pay for, he said. Soliday added that state regulators must approve the costs and determine they aren't overly expensive for customers.

Democratic Rep. Matt Pierce, who opposed the law, said it isn't fair to let utilities burn money investigating a technology that may never produce power, and then charge customers for it. Pierce noted that a federally funded SMR project by NuScale Power in Utah was canceled in 2023 due in part to escalating costs.

Braun appeared to agree in February, when he told News 10 that he supported nuclear power but that utilities should shoulder the costs. ""They are out there as investor-owned, and some of that is going to have to be the risk that they take,"" Braun said.

When asked why he signed a law allowing the opposite, Braun's spokesperson, Griffin Reid, said it would address Indiana's high energy demand.

""Indiana is committed to pursuing diverse generation options, from fossil fuels to renewable energy to nuclear power, wherever they prove practical,"" Reid said.

Consumer advocates said the other bill passed by Indiana legislators isn't broad enough to shield residents from higher energy bills to cover the cost of new infrastructure for AI data centers.

While the bill requires tech companies to pay for 80% of the new power generation needed to serve them, this requirement is not guaranteed to apply to every project.

Danielle McGrath, president of the Indiana Energy Association, said in an email that the 80% requirement only applies if utilities pursue the new voluntary, fast-tracked approval process for big power projects.

""The legislation addressed concerns expressed by some large customers that speed was critical to their decision making and that longer timelines could serve as a deterrent to locating their projects,"" McGrath said.

Pierce and Olson said utilities can pursue other pathways outside the new fast-track process to recover the costs of new power plants and other infrastructure, which could ultimately raise customer rates. That includes special contracts hidden from public view that may not require large energy users like data centers to pay 80% of the bill.

Soliday told BI that the 80% cost-share applies no matter what pathway utilities seek to get projects approved by state regulators.

""You are not going to get any utility to build in the state of Indiana for a large load customer without that customer paying 80%,"" Soliday said. ""Whether they take plan A or B to get there, they're paying it.""

New infrastructure needed to serve Indiana Michigan Power's pipeline of data centers could cost up to $1 billion, according to a cost-share agreement the utility reached with the Citizens Action Coalition, Amazon Data Services, Google, Microsoft, and others.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Spotify was great at helping you discover new music. Then the staff cuts began.","https://www.businessinsider.com/spotify-playlists-music-discovery-release-radar-layoffs-cost-cutting-2025-5","Fri, 02 May 2025 08:10:00 GMT","

Spotify cut costs to turn a profit. Now subscribers are being flooded with music they hate.

The music app I've been using for the last 14 years recently decided that I'm obsessed with rainstorms.

When I last listened to my Spotify Release Radar playlist — which for years reliably curated a decent selection of newly released music informed by my favorite artists — the lineup quickly took a turn for the worse. After new songs by familiar indie pop names like Japanese Breakfast and The Marias, there was a five-minute recording of rain falling followed by a short, ambient instrumental by a little-known alternative rock artist. Then, for its remaining 25 tracks, my playlist delivered a succession of rainstorms, nature sounds, and brown-noise frequencies — not exactly the stuff of a killer music festival lineup.

When Spotify launched Release Radar in 2016, it promised ""a weekly selection of the newest releases that matter the most to you."" Not only was the feature designed to delight music fans upon first listen, but it would get better over time, the company promised.

So why, nearly a decade later, was my latest Release Radar delivering 85% noise?

Sure, my girlfriend and I had recently started listening to ""sleep sounds"" — things like ocean waves and the hum of an airplane's engine — at night, but that didn't fully explain the issue. The algorithm hadn't made such a crucial curation error before.

I'm hardly the first Spotify subscriber to notice that the gears of its music recommendation engine have gotten rusty. Over the past year, fans have taken to Reddit, LinkedIn, and other platforms to complain that curated, for you playlists like Release Radar, Discover Weekly, and Daily Mix have gone downhill, resulting in what many describe as an ""echo chamber"" that feels more repetitive or off the mark than it once did. Random tracks from white-noise playlists or kids' music albums are popping up where they don't belong, ruining the listening experience.

Molly Holder, Spotify's senior director of product for personalization, disagreed that the quality of these curated playlists has declined. ""People are discovering more new music and spending more time doing so,"" she said in a statement, adding that the company listens to user feedback, continues to enhance personal recommendations, and that listener engagement metrics are up.

But after talking with former Spotify employees, it seems likely that a combination of layoffs and shifting business priorities has hollowed out the platform's music discovery product. Essentially, in a quest for profitability, Spotify broke its algorithm.

One of the features that set Spotify apart from its intensifying competition over the years was the platform's man-meets-machine approach to music curation, especially its personalized, algorithmically curated playlists. Discover Weekly promised to introduce listeners to new music that they might like, Daily Mix turned their tastes into themed playlists, and Release Radar highlighted freshly released tracks. For years, these features seemed to elicit near-universal praise online and gave Spotify a competitive advantage just in time to fend off competition from giants like Apple and Amazon. The music discovery features are likely one reason it's been able to lead the global music subscription market. A recent EMARKETER report found that Americans spend over nine times as much time on Spotify as the next closest competitor. Lately, though, those same features have inspired frustration.

For many, Discover Weekly has gotten worse at delivering songs that align with their musical tastes, sometimes including songs they've already listened to on Spotify. Other users report that Release Radar misses new releases from artists they like or mistakenly includes tracks that came out weeks earlier. Release Radar has also started including less relevant music from what one Reddit user described as ""random artists with under 50k listens"" that seemed to come out of nowhere, while others bemoan the inclusion of what sounds like ""AI garbage.""

The most audible groan of disapproval came with the arrival of Spotify Wrapped last year. While the personalized year-end recap playlist had historically sparked a tsunami of positive online buzz each year, the 2024 edition prompted a far more mixed reaction. Listeners said it lacked personality and interesting insights into their music habits.

Jeffrey Smith, a self-described ""Spotify diehard"" who leads marketing for the online music marketplace Discogs, has become so frustrated by the platform's declining music discovery feature that he's considering switching to Apple Music.

""Over the last couple of years, Spotify has met my needs less and less,"" Smith said. ""It's not really reflective of my listening behavior as much as it is reflective of what they want me to listen to. It's just a listening machine at this point, not a music platform.""

Smith's affinity for Spotify started fading when he noticed one song — ""Back on 74"" by Jungle — kept popping up on his personalized Spotify playlists. While it's possible that he had checked the song out at some point, it wasn't something he enjoyed or actively listened to. Still, the song made its way from one personalized music recommendation feature to another and even started inspiring Spotify's algorithms to play similar songs.

""It just continued until I finally said, 'I can't take it,'"" Smith said.

As a music obsessive working at a major marketplace for vinyl records, Smith has no shortage of sources of quality music recommendations. But the days of Spotify augmenting his organic music discovery appear to be over. If he keeps his Spotify subscription at all, he says it will be for the podcasts and audiobooks the company has added to its premium tier.

I've found myself in a similar conundrum. After largely dismissing the 2015 launch of Apple Music as a then-satisfied Spotify subscriber, I recently decided to give Apple's music service another try. Since its debut, Apple Music has prioritized human editors over algorithms for music curation. Where it does use data-driven personalization, the results are pretty solid, and crucially, free of rainstorms. While Spotify's new audiobook library makes it tempting to stay, its playlists no longer feel like the best in the business. Once my free trial of Apple Music is over, I'm planning to make the switch.

Music subscription services like Spotify spend an extraordinary amount of money — last year, the company said it spent $10 billion — to license their massive music catalogs from record labels, publishers, and other rightsholders. These high costs make it more challenging to turn an enduring profit, something Spotify only managed to do for the first time in 2024.

From Wall Street's perspective, Spotify is killing it as year-over-year metrics like subscribers and revenue continue to grow. But in the quest to please investors, some ex-Spotify employees think it has abandoned too much of the human element that makes music and the culture around it so special.

Doug Ford was a Spotify executive who oversaw editorial playlist curation from 2013 to 2018. He arrived via Spotify's acquisition of Tunigo, a Swedish company that specialized in expert-curated music playlists based on different genres and moods. The next year, Spotify acquired Echo Nest, a music data startup founded by MIT grads that used a mix of machine learning and data filtering to build Pandora-style music recommendation algorithms. Both teams built out Spotify's man-meets-machine music discovery system, which helped the company successfully weather new competition from tech giants like Apple and Amazon as it started to explore the possibility of going public.

""That was a really beautiful moment in Spotify's history,"" Ford said. ""That mix of the intentional algorithmic and human curation to make a really deep product was great.""

The results spoke for themselves. Spotify said the 2015 launch of Discover Weekly yielded 1.7 billion streams in its first five months and generated a weekly wave of social media buzz when listeners' Discover Weekly playlists were refreshed.

""Our goal with Discover Weekly was to make something that felt like a friend or someone who knew you well was making you a mixtape,"" Spotify's product lead at the time, Matt Ogle, told me in an interview. To accomplish that feeling, the algorithm drew heavily from how real flesh-and-blood music enthusiasts were curating playlists on the platform.

""That's why that thing was so good,"" Ford said. ""It was taking all the inputs equally and letting things happen normally with the audience. Now it feels a little bit different.""

Ford said things started changing in the lead-up to Spotify's 2018 initial public offering and the ensuing pressure to prove to investors that profitability was possible in the notoriously tight-margined music streaming business.

""The culture changed because it had to become a business,"" Ford said. ""You need to be a successful business in order to offer this utility to people. But they've discarded some of the human aspects of it, for sure.""

One way the company shifted was by finding cheaper content to use. As the journalist Liz Pelly outlines in her book ""Mood Machine,"" Spotify's pre-IPO years saw an increasing reliance on what is known internally as ""perfect fit content,"" a euphemism for cheaper-to-license audio and mood-specific stock music that is optimized for longer listening sessions. As more listeners turned to streaming services like Spotify for ""chill vibes"" playlists and background music for studying, the company realized it could save money on royalty costs by populating those playlists with the cheap stuff. That would certainly explain the astonishing number of rainstorm audio tracks being released in a given week.

Ford watched with dismay as the platform became flooded with generic mood music. Around the same time, he said, respected colleagues started leaving the company. After what he describes as ""a particularly bad stretch"" of feeling frustrated by what he saw as a dramatic culture shift, Ford accepted an offer from YouTube to lead content for its music subscription service in 2018.

In the years since, Spotify's music programming strategy has only skewed more heavily toward automation. Pelly writes that by late 2023, the number of Spotify employees working on editorial music curation (about 200 people globally) was less than one-third the size of the team focused on algorithmic curation and personalization, according to an internal org chart. Notably, that head count was before Spotify laid off 17% of its total workforce in December 2023, a drastic cost-cutting measure that CEO Daniel Ek later admitted ""did disrupt our day-to-day operations more than we anticipated."" Holder said that there are now over 130 employees working on editorial music curation.

One of the more palpable victims of Spotify's 2023 cuts was Glenn McDonald, the company's data alchemist (his real job title), who came from the original Echo Nest team and designed and built much of the original data infrastructure and algorithms powering Spotify's music recommendation engine. He designed the system that identifies a song's genre, which was crucial to effectively sort and recommend music and understand listeners' tastes.

""The genre system was human-guided,"" McDonald said. ""After they laid me off, they replaced it with a system that is not human-guided. It's just machine learning. It looks at patterns of words in the titles and descriptions of playlists. That's objectively worse.""

McDonald said the ripple effects of this change could be felt across Spotify's listening experience. Music was often misclassified, like when Swedish folk-metal bands were suddenly lumped in with all other folk artists. He said it took Spotify engineers a year to fully deactivate and replace the genre system he built, according to data output from the company's public API. One of the many data-filtering tools he built during his tenure at the company was a set of filters designed to fine-tune the music recommendations presented by Discover Weekly and Release Radar — and crucially, prevent things like nature sounds and ambient noise frequencies from showing up where they don't belong.

""They would have been flagged as anomalies on those dashboards, and I would have followed up with the teams in charge of those recommendations,"" McDonald explained. ""Without those dashboards, probably nobody is even watching for these issues.""

Holder said that Spotify's approach to classifying genres and subgenres has ""evolved"" from the legacy system built by McDonald and other Echo Nest engineers, but declined to get into technical specifics of how it works now or what advantages the new system introduces.

""We're always laser-focused on continually enhancing personalized recommendations,"" she said. Recent updates include improvements to genre accuracy and Discover Weekly recommendations, she added.

Ford said the changes at Spotify are part of a broader industry shift away from costlier human curation. ""There's been a tradeoff in favor of high metrics, long listening sessions, and music that's just 'good enough,'"" he said. ""It's happening everywhere.""

The result is what Ford calls a ""rampant wave of algorithmic fatigue"" among listeners, who are clamoring for more meaningful cultural experiences as online platforms become increasingly hyper-automated.

While the occasional bug and ongoing iteration are to be expected in any product, some longtime subscribers find it odd that Spotify would need to fix or enhance features that worked so well in the first place. My Release Radar delivering mostly white noise and rainstorms, for instance, feels like a fundamental failure of what that feature used to do so well. Over the course of reporting and writing this story over the last few weeks, I've checked back with my Release Radar. Each week, it has a few new songs, but it's still mostly rainstorms.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","I bought a ticket to see Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter by myself. Security upgraded me to an incredible seat.","https://www.businessinsider.com/my-seat-was-upgraded-at-beyonces-first-cowboy-carter-concert-2025-5","Fri, 02 May 2025 13:47:00 GMT","

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Coco Mocoe. It has been edited for length and clarity.

Three days before Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter tour kicked off at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, I bought a ticket to see her.

I'd never seen her in person, and was so excited at the thought of seeing her perform after she'd won her first album of the year at the Grammys — a win I predicted. I felt like the concert would be a historic moment for her, and I was excited to see her live.

I didn't expect what happened once I arrived at the stadium.

I paid $408 for a ticket from a reseller on Ticketmaster and was informed I might not get the ticket until the day of the concert. In the end, the tickets weren't released to me until just a few hours before the concert started, which made me nervous on the day of.

Arriving in plenty of time before the concert started, I was confused about where my seat was. The security guards put me in another section — still on the floor, just in a different section.

Chatting and making friends with the people around me, a couple got my attention and said they thought I was sitting in their seat. We were showing each other our tickets, trying to figure out who was meant to be where. I felt embarrassed, thinking everyone thought I had taken a seat that wasn't mine.

I asked the security guards for help, and they were getting different people involved to figure out what to do. With all the confusion, I was nervous I would miss the concert's start.

A manager eventually appeared and apologized for the confusion. ""We're going to hook you up,"" he said. ""Your seat is going to be even better."" I'm guessing it was easier to adjust my seat because I was there as a single person.

Security directed me to guest services, which gave me an updated ticket to show to the security guards. I ended up in Section B, Row 12. It was closer than my original seat, only two school buses' lengths away from the runway. As I got to my seat, Serena and Kordell from ""Love Island USA"" were being escorted in, mobbed by fans. I knew I was in the cool section and had been upgraded.

As the concert started, I knew I had lucked out. The runway she used for much of the concert was right in front of me.

I could see everything. Her brilliant costume changes — a sparkled red outfit, an LED changing dress, and a newspaper outfit. I also saw her getting buckled on the giant horseshoes that she'd fly across the stadium on.

I loved watching all of it. The audience was great — it felt like a big community of people just so happy to be there.

Taking my time leaving, I stopped to get merchandise. I hadn't planned to buy anything, but after getting so lucky, I needed a lucky charm to commemorate the evening.

Although I knew how lucky I'd been, it wasn't until the next day that I realized just how fortunate. I watched videos of people who had paid for a closer seat in the Honey Bucking Pit, saying they were disappointed because Beyoncé spent a lot of time on the runway — the runway in front of me.

I looked on StubHub and Ticketmaster to see what my seat would cost now. One of the tickets in my section is now going for $7,000.

It was an unexpected and magical night. I think I was the luckiest person in that stadium.

The DOGE chief is apparently refocusing on his electric car company. But when safety is a priority, could his attention bring more harm than good?

Is this the face of a culture of safety?

Photographer: Shawn Thew/Bloomberg

The Tesla Inc. board is doubling down on Elon Musk. With its chair denying a report that the electric car company was exploring other CEO possibilities, the board is sending a clear message: We're in the Elon business.

It's a questionable move given one of directors' core responsibilities: assessing risks. Right now Tesla is facing a host of them, including flagging sales, Musk's Department of Government Efficiency hangover and, crucially, his plan to bet the company's future on robotaxis. The biggest risk, however, is caused by Musk himself. After all, the worst-case scenario for a self-driving taxi fleet is a safety issue identified after the vehicles are on the road. In addition to potentially costing lives, any significant problem could scare people away from the Tesla brand. Musk's leadership style makes that scenario a frighteningly plausible one.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

In this article

Netflix is on a winning streak.

The streaming giant's stock has traded for 11 straight days without a decline, the company's longest positive run ever.

Its previous record was a nine-day stretch in late 2018 and early 2019 when the stock traded up for four days, was unchanged for a day and then traded positively for another four days.

The stock is also trading at all-time high levels since it went public in May 2002.

This new streak comes on the heels of Netflix's most recent earnings report on April 17, in which it revealed that revenue grew 13% during the first quarter of 2025 on higher-than-forecast subscription and advertising dollars.

Netflix has been one of the top performing stocks during the first 100 days of President Donald Trump's second term, with shares up more than 30% since mid-January. The company has been largely unaffected by Trump's tariffs and trade war with China and is a service that consumers are unlikely to cut during a recession.

Meanwhile, traditional media stocks have been slammed by a tumultuous market prompted by Trump's trade policy. Warner Bros. Discovery has lost nearly 10% since Trump took office, while Disney is down 13% in that same period.

Netflix continues to forecast full-year revenue of between $43.5 billion and $44.5 billion.

""There's been no material change to our overall business outlook,"" the company said in a statement last month.

As investors worry about the potential impact of tariffs on consumer spending and confidence, Netflix's co-CEO Greg Peters said on the company's earnings call, ""Based on what we are seeing by actually operating the business right now, there's nothing really significant to note.""

""We also take some comfort that entertainment historically has been pretty resilient in tougher economic times,"" Peters said. ""Netflix, specifically, also, has been generally quite resilient. We haven't seen any major impacts during those tougher times, albeit over a much shorter history.""

JPMorgan said Thursday that it sees more upside for shares.

""NFLX has established itself as the clear leader in global streaming & is on the pathway to becoming global TV...Advertising Upfronts in May should serve as a positive catalyst to shares,"" analysts wrote.

While Netflix has hiked its subscription prices — its standard plan now costs $17.99, its ad-supported plan is $7.99 and premium is $24.99 — it appears to have retained its value proposition for customers. But it's unclear if the subscriber base is growing or shrinking because the company recently stopped sharing details on its membership numbers, instead focusing on revenue growth.

President Donald Trump on Friday said his administration will revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status, escalating his previous threats against the Ivy League school and potentially expanding an ongoing legal battle.

""It's what they deserve!"" Trump wrote in a terse Truth Social post announcing the decision.

The post is the latest escalation in Trump's campaign against Harvard and other elite schools, based on claims that they have fostered antisemitism and other forms of discrimination on their campuses.

Trump has sought to extract concessions from the institutions by threatening to withhold federal research grants unless the schools make massive changes, many of which give the administration more oversight of its operations.

The State Department and immigration authorities have also targeted thousands of international students by revoking their visas and, in several high-profile cases, detaining individual students.

The Trump administration in mid-April said it would freeze $2.2 billion in grants to Harvard, the nation's oldest and wealthiest university. The college filed a lawsuit soon after, calling the government's flex of power ""unprecedented and improper.""

Around the same time, Trump openly considered stripping Harvard of the tax-exempt status that the government grants to most public and private universities and colleges.

""Remember, Tax Exempt Status is totally contingent on acting in the PUBLIC INTEREST!"" he wrote on Truth Social on April 15.

The Treasury Department has asked the Internal Revenue Service to consider revoking the school's tax-exempt status, The New York Times reported last month.

Trump's Homeland Security secretary also recently threatened to revoke Harvard's ability to secure student visas for the international students enrolled there.

A spokesperson for Harvard responded Friday to Trump's latest threat, saying, ""there is no legal basis to rescind Harvard's tax-exempt status."" 

""Such an unprecedented action would endanger our ability to carry out our educational mission,"" the spokesperson said in a statement to NBC News. ""The unlawful use of this instrument more broadly would have grave consequences for the future of higher education in America.""

A group of Senate Democrats on Friday sent a letter to the acting chief of the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, requesting an investigation into whether the White House has pressured the Internal Revenue Service to revoke Harvard's tax exempt status and whether the IRS has taken any action to examine Harvard's tax designation.

""It is both illegal and unconstitutional for the IRS to take direction from the President to target schools, hospitals, churches, or any other tax-exempt entities as retribution for using their free speech rights,"" wrote Sens. Chuck Schumer, N.Y., Ron Wyden, Ore., Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren, both of Massachusetts. 

""While auditing Harvard for refusing to capitulate to the President's demands is clearly troubling, we are even more concerned about the implications for organizations that are too small to resist pressure from the White House or do not have the resources for legal action,"" they wrote. 

""Church groups, hospitals, health clinics, or food banks could be next.""

In this article

Chevron will slow the pace of its share buybacks, as falling crude prices hit the oil major's first-quarter profit.

U.S. crude oil prices have dropped about 18% this year as President Donald Trump's tariffs are expected to weigh on demand at the same time OPEC+ plans to pump more supply into the market.

The oil major said it plans to repurchase $2.5 billion to $3 billion of its own stock in the second quarter, which is lower than the $3.9 billion it bought back in the first quarter. Chevron, however, is maintaining its overall guidance of $10 billion to $20 billion of repurchases this year.

Chevron shares were basically flat in morning trading.

Here is what Chevron reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: 

Chevron clearly has room to continue its shareholder returns, Biraj Borkhataria, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, told clients in a Friday note.

""The reaction from the company today seems to reflect a 'skate to where the puck is going' situation, with a recognition that the macro has deteriorated, and could continue to deteriorate further from here,"" the analyst said.

Chevron's net income declined more than 30% to $3.5 billion, or $2 per share, from $5.5 billion or $2.97 per share, in the year-ago period. Excluding one-time items, Chevron earned $2.18 per share, which was in line with Wall Street estimates.

Chevron's U.S. production business posted a profit of $1.86 billion, a decline of more than 10% from $2.08 billion in the year-ago period, as it experienced higher operating expenses and lower commodity prices.

On the international front, Chevron's production segment earned $1.9 billion in the quarter, down nearly 40% from $3.16 billion last year. International profits took a hit due primarily to lower earnings at the company's TCO project in Kazakhstan.

Chevron produced 3.35 million barrels per day in the quarter, largely flat compared with the 3.34 million bpd in the year-ago period. Capital expenditures declined about 5% to $3.9 billion, down from $4.1 billion one year ago.

Chevron is still trying to close its planned acquisition of Hess. The deal has been stymied as Exxon Mobil challenges Chevron's move to buy Hess assets in Guyana before an international arbitration court. Chevron acquired $2.2 billion of Hess shares in the quarter.

The oil major's U.S. refining business shifted to a profit of $103 million after posting a loss of $348 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. The segment's earnings, however, declined 77% from $453 million in the year-ago period due to lower margins on refined product sales.

Chevron's international refining business posted a profit of $222 million, a decline of about 33% from $330 million in the same quarter last year also due to lower margins on product sales.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Tether, the world's largest stablecoin issuer, is preparing to launch a U.S.-based stablecoin as soon as this year, as its CEO ramps up his presence in Washington to shape crypto regulation.

In an interview with CNBC this week, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino revealed that the company is working on plans to issue a new dollar-pegged stablecoin in the U.S. as soon as this year. The move comes as Tether, once accused of being a criminal's 'go-to cryptocurrency' – rebrands itself as a partner to American lawmakers and law enforcement.

""A domestic stablecoin would be different from the international stable coin,"" Ardoino told CNBC's Dan Murphy at the Token2049 conference in Dubai on Wednesday. ""It depends on the timeline of the final legislation… but we are looking at that by the end of the year, or early next year at the fastest,"" he said.

But the timing and tactics of that next step are raising eyebrows on Capitol Hill.

Ardoino's recent charm offensive in Washington, which included private meetings with lawmakers, a Capitol Hill lunch with Senator Bill Hagerty and parties with crypto insiders, according to a New York Times report, has put a spotlight on Tether amid the pro-crypto shift under President Trump.

That influence may now be helping shape key legislation, including the GOP-backed GENIUS Act, which critics say includes loopholes that benefit Tether and other foreign issuers – such as provisions allowing operations in the U.S. if they agree to work with law enforcement.

Tether, headquartered in El Salvador, has made legal cooperation key to its lobbying narrative despite a history of regulatory penalties.

""There is no company… even in the traditional financial system, that has such a breadth of collaboration with law enforcement,"" Ardoino said. ""We are always trying to do better and more to block criminal activity…. we have much better tools than the traditional financial system and we're proving that everyday.""

Ardoino also addressed concerns about the firm's ability to back its digital assets. In 2021, Tether settled with the New York attorney general for $18.5 million over allegations it lied about its reserves. It now publishes attestation reports and holds billions in U.S. Treasuries - managed by Wall Street heavyweight Cantor Fitzgerald - and Ardoino insists the business is well capitalised in the event of a market shock.

""We are very close to having $120 billion in U.S. Treasuries in our reserves,"" he said. ""We have $7 billion in excess equity within the company capital. That is really unprecedented and I wish financial institutions in the traditional financial system would at least try to copy us to provide better products for their consumers.""

Tether's latest attestation report confirmed the firm holds about $120 billion in U.S. Treasuries. Its first quarter independent auditors' report confirmed assets and reserves exceed liabilities by almost $5.6 billion, a decrease from more than $7 billion in its December audit. 

Tether's partnership with Cantor, now run by the sons of U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, has also raised questions. Ardoino told CNBC he doesn't speak with Secretary Lutnick ""because there are proper walls given the potential conflict of interest,"" but added ""we have great relationships with many people in the U.S. and also now in Washington."" 

Eric Trump and his older brother Donald Trump Jr. recently announced plans to launch a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin through World Liberty Financial, the finance venture backed by President Donald Trump.

TikTok has been fined 530 million euros ($601.3 million) by Ireland's privacy regulator for sending user data to China.

The Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) — which leads on privacy oversight for TikTok in the EU — said Friday that TikTok infringed the bloc's GDPR data protection law over transfers of European user data to China.

The regulator ordered TikTok to bring its data processing into compliance within six months and said it would suspend TikTok's transfers to China if processing is not brought into compliance within that timeframe.

""TikTok's personal data transfers to China infringed the GDPR because TikTok failed to verify, guarantee and demonstrate that the personal data of EEA users, remotely accessed by staff in China, was afforded a level of protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed within the EU,"" Graham Doyle, deputy commissioner at the DPC, said in a statement Friday.

""As a result of TikTok's failure to undertake the necessary assessments, TikTok did not address potential access by Chinese authorities to EEA personal data under Chinese anti-terrorism, counter-espionage and other laws identified by TikTok as materially diverging from EU standards,"" he added.

The DPC said it also found TikTok had provided inaccurate information to its inquiry when it claimed it hadn't stored European users' data on servers located in China. TikTok informed the regulator this month that it discovered an issue in February where limited European user data had been stored on servers in China, contrary to its prior statements.

The DPC takes the issue ""very seriously"" and is considering what further regulatory action may be warranted in consultation with its fellow EU data protection authorities, Doyle said.

TikTok said it disagrees with the Irish regulator's decision and plans to appeal in full.

In a blog post Friday, Christine Grahn, TikTok's head of public policy and government relations for Europe, said the decision failed to take into account Project Clover, a 12-billion-euro data security initiative aimed at protecting European user data.

""It instead focuses on a select period from years ago, prior to Clover's 2023 implementation and does not reflect the safeguards now in place,"" Grahn said.

""The DPC itself recorded in its report what TikTok has consistently said: it has never received a request for European user data from the Chinese authorities, and has never provided European user data to them,"" she added.

TikTok has previously acknowledged that staff in China can access user data.

In 2022, it said in an update to its privacy policy that employees in countries where it operates — including China, Brazil, Canada and Israel — are permitted access to users' data to ensure their experience is ""consistent, enjoyable and safe.""

Western policymakers and regulators are concerned TikTok's transfers of user data could lead to Beijing accessing the data to spy on users with the app. Under Chinese law, tech companies are required to hand over user data to the Chinese government if requested to assist with vaguely-defined ""intelligence work.""

For its part, TikTok has insisted that it has never sent user data to the Chinese government. In 2023, TikTok boss Shou Zi Chew said in written testimony for a U.S. Congress hearing that the app ""has never shared, or received a request to share, U.S. user data with the Chinese government.""

U.S. Vice President JD Vance has warned Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine is not likely to come to an end ""any time soon.""

Speaking during an interview on Fox News, Vance said on Thursday that President Donald Trump's administration was working to ""find some middle ground"" to stop a conflict that has been raging for more than three years.

""It's not going anywhere ... it's not going to end any time soon,"" Vance said.

His comments come shortly after the U.S. and Ukraine signed a long-awaited minerals deal, an agreement that Vance said showed the White House is making progress.

He later added that while he was ""optimistic"" of a breakthrough in peace talks, ""it's hard to say confident"" because Russia and Ukraine will ""have to take the final step.""

After months of tense negotiations, the U.S. and Ukraine on Wednesday signed an economic partnership that provides Washington with preferential access to some of Kyiv's natural resources.

U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent said the ""historic"" agreement would allow the two countries to invest together to accelerate Ukraine's economic recovery and help to ""facilitate the end of this cruel and senseless war.""

For its part, Ukraine said the partnership was capable of delivering success for both Washington and Kyiv.

Since his inauguration in January, Trump has pushed for a minerals deal with Ukraine, saying an agreement to jointly develop and monetize Kyiv's deposits of rare earths, critical minerals, oil, gas and other natural resources would act, effectively, as compensation for U.S. aid to Ukraine throughout the war with Russia.

Before his presidential victory last fall, Trump pledged to end Russia's war with Ukraine in just ""one day.""

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned on Tuesday that Washington could step back from its mediation efforts unless Russia and Ukraine delivered ""concrete proposals"" on how to end the conflict.

The Kremlin on Wednesday reiterated previous statements that Russian President Vladimir Putin is open to peace talks with Ukraine.

As debates ramp up for President Donald Trump's policy agenda, changes to a key tax provision could benefit higher earners, experts say. 

Enacted via the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, of 2017, there's a $10,000 limit on the federal deduction on state and local taxes, known as SALT, which will sunset after 2025 without action from Congress. 

Currently, if you itemize tax breaks, you can't deduct more than $10,000 in levies paid to state and local governments, including income and property taxes.

Raising the SALT cap has been a priority for certain lawmakers from high-tax states like California, New Jersey and New York. With a slim House Republican majority, those voices could impact negotiations.

While Trump enacted the $10,000 SALT cap in 2017, he reversed his position on the campaign trail last year, vowing to ""get SALT back"" if elected again. He has renewed calls for reform since being sworn into office.

Lawmakers have floated several updates, including a complete repeal, which seems unlikely with a tight budget and several competing priorities, experts say.

""It all has to come together in the context of the broader package,"" but a higher SALT deduction limit could be possible, said Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis at the Tax Foundation.

Here's who could be impacted.

When filing taxes, you choose the greater of the standard deduction or your itemized deductions, including SALT capped at $10,000, medical expenses above 7.5% of your adjusted gross income, charitable gifts and others.

Starting in 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act doubled the standard deduction, and it adjusts for inflation yearly. For 2025, the standard deduction is $15,000 for single filers and $30,000 for married couples filing jointly.

Because of the high threshold, the vast majority of filers — roughly 90%, according to the latest IRS data — use the standard deduction and don't benefit from itemized tax breaks.

Typically, itemized deductions increase with income, and higher earners tend to owe more in state income and property taxes, according to Watson.

Generally, higher earners would benefit most from raising the SALT deduction limit, experts say.

For example, one proposal, which would remove the ""marriage penalty"" in federal income taxes, involves increasing the cap on the SALT deduction for married couples filing jointly from $10,000 to $20,000.

That would offer almost all the tax break to households making more than $200,000 per year, according to a January analysis from the Tax Policy Center.

""If you raise the cap, the people who benefit the most are going to be upper-middle income,"" said Howard Gleckman, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.

Of course, upper-middle income looks different depending on where you live, he said.

Forty of the top 50 U.S. congressional districts impacted by the SALT limit are in California, Illinois, New Jersey or New York, a Bipartisan Policy Center analysis from before 2022 redistricting found.

If lawmakers repealed the cap completely, households making $430,000 or more would see nearly three-quarters of the benefit, according to a separate Tax Policy Center analysis from September.

In this article

While global markets have been gripped by turbulence in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump's seesawing tariffs policies, British stocks have enjoyed a bumper rally.

London's FTSE 100 index, which has gained more than 5% since the beginning of the year, rose by 1.25% on Friday. It marked the fifteenth consecutive day of gains for the index, its new longest run ever.

In 2017, the index had fourteen back-to-back daily rises.

London's more domestically focused FTSE 250 has also been on a winning streak of late, having notched seven consecutive days of gains by Thursday's closing bell. On Friday, the index was trading flat, paring earlier gains. If the index ends Friday's session in positive territory, it would mark the FTSE 250's longest run of gains since late 2020.

London-listed equities that saw the biggest gains on Friday included British food outlet operator SSP Group, up 4%, English healthcare firm Haleon, up 3.8%, and U.K.-based aerospace firm Melrose Industries, which rose by 3.6%.

When it comes to what's fueling the rise of British stock markets, the U.K.'s unique position away from the firing line of new U.S. tariffs is part of the picture, according to Naeem Aslam, chief investment officer at London's Zaye Capital Markets.

""The easing of U.S.-China trade tensions and the removal of tariff threats have boosted confidence, while the United Kingdom's neutral trade status has shielded it from the more punitive levies faced by the European Union or China,"" he said in an email.

The U.K. has been spared from the brunt of the Trump administration's so-called reciprocal tariffs, and last month Vice President JD Vance said he saw a ""good chance"" of Britain forging a trade deal with the United States that would give the U.K. further reprieve from the duties.

""The index's defensive giants — healthcare (e.g., AstraZeneca), energy (e.g., Shell), and consumer staples — have drawn investors seeking refuge from volatility, supported by a high dividend yield of between 3.5% and 4%,"" Aslam told CNBC on Friday.

""Furthermore, robust corporate results from the likes of Whitbread (+3.4%) and Entain (+6.8%), combined with a resilient UK economy growing at an annualized rate of 1.5%, also add fuel to the rally, making the FTSE 100 a relative safe haven.""

Aslam said the FTSE 100's upward momentum could continue if defensive stocks remain in favor — however, he noted that there were ""risks abound.""

""Technical point to the index, being overbought … suggesting a pullback,"" he said. ""Geopolitical hotspots or revived tariff tensions may upset momentum, while a firmer pound (around $1.30) could put pressure on export-heavy members.""



However, he noted that undervaluation relative to the FTSE 100's global peers combined with expectations of multiple interest rate cuts from the Bank of England this year, could push the index as high as 8,900 points by the end of next month — a return of around 4% from current levels.

Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, agreed that the blue-chip index has the potential to extend its record run.  

""The FTSE 100 has significantly more power in reserve and could have further to run, given that the index is not yet regained the record levels reached in March,"" she told CNBC via email on Friday.

However, she noted that uncertainty over U.S. trade policy and the extent of the effect on the global economy, had the potential to put a lid on further gains.

In a note to clients on Thursday, Bank of America strategists ranked the UK as its 10th best performing equity market with returns of 12.6% from the beginning of the year to the end of April. The top of the list was dominated by European markets including Spain, Greece and Germany, while U.S. stocks — down by around 5% on a year-to-date basis — were ranked in 20th place.

Bob Huxford, head of the public companies division at London-based communications agency SEC Newgate, told CNBC on Friday that volatility in U.S. equity markets presented British capital markets with an opportunity to regain some of the ground lost to the U.S. in recent years.

""The London market has undergone nine successive years of outflows, with 2024 the worst year on record when £9.6 billion left our shores, mostly headed for America,"" he said. ""Current uncertainty in the US stock market offers a chance for the UK to reverse this trend. Money is already flowing from the US, and there are a host of reasons why the UK represents a port in a storm amid the market turmoil.""

 Bitcoin (BTCUSD) has surged to its highest point in more than two months, putting it back within reach of the psychological $100,000 level. 


 The digital asset rallied Thursday after reports surfaced that investment bank Morgan Stanley is looking into adding spot cryptocurrency trading to its E*Trade platform sometime next year. Sentiment also received a boost after Strategy (MSTR), the world's largest corporate holder of bitcoin, said it plans to acquire more bitcoin through a $21 billion equity offering.


 Bitcoin is up about 30% from its early-April low as investors have sought to diversify their portfolios amid uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's trade policies and their potential impact on the economy. Amid recent market turmoil, bitcoin and stocks have occasionally moved in opposite directions, evidence to some investors that the cryptocurrency is finally showing its worth as a safe haven.


 The legacy cryptocurrency was at $97,000 recently, still below its record high of around $109,000 in January but up from last month's low below $75,000.


 Below, we take a closer look at bitcoin's chart and apply technical analysis to identify crucial price levels worth watching out for.


 After breaking out from a a descending channel last month, bitcoin's price rallied sharply before consolidating in a narrow pennant pattern.


 In a win for the bulls, the pioneer cryptocurrency staged a breakout above the pennant's top trendline Thursday, setting the stage for a continuation move higher. Moreover, the relative strength index confirms bullish price momentum, with the indicator edging toward overbought territory. 


 However, it's worth pointing out that trading volumes remain below average during bitcoin's recent bullish price action, suggesting larger market participants may remain on the sidelines.


 Let's identify two crucial overhead areas on bitcoin's chart that investors may be watching and also locate key support levels worth eyeing during future pullbacks.


 The first overhead area to watch sits at $100,000. This crucial location would likely provide resistance near the round number and a horizontal line that links a range of trading activity on the chart between November and February.


 A more bullish move could see bitcoin's price test overhead resistance around $107,000. Investors who have accumulated the cryptocurrency at lower prices may decide to lock in profits at this level near the prominent December and January swing highs. This region also roughly aligns with a projected bars pattern upside target that takes the impulsive move higher that preceded the pennant and repositions it from the pattern's breakout point.


 During pullbacks, investors should initially eye the $92,000 level. Retracements to this area may attract buying interest near the low of the pennant pattern, which also aligns with several peaks and troughs on the chart stretching back to last November.


 Finally, a breakdown below this key technical level opens the door for a drop to $85,000. Investors may seek entry points in this area near the February low and a period of sideways drift on the chart prior from bitcoin's breakout from the descending channel last month.

The Surinamese political candidate has projected an image of herself as a successful businesswoman running as a pro-Bitcoin presidential candidate to the international Bitcoin community, but those who've interacted with her on the ground — or those who've obtained reported government intel on her — tell a different story.

Last year, Maya Parbhoe quickly became well-known in the international Bitcoin community as she presented herself to the world as a presidential candidate in her country, Suriname. She vowed to fight corruption in a country rife with it and to make bitcoin legal tender in Suriname to help get the country's citizens out of financial “survival mode.”

Parbhoe's story as an underdog candidate quickly gained traction as she made her case for how she could help Suriname as president both online and in person at conferences such as Bitcoin Amsterdam.

Prominent members of the Bitcoin community such as Bitcoin mining analyst and leadership coach Daniel Batten have vouched for Parbhoe in recent months, while Jan3 CEO Samson Mow was the one who encouraged Parbhoe to run for president. I, too, helped bring attention to her candidacy.

However, in recent weeks, some cracks have started to form in Parbhoe's story. Reports from those who have visited the country say that the image that Parbhoe has been projecting of herself and her candidacy to the world may be in part an illusion.

The reports claim that Parbhoe has overstated her odds of becoming president of Suriname to the international community and that her political messaging within the country has had little to nothing to do with Bitcoin.

What is more, some reports that are now reaching the international Bitcoin audience also contend that Parbhoe's candidacy is not well known within Suriname. And while Parbhoe has positioned herself as an advocate for those within her country who are struggling financially, one source told Bitcoin Magazine that she has disdain for the country's poor.

On top of that, reported intel from the U.S. government estimates that Parbhoe may be running as “controlled opposition,” a political figure who serves as a placeholder for those that they purport to be against. According to Bitcoin Magazine's source, the same reported intel states Parbhoe's father was knowingly in business with drug traffickers and money launderers and that there's also a chance that the bank accounts for Parbhoe's companies are being used to launder money.

Before diving deeper into the latter allegations, it's first important to understand the depths of corruption in Suriname and how Parbhoe claims to be an antidote to it.

According to a 2022 report from the U.S. Department of State, almost every sector of Suriname's government has been accused of corruption. These sectors include the central bank of Suriname and state-owned companies, including the country's national airline, Surinam Airways, and the government health insurance company, SZF.

Some of the highest-ranking individuals in the country have also been involved in corruption, as the country's current vice president has been convicted of drug trafficking and the country's former president, Dési Bouterse, was convicted of drug trafficking and murder and sentenced to 20 years in prison.

Parbhoe billed herself as an anti-corruption presidential candidate in Suriname's upcoming elections, which are slated to occur on May 25, 2025.

As part of her messaging, she often mentions how her father was murdered for speaking out against corruption in the country, and she says that she wants to carry on his legacy by speaking out against corruption in Suriname, as well.

The part of this story that Parbhoe has left out as she's recounted it time and time again, though, is that her father had two Colombian partners in his casino business who he knew were also involved in drug trafficking and money laundering. According to a former senior advisor for Parbhoe's campaign, Shamay, Parbhoe is aware that her father knew he was in business with these people, as she has told him as much.

Micah Dunford, a retired Green Beret and CEO of Greyscale Protection, a company that Parbhoe contracted to protect her during the beginning of April, when she gave birth to her daughter, informed Bitcoin Magazine that reported intel from the U.S. government states that Parbhoe's father was knowingly involved with “nefarious actors” and was murdered by “narco terrorists.”

[Author's note: Dunford would like to make it clear that he only shared the information above as well as other information in this piece about a client of his because he is a Bitcoin enthusiast and feels that Parbhoe is doing a great disservice to the Bitcoin community and to Bitcoin's reputation.]

When I initially interviewed Parbhoe in July 2024, she offered an account of her father's business dealings that did not include his knowingly being in business with drug traffickers and money launderers. She stuck to her original story and denied that her father was in business with two Colombian drug traffickers when I recently reached out to her to ask her about the matter.

“My father was in business with Dorsett Resorts,” Parbhoe told Bitcoin Magazine via email. 

“It was a publicly traded company in the U.S. and he bought $500,000 in shares so he could be in investor meetings. My father went to the then Minister of Justice, Santhokhi, and all authorities, including the three letter agencies, when he realized what was going on,” she added.

“His case against de [De] Surinaamsche Bank is currently being delayed by the president at our highest court of justice. The case against the CEO, COO and Manager from Dorsett goes to court on April 28th. I am his only living heir fighting this case.”

If Parbhoe's father was knowingly in business with drug traffickers and if Parbhoe knew that he knew this and continues to omit it from the story of her father's murder that she tells the media, what she's doing is part of a broader trend when it comes to some of the stories she tells — including the one about her becoming president of Suriname.

In Suriname's political system, a parliamentary democracy, voters elect candidates to represent them in parliament, the 51-member National Assembly.

Historically, most voters vote for the leader of a political party, and if that leader won enough votes for more than one seat, the additional seats went to members of their same party in predetermined order based on their position on the party's candidate list — the higher on the list, the better the odds of winning a parliamentary seat.

Although it was technically possible for a candidate lower on the list to be elected into parliament directly if enough people vote on this candidate specifically (rather than the party leader), this rarely happened.

Once parliamentarians were elected, coalitions would form in parliament, and its members would then vote on a president. The National Assembly would then elect the president by a two-thirds vote — 34 of 51.

This dynamic will partially shift in upcoming elections, though, as Suriname is implementing a new “one person, one vote” system.

In August 2020, the Constitutional Court of Suriname ruled the former electoral law in Suriname unconstitutional in that it violated the principle of one person, one vote, according to the aforementioned 2022 report from the U.S. Department of State.

The document states that “the court found that votes in rural, less populated districts outweighed those in urban, more populated areas, since it required far fewer votes to win a seat for the National Assembly in rural districts [and it] mandated that the government and National Assembly amend the legislation as soon as possible for the 2025 elections to take place on time.”

Under the new system, each voter votes for one member of parliament, and each party has 51 candidates for the 51 seats of parliament.

Seats are divided between the different political parties based on the total number of votes on all candidates for these parties. These seats then go to the candidates of each of these parties that got the most votes individually. So, if a political party gets (say) five seats in parliament, those five seats will go to the five candidates of that party with the most individual votes; their ranking on the party's candidate list is irrelevant.

Any group of at least seven members of parliament (regardless of party affiliation) can submit a candidate for president. Parliament then votes based on that list of candidates, and a two-thirds majority vote determines who wins the presidency.

Parbhoe, who is not the head of the political party with which she's affiliated, the National Party of Suriname (NPS), is looking to capitalize on this new system by aiming to get as many votes as possible in the general election.

She said that she would need 5,380 votes to win a seat in parliament, which she believes she can get. (This seems logical in that 283,834 people voted in Suriname's 2020 election, and if each of the 51 candidates elected to parliament received 5,380 votes, this would mean that 274,380 people voted, which is very close to the voter turnout from the previous election. Also, under the old electoral system, Parbhoe would have needed a minimum of 7,000 votes as a candidate based in Paramaribo, the largest constituency in the country.)

A poll conducted on April 21, 2025 shows that NPS may win 10 seats in parliament (7 more than they currently have), but the poll doesn't indicate which of NPS's candidates are most popular.

However, this doesn't matter much to Parbhoe anyway because winning a seat in parliament is what she calls a “worst case scenario.”

This is because her goal isn't to become a member of parliament — it's to become president.

“I am not running for a seat in the National Assembly,” she wrote in an email to me.

Parbhoe is aiming for a best-case scenario in which she gets the most votes in the country, as “usually, the candidate with the most votes gets elected by members of parliament to become president,” according to her. (What she didn't mention, though, is that the candidate who almost always gets the most votes is the leader of the biggest political party.)

She acknowledged that the leader of NPS, Gregory Rusland, is one of her biggest competitors. A report shows that in a recent poll on the most popular presidential candidates in Suriname, Rusland ranked fourth. (Parbhoe wasn't mentioned in the report.)

Parbhoe believes that part of her edge is that she's a younger candidate (She is 37 years old). She noted that Rusland is over 60 years of age, while the majority of the voters in the country are under the age of 45.

Parbhoe also added that “most of the candidates that have announced that they are running for president have an equal shot [of winning] as I do,” without commenting on what those odds are.

In a Reddit post on April 13, Michel Greijmans, a businessman based in Curaçao who visited Suriname for work in February, commented that Parbhoe has less of a chance of winning the presidency because she is ranked number 21 within the NPS.

What Greijmans didn't acknowledge, though — probably because he was not privy to this information — is that Parbhoe, by her own account, strategically selected this ranking of number 21 as an ode to Bitcoin, because rank within a party is mostly irrelevant now anyway.

Parbhoe first informed me of her doing this via text weeks back when her rank within the party was first announced, and she reiterated this to me in our most recent communications.

Had she not selected number 21, she said she would have opted for a ranking at the bottom of the list of her party (number 50 or 51). In Surinamese parliamentary system — at least in the older version of it — when a candidate selects the lowest ranking within a party, it's a signal that they aren't necessarily running for a seat in parliament, but are on the list just to endorse a particular party. (This type of candidate is sometimes referred to as a Lijstduwer, which translates to “list pusher,” and it exists in the Surinamese and Dutch parliamentary systems. List pushers often include celebrities, artists, or athletes who have no intention of serving in parliament.)

This type of candidate is sometimes referred to as a Lijstduwer, which translates to “list pusher,” and it exists in the Surinamese and Dutch parliamentary systems. List pushers often include celebrities, artists, or athletes who have no intention of serving in parliament. (Such a candidate in Suriname's current electoral race is Ingrid Bouterse-Waldring, widow of the late Dési Bouterse, the aforementioned former president of Suriname. She's ranked number 51 within the NPS.)

So, aside from Parbhoe's being a new, young candidate, what else is she doing to differentiate herself from the competition?

Well, she's broadcasted to the international Bitcoin community that she plans to replace Suriname's national currency, which has an average yearly inflation rate of 8.7% and which spiked as high as 59% in 2020, with bitcoin.

However, those who've visited Parbhoe in Suriname and who have reported back to the international Bitcoin community have said that Bitcoin is hardly part of her messaging within the country and that her strategy to replace the national currency with bitcoin won't work.

Greijmans, in his aforementioned Reddit post, mentioned that, in his experience on the ground in Suriname, no one outside of Bitcoin circles knew who Parbhoe was and that those within Bitcoin circles in the country didn't want to talk about her.

Dr. Jack Kruse, who'd met with Parbhoe on the ground in Suriname in February and even gave a nationally-televised talk on reforming Suriname at an NPS event during this visit, claimed on X that Greijmans' experience was comparable to his own.

I was in Suriname for two weeks with Maya and I can confirm everything in this recent report from Reddit is factual and comparable to my own data and research. The bitcoin community is being SCAMMED. Don't Trust, Verify: Maya Parbhoe, “The Next Bitcoin President of Suriname”… pic.twitter.com/O2nVkPXWWe

I followed up with Greijmans to learn more about his experience on the ground.

“The fact that the people I spoke to didn't want to talk about her raised concerns for me,” Greijmans told Bitcoin Magazine.

Greijmans didn't speak up about his experience immediately after his visit, though, because he felt it was possible that members of the local Bitcoin community were simply trying to distance the community that they were building from her campaign.

He also noted that members of the Bitcoin community on the ground in Suriname are doing “tremendous work” and that he doesn't want the damage that Parbhoe might be doing to blow back on the community there. (Kemal Yaşar, Marketing Director for Blink Wallet, confirmed that the number of transactions by Blink users in Suriname increased 2,389% from July 2024 to March 2025.)

To Parbhoe's credit, she established the Bitcoin community that Greijmans visited, Bitcoin Sranan, in 2021.

Greijmans also noted that as of the second week of April, Parbhoe had revamped her website, removing all claims that she is running for president.

His main issue with Parbhoe was that she was projecting an image to the world about her candidacy that's far from the reality on the ground.

He said that one of his motivations in writing the Reddit piece was to let the international community know that Parbhoe seemed to be taking advantage of the fact that it was easy for her to project a certain image to an international audience, as her actions are difficult to audit for those who aren't on the ground in Suriname.

“I wanted to at least alert people like, ‘Hey, listen, you're dealing with a culture, a political system, a country that's very opaque to its international audience,'” said Greijmans.

Rahim Taghizadegan, Parbhoe's chief economic advisor, claimed in a recent X post that, when he visited Suriname, he also found that the reality on the ground was different from the image Parbhoe had been projecting to the world.

“It did not surprise me in the slightest that the on-the-ground reality — regarding both Bitcoin adoption and Maya's actual role — fell significantly short of the media hype,” wrote Taghizadegan.

Taghizadegan also mentioned that he'd communicated to Parbhoe that her plan to make bitcoin the primary currency in Suriname wasn't realistic, an assessment she wasn't fond of.

“Maya disliked my assessment that her proposal to convert the national currency directly into [b]itcoin by governmental decree was unfeasible,” he wrote.

Furthermore, Taghizadegan also noted Parbhoe's shortcomings as a businesswoman.

“Her business track record revealed deficiencies in judgment and execution, but this was hardly unexpected and quite typical for someone transitioning into politics,” he added.

Shamay, who first met Parbhoe at Adopting Bitcoin El Salvador in November 2024 and began communicating with her soon after, visited Parbhoe in Suriname twice, once in January and once in February of this year, also voiced concerns about Parbhoe based on her lack of ability to execute as well as her poor business acumen.

While he was with Parbhoe on the ground, Parbhoe tearfully told him that the companies she'd founded — Quickship Logistics, Icarus Geosystems, and Daedalus Labs — weren't profitable, but that she had to keep up the image that they were successful or she wouldn't be respected as a young woman in politics in Suriname. He added that she was very fearful that this fact might get out and ruin her reputation.

Another source familiar with the matter confirmed that Quickship Logistics is not profitable, and that Parbhoe uses funds from the company to pay for personal expenses.

Shamay was also taken back at how disorganized Parbhoe's political campaign was.

He said that the campaign was being run from her living room couch with a few unpaid team members and that there was “no discussion about bitcoin.”

“Parbhoe did not have a Bitcoin platform within Suriname,” said Shamay.

Because of what he saw in his visits with Parbhoe, he withheld a mid-six-figure donation that he planned to give to her campaign.

One of the members from Greyscale's security team who went to Suriname wasn't as concerned about Parbhoe's lack of focus on bitcoin, which he still noted, as he was with how Parbhoe treated the less fortunate in the country.

“She speaks to people based on how they dress and how they present themselves,” the security team member told Bitcoin Magazine. 

“If they are poor, you can tell that she does not give a flying shit about them. We would walk through the streets, and if somebody walked past her or walked too close to her, she would act like they were dirty — she did not like these types of people being around her,” he added.

(Taghizadegan also commented on Parbhoe's behavior toward others in his X post. He wrote that “She was unkind to many people.”)

Parbhoe also demeaned and belittled both this security team member and his partner on the ground, he said.

According to the security team member, she asked him how much money he made, and when he told her, she responded by saying, “I didn't know you're one of the poors.”

The security team member also noted that Parbhoe's critique of him seemed ironic since Parbhoe herself didn't seem to have much money (though, he reported that she owns a Mercedes-Benz), and almost every source for this piece said that Parbhoe either owes them money, owes someone that they know money, or owes someone with whom she works money.

According to the security team member, she repeatedly asked to either borrow money from him or for him to pay for things like her groceries or dinner at a restaurant because she couldn't afford them.

Ironically, Parbhoe claims that having to pay Greyscale, which provided its services to her at a discount, is part of the reason she doesn't have the funds she needs to run her campaign properly or to help those she claims to help.

“[My] chances [of winning] decrease if I pay companies like Greyscale 3x for [a] contract and they deplete us out of funds,” wrote Parbhoe, alluding to the notion that Greyscale had overcharged her.

“I have projects for the teachers (painting schools, materials for the kids), orphanages (we still deliver food daily and have also planned sports/play days for them) and nurses (they've planned delivery of 70 bags with products new moms need) with deadlines and now less resources to complete,” she added.

“If I need to pick between airtime, billboards, and actual projects that help people, I will always pick the latter.”

(Shamay told me that she recently purchased a billboard for her campaign for $35,000.)

Parbhoe also suffers from insomnia, according to the security team member, and every hour and a half during the night, Parbhoe would come out of her room and turn the lights on in the room in which the security team members were sleeping on couches.

“She would flip the lights on and say ‘If I'm awake, you're awake,'” said the security team member.

What is more, early one morning, she made the security team member with whom I spoke move to the floor to sleep.

“She came out to the couch and said, ‘You're in my spot — get out. You can sleep on the floor,'” said the security team member. “For the rest of the time that we stayed at that house, I just slept on the floor in the kitchen, and it was horrible.”

Furthermore, this security team also said that Parbhoe became paranoid that her stepfather was trying to kill her because he'd left a cereal box on a panini press in her hospital room. She thought he was trying to start a fire next to her bed.

This sort of paranoia and irrational thinking had started weeks earlier, and the broader world started to get a glimpse of it on April 2, 2025.

On April 2, Parbhoe posted both a “Help” message on X and also recorded a 6-minute Space entitled “Life and family under threat. SOS,” which didn't feature any evidence of a threat. Both the tweet and the Space were only recently deleted.

Many in the Bitcoin community who are on X became concerned, as there were no reports of her status for the hours that followed.

Hours after the original messages, she posted another message on X in which she stated “The US Secret Service is here in Suriname to protect me and to help me uncover corruption.” (This message has since been deleted.)

Days later, Parbhoe stated in an X post that it was because she was “under heavy medication and recovering from childbirth” that she inaccurately posted about the Secret Service protecting her. The latter portion of that statement is untrue, though, because Parbhoe hadn't given birth by the time she'd published the X post.

Furthermore, two sources confirmed that Parbhoe was under no immediate threat when she made the initial two posts.

In the days leading up to Parbhoe's entering the hospital in preparation to give birth, she grew increasingly paranoid that “they” were going to kill or harm her while she was giving birth.

“They” included the hospital staff and her political opposition. Dunford surmised that Parbhoe's emotional state in this situation was a result of a combination of her being both paranoid and irrational in part because she was being “controlled by the opposition.”

“She is under their thumb,” said Dunford. “They most likely wanted to cut ties because she wasn't endorsed to run a campaign and/or went off the reservation either politically or businesswise with whomever she is in bed with — which is most probably a combo of government [officials] and narcos, which are synonymous in Suriname.” (More on this in the following section.)

Around this time, Parbhoe sent repeated erratic messages to the cofounder of Bitcasa Homes, Amanda Dawn.

Dawn had been introduced to Parbhoe a year and a half prior, and the two had worked together in a small capacity as their respective companies (Daedalus Labs for Parbhoe) were focused on the intersection of bitcoin and real estate.

On March 26, 2025, Parboe had reached out to Dawn, frantically claiming that her life was being threatened.

Dawn was rattled by the desperation in Parbhoe's voice. (I can relate to how Dawn likely felt, as I've received my fair share of panicked messages from Parbhoe, especially as her child's due date approached. She has a strong ability to arouse sympathy and/or empathy from those with whom she engages.)

Dawn, who believed deeply in Parbhoe's alleged pro-Bitcoin mission in Suriname, reached out to a contact at Bitcoin Veterans, stating that she needed to quickly find protection for Parbhoe.

That contact connected her with Dunford at Greyscale.

Dunford was familiar with Parbhoe's purported mission to bring Bitcoin to the people of Suriname and agreed to offer his company's services to Parbhoe while waiving his personal fee.

In the following days, Dunford sent two of his team members to guard Parbhoe, one a combat medic who is capable of delivering babies, as she gave birth.

Parbhoe didn't sign the contract with Greyscale, as she claimed she was being forced to do so under duress, but Dunford sent help regardless. (Parbhoe never did sign the contract, which included a nondisclosure agreement. This is another reason Dunford is comfortable sharing information about the ordeal.)

Peter Kroll, founder of BTC Curaçao, sent bitcoin to Parbhoe for the purpose of paying the Greyscale bill.

Kroll also donated 0.5 bitcoin to Parbhoe during the latter part of 2024 and urged others to follow his lead by donating, though, he now regrets doing so.

He said that he very much believed in Parbhoe — someone he'd met through the virtual Bitcoin community Eenentwintig. He added that she had credibility because she'd “put time into the Bitcoin community.”

Parbhoe gave birth the day the Greyscale guards arrived.

And while Dunford's men were with Parbhoe in the hospital and back at her home, a contact in the U.S. government shared intel on Parbhoe with Dunford.

That intel included information about Parbhoe being “controlled opposition” and potentially being involved with money laundering.

Dunford shared that he was taken aback when he received this information on Parbhoe, as it shattered his illusion of her.

He wanted to believe she was the next Nayib Bukele — another pro-Bitcoin president — but what he learned from the intel changed his views on Parbhoe.

“She's linked in with nefarious people,” Dunford told Bitcoin Magazine. “She's controlled opposition — it's not a real candidacy.”

As mentioned, controlled opposition refers to a situation where voters feel they have an option in an election, but the option is either owned financially or coerced into complying with the sitting power in some manner.

In Parbhoe's case, Dunford believes that both are at play.

“The powers that be in the country have coerced her through financial manipulation and they own her,” said Dunford.

“This way, they could ensure that even if she got into some sort of power, that they would never be extradited to the EU,” he added. (When I first spoke with Parbhoe in July 2024, she said that the leaders of her country fear extradition, because, if extradited, they would be tried for the international crimes they've allegedly committed.)

“She puts on a policy platform that would make the people think, ‘Yeah, we're going to fight the powers — we're going to implement Bitcoin, blah, blah, blah, and that just isn't true because they are pulling her puppet strings.”

Dunford also shared that he is a specialist in controlled opposition and information operations (i.e., propaganda campaigns). He added that he trains special operations forces (e.g., Green Berets) on these topics.

On the evening before the two Greyscale security team members left Suriname, “unknown entities, perhaps members of national security services,” attempted a forced entry into the hotel room in which the two Greyscale team members were staying to “change a lightbulb,” as the unknown persons put it, according to Dunford.

“Speaking as a guy that does this, if you have bad placement on a microphone or a camera, you're not going to know that until you get back and you start to assess the audio and video — you might realize you can't hear the conversation or that there's something blocking the camera,” explained Dunford.

“So, they sent five really burly dudes to get into the hotel room to fix the batteries and the light or whatever it was, but we assessed that they were making a battery, camera, or microphone adjustment to correct their initial placement.”

I was in touch with these two Greyscale team members via text as this situation in the hotel played out, and they seemed genuinely concerned about their safety.

With that said, I was not able to find further information to corroborate that Parbhoe is “controlled opposition,” as Dunford put it.

According to Dunford, intel derived from an artificial intelligence system built by the U.S. government states that there's a highly credible chance that the bank accounts for Quickship Logistics and Icarus Geosystems are being used to launder funds.

A source privy to bank records at Quickship Logistics said he didn't get the sense that this sort of activity was happening through the company's bank accounts, though.

If one of Parbhoe's accounts were being used for such activity, it would more likely be the account for Icarus Geosystems, a company that builds infrastructure such as roads in remote regions of the country.

Parbhoe is the financial director of this company, and six-figure sums of money frequently flow through a bank account for the company, as per bank records obtained by Bitcoin Magazine.

I asked Parbhoe via email what some of the six-figure deposits were for via email and she responded with the following:

“Though Icarus is a private company, I can share that that's revenue from projects currently in progress at Newmont and housing development and a retaining wall/channel project in Guyana.” 

(Newmont is short for Newmont Corporation. The company has a subsidiary called Newmont Suriname, LLC — formerly Suriname Gold Company, LLC — which is a partially state-owned company.)

A company with the word “Newmont” in its name did in fact make a six-figure deposit on February 14, 2025.

In my research, I couldn't find anything to confirm or corroborate the notion that funds are being laundered through Parbhoe's companies' bank accounts, nor that she is involved with money laundering in any other way.

A number of sources described Parbhoe as “delusional,” “narcissistic,” and “mentally unstable,” but almost all of them were reluctant to call her a criminal.

“She's more delusional than fraudulent,” is how one source put it. “She's also very good at spinning the truth.”

In my personal interactions with Parbhoe, I've witnessed her stretch the truth on a number of occasions.

An example of this is last year at Bitcoin Amsterdam where I overheard her tell someone that she is an Oxford Alumni, when, in reality, she's only completed a weeks-long certificate program at the university — not a proper degree.

According to Mick, the founder of Geyser Fund, Parbhoe's Geyser campaign raised approximately $70,000 worth of bitcoin, as per bitcoin at a price of approximately $90,000.

(Other donors also donated to her campaign outside of Geyser, but those amounts haven't been made public.)

Because of recent reports of Parbhoe's lack of forthrightness, Geyser Fund has taken down Parbhoe's “Maya for President” donations page.

For some time, Parbhoe published a campaign funds tracker, and she seemed to take pride in being transparent about where the funds were going.

Huge milestone for campaign transparency! 🚀For the first time in history, a candidate can share live updates on how campaign funds are being spent. No more static overviews, now you can track the campaign balance and expenses in real time, directly on our website!This is all… pic.twitter.com/5Obp961rc4

She's recently taken down the campaign funds tracker, though.

When I asked Parbhoe for an overview of expenses, she provided me with a link to this document (screenshot below), which only has eight line items.

Taghizadegan mentioned in his X post that some funds were spent on bringing renowned economist Arthur Laffer to Suriname to publicly voice his support for Parbhoe on the ground and on camera.

Parbhoe provided more information on this in my email communication with her.

“Arthur Laffer was engaged by a third party and paid by him, John, who himself negotiated terms with Dr. Laffer,” wrote Parbhoe. “He is engaged to be economic advisor once [I'm] elected.”

(Parbhoe didn't make it clear who “John” was, but judging by the context in the email, it seems he was a major donor to the campaign.)

While in Suriname, Parbhoe conducted an on-camera interview with Laffer, which was published via the Bitcoin Magazine YouTube channel.

(When Parbhoe reached out to me about publishing the video, which I helped facilitate, she did not mention that Laffer was paid to visit Suriname.)

In the interview with Parbhoe, Laffer spoke about Parbhoe's plans for Bitcoin adoption on the ground in Suriname.

However, there are no reports of him speaking about Bitcoin adoption with those with whom he engaged while on the ground in Suriname, despite the fact that he spoke with NPS about money and government financing.

“He gave a presentation for the NPS, which had a great impact on how the party views taxes and monetary incentives,” wrote Parbhoe.

Parbhoe also paid Daniel Batten $2,500 in total, though half of that funding came from Daedalus Labs, according to her.

Parbhoe wrote that Batten's services were helpful in part because the breathing techniques he taught her helped her to cope with a situation that occurred approximately one week before she gave birth in which she was hospitalized and claims she was taken off of IV and left without water while she needed to be hydrated. She communicated this story to me shortly after this happened and believed it was an attempt on her life.

Shamay, who claims to have worked for her pro bono, said that she'd agreed to pay her campaign manager $15,000 per month, but her most recent campaign manager quit after only being paid $8,500 after two months.

Parbhoe's aforementioned billboard expense cost the campaign $35,000, and she paid Greyscale $27,000 for its services.

Parbhoe continues to campaign despite the challenges she's faced as of late. However, she also says that the birth of her child has put the election in perspective for her.

“These last few weeks, I have undergone more trauma than I have endured my entire life,” wrote Parbhoe.

“The thought of losing my daughter, if you had given me 21 million Bitcoin, I would have spent it all to save her life. No election is worth her life,” she added. 

“At this point, I don't care if I win.”

Parbhoe also stated that whether or not she wins the election, she'll continue to fight for Bitcoin adoption in Suriname past election day.

“I'll do my best, I'll fight for [my daughter's] future and continue beyond May 25th,” wrote Parbhoe.

She concluded her final email to me with a quote from Bitcoin's creator, Satoshi Nakamoto:

“If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry.”

What Parbhoe seemed to miss in making this final statement is that campaigning for political office is literally the process of convincing people that you're the right person for the job. And, right now, many, including a number of former members of her team, don't seem to feel that she is.

I don't know for sure whether Parbhoe is controlled opposition or if she's just someone struggling to execute a vision.

But I do know that trust is a difficult thing to win back — especially when it comes to the Bitcoin community — and her lack of forthrightness has done considerable damage to her reputation.

Having been in touch with Parbhoe on a semi-regular basis for the past eight months, I'd imagine, in her mind, her plan looked something like this:

Some of this played out. The problem was that many who supported her eventually rescinded their efforts when they saw up close what was happening with Parbhoe.

But the most maddening part of this whole scenario is that if Dunford is right in that Parbhoe is “controlled opposition” — that her campaign has been little more than a ruse and that she's working with “nefarious actors” behind the scenes — then the majority of this piece was written for naught and Parbhoe should simply be classified as the first major scammer of this cycle.

If this is the case, please accept my apology for helping to platform Parbhoe via Bitcoin Magazine.

And whether this is the case or not, this situation has been a strong reminder of the popular Bitcoin-related adage: Don't trust, verify.

Some of us — myself included — should not so readily believe that certain characters in this space, especially political figures, are everything they purport to be.

Bitcoin (BTC) price is extending its gains, trading above $97,000 at the time of writing on Friday after breaking above the key resistance level of $95,000 the previous day. Ethereum (ETH) approaches a key level of resistance, while Ripple (XRP) finds support around a significant level; a decisive close above these levels could pave the way for a bullish run.

Bitcoin price broke above its key resistance level of $95,000 on Thursday after consolidating around it for the past five days and reaching a high of $97,400. At the time of writing on Friday, it trades at around $97,000.

If BTC continues its upward momentum and closes above its daily resistance at $97,700, it could extend the gains to retest its psychological resistance at $100,000.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart reads 70, hovering around its overbought level of 70. However, traders should be cautious as the chances of a pullback are high around the overbought level at 70. Another possibility is that the RSI will remain above the overbought levels and continue its price rally.

BTC/USDT daily chart

However, if BTC fails to close above $97,700, it could face a correction toward its next daily support at $95,000.

Ethereum price has been consolidating between $1,700 and $1,861 since last week. At the time of writing on Friday, it is nearing its upper consolidating boundary at $1,861.

If ETH breaks and closes above the daily resistance at $1,861, it could extend the rally to retest its psychological importance level at $2,000.

The RSI on the daily chart stands at 58, above its neutral level of 50, indicating bullish momentum.

ETH/USDT daily chart

Conversely, if ETH declines and closes below $1,700, it could extend the losses to retest its next daily support at $1,449.

XRP price retested and found support around its previously broken 50-day EMA level at $2.20 on Wednesday, stabilizing at this level the next day. At the time of writing on Friday, it continues to hold around this level.

If the support level at $2.20 holds, XRP will extend the rally to retest its March 24 high of $2.50 before potentially reaching $3.00.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 54 above its neutral level of 50, indicating bullish momentum.

XRP/USDT daily chart

On the other hand, if XRP fails to find support around the $2.20 level, it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $1.96.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.

Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility. 

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

As it trades just above $96,000, up 2.14% on the day, Bitcoin is getting close to a turning point. It is currently in a technical vacuum following a robust recovery in late April; neither significant resistance nor obvious support is located right above it or below. A significant volatility spike that determines the market's course for weeks or even months frequently precedes this kind of price structure.

If momentum returns, Bitcoin has the potential to soar higher because there are not any nearby resistance zones. However, the opposite is also true: the asset is extremely susceptible to steep declines in the event that bulls lose control because there is not an immediate support buffer until approximately $89,000.  

With the RSI at 68, which is getting close to the overbought threshold, momentum is still strong but may be peaking. But the volume remains low, which is a warning sign. In the absence of increased participation, this breakout could turn into a bull trap. The course of the subsequent volatility spike will determine everything that happens next. 

A new leg up that might target the psychological $100,000 level and beyond could be started by a clean break above $97,000 with high volume. Alternatively, a collapse below the $93,000-$92,000 range would probably lead to $89,000 or even lower, indicating the end of this rally and possibly igniting a general market correction. 

Bitcoin is perched on the edge of a tight market. Since no safety net is in sight, the next big move — up or down — will not merely be another leg; rather, it will determine the framework for the cycle's subsequent phase. Hold on tight because this level of calm is short-lived.

As it tests the upper limit of a descending channel that has characterized its price action since January 2025, XRP is poised for a significant move. Just below the $2.40 resistance, a crucial level that, if broken, could lead to a volatility breakout, the asset is currently trading at about $2.37, up 2.12% for the day.

With declining volume suggesting that a breakout — or breakdown — is imminent, the chart clearly shows that XRP is compressing toward the tip of a wedge following months of lower highs and lower lows. The fact that XRP has surpassed all three major moving averages, the 50, 100 and 200 EMA, and that they are now converging around the $2.20 region, is encouraging for bulls.

Vitalik Buterin Reveals Ethereum (ETH) 2025 Game Plan: Details

ByTomiwabold Olajide





This confluence serves as a dynamic floor of support. Because the asset is not yet overbought, the RSI remains neutral at 55, providing it with room to rise sharply. The volume is still low, but given how swiftly XRP moves when sentiment changes, any increase in buying interest around $2.40 could spark a quick rally to the $2.80-$3.00 region. 

Technically speaking, XRP is acting in a positive way. It made a clean recovery from the April bottom of the wedge and is now marking higher lows, which suggests that buyers are intervening more forcefully. The consolidation that is occurring close to the top of the descending channel is an indication of increasing pressure, not weakness.

Strong volume and a clean breakout above $2.40 would validate the trend reversal and probably signal the start of a period of increased volatility and quick gains. On the other hand, if the 200 EMA is not held above $2.20, it may retest around $1.98.

With its strong 3.14% daily gain, Ethereum has pushed to $1,850, igniting cautious optimism about a wider recovery. This rally might not be as strong as it first appears, at least not yet, according to a closer examination of the market environment and chart structure. As of right now, ETH is trading just above its 50-day EMA, which it recently flipped into support. 

Generally speaking a sustained breakout above this level is a bullish indication, particularly when combined with price consolidation close to the top. The 100 EMA, which is at $2,148, and the 200 EMA, which is at $2,469, represent the next important test. These moving averages could confirm a reversal and restore medium-term bullish momentum if they break cleanly. The problem is that the volume is not very impressive.

Dogecoin (DOGE) to $0.20 Possible If History Repeats Itself

ByGodfrey Benjamin





Although Ethereum's price is rising, the stability of this trend is undermined by the lack of robust buying activity. Significant ETH reversals in the past have been marked by spikes in volume and volatility, neither of which is present at the moment. This means that if the mood of the market changes or if Bitcoin begins to correct, the current move could be quickly reversed.

The RSI, which is at 59, indicates that ETH has some leeway before hitting overbought levels, but it might not mean much if volume does not increase. Although it is speculative at best without confirmation, this could be seen as quiet accumulation. Overall, the recovery is brittle even though Ethereum is displaying early indications of strength. 

With increasing volume and volatility, ETH must decisively break through the 100 EMA for the market to fully embrace a bullish narrative. Until then, it would be more accurate to consider this move a cautious bounce rather than a complete trend reversal. Keep a close eye on the $2,150 zone; it will determine ETH's short-term destiny.

Famous XRP advocate ‘All Things XRP' sheds light on Eric Trump's utter silence about XRP despite publicly praising Ethereum, revealing potential factors behind the snub. 

In an X thread, the commentator asserted that Eric and the Trump family-backed crypto project, World Liberty Financial, has entirely snubbed XRP while focusing on Ethereum and Bitcoin. 

Specifically, he recalled when Eric tweeted it was a ‘great time to buy' ETH in February 2025. A few days later, Eric made some bullish comments about Bitcoin. 

As reported earlier, he suggested that the market dynamics at the time presented investors with an opportunity to buy more Bitcoin. These bullish comments, according to All Things XRP, drove the price of Bitcoin upwards toward $98,000.

While Eric has been bullish about Ethereum and Bitcoin, the analyst stressed that Trump's son has disregarded XRP. He added that Trump's World Liberty Financial has also completely ignored XRP while investing tens of millions of dollars in ETH. 

The commentator highlighted how the crypto project purchased around $48 million worth of ETH this year, with zero XRP acquisition. World Liberty's crypto portfolio features major assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins, and Tron. However, there is no trace of XRP in the project's portfolio. 

The community figure questioned the rationale behind ignoring XRP despite its payment utility and proposed inclusion in the U.S. crypto reserve initiative. He highlighted the potential reasons behind Eric and World Liberty's silence on XRP. 

 All Things XRP emphasized that XRP's embroilment in the SEC v. Ripple lawsuit remains ‘messy.' He noted that the coin was labeled a security and dragged through the court. 

Despite acknowledging that the legal mess has been cleaned up, All Things XRP suggested that the Trump crypto project and Eric might be avoiding the coin due to this regulatory baggage. 

Furthermore, the commentator highlighted World Liberty's strategic focus as another reason XRP has been ignored, noting that the project is positioning itself around DeFi. They characterized Ethereum as a DeFi engine, Bitcoin as digital gold, and XRP as cross-border rails. 

Therefore, All Things XRP asserted that since the Trump family crypto project is positioning itself around DeFi, ‘XRP does not fit that mold yet.'  

Regarding political optics, the expert stated that the Trump brand usually backs winners and completely avoids scandals. The commentator suggested that any attempt by the brand to indirectly mention XRP might attract political criticism. 

All Things XRP suggested that market dynamics might also influence Eric and World Liberty's silence about XRP. He noted that while Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate headlines and liquidity, XRP lives in a ‘niche.' 

Given Bitcoin and Ethereum dominance, the expert said it is “safer” to ignore XRP, especially if the project is playing the optics game. 

Finally, All Things XRP noted that this silence might not be an outright rejection of XRP. Instead, it could be that the Trump brand is waiting for regulatory clarity before proceeding. The expert asserted that the Trump crypto empire has plans for XRP but has not disclosed them publicly.

🔟 Don't Ignore What's Not Said.

Sometimes, the loudest message… is silence.

Trump's crypto empire has plans. XRP just isn't public—yet.

Oops, something went wrong

Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street. 

After rallying more than 11% off the April 22 move, Ethereum has spent the last six days stuck in a tight consolidation range between $1,744 and $1,835. This comes after a strong move higher that showed strength from bulls, but since then, ETH has struggled to expand further as momentum has cooled. Broader market volatility has also declined, with the VIX topping out near 60 earlier this month and now trading closer to 25, suggesting a quieter environment across the board.

For now, Ethereum is coiling in a narrow structure, and the next directional move out of this range will likely set the tone for the coming weeks. If bulls want to see continued upside, the first goal will be to break and hold above $1,835. However, caution is still warranted even on a breakout, as ETH remains about 8% below the next significant upside level at $1,956 — the April high.

A clean reclaim of $1,956 could open the door to higher prices, but without strong follow-through, there's a risk of false breakouts. Momentum will be key. Traders should be patient and wait for confirmation rather than getting caught chasing price within a still-choppy environment.

Key Upside Levels to Watch:

$1,835: Top of the current 6-day consolidation range.

$1,956: April high and the next major upside target.

$2,140: Important daily level where ETH tried to form a base before breaking down; also aligns with the March 24-25 swing high.

$2,520 – $2,700: Major high-timeframe zone formed after the March 2 crypto reserve announcement.

If Ethereum can clear $1,956, the next major level to watch would be $2,140. This area is important because on the daily chart, ETH previously tried to build a base here before breaking down, and it matches up with the March 24-25 swing high, making it a strong technical zone.

Beyond $2,140, bulls will have their eyes on the $2,520 to $2,700 range. This zone is a major high-timeframe area created during the rally that followed the crypto reserve announcement. It represents a previous swing high where heavy profit-taking took place. A clean reclaim of this zone would suggest a much broader structural shift for Ethereum, potentially setting the stage for a stronger trend reversal.

Until then, Ethereum remains trapped in its six-day consolidation. Tight price action like this often precedes a larger breakout move, and with broader volatility metrics like the VIX continuing to decline, the next expansion could happen quickly and catch a lot of market participants off-guard.

For now, the playbook is simple: stay patient while ETH is inside the range, monitor the key levels mentioned above, and be ready for volatility to return once this compression phase resolves.

BTC breaks resistance, invalidates short-term bearish setup

Bitcoin has officially closed above $95,000, breaking its six-day rejection streak and invalidating the previously anticipated pullback scenario. With price action now clearly above the daily, 4h, and weekly TBO Clouds, this marks a strong bullish shift. Daily RSI has remained overbought for 10 days, signaling sustained momentum, though daily Volume remains slightly below the yellow MA line.

Weekly signals are growing more bullish. OBV is expected to cross back above its moving average, and RSI continues to rise. A weekly close above 70 on RSI would open the door to a move beyond the current ATH of $109K. With major Fibonacci levels now mapped, the next resistance zones are: $100–$103K, $117–$123K, $138K, and $173K. However, overhead resistance drawn from 2021 still looms around $99,800, reinforcing the importance of this next leg higher.



Dominance and market structure show BTC leading the way

Stablecoin dominance continues to fall inside the daily TBO Cloud, signaling a shift toward risk-on assets. While current action mirrors the whipsaw behavior of September 2024, this typically leads to broader market rallies. Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) is still climbing with RSI at 77.47 and weekly resistance at 71.39% in sight, signaling ongoing capital inflow into BTC.

Meanwhile, Top 10 Dominance continues to struggle. The daily and weekly charts are both bearish, while OTHERS.D has broken prior resistance but now contends with dominance shifting back toward BTC. RSI has broken support, but the OTHERS market cap chart still looks strong with continued OBV growth and a recent TBO Open Long.

Total market structure reflects BTC pause, altcoin sentiment remains cautiously bullish

TOTAL remains stalled just below $3T, while TOTAL3 (excluding BTC and ETH) has already confirmed a TBO Open Long. Although a TBO Close Long printed on the 4h chart, this is an early warning rather than a guaranteed reversal. OTHERS also closed a TBO Open Long, though 4h signals show potential short-term weakness.

Volatility remains low with BVOL7D back in the Bounce Zone. The setup resembles October 2024—another signal suggesting the market may be coiling for a breakout.

TradFi trends upward while Gold confirms cooling

The VIX continues to fall, signaling reduced volatility, while Gold has retraced into its daily TBO Cloud, signaling bearish consolidation. PAXG/BTC confirmed a TBO Open Short, and BTC/Gold is close to confirming an Open Long—favoring Bitcoin's outperformance over Gold in the months ahead.

Altcoins begin to diverge with mixed signals across the board

ETH and SOL are slowly benefiting from BTC's momentum but are both limited by weak volume. ADA, LINK, and LTC are outperforming, with LINK confirming a TBO Open Long and LTC closing above long-term resistance. AAVE followed suit but still needs to close above the 0.5 Fibonacci level to confirm.

SUI and TAO are showing signs of exhaustion, while S, QNT, IMX, and KAIA are seeing renewed interest with TBO Open Longs printing or forming. OM flashed a 4h TBO Breakdown, indicating potential downside risk, while TWT printed a second TBO Close Short yesterday.

Conclusion

Bitcoin closing above $95K is a significant milestone and clears the way for a run to $100K and beyond. While BTC shows strong macro signals, short-term volume remains soft. Dominance remains firmly with BTC, causing altcoin momentum to remain inconsistent. As long as BTC stays above key levels and TradFi maintains its risk-on tone, the broader crypto market is likely to continue its bullish expansion into Q2.

As investors are eager to identify crypto tokens with immense growth potential as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu falter, RCO Finance, XRP, and ADA are emerging as the top altcoins to buy. Each project presents unique innovations and market positioning, with RCO Finance's rapid presale growth and innovative features particularly catching investor attention.

In this overview, we'll examine why these tokens are the top altcoins to buy and potentially your best bet. 

As you weigh your next investment, ask yourself: do you want to follow the crowd or lead it? The top altcoins to buy are those with proven backing, real utility, a growing DeFi ecosystem, and explosive potential—and RCOF checks every single box.

RCO Finance's rise centers on its intelligent robo-advisor—an advanced digital assistant that collaborates with users. This sophisticated AI analyzes market data, filters opportunities, and offers real-time, customized trade suggestions on the DeFi platform.

Had you used this robo-advisor in 2024 for tapping games like Tapswap and Notcoin, you would have identified the most profitable options. This would have saved you time by steering clear of unprofitable ventures.

What makes this decentralized platform unique is its focus on user success. On May 7, 2025, RCO Finance will introduce CRM Sync and User Behavior Tracking, improving onboarding and engagement tools for a personalized trading experience.

Starting May 24, RCO Finance will also enable crypto-funded demo trading, allowing users to trade without sharing bank details or waiting for approvals. Simply fund a demo account with crypto, instantly converted to USDT. This secure process, backed by SolidProof's smart contract auditing, boosts transparency and investor trust.



XRP has risen 9% this week, hitting a new monthly high of $2.35, driven by strong buying interest in a Reverse Head and Shoulders pattern. Experts are evaluating its potential as one of the top altcoins to buy, as it still aims to reach the recent peak of $3.18 from 90 days ago.

From analyst Ali's perspective, the $2.70 – $2.90 price range seems to be the most realistic target. For this to happen, XRP price would have to bounce off the right shoulder, while a daily closure above the $2.25 demand zone would strengthen the bullish thesis as XRP Ledger nears 7 million crypto wallets.

Cardano (ADA) has demonstrated notable strength in recent trading sessions, making it one of the top altcoins to buy. ADA's price has risen approximately 11.8% over the past week, and over the past month, it has appreciated by about 4.6%.

Technical analysis indicates that ADA is testing a significant resistance zone between $0.70 and $0.75. A successful breakout above this range could pave the way for a rally towards $1.00. Conversely, failure to breach this resistance may result in a pullback to support levels around $0.62 or $0.58.

While XRP and ADA are among the top altcoins to buy in May, RCOF is stealing the spotlight, having successfully raised over $17 million in its ongoing token presale. Currently priced at $0.13, market experts believe RCOF has even greater potential ahead.

Forecasts suggest that RCOF could surge by over 900% during the remaining presale stages, potentially reaching $0.60 at its launch. Some analysts even speculate that the token price could see an astonishing 5000% increase in the second quarter of 2025 alone.

In addition to its potential as one of the top altcoins to buy in the market, investors will benefit from discounts on transaction fees, making trading more cost-effective. Plus, they will also have a say in the platform's governance, enabling them to influence key decisions related to network operations.

Don't miss out on one of the top altcoins to buy today— the rewards could be significant!

Bitcoin's dominance relative to other major cryptocurrencies continues to soar reaching a new 4-year high.

Bitcoin's (BTC) dominance has surged to 64%, a four-year high, signaling its unrivaled strength in the cryptocurrency market. This metric, which measures Bitcoin's share of the total crypto market capitalization, reflects a growing preference for Bitcoin as a safe haven amid economic uncertainty. 

As BTC's price hovers above $96,000, institutional inflows via ETFs and corporate treasury adoption, like Metaplanet's 5,000 BTC holdings, are fueling this rally. But what does this mean for other major blockchain chains like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Binance Chain (BNB)?

ETH, despite a recent 15% surge to $1,800 over the last two weeks, struggles with a market dominance of just 7.4%, its lowest since January 2020. Its ETH/BTC ratio, at 0.115, underscores BTC's outperformance, driven by ETH's high transaction costs and slower innovation compared to newer layer-1 chains. 

Solana and Binance Chain, while gaining traction for faster transactions, lack the institutional trust Bitcoin commands. Analysts suggest Bitcoin's dominance may peak soon, potentially triggering an altcoin season as capital rotates to undervalued projects. However, regulatory uncertainty and weak fundamentals in many altcoins could delay this shift.

For now, Bitcoin's dominance stifles altcoin growth, as investors prioritize its proven store-of-value narrative over speculative ventures. Chains like Ethereum and Solana, meanwhile, are trying to innovate rapidly or risk losing further ground. Solana's focus on scalability offers hope, but without broader adoption, altcoins face a prolonged trough of disillusionment. Bitcoin's reign, backed by BlackRock's Larry Fink calling it a hedge against U.S. debt and orange-pilled BTC maxis like Strategy'S Michael Saylor, suggests altcoins still need compelling use cases to compete.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Google Adds Blockchain Tech to Wallet to Let Users Prove Age Without Sharing Data","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/02/google-adds-zero-knowledge-proofs-to-wallet-for-age-verification","Fri, 02 May 2025 11:21:25 GMT","

Google is rolling out a privacy-focused upgrade to its Wallet service that uses zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) technology for age verification, per a release.

The company said that the dating app Bumble, among others, will be one of the first partners to use this system. Bumble will use digital IDs issued through Google Wallet for user verification, while ZKPs will handle age confirmation.

The move allows users to prove they're old enough to access certain apps or websites without revealing their birthdates or personal identifying data. ZKP is one of the biggest use cases for blockchains apart from real-world assets and payments, though it has yet to find popularity outside of niche circles.

Google said the system was developed in response to the growing number of services requiring age checks, from dating platforms to e-commerce and social media. “We wanted to develop a system that not only verifies age, but does it in a way that protects your privacy,” it said.

The ZKP cryptographic method lets someone prove a fact (like being over 18) without revealing how they know it or any more information. 

Traditional ID-based age verification methods, in contrast, often require revealing government-issued documents or date of birth, creating privacy and data security risks.

This is done using a complex blockchain-based system that runs a condition (such as age) in an encrypted form, generating a proof, and letting an outside system verify it using public keys, ensuring privacy without exposing the underlying information.

The implementation is now live in Google Wallet and works across mobile devices and apps using Google's Digital Credential API, which means it can be embedded into third-party sites and platforms.

ZK-based tokens are up 1.7% on average in the past 24 hours, CoinGecko sector data shows. The sector could be one to keep an eye on as giants like Google adopt ZKP technology - bringing demand to the privacy-first sector that has generally fallen out of investor interest in past years.

Oops, something went wrong

Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street. 

Chicago, IL – May 2, 2025 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Visa Inc. V, HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. HIVE and Accenture plc ACN.

The cryptocurrency market suffered in the first quarter of 2025 and struggled to rebound in April. The crypto market has been taking a hit as part of the broader market slump. However, the final days of April saw cryptocurrencies staging a rebound, with Bitcoin (BTC) back in the race to surpass $100,000.

Bitcoin price is still more than 10% lower than its all-time high attained in December 2024. However, experts believe that the cryptocurrency is on track to surpass $140,000 once global trade tensions ease and the Federal Reserve resumes its rate cuts.

Given this situation, it would be ideal to buy the dip. We have selected four stocks, namely NVIDIA Corp., Visa Inc., HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. and Accenture plc. Each of these stocks has strong growth potential for 2025 and has seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 90 days.

Bitcoin's rebound came as the broader market rebounded last week after President Donald Trump said that he is ready for trade negotiations with China, while the White House is already having trade talks with several nations. Trump's comments gave the broader market a major boost. Cryptocurrencies also rallied. The momentum continued into this week, with Bitcoin surpassing $95,000 on Wednesday.

Trump's tariff announcement triggered a major stock market selloff over the next few sessions, causing Bitcoin's value to drop below $74,000. However, markets have rebounded since he announced a 90-day halt on tariffs earlier in April.

Market participants are also hopeful that the Federal Reserve could resume its rate cuts after inflation dipped in March for the first time since May 2020. Also, Trump has been pushing for rate cuts to bolster the economy.

The Commerce Department reported on Wednesday that the U.S. GDP shrank 0.3% in the first quarter, raising concerns among investors. However, investors still held their nerves as many believe that one of the major factors behind this is that consumers spent less and saved more after Trump announced reciprocal tariffs. However, the fears have eased substantially over the past few weeks, and the economy may have recovered in April.

peaq was designed to meet the needs of DePINs, offering native features for identity, machine coordination, and real-world data validation

Calin-H/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks

Physical infrastructure is becoming increasingly intelligent, connected, and autonomous. But while machines are generating more data and services than ever before, that value still flows to a handful of centralized platforms and corporations. 

DePINs (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) level the playing field.

Instead of relying on a single company to own and operate the physical infrastructure we use daily, DePINs enable communities to build and run these networks themselves, using blockchain to coordinate machines, verify activity, and distribute rewards fairly among participants.

It's a powerful shift: infrastructure is owned and operated by the people who use it. And this shift needs a blockchain purpose-built for the real world.

Unlike general-purpose chains, peaq was designed from the ground up to meet the needs of DePINs, offering native features for identity, machine coordination, and real-world data validation.

 → Explore what makes peaq different

In this article, we'll explore why DePINs need their own dedicated blockchain, how general-purpose chains fall short, and why peaq is uniquely equipped to support this new era of real-world Web3 apps.

Many DePIN projects today begin on general-purpose blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, or Polygon. These networks are battle-tested and widely adopted, but they weren't built with the physical world in mind.

That creates real friction for DePIN builders—general-purpose blockchains and their ecosystems were designed for digital assets, not real-world devices. 

When it comes to managing fleets of machines, processing real-world data, or enabling seamless user interactions with hardware, these chains often fall short. The more physical infrastructure you try to onboard, the more those shortcomings begin to show.

Here are a few of the most common challenges:

Lack of standardization across devices and interactionsDePINs rely on seamless coordination between thousands—sometimes millions—of machines. But general-purpose chains offer no standardized frameworks for things like device identity, access control, or time-based coordination. Without shared protocols, builders are forced to create their own ad-hoc solutions, making it harder to scale networks or ensure reliable real-world performance.

Latency and scalability limitationsMachines operate in real time. General-purpose chains often can't keep up with the speed and volume of physical-world transactions, especially as networks scale—and chains for real machines cannot afford any downtime.

Poor integration with real-world devices and dataConnecting hardware to a blockchain isn't straightforward. Most chains lack native tools for device identity, data validation, or time-sensitive coordination.

Lack of native incentives and financial infrastructureGeneral-purpose chains do nothing to boost the DePINs' innate rewards mechanisms and don't provide any DeFi frameworks that would capitalize on DePINs' unique value proposition.

Limited customization for physical assetsDePINs often need specialized logic, security models, or governance structures. General-purpose chains offer flexibility—but not the kind that's tailored for physical infrastructure.

As a result, DePIN builders are forced to cobble together workarounds, rely heavily on off-chain systems, or compromise on performance. That limits the real-world impact of what these networks can achieve.

Unlike DeFi or NFTs, DePINs are doing more than moving assets on a screen. They coordinate real-world machines, processing physical data, and managing interactions between devices, users, and infrastructure. 

That brings a new set of requirements that most blockchains simply weren't built to handle.

Imagine trying to run a network of autonomous delivery drones that need to verify their location, log actions in real time, and interact with other machines around them. If the underlying blockchain can't process those updates fast enough or in synchronicity—or doesn't support real-world data validation natively—then the entire system risks delays, errors, or loss of trust.

A dedicated Layer 1 removes those limitations. When the architecture is designed for physical infrastructure from the start, it can optimize for the kinds of interactions DePINs rely on: low-latency updates between machines, scalable data handling at the edge, and built-in support for identity, coordination, timing, and trust.

We've seen this pattern in other parts of technology. Vertical software outperforms generic tools because it's purpose-built for the specific needs of a user. In the same way, a Layer 1 tailored to DePINs can unlock entirely new business models that wouldn't be feasible otherwise.

peaq was purpose-built to support decentralized infrastructure in the physical world; it's not retrofitted for DePINs, it's engineered around them. 

At its core, peaq is a Layer 1 that functions like an operating system for the Machine Economy, empowering real-world apps to coordinate machines, manage data, and distribute value in a decentralized way.

Most importantly: peaq isn't a pitch. It's already happening.

Since launching, peaq has secured collaborations with global enterprises and innovators who see the potential of DePINs to reshape industries.

What makes peaq uniquely equipped for DePINs is its native stack of DePIN-specific features, including:

Together, these features allow DePINs to coordinate machines, verify real-world actions, and maintain trustless integrity without centralized intermediaries. As the peaq function stack develops, DePINs will have more and more of their architecture pre-built, enabling them to deploy and scale faster. 

Beyond these and other core Modular DePIN Functions, peaq also offers full interoperability with other Web3 ecosystems and permissionless deployment. Builders can launch, scale, and evolve their DePINs without needing approval or relying on proprietary infrastructure. This standardization enables a unique feature that peaq refers to as machine composability: A device's ability to contribute to multiple DePINs. For example, a self-driving car can provide rides or do deliveries while collecting navigation and traffic data via DePINs on peaq.

Another key benefit is the network effect that comes with a full-on focus on a specific sector. On peaq, a new DePIN joins dozens of other similar-minded projects, which unlocks a wide array of synergies, such as the recent partnership between SkyX and Quakecore, which gives both projects more valuable data to work with. The same goes for the community, with any new DePIN launching into a crowd of DePIN enthusiasts and early adopters. 

peaq's economic model is similarly built to boost DePINs, and it's now developing its Machine DeFi ecosystem, which will bring to life new and innovative DeFi tools focused on real-world value. This grants DePINs additional opportunities to create value and expands the utility of their tokens. 

Across sectors like weather data, environmental monitoring, agriculture, and connectivity, DePINs building on peaq are creating tangible value by tapping into communities, distributing ownership, and solving problems traditional infrastructure has left behind.

Here are two projects leading that charge:

SkyX is building a decentralized network of smart weather stations to crowdsource hyper-local meteorological data from around the world. Industries like agriculture, aviation, and logistics rely on weather insights, but many regions suffer from poor coverage and centralized bottlenecks.

SkyX empowers anyone to deploy a weather station, collect valuable data, and earn rewards in SKY tokens. Their data fuels a decentralized platform with AI-powered analytics and natural language interfaces (like SkyXGPT) for both consumer and enterprise use.

Follow SkyX on X.

Farmsent is building a Web3 marketplace that connects farmers directly with retailers, cutting out centralized middlemen and restoring value to the people who grow our food.

With over 160,000 farmers onboarded across Indonesia and Colombia, Farmsent is already tracking shipments of coffee, avocado, and palm sugar across four countries. It combines this marketplace with a sensor-based DePIN that ensures full traceability of food products from soil to shelf.

On peaq, Farmsent uses peaq ID for farmers and farm devices, stores data on-chain, and deploys smart contracts for transparent rewards and logistics. Its token will launch natively on the network, forming the backbone of its growing agricultural data economy.

The projects above are more than examples of technical innovation. They signal a fundamental shift in how infrastructure is built, governed, and rewarded.

Fortnite maker Epic Games' antitrust case against Apple benefited the crypto industry on Thursday, when the iPhone maker loosened restrictions on developers' ability to offer apps in the U.S. that direct users to non-standard purchasing methods or digital collectibles.

Apple updated its iOS App Store review guidelines after a U.S. District Judge found this week that the tech titan “willfully” violated a court injunction issued in 2021. Moving forward, the federal court prohibited Apple from collecting fees on purchases made outside of its iOS apps (currently 27%) or limiting developers' ability to direct users to third-party websites.

In an email obtained by Decrypt, Apple notified iOS developers that “apps on the United States storefront are [no longer] prohibited from including buttons, external links, or other calls to action when allowing users to browse NFT collections owned by others.”

“The prohibition on encouraging users to use a purchasing method other than in-app purchase does not apply on the United States storefront,” the email added.

Although the loosened restrictions do not apply to in-app features, such as buying premium content or in-game boosts, they may lead to a “generational golden consumer crypto bull run,” Wojciech Kulikowski, a software engineer at Farcaster, wrote on the decentralized media protocol.

“This will allow for more experimentation with crypto-native mobile apps that were previously often blocked from Apple [iOS] App Store,” he told Decrypt.

In practice, NFT marketplaces like OpenSea have limited functionality through their iOS apps. Users are able to browse a panoply of NFT collections, but they can not purchase them.

Some companies, including Magic Eden, have released digital wallets that allow users to make in-app purchases using a browser embedded in their application. The feature mirrors self-custodial wallets offered by firms like MetaMask, Coinbase, and Uniswap.

Apple's iOS App Store review guidelines still include strict restrictions when it comes to cryptocurrencies. Crypto apps cannot offer currency for completing tasks, facilitate initial coin offerings, also known as ICOs, or leverage users' devices to mine digital assets.

Google updated its Google Play Store policies in 2023, allowing NFTs to unlock in-app content regardless of where they were purchased. Apple's chief rival in the mobile space also required game developers to disclose whether their experiences were blockchain-based, similar to the Epic Games' platform.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.

Aptos APT/USD is expanding its scope beyond traditional crypto verticals like DeFi and NFTs, with a growing focus on real-world consumer applications, particularly in payments, HR systems and micro-credit.

That's according to Ash Pampati, Head of Ecosystem at the Aptos Foundation, who spoke in an interview with Benzinga about where the Layer 1 network is aiming to differentiate itself.

""We feel there are two evergreen areas that will last forever: trading and payments,"" Pampati said. 

While trading spans both crypto-native and traditional assets, Pampati emphasized the potential of blockchain to fundamentally reshape how money moves and how services are built for consumers around the world.

""You can open up micro-streaming payments, remittance, cross-border transfers,"" he said. ""We're already seeing founders build native HR payroll software fully on-chain or extend credit networks to emerging markets."" 

He added that such applications are not just rebrands of legacy models, but entirely new structures only feasible because of on-chain architecture.

In addition to payments and credit, Aptos is increasingly focused on decentralized infrastructure, particularly where it can solve longstanding Web2 data bottlenecks. 

Pampati said one of the biggest barriers to blockchain adoption in areas like social media and content streaming is the lack of usable, composable data. ""We're working on how to unlock that data so big networks or dApps can actually be fully powered on-chain.""

This product-oriented vision comes as Aptos pushes to carve out competitive territory in a landscape increasingly dominated by Ethereum L2s, modular blockchains and fast-rising alternatives like Solana.

According to Pampati, Aptos's architecture allows it to handle enterprise-grade performance requirements and consumer-grade user experience expectations simultaneously.

""When you have the fastest, most performant, high throughput L1 integrating a stablecoin, you automatically have the cheapest and most efficient dollar on the internet,"" he said, referencing Aptos's integration with the Hong Kong dollar (e-HKD) and support for other stablecoins like USDC.

The foundation's efforts are also gaining traction in the real-world asset (RWA) sector. 

Pampati noted that Aptos currently ranks among the top four chains by RWA total value locked (TVL), even ahead of Solana in that category. 

""What we're really focused on is the utilization of those assets in native Web3 use cases,"" he said, adding that Aptos plans to onboard Aave, one of the largest DeFi money markets, in the coming months, its first expansion beyond EVM chains.

While many blockchains position themselves as general-purpose networks, Aptos is explicitly focused on long-term adoption scenarios where billions of users could eventually be onboarded. 

""We've had 99% uptime since launch. Our CEO and founding team are obsessed with performance. They built blockchain systems at Meta to support billion-user apps,"" Pampati said.

He added that the network's focus on reliability is critical to standing out. ""We're here for the future. Institutions have signaled they trust us, the network and the team. That kind of equity takes time to build.""

Claynosaurz, an NFT-driven entertainment brand that first set up shop on Solana, is expanding to a second blockchain: Sui.

The announcement came during Token2049's Sui Basecamp event, where Claynosaurz CEO Andrew Pelekis outlined how the team is setting its sights on a broader frontier for interactive digital IP—starting with a series of upcoming launches tied to collectibles, gaming, and community engagement.

The expansion builds on a March reveal that Claynosaurz would use Walrus Protocol—a decentralized storage platform built by core contributors to Sui—as its backend infrastructure of choice. With this foundation in place, Claynosaurz is gearing up to introduce a suite of experiences that tap into Sui's technology.

“We're not moving chains—we're expanding to shape the future of entertainment,” said Pelekis. “Sui offers a scalable, flexible foundation that empowers us to build entertainment products that feel frictionless, immersive, and rewarding—whether you're a seasoned Web3 user or brand new to NFTs.”

The original Claynosaurz NFTs will remain on Solana, with newer expansions to the project debuting on Sui going forward.

“The Genesis collections will always be on Solana,” said Claynosaurz founder and Co-Creative Director Nicholas Cabana. “That's their provenance. But for expansionary collections tied to new experiences, we're doing that with Sui.”

First up is the achievements system, an ecosystem-wide rewards engine that recognizes engagement across gameplay, collecting, and creative contributions. While Claynosaurz's Solana-based NFTs like the O.G. collection and Saga phone-related assets will still be integrated, the badges themselves will be minted on Sui. The system also includes “soft staking,” letting holders earn rewards from both Solana and Sui assets.

This month, Claynosaurz will debut Popkins, a 25,000-character expansion on Sui that introduces a new species into the Clayno universe. Popkins won't launch via a standard mint. Instead, collectors will purchase themed booster packs containing digital perks like shop discounts and in-game cosmetics.

Each pack includes a chance to catch a Popkin—but it's not guaranteed.

When you open a pack, the contents will shake loose and there will be either a Popkin in it—meaning you caught one—or otherwise, one of nine collectible species cards.

Later in 2025, Claynosaurz will also roll out its first mobile game for iOS and Android, and eventually the SuiPlay0X1 gaming handheld.

The game promises real-time creature battles and rich world-building, but the blockchain layer will be completely abstracted for casual players, with gameplay designed to appeal to non-Web3 natives users while still integrating Web3 mechanics behind the scenes.

Claynosaurz said the move to Sui is rooted in both technical ambition and community growth, and that the chain will “enable Claynosaurz to craft the most epic and engaging on-chain experience ever” via the combination of storytelling, gameplay, and collectibles.

The full mint mechanics, distribution, and pricing are expected to be revealed soon.

Glossy  E-Commerce Summit: Hear from execs at H&M, Warby Parker and Fabletics 


This is an episode of the Glossy Fashion Podcast, which features candid conversations about how today's trends are shaping the future of the fashion industry. More from the series →

On the Glossy Podcast, senior fashion reporter Danny Parisi and editor-in-chief Jill Manoff talk about some of the biggest fashion stories in the industry.

This week, we talk about Prada's positive earnings, including the spectacular growth of Miu Miu and why so many other luxury brands are falling behind. We also talk about Nike being sued in a class action lawsuit over the shutdown of its NFT business, RTFKT — one of a number of lawsuits over the ill-fated technology.

Later in the episode, Manoff speaks with Rent the Runway co-founder and CEO Jennifer Hyman about her turnaround plan for the company. As the OG in the fashion rental space, Rent the Runway has had to contend with new competitors like Nuuly, which have swept into the rental space. Below are some highlights from Manoff's conversation with Hyman, lightly edited for clarity.

“We have made in 2025 the biggest investment that we've ever made into our inventory and into our assortment. We know that, for our business, inventory is the key to growth. We spent the last few years bringing our business to a place where we were essentially nearly breakeven on a free cash flow basis, really changing our margin profile, our unit economics, the way we actually acquire inventory and setting up the business for this next phase. So we decided to go for it this year and double the inventory. 

In doubling the inventory, we've been able to go much deeper into use cases that we might have lacked or not had as much inventory of in the past, because the inventory in the past was more concentrated from March through May or September through November. We are now able to focus on those occasions in deep summer and in deep winter, when folks may be using Rent the Runway for things like having a tennis match with your friends, or going to the beach or going skiing in the winter. So we're offering categories that are new, that keep people excited and engaged on the platform.”

“We understand that there are some blockbuster brands on Rent the Runway, where, when a customer receives items from those brands, she actually is more loyal overall. And so what we've done is we've quadrupled the inventory assortment and depth and breadth in those brands so that more of our customers can access Ulla Johnson and Veronica Beard and the brands that she really loves.

We started testing styling a few quarters ago, and we did it manually. We found that when we gave customers access to human stylists, we dramatically improved their loyalty rates. So then we embarked on a customer service transformation within the organization. Customer service has always been one of the things we're known for. We're really great at it. We've taken all the manual tasks out of customer service and really outsourced a lot of those tasks and redeployed our own internal team into loyalty-driving behaviors. So, as opposed to our internal team writing you an email back about a shipping label, we're instead having that internal team have the time to call you when you first join and have a welcome call, and teach you all about Rent the Runway, or spend time styling you, or help you create lists, or do those high-value actions that make us a more premium service.”

“I hear people talking about fashion and tariffs and the impact on the news all of the time. And then, when I sit down with brands, no one knows what's going on right now. No one has a plan yet. People are kind of running around trying to figure it out. This all happened so suddenly. Over 90% of the production of fashion happens in China. It is not feasible, easy or possible for that production to just move overnight to other places. It's certainly not going to move to the U.S. And so I think that all of our brand partners are trying to figure out, like, is this real? I am taking it day by day with our brand partners. I'm actually going next week to L.A. to sit down with 20 of our brand partners there and just going to have open conversations with them on how we should handle this together.”

On April 29, 2025, the UK Information Commissioner's Office (the “ICO”) and the California Privacy Protection Agency (the “CPPA”) signed a declaration of cooperation regarding international privacy and data protection coordination, formalizing their existing collaboration.

The statement from the CPPA sets out the key aims of the declaration, namely:

The ICO considers the declaration to be a “commitment to work together on common issues so people's privacy rights are respected across the UK and California.” Tom Kemp, Executive Director at the CPPA stated that through the collaboration, the CPPA “can deepen…[its] knowledge base and leverage best practices from other regulators whose citizens face many of the same privacy harms that Californians have.”

The declaration marks the latest collaboration between the CPPA and international data protection authorities. In January 2025, the CPPA entered into collaboration with the Republic of South Korea's Personal Information Protection Commission, and in June 2024, the CPPA entered into collaboration with the French data protection authority, the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés.

The UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC) have called for the protection of the sensitive personal data of 23andMe's customers during and after the genetic testing company's bankruptcy proceedings. 

The regulators have written a joint letter to the U.S. Trustee, which serves to oversee bankruptcy cases, overseeing case administration and litigating to enforce the bankruptcy laws.

The letter highlights the requirements under UK and Canadian law for both 23andMe and any potential buyer of either the company or its customers' personal data to adhere to UK GDPR and PIPEDA (Canada's federal private-sector privacy law), whilst warning that they will take action if this data is not properly protected. 

At a hearing on 29 April 2025, a US bankruptcy judge ordered the appointment of a Consumer Privacy Ombudsman to oversee the handling of 23andMe's customers' personal information during the bankruptcy proceedings. The ICO and OPC welcome this development and plan to engage with the ombudsman once their appointment has been finalised. 

John Edwards, UK Information Commissioner, said:

“23andMe holds some of the most personal and highly sensitive information possible about its customers, including genetic data, health reports and self-reported health conditions. We have this week written to the U.S. Trustee to call for the protection of this sensitive data during and after the company's bankruptcy.

“The UK public need to trust that the bankruptcy proceedings, and any potential sale of the company or its assets, will safeguard their personal data from unauthorised use or misuse. We are here to advocate on their behalf and we will not hesitate to take action against 23andMe or any potential purchaser should data protection legislation not be adhered to.”   

Philippe Dufresne, Privacy Commissioner of Canada, said: 

“23andMe holds the highly sensitive personal information, including DNA, of millions of customers. My Office is closely following the sale of 23andMe to ensure that any personal information relating to individuals located in Canada is handled in compliance with our federal private-sector privacy law. This is of the utmost importance given the significant concerns that Canadians may have about the protection of their personal information going forward, especially given that some of the data has previously been subject to a breach.” 

23Andme joint letter to US officials

Investigation 

The ICO and OPC have been jointly investigating a 2023 data breach at 23andMe. In March 2025 the ICO issued its provisional findings, a Notice of Intent to impose a fine of £4.59m and a Preliminary Enforcement Notice. The ICO will carefully consider any representations from 23andMe before taking a final decision.

Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is set to shake up the $11 billion crypto wallet industry with a new super app that lets you meet all your blockchain needs from one dashboard.

The project is currently undergoing a presale where it has raised $11.9 million so far, reflecting immense appeal among investors. This presale event will finance Best Wallet's development while granting investors an opportunity to buy $BEST at a ground floor price.

Its early success reflects deep market interest, which, when combined with its innovative use case, is stirring considerable optimism among industry experts. Several top traders have said $BEST will explode when it lists on the open market, with some forecasting that 100x gains could follow the exchange launch.

Prospective investors can buy $BEST at its current presale price of $0.02495, but this will rise as the presale advances. The next increase will occur in under two days, meaning those seeking the most upside potential should not wait around.

While wallets such as MetaMask and Phantom are tied to a small number of blockchains, Best Wallet supports a staggering 60 different networks. This includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, Cardano, and Sui.

What's more, the project also has a built-in cross-chain decentralized exchange. No more manual bridging or hunting for the best swap rates, Best DEX aggregates liquidity from over 200 exchanges so you can execute instant cross-chain swaps and are guaranteed the best price.

Beyond that, Best Wallet also presents features such as a crypto debit card, a presale aggregator, and advanced fraud protection.

The last point is crucial. Scams are rife in crypto, especially once you venture outside the garden walls of a centralized exchange. But Best Wallet grants you all the benefits and opportunities of decentralized crypto storage, while providing security measures that exceed those of a top centralized exchange.

It uses cutting-edge Fireblocks MPC and allows users to create cloud backups to their multi-chain crypto wallets without managing seed phrases. It's a setup that greatly enhances the user experience while ensuring funds are always safe.

With serious advancements in wallet technology, experts believe Best Wallet Token could provide substantial returns. For instance, analysts from Cryptonews said the price could rally by 100x after listing on exchanges.

Considering its early stage and powerful use case, 100x gains certainly should not be ruled out.



There has been a vibe shift in crypto recently, with Bitcoin and altcoin prices rallying again after months of adversity.

Now, investors are hungry for opportunities that could compound their wealth – and the Best Wallet app offers exactly that.

It offers users two core money-making features capable of delivering substantial returns in bullish periods.

The first is Upcoming Tokens, a presale aggregator that allows investors to research, buy, and track all the top crypto presales from one dashboard. This feature has already proven useful, having provided a 10x gain on Pepe Unchained and 50x gain on Catslap during December, which was the last time the market was bullish.

Currently, projects like Solaxy, MIND of Pepe, and BTC Bull Token are available to buy. And with market conditions on the rise, it appears that these could also provide huge returns after listing on exchanges.

Second is its staking aggregator. This feature allows users to deposit a range of different cryptocurrencies and generate passive yields.

Best Wallet covers all bases ranging from multi-chain support to crypto launches and staking – it's compiling the multi-trillion dollar crypto industry into one smartphone app.

Holding the Best Wallet Token unlocks special perks inside the app such as trading fee discounts, higher staking yields, governance rights, and access to promotions on partner projects.

It's not just a token to speculate on Best Wallet's growth; it's a key that unlocks game-changing utility.

Despite being newly launched, Best Wallet already boasts over 250,000 users. It's proving highly popular, and as its demand increases, as will the demand for $BEST.

This, in turn, could cause its price to surge and potentially realize the 10x price target set by Jacob Bury. But with price increases occurring throughout the ICO, potential investors shouldn't wait to get involved.

According to @ai_9684xtpa on Twitter, a whale investor from the 2015 Ethereum ICO with an average cost basis of $0.31 per ETH has sold 6000 ETH in the past 33 hours, likely through Kraken. If fully executed, this sale would net a profit of $10.92 million for the whale (source: @ai_9684xtpa, May 2, 2025). The address still holds 2000 ETH, which may be sold soon. Traders should closely monitor this address and potential further sales, as such large-scale liquidations can lead to short-term price volatility for ETH.

Switzerland's recent experiment with central bank digital currency (CBDC) tokenization is being hailed as a potential blueprint for global adoption.

The World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) has spotlighted the country's pilot program—led by the SIX Digital Exchange—as a promising example of how digital currencies issued by central banks can support trust, liquidity, and market efficiency.

In a newly released report, the WFE suggests that the Swiss model offers valuable insights for regulators and institutions exploring the next phase of financial market infrastructure.

According to Richard Metcalfe, the organization's regulatory affairs lead, CBDCs could become a critical piece in scaling tokenized economies, provided they are implemented with clear standards and cross-system compatibility.

Following Switzerland's lead, other regions are stepping up their efforts. The European Union is preparing for wholesale CBDC trials, while similar developments are underway in the UK, Brazil, Hong Kong, and the UAE. However, challenges remain—from integrating with legacy systems to overcoming the limitations of distributed ledger technology (DLT) at scale.

Still, the early outcomes are encouraging. In Switzerland, the pilot supported multiple bond issuances and proved that tokenized settlements could operate in a live environment, albeit gradually. The WFE believes this signals a broader shift—from isolated trials to real-world deployment—as tokenization gains momentum on the global stage.







Kraken is ramping up its derivatives business in the UK with the full launch of its regulated crypto trading platform for professional users.

Sending crypto across multiple blockchains can still feel like navigating a maze — especially when it's unclear which network an address belongs to.

Galaxy Digital is preparing to enter the U.S. public markets, aiming for a Nasdaq listing under the ticker “GLXY” as early as May 16.

In a move blending sci-fi and crypto, Sam Altman's Worldcoin project is bringing its iris-scanning tech to the U.S. on a massive scale.

Soaring cryptocurrency values after Trump election has put pressure on financial regulator to take tougher line

The UK financial regulator is preparing to ban retail investors from using borrowed funds such as credit card balances to invest in cryptocurrency as it seeks to overhaul supervision of the fast-growing digital assets market.
 The soaring values of virtual currencies such as bitcoin after Donald Trump's election have put pressure on the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to take a tougher line while it also lays the groundwork for the industry to flourish in the UK.

According to a recent YouGov survey, the proportion of people in the UK using borrowed funds to make crypto purchases more than doubled from 6% in 2022 to 14% last year.

Borrowing to fund investments, when asset values could change dramatically, meant consumers risked losing their entire investment and potentially other assets, such as their home. These characteristics closely resembled gambling, the Treasury committee found.

The proposed ban is expected to face resistance from some fintech firms. Meanwhile, ministers have presented draft laws that will extend existing financial regulation to companies involved in crypto, aligning the UK with the US rather than the EU.

The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said after a recent visit to Washington she had discussed crypto regulation with the US Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, and that the two countries planned to discuss the subject further in June.

Bessent is known to be pro-crypto and, along with Trump, is against proposals for a central bank digital currency. Dismissing concerns that private companies such as Meta, Google and Apple might control digital currencies in the future, he told a Senate finance committee hearing in January: “I see no reason for the US to have a central bank digital currency.”

Eurozone finance ministers said last month they were concerned the US stance could affect eurozone monetary sovereignty and financial stability.

In the UK, the Starmer government has come under pressure from within the Labour party to take a tougher line. In 2023, MPs on an all-party parliamentary committee urged ministers to treat retail investment in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin as a form of gambling.

As part of her growth strategy, Reeves has called for an easing of regulations in some areas, an approach backed by the FCA chief executive, Nikhil Rathi, who has suggested that rules in the Square Mile could be simplified to spur innovation.

David Geale, the executive director of payments and digital finance at the FCA, said clear crypto regulation would increase confidence in the sector, supporting growth.

“Crypto is a growing industry. Currently largely unregulated, we want to create a crypto regime that gives firms the clarity they need to safely innovate, while delivering appropriate levels of market integrity and consumer protection,” he said.

Citing concerns about market manipulation, conflicts of interest, a lack of transparency and unreliable trading systems, Geale added: “Our aim is to drive sustainable, long-term growth of crypto in the UK. We're asking whether we have got the balance right.”

Green Dot has partnered with Crypto.com to provide money management services for Crypto.com's customers, the companies said.

Using Green Dot's embedded finance platform, Arc, Crypto.com customers will be able convert their digital assets to fiat currency and vice versa, allowing them to access funds at Green Dot locations nationwide and earn interest, according to a press release Wednesday.

Crypto.com is also introducing an interest-earning savings account. The company plans to add more features to the account in the future, per the release.

Crypto.com continues to align itself with traditional finance through its partnership with established financial services firms. In 2021, Visa teamed up with the digital currency platform on a pilot program that settles transactions using digital stablecoins through Ethereum, the crypto blockchain. 

The following year, Singapore-based Crypto.com collaborated with Fidelity National Information Services and its Worldpay unit to facilitate its card-based cryptocurrency sales and purchases for the platform. 

Crypto.com's partnership with Provo, Utah-based Green Dot provides crypto customers with a pathway to buy digital currencies using in-store access points, the release noted. Green Dot has cash deposit and withdrawal kiosks at more than 95,000 retail locations nationally, including in retail stores such as Walgreens, Walmart, 7-Eleven and CVS, per the press release. 

“We are thrilled to partner with Crypto.com to enhance the customer experience for their millions of users in the U.S. with more seamless and affordable means of buying and selling cryptocurrencies,” Renata Caine, general manager and senior vice president of embedded finance at Green Dot, said in the statement, calling Crypto.com “a trailblazer in safely and securely advancing the adoption of cryptocurrency in the U.S.”

Green Dot's crypto partnership follows the embedded finance company's decision to explore a possible sale. 

In March, the company tapped Citi to map out “potential strategic initiatives,” but it declined to explain further what options it is considering. Green Dot enlisted Citi's services after its chief executive's abrupt departure from the company that month, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

Huione Group, the Cambodia-based conglomerate that the U.S. Treasury Department wants to cut out of the U.S. financial system, received $98 billion worth of crypto since 2014 through illicit schemes like money laundering, pig butchering and online scams, according to blockchain security firm Elliptic.

The company, which has links to the Asian country's ruling Hun family, runs a Telegram-based marketplace where users can purchase personal data, money laundering services and even electric shackles intended for use on human beings.

“Huione Group has come under intense scrutiny this week, with the U.S. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) identifying the Cambodia-based conglomerate as an entity [of] primary money laundering concern,"" Elliptic co-founder Tom Robinson told CoinDesk.

In January, the company introduced its own stablecoin that, unlike third-party assets like Tether's USDT, cannot be frozen by external organizations. The stablecoin, USDH, was created to ""avoid transfer restrictions of traditional digital currencies.”

Despite rolling out the stablecoin, Robinson said FinCEN's move to clamp down on Huione is a ""significant blow"" to the conglomerate. 

""This should serve as a wake-up call for the broader financial ecosystem to strengthen the detection and disruption of cross-border laundering networks,"" he added.

Huione also received $150,000 worth of crypto from North Korean hacker Lazarus Group, which stole around $3 billion worth of crypto between 2018 and 2024, according to a report from cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.

An attempt to contact the company by email was not answered by publication time.

Oliver Knight is the co-leader of CoinDesk data tokens and data team. Before joining CoinDesk in 2022 Oliver spent three years as the chief reporter at Coin Rivet. He first started investing in bitcoin in 2013 and spent a period of his career working at a market making firm in the UK. He does not currently have any crypto holdings.

The Apple Pay integration is powered by Mesh's SmartFunding technology, which allows customers to pay with cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, or SOL.  

Merchants can then settle these payments in the stablecoin of their choice, including USDC, USDT, PYUSD, and others.  

This technology claims to simplify the transaction process, with users selecting Apple Pay at checkout, authenticating via Face ID, and completing the transaction in fiat currency payments. 

The integration capabilities are extended to physical retail environments as well.

Merchants can utilise Apple Pay's NFC features to provide customers with a consistent payment experience both in-store and online, beyond the traditional point-of-sale terminals. 

Mesh CEO and co-founder Bam Azizi said: “We believe that as soon as crypto payments are as seamless as fiat payments, nothing is left to stop the mass migration of global commerce onto blockchain rails. Crypto already offers countless benefits over fiat, and Mesh is solving the UX and convenience pieces.  

“With our Apple Pay integration, we're solving crypto's existential last-mile problem, bringing to life a plug-and-play solution that turns on global crypto payments through our existing partners.” 

This development follows Mesh's $82m Series B funding round, led by Paradigm and supported by investors such as Consensys, QuantumLight Capital, and Yolo Investments.  

Mesh has over 300 integrations, including prominent crypto exchanges and wallets like Coinbase, Binance, MetaMask, and Phantom.

Worldcoin arrives in the United States. Objective: to scan your irises to prove that you are human. Behind this project, Sam Altman, the head of OpenAI, is betting on biometric technology to create a unique and secure digital identity. With six sites opened in key cities, the challenge is set: link blockchain, crypto, and eye recognition to reinvent access to digital services.

The founder of OpenAI, Sam Altman, keeps blurring the lines between science fiction and reality.

This time, it's not about generating images or texts with AI, but about closely examining… your eyes. The crypto project Worldcoin – recently renamed simply “World” – is now rolling out six centers in the United States to collect iris scans using its famous Orb, a spherical biometric device that looks more like an extraterrestrial artifact than a verification booth.

Austin, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Nashville, Miami, and San Francisco have been chosen as the first stops of this techno-identity adventure. Objective: to create a unique IrisCode, specific to each user, to verify that they are indeed a human being and not a robot.

In return, the user receives a free dose of WLD, the native crypto. It all comes with a promise: that of a Web where humans are not relegated behind bots, but regain centrality.

This technology, though controversial, responds to a contemporary urgency: the proliferation of artificial intelligences, deepfakes, and forged identities. For Altman and his partner Alex Blania, the time has come to establish proof of humanity in a world increasingly saturated by fakes.

But behind the technical feat, Worldcoin's ambition is also economic. Two major partnerships have just been announced. First with Visa, which will soon offer a “World Visa Card” exclusively for World ID holders.

Then with Match Group, parent company of Tinder, which will test age verification via eye scan in Japan. In short: your irises will not only serve to prove that you are human, but also to flirt, pay, and maybe tomorrow… vote?

However, this crypto project is not unanimous. Some governments, like Hong Kong, have already requested the halt of data collection by World. Because yes, although the founders assure that the data are decentralized and impossible to reconstruct, distrust persists. Especially since the promise of absolute anonymity has never really withstood great economic ambitions.

Altman claims to want to keep humans at the center in a world where AI occupies more and more space. Admirable? Maybe. But for that, is it really necessary to scan the eyes of the entire world? The question remains open, and the answer will probably depend on the degree of citizens' adherence. Or their weariness in the face of the bots' invasion.

In summary, World has not only launched a technology: it has lit a fuse. That of a new debate on identity, privacy, and the place of humans in the BTC ecosystem. The project could well reshape our relationship to technology by imposing a global biometric standard… or crash headlong into the wall of distrust. One thing is certain: all eyes are on it. Meanwhile, Mastercard is also trying to reshuffle the cards by announcing strategic partnerships to revolutionize crypto payments.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Anduril Industries co-founder and CEO Brian Schimpf discuss the future of AI and the ethical use of technology on 'Making Money.'

Sam Altman's biometric identity project — World, formerly known as Worldcoin — has officially launched in the United States, bringing with it a blend of sci-fi-like ambition and mounting global concern.

The technology verifies individuals by scanning their irises in exchange for a share of cryptocurrency and a digital ID called World ID.

The debut event, held Wednesday night in San Francisco, unveiled a new, more compact version of the company's signature imaging device known as the Orb, a silver sphere that captures iris patterns to prove a person is human. 

Altman, who also leads OpenAI, framed the launch as a critical step toward digital trust in an artificial intelligence-driven future.

""As AI advances, it's increasingly important to distinguish between humans and bots online,"" the company said in a press release, positioning World ID as a ""proof-of-human"" standard for the internet age.

But with that goal comes controversy. World has already faced legal scrutiny on multiple continents. 

Authorities in Spain have suspended the project. Argentina has issued fines over its data terms. Kenya opened a criminal investigation before ultimately halting the project. And, in Hong Kong, regulators ordered World to cease operations, citing the collection of biometric data as ""excessive and unnecessary.""

OPENAI CEO SAM ALTMAN TO DONATE $1 MILLION TO TRUMP'S INAUGURAL FUND

Despite these rebukes, World claims its system is safe. It says the Orb doesn't store actual images of users' eyes, instead generating an encrypted ""iris code"" that is then tied to a blockchain-based digital identity. Critics, however, remain wary.

""Once you link an unchangeable biometric like your eye to a global ID system, you can't take it back,"" one cybersecurity expert warned. ""It's the ultimate honeypot for surveillance.""

Altman, 39, rose to prominence as the CEO of OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. Under his leadership, OpenAI has driven artificial intelligence into the public mainstream while sparking fears over deepfakes, misinformation and job displacement. Now, with World, he's turning his focus from thinking machines to verifying the humans still using them.

The app has already verified over 11 million people worldwide, and its ambitions are expanding quickly. On Wednesday, the company also announced a partnership with Visa to release the World Card later this year, a crypto-linked debit card that users can spend anywhere Visa is accepted. 

In Japan, a separate partnership with Match Group's Tinder will allow users to verify their identity via iris scan, aimed at cracking down on romance fraud.

The U.S. rollout comes as the Trump administration continues to back digital assets and emerging tech.

President Donald Trump has called for making the country the ""crypto capital of the world,"" and his administration has reportedly supported initiatives that reduce regulatory barriers to private sector innovation.

That supportive environment may explain why Altman chose now to bring World home after a cautious international rollout during the previous administration. 

""We are building the foundational layer of the internet economy,"" Altman told attendees in San Francisco. For some, that's a glimpse into a promising digital future. For others, it's a warning.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","Japan's Bitcoin HODLer Metaplanet to Buy More BTC By Issuing $25M Worth of Bonds","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/02/metaplanet-issues-25m-bonds-to-buy-more-bitcoin","Fri, 02 May 2025 08:54:20 GMT","

Tokyo-based Metaplanet (3350) has issued 3.6 billion yen (around $24.8 million) in bonds to fund additional purchases of bitcoin (BTC) after the Japanese hotel firm's holdings surpassed 5,000 BTC.

According to a notice from the company, the newly issued bonds were sold entirely to EVO FUND. The bonds carry no interest and will be redeemed at par value on October 31, 2025, unless repaid earlier at the bondholder's request.

The funds are earmarked specifically for BTC acquisition, in line with the plan disclosed earlier this year when Metaplanet detailed a series of stock acquisition rights.

The company expects to fund the bond's redemption through capital raised via the exercise of its stock acquisition rights, meaning the ultimate payback may rely on investor appetite for Metaplanet's equity-linked instruments.

If proceeds from those rights exceed certain thresholds, Metaplanet reserves the right to repay portions of the bond early. Metaplanet shares closed at 428 yen each, up 8.6% in the last trading session.

Movement Labs announced today on X that it had suspended co-founder Rushi Manche.

The move to suspend Manche comes as Coinbase delisted the MOVE token, after CoinDesk reported that Movement Labs is investigating how a market maker tied to Web3Port acquired and dumped over 5% of the token's supply, triggering a price crash.

We confirm that Rushi Manche has been suspended from Movement Labs. This decision was made in light of ongoing events and as the third-party review is still being conducted by Groom Lake regarding organizational governance and recent incidents involving a market maker.

Binance had previously banned the market maker at the center of this, Web3Port, from its platform.

The MOVE token is down about 20% on the day, according to CoinDesk market data.

The U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is seeking views on intermediaries, staking, lending, borrowing, and decentralised finance (DeFi), in a discussion paper released on Friday.

The discussion paper follows draft legislation by the Treasury that was announced on Tuesday. Once the legislation passes it will bring specific crypto activities within the FCA's regulation, the regulator said on its website.

""Crypto is a growing industry. Currently largely unregulated, we want to create a crypto regime that gives firms the clarity they need to safely innovate, while delivering appropriate levels of market integrity and consumer protection,"" said David Geale, executive director of payments and digital finance at the FCA.

The crypto industry has said the regulator, which has had oversight of crypto since 2020 under its anti-money laundering rules, has been too restrictive at times. It has registered 51 firms of the 368 applications it's received in the past five years. A new authorization regime for offerings should kick in by 2026.

Among the topics in the discussion paper is whether firms should be able to accept credit cards to pay for crypto purchases.

""We are considering a range of restrictions, including restricting the use of credit cards to directly buy cryptoassets, and using a credit line provided by an e-money firm to do so,"" the discussion paper said.

The deadline for comments is June 13 and the FCA will consult on the final regime later this year.

UPDATE (May 2, 12:10 UTC): Adds no. of firms approved since 2020, credit card purchases starting in fourth paragraph.

Google is rolling out a privacy-focused upgrade to its Wallet service that uses zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) technology for age verification, per a release.

The company said that the dating app Bumble, among others, will be one of the first partners to use this system. Bumble will use digital IDs issued through Google Wallet for user verification, while ZKPs will handle age confirmation.

The move allows users to prove they're old enough to access certain apps or websites without revealing their birthdates or personal identifying data. ZKP is one of the biggest use cases for blockchains apart from real-world assets and payments, though it has yet to find popularity outside of niche circles.

Google said the system was developed in response to the growing number of services requiring age checks, from dating platforms to e-commerce and social media. “We wanted to develop a system that not only verifies age, but does it in a way that protects your privacy,” it said.

The ZKP cryptographic method lets someone prove a fact (like being over 18) without revealing how they know it or any more information. 

Traditional ID-based age verification methods, in contrast, often require revealing government-issued documents or date of birth, creating privacy and data security risks.

This is done using a complex blockchain-based system that runs a condition (such as age) in an encrypted form, generating a proof, and letting an outside system verify it using public keys, ensuring privacy without exposing the underlying information.

The implementation is now live in Google Wallet and works across mobile devices and apps using Google's Digital Credential API, which means it can be embedded into third-party sites and platforms.

ZK-based tokens are up 1.7% on average in the past 24 hours, CoinGecko sector data shows. The sector could be one to keep an eye on as giants like Google adopt ZKP technology - bringing demand to the privacy-first sector that has generally fallen out of investor interest in past years.

 Europe will ban anonymous crypto accounts and privacy coins starting in 2027 under sweeping new AML regulations targeting service providers and token anonymity. 

The European Union is set to impose sweeping Anti-Money Laundering (AML) rules that will ban privacy-preserving tokens and anonymous cryptocurrency accounts from 2027.

Under the new Anti-Money Laundering Regulation (AMLR), credit institutions, financial institutions and crypto asset service providers (CASPs) will be prohibited from maintaining anonymous accounts or handling privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies, such as Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC).

“Article 79 of the AMLR establishes strict prohibitions on anonymous accounts [...]. Credit institutions, financial institutions, and crypto-asset service providers are prohibited from maintaining anonymous accounts,” according to the AML Handbook, published by European Crypto Initiative (EUCI).

The regulation is part of a broader AML framework that includes bank and payment accounts, passbooks and safe-deposit boxes, “crypto-asset accounts allowing anonymisation of transactions,” and “accounts using anonymity-enhancing coins.”

“The regulations (the AMLR, AMLD and AMLAR) are final, and what remains is the ‘fine print' — aka the interpretation of some of the requirements through the so-called implementing and delegated acts,” according to Vyara Savova, senior policy lead at the EUCI.

She added that much of the implementation will come through so-called implementing and delegated acts, which are mostly handled by the European Banking Authority:

“However, the broader framework is final, so centralized crypto projects (CASPs under MiCA) need to keep it in mind when determining their internal processes and policies,” Savova said.

Under the new regulatory framework, CASPs operating in at least six member states will be under direct AML supervision.

In the initial stage, AMLA plans to select 40 entities, with at least one entity per member state, according to EUCI's AML Handbook. The selection process is set to start on July 1, 2027.

AMLA will use “materiality thresholds” to ensure that only firms with “substantial operations presence in multiple jurisdictions are considered for direct supervision.”

The thresholds include a “minimum of 20,000 customers residing in the host member state,” or a total transaction volume of over 50 million euros ($56 million).

Other notable measures include mandatory customer due diligence on transactions above 1,000 euros ($1,100).

These updates come as the EU ramps up its regulatory oversight of the crypto industry, building on previous measures such as the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA).

 Bitcoin's more resilient hodlers are nearing what has been a classic profit-taking level in the past — will they copy history and start selling their BTC? 

Key points:

Bitcoin long-term holders are about to hit a level of unrealized profit, which has traditionally caused them to sell.

That level coincides with the return to a six-figure BTC price.

Order book data suggests that bulls may not succeed in keeping the upside going.

Bitcoin (BTC) risks a “notable increase” in selling from its older investors if price rises further, warns onchain analytics firm Glassnode.

In the latest edition of its regular newsletter, “The Week Onchain,” researchers calculated that long-term holders (LTHs) are sitting on almost 350% unrealized profits.

Bitcoin at multimonth highs will tempt an increasing number of hodlers to take profits — including so-called “diamond hands.”

Using a variety of metrics to track investor profitability, Glassnode shows that aggregate LTH unrealized profits are now nearing 350% — a key historical level.

“Having established that the LTH cohort is expressing a preference to hold onto their supply, we can attempt to quantify the potential price levels required to entice them to part with their coins, and commence the next wave of profit taking,” it explains.

LTH refers to entities holding BTC for more than six months. For Glassnode, the key price area to watch for changes in their behavior is the $100,000 zone.

“Historically speaking, the Long-Term Holder cohort typically ramps up their spending pressure when the average member is holding a +350% unrealized profit margin,” it explains.

BTC/USD reached $97,500 this week before cooling off — its highest since Feb. 21, per data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView.

While more than $20,000 above its recent lows, Bitcoin is not yet convincing traders that it can return to classic bull market behavior.

Popular trader TheKingfisher pointed to order book liquidity as one sign that sellers may take revenge on the recovery.

“Massive wall of LONG liquidations stacked up under ~$91k. Shorts above current price ($96.6k)? Barely anything significant,” he wrote in part of an X post on May 1.

Glassnode also acknowledged the need to demonstrate key resistance/support flips, referencing the 111-day simple moving average (SMA) and the aggregate cost basis of Bitcoin speculators, known as short-term holders (STHs).

“The price has recently surged above both of these pricing models, and is now attempting to consolidate within this zone. This highlights a noteworthy degree of strength behind this upwards swing,” it commented.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","Moon soon? XRP's 'strongest spot premium' aligns with 70% rally setup","https://cointelegraph.com/news/xrp-moon-soon-strongest-spot-premium-aligns-with-70-rally-setup","Fri, 02 May 2025 14:22:08 GMT","

 Strong spot market demand, supported by persistent accumulation from whales and a bullish technical pattern, favors an XRP price boom over $3.75. 

Key takeaways:

XRP's strongest spot premium phase suggests real buying demand, not just speculative futures trading. 

The number of XRP addresses holding ≥10,000 tokens has steadily climbed, even during recent price pullbacks. 

A falling wedge pattern points to a possible breakout toward $3 to $3.78, with up to 70% upside if confirmed.

XRP (XRP) is experiencing its strongest sustained phase of spot premium in history, a period where the spot market has been consistently trading at stronger levels compared to perpetual futures.

Since 2020, most major XRP price peaks happened when the perpetual futures market was leading, noted market analyst Dom in his May 2 post on X. 

XRP's futures prices being higher than spot signaled excessive speculation and led to sharp price drops.

As of 2025, a spot premium suggests that demand from actual XRP buyers is driving the rally, pointing to a more stable price rise compared to past runs powered by leveraged bets.

Further reinforcing the case for real demand, Glassnode data shows a consistent rise in the number of XRP addresses holding at least 10,000 XRP (the green wave in the chart below) since late November 2024. 

XRP's price has rallied by approximately 350% since then.

XRP's whale count has risen even during its 35% price pullback between January and April. It suggests that larger holders—often viewed as more patient or strategic investors—are steadily accumulating positions in anticipation of further gains.

Optimism has been fueled by improving odds of spot XRP ETF approval in the US. The US Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) decision to drop its lawsuit against Ripple has further boosted the market's upside sentiment.

XRP has been consolidating within a falling wedge pattern on the weekly chart — a structure defined by downward-sloping, converging trendlines. In technical analysis, this pattern is generally viewed as a bullish reversal signal.

A confirmed breakout requires a clear move above the wedge's upper resistance near $2.52. 

If XRP breaks this level, the pattern's measured move — calculated from the wedge's maximum height — suggests a potential rally toward $3.78 by June. This would represent an estimated 70% upside from the current prices.

Conversely, if XRP fails to break above the $2.52 resistance, the price could pull back toward the wedge's lower trendline. The pattern's apex near $1.81 may act as the final potential breakout point.

A breakout from the $1.81 level would still keep the pattern's structure intact, with a potential upside target around $3 by June or July — roughly 35% above current levels.

 Dogecoin, in particular, has seen a notable spike in online discussions as various ETF applications are being considered in the US, says Santiment's Brian Quinlivan. 

Online discussions about memecoins have hit a year-to-date high, gaining considerable attention after sentiment cooled earlier in the year, according to onchain analytics platform Santiment. 

Two weeks ago, discussions around Bitcoin (BTC) and layer-1 protocols peaked during the market volatility brought on by the Trump administration's sweeping tariffs. However, that's since shifted to high market cap memecoins, Santiment marketing director Brian Quinlivan said in a May 1 blog post.

“Online discussions about these high-risk tokens have proliferated as traders embrace a gamble mindset, rather than a calculated investment approach,” he said.

“This is a telltale sign that traders are increasingly investing based solely on speculation and short-term gains,” Quinlivan added.

Quinlivan said the overall crypto market rose 10% in the past eight days, but Bitcoin only gained 7%, which indicates traders are flocking to more speculative assets.

“Any time Bitcoin leads an initial rally and then begins to move sideways, investors generally start taking bigger risks in hopes of scoring even higher returns through more speculative and riskier purchases,” he said.

In particular, Dogecoin (DOGE) has seen a notable spike in positive crowd sentiment after a major decline in crowd interest during April, as various applications for DOGE exchange-traded funds were filed in the US.

Despite the Securities and Exchange Commission delaying its decision on these filings until mid-June, Quinlivan says traders are in a state of cautious anticipation.

“Until late April, DOGE had been on a major decline in terms of crowd interest. But its social dominance has spiked to its highest level in nearly three months, as the conversations and filings surrounding Nasdaq's ETF listings have risen,” he said.

DefiLlama data shows PumpSwap, the decentralized exchange of the memecoin launch platform Pump.Fun saw a spike to $11 billion in monthly trading volume during April after recording only $1.7 billion in March.

Meanwhile, Pump.Fun's monthly trading volume rose to $3.3 billion in April, up from $2.5 billion in March.

Memecoin activity exploded after the launch of US President Donald Trump's memecoin on Jan. 18, with Pump.fun usage recording a high of $3.3 billion in weekly trading volume.

However, traders soon cooled on memecoins. CoinGecko founder Bobby Ong said in a March 6 report that memecoin investor interest dropped after a series of bad launches, noting the fallout from the Libra (LIBRA) token launch in February as a significant catalyst.

Could the Sun Fry Earth with a Superflare?

Stars like the sun might erupt with extreme explosions about once per century

In our daily lives, the sun seems constant and quiet, sedately shining at a steady pace. But looks can be deceiving: our star can also blast out powerful solar storms, huge explosions of energy and subatomic particles. If these are directed toward us, they can trigger auroras and disrupt our power grids, as well as play havoc with Earth-orbiting satellites.

These storms are magnetic in nature. A fundamental rule in physics is that charged particles create magnetic fields around them as they move. And the sun is brimming with charged particles because its interior is so hot that atoms there are stripped of one or more electrons, forming what we call a plasma. The superhot plasma closer to the core rises, whereas cooler plasma near the surface sinks, creating towering columns of convecting material by the millions, each carrying its own magnetic field. These fields can become entangled near the surface, sometimes snapping—like a spring under too much strain—to release enormous amounts of energy in a single intense explosion at a small spot on the sun. This sudden flash of light accompanied by a colossal burst of subatomic particles is called a solar flare.

The most powerful flare we've ever directly measured occurred in 2003, and it emitted about 7 × 1025 joules of energy in the span of a few hours. That's roughly the amount of energy the whole sun emits in one fifth of a second, which may not sound very impressive—until you remember it comes from just a tiny, isolated region on the sun's surface!

We also know that, historically, our star has spat out much bigger flares. High-speed subatomic particles raining down from solar storms slam into the nitrogen in our atmosphere to create an isotope called beryllium 10, or Be-10, which can be captured in polar ice after falling to Earth's surface. By examining ancient ice cores, scientists are able to obtain accurate dates for spikes in Be-10 (and other related isotopes), which can then be used to track historic solar activity.

Such isotopic spikes have revealed what may be the most powerful solar eruption in relatively recent history, an event that occurred in 7176 B.C.E. Scientists argued at first about the cause of these spikes; the sun's activity didn't seem powerful enough to create the amounts of isotopes seen. Supernovae or gamma-ray bursts could explain the spikes, too—but only by occurring rather close to our planet, and that should've left behind other forms of evidence that, so far, scientists haven't found. Consequently, the current consensus is that the sun is indeed responsible for these massive upticks in isotopes. Scientists now call these spikes “Miyake events,” in honor of Japanese cosmic-ray physicist Fusa Miyake, a leader in discovering and understanding them.

While these flares were huge, there are reasons to suspect the sun is capable of unleashing even bigger ones. Some stars undergo what are called superflares, which are ridiculously powerful, reaching a total energy of 1029 joules, or the equivalent of what the sun emits over the course of 20 minutes. In more human terms, that's about 300 million years' worth of our global civilization's current annual energy usage—all squeezed into a brief burst of stellar activity.

Superflares are relatively rare. Observing them in any given star would take a stroke of luck—unless you stack the odds in your favor.

That's just what an international team of astronomers did. The Kepler spacecraft monitored about half a million stars over a period of a decade, looking for telltale signs of accompanying planets. But all those data can be used for other things, too. The astronomers looked for superflares arising from more than 56,000 sunlike stars in Kepler's observations—which added up to a remarkable 220,000 total observed years of stellar activity. The researchers published the results in Science in late 2024.

By sifting through that vast dataset, the team found 2,889 likely superflares on 2,527 sunlike stars. That works out to roughly one superflare per sunlike star per century, which seems pretty terrifying because it would presumably mean the sun sends out an explosive superflare every hundred years or so.

But let's not be so hasty. For one thing, a star's rotation can powerfully influence the development of flare-spewing magnetic fields, and the rotational period was unknown for 40,000 of the study's examined stars—so it's possible this part of the sample isn't representative of the actual sun. And 30 percent of the superflare-producing stars were in binary systems with a stellar companion, which could also affect the results. The list of potential confounding variables doesn't stop here—there are several other factors that might make a seemingly sunlike star more prone to producing superflares than our own sun is.

Then again, as I already mentioned, Be-10 and other telltale isotopes can be produced in other ways that don't involve stellar flares. And, for that matter, it's not at all clear how well superflares would specifically make such particles. So although we've counted five sun-attributed Be-10 spikes across the last 10,000 years, that doesn't mean the sun has only produced that many strong flares in that time. Perhaps there were others that left more subtle, as-yet-unidentified records in the ice—or that weren't aimed at Earth and therefore produced no terrestrial isotopic signal at all.

If the sun did blow off a superflare today, what would be the effects? The impacts to life on Earth would probably be pretty minimal; our planet's magnetic field acts as a shield against incoming subatomic particles, and our atmosphere would absorb most of the associated high-energy electromagnetic radiation (such as gamma and x-rays).

Our technological civilization is another matter, though. A huge flare could fry the electronics on all but the most protected satellites and disrupt power grids to cause widespread and long-lasting blackouts. Engineers have devised safeguards to prevent damaging electrical surges from most instances of extreme space weather, but if a flare is powerful enough, there may not be much we could do to avoid severe damage.

Should we worry? The takeaway from the study is that it's possible the sun produces superflares more often than we previously thought, but this conclusion is not conclusive. So consider this research a good start—and a good argument for getting more and better information. Don't panic just yet!

By combining data on all known bird species, this tree is the most impressive snapshot yet of one of Earth's most awe-inspiring classes of animal.

When it comes to diversity, no animal can quite hold a candle to birds. Being the most genetically varied land vertebrate on the planet, the class Aves thrive on every continent. And they're also impressive survivors, being as they're the direct descendants of the avian dinosaurs that survived the K-T Extinction event some 66 million years ago. 

Those many millions of years have given birds time to evolve into some 11,000 species, and keeping track of all those species—not to mention their evolutionary history–can be quite the challenge. Luckily, scientists from the University of California Merced and Cornell Lab of Ornithology decided that challenge was one they wanted to meet and proceeded to pour over 262 studies related to 9,239 bird species published from 1990 to 2024. After combining additional data on the 1,800 or so species not included in these studies, the team formed a complete map of avian evolutionary history. The results of this work were detailed in the journal Proceedings of the National Academies of Science (PNAS)

“People love birds, and a lot of people work on birds,” Emily Jane McTavish, the lead author of the study from UC Merced, said in a press statement. “People publish scientific papers about birds' evolutionary relationships all the time. We synthesized all the data to have unified information all in one place.”

For years, McTavish worked on software known as the Open Tree of Life (OpenTree) project, a collaboration between evolutionary biologists and taxonomists to build a comprehensive evolutionary tree of all species on the planet—not just birds. By creating a complete evolutionary history of all known birds on the planet, the experts hope to gather research in one place and make startlingly new discoveries in the future. 

“Many dozens of bird phylogenies (studies of evolutionary histories using genetics) get published every year, yet their findings—with implications for everything from taxonomy to our understanding of ancestral characters—aren't necessarily being used for downstream research,” Eliot Miller, a visiting scientist to Cornell Lab and senior author of the study, said in a press statement. “Our project should help to close this research loop so that these studies and their findings are better incorporated into follow-up research.”

Because Cornell Lab is also in charge of popular citizen science bird tools like Merlin and eBird, this updated tree can also link with those datasets, providing even better models for scientists and birders alike. The team also designed the dataset to update automatically as new phylogenetic information about birds becomes available. Crucially, similar techniques used to construct this evolutionary tree can be applied to other groups of species as well, slowly revealing the incredible and inter-related animal diversity that spans the globe.

Art imitates life ... maybe.

There's something intriguing, even frightening, about the image of an ancient horned serpent roaming across the land. Thanks to some suggestive fossils and legends of old, talk of such a creature isn't a new concept. But the recent discovery of 200-year-old rock paintings found in South Africa now has scientists hypothesizing that this ancient creature may have been far more than just a legend. 

The first formal scientific descriptions of this horned serpent—a supposed member of the dicynodont group—appeared in 1845. Considering the abundance of dicynodont fossils found in the Karoo Basin in South Africa, some have pondered whether this long-thought mythical horned serpent is rooted in reality. The discovery of rock art dated to between 1821 and 1835 adds even more credence to the legend, as the painting is older than the first formal reference to the dicynodont. If we're lucky, it could provide further clues as to just how intertwined this horned serpent was with South Africa's indigenous San culture. 

In a study published in the journal PLOS ONE, Julien Benoit from the University of the Witwatersrand confirmed that the rock art from the early 1800s depicts a tusked animal, and that it sits alongside tetrapod fossils in the immediate vicinity. “Altogether,” the Benoit wrote, “they suggest a case of indigenous paleontology.” 

Still, it will need to take more than a 200-year-old painting to match a smattering of unknown fossils to a long-extinct creature unlike anything seen in the area today. “The ethnographic, archaeological, and paleontological evidence are consistent with the hypothesis that the Horned Serpent panel could possibly depict a dicynodont,” Benoit wrote in the study. He added that the downward orientation of the tusks, which doesn't match any African animal (but does match dicynodonts), the abundance of fossils in the area, and the belief held by the San of the existence of this long-extinct large animal further support the theory. 

“Of course, at this point it is speculative,” said Benoit, according to IFL Science, “but the tusked animal on the Horned Serpent panel was likely painted as a rain-animal, which means it was probably involved [in] rain-making ceremonies.” These ceremonies often evoked known extinct animals to help the people encourage the gods to send rain. 

The San were known to have a robust mix of animals belonging to their ‘spirit world,' but Benoit said that these animals were generally inspired by reality—even if extinct. Coupled with the San's interest in fossils, Benoit believes a fossil discovery could have led the San to recreate the horned serpent, using a long-held legend in which their ancestors described the creatures as “great monstrous brutes, exceeding the elephant or hippopotamus in bulk” as the template. 

There's plenty of leaps from legend to scientific grounding that may be too large for a fabled horned serpent to make. But after further studies, the 200-year-old paintings could spin a different tale.

April showers bring... renewable energy? 

Have you ever absentmindedly run your hand over the fabric of your shirt, then touched a light switch and gotten zapped back into consciousness? That same effect could soon generate massive amounts of electric power with rain. 

Hydroelectric power may produce clean energy, but in order for it to work, the movement of water needs to activate some sort of mechanical system (like a turbine). This complex equipment cannot be used everywhere, and may even harm the environment in certain situations. Rain, on the other hand, bypasses the need for any equipment other than a tube for it to run through. It also generates energy magnitudes greater than continuously flowing water, because the charge created by drop after drop of rain takes much longer to decay. 

This is what engineer Siowling Soh—from the National University of Singapore—and his research team realized when they tried to generate electricity by catching rainwater in tubes.

“The setup is simple; no equipment is needed,” they said in a study recently published in ACS Central Science. “Hence, it is inexpensive and environmentally friendly to install, operate, and maintain […] scaling up can be achieved readily in three dimensions for large-scale harvesting of energy from nature. It can be used anywhere, including in urbanized areas.”

Previous experiments had tried to use water flowing through nanoscale tubes to capture electric charge. However, not only does the charge from flowing water decay more rapidly, but when tubes that small are used, that charge becomes just about negligible. It is also unnatural for water to flow through nano-tubes, which is why Soh stresses that macroscale tubes on the scale of at least millimeters wide should be used to harvest electricity from natural sources of water. 

The way droplets of rain flow through a tube (with pockets of air between them) is known as plug flow. Positively charged hydrogen ions and negatively charged oxygen ions separate spontaneously at the interface of liquid and solid, but the charge is much greater for individual sparks that result from the ‘plunk' of raindrops than from water which continuously flows through the tube. This charge separation is also the reason for the sudden electric jolt you experience turning on a lamp.

Soh and his team set up a tube and a stainless steel cup partially filled with uncharged water, and connected to a series of resistors (which regulate the flow of electricity) to the cup and tube with wires for electrical contact. The charge accumulated in the tube and cup powered circuits, and an electric current was created, achieving an energy output about 100,000 times higher than the output generated by a continuous flow. 

Another advantage of plug flow is that the power it generates is consistent in the long term. So, what does that amount of energy mean when translated into utilities that add up on your electric bill, such as the lightbulb in the lamp that shocked you? Say that it uses an LED lightbulb. For the duration of a rainfall, 20 seconds of rain plinking and plunking into four of tubes connected to an external circuit would power 12 of those bulbs. Soh thinks it can be easily scaled up for longer stretches of time and higher voltages.

“Importantly,” he said in the same study, “the combination of high efficiency and use of macroscale tubes enables plug flow to harvest renewable and clean energy from nature freely, including directly from rain.”

In the future, maybe that electric bill will trigger less of a shock.

Climate change is driving more frequent bouts of extreme weather that lead to floods and other damage.Credit: Scott Olson/Getty

Every four years, the US government is supposed to release a report on how climate change is affecting the nation, to guide communities and companies on how to address and adapt to a warming planet. But the sixth edition of the National Climate Assessment — already in the works for months — was gutted earlier this week, when US President Donald Trump's administration dismissed hundreds of scientists helping with it.

‘Totally broken': how Trump 2.0 has paralysed work at US science agencies

Some researchers aren't giving up, however. They are wondering whether they could publish it anyway, through independent channels. One of their inspirations is the National Nature Assessment, a report that Trump cancelled on his first day back in office. Last month, researchers involved with that report announced a campaign to publish it outside the governmental framework, using private funding. The report is meant to detail the importance of nature — ecosystems, biodiversity and more — on the US economy and on US health.

Both reports address “the condition of the planet writ large”, says Gillian Bowser, an ecologist at Colorado State University in Fort Collins and a lead author of the nature assessment. Efforts to revive them reflect the ways in which US researchers are trying to cope with Trump's assault on federal science. 

“I volunteered for this effort, and I'm ready to continue it,” says Costa Samaras, a systems engineer at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and lead author of a chapter of the climate assessment. “This is important work for the country,” adds Samaras, who worked on US energy policy under Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden. 

Both projects were coordinated by the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), a network of 15 federal agencies that deal with environmental issues across the US government. The reports were meant to be comprehensive syntheses of the most up-to-date scientific knowledge in the fields of climate science and ecology.

Will US science survive Trump 2.0?

Will US science survive Trump 2.0?

The first National Climate Assessment was published in 2000; since then, this report, mandated by the US Congress, has come out fairly regularly. It is “the de facto understanding of what climate change means for the country”, says Nícola Ulibarrí, an environmental policy specialist at the University of California, Irvine, who contributed to the fifth edition and was slated to contribute to the sixth.

Trump has called climate change a “hoax”, but during his first term as president, he approved the 2018 release of the fourth climate assessment. His team also began the process of setting up the fifth assessment, although the president's controversial pick to lead the USGCRP — a climate-change denier — was later replaced. By contrast, Trump's current administration moved swiftly to gut the sixth report, dubbed the NCA6. 

In early April, the president's team terminated contracts with the company that provided internal staff members to coordinate the report's production. This week, administration officials dismissed nearly 400 university and other external scientists who were working on it. Nature asked the White House the reason for the terminations, and received the same line that appeared in the scientists' dismissal e-mail: “At this time, the scope of the NCA6 is currently being reevaluated in accordance with the Global Change Research Act of 1990.”

Thomas Crowther made a name for himself after publishing a paper that suggested Earth had eight times more trees than expected.Credit: Bryan Bedder/Getty Images for Bloomberg Philanthropies

A university investigation into Thomas Crowther, a prominent tree researcher who ran a large laboratory at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH Zurich), reveals that he blurred personal and professional relationships in his lab and breached internal rules on financial and hiring compliance. But it clears him of misusing grant funds.

However, some members of Crowther's laboratory have accused ETH Zurich of a flawed and biased investigation, in a letter sent to the university on 28 April and seen by Nature, and they call for an independent review into the university's handling of the case. The investigation led ETH Zurich to decide, in January, that it would not renew Crowther's contract — a tenure-track professorship — and his lab, which previously employed 40–60 people, is being dismantled.

ETH Zurich published a retracted version of the report on 25 April. It finds that Crowther “repeatedly failed to follow internal rules and adequately address conflicts of interest”, but it does not provide evidence of any misuse of funds, according to Stefan Spiegel, the university's vice-president of finance and controlling at the institution.

Crowther, who is on administrative leave until his contract expires in September, denies many of the allegations investigated in the report, but admits he made mistakes. “I am deeply sorry if this caused any discomfort for anyone,” Crowther said in a statement to Nature. He never engaged “any form of inappropriate advances”, he adds.

The university confirmed to Nature that it had received the lab members' letter. “From ETH Zurich's perspective, the case is considered closed” with the publication of the report, it said in a statement. “The President of ETH Zurich had already concluded in December 2024 that the basis of trust required for a permanent position was not given in this case.”

Crowther rose to prominence after publishing a Nature paper1 in 2015 that suggested that Earth had eight times more trees than expected. His work garnered interest from influential people, including US President Donald Trump, and inspired a high-profile tree-conservation initiative by the World Economic Forum.

Crowther has been at ETH Zurich since 2017, but in late 2024, Swiss media reported that several people had made allegations against him to the university.

The report into these allegations, investigated in 2024 and 2025 by a law firm appointed by ETH Zurich, reveals that among the documents examined were five individuals' written statements and a whistle-blowing report on possible compliance issues.

The investigation says that Crowther treated “his employees in the same way as friends”. Although most employees appreciated his behaviour, the report says, others thought it was inappropriate and said he crossed personal boundaries. Examples of this reported behaviour included late-night WhatsApp messages inviting employees to parties. Some described a “toxic management culture”.

In a statement to Nature, Crowther admits that he blurred the lines between personal and professional life, and treated employees as close friends. “I am devastated that it did not work for some. I will always strive to improve,” he says.

For some of the more serious allegations, such as that Crowther kissed a former lab intern and invited a student to his apartment after dinner, the institution said it received information during the investigation that contradicts the accusers' versions of events.

Crowther added: “I would never ever initiate any form of intimate interaction with a student. I am grateful that the ETH investigation uncovered clear evidence to contradict these accusations.”

On financial and legal matters, the probe investigated several allegations, including that lab members worked for other organizations during their contracted hours and that the lab misused consultancy contracts.

The report finds that in certain cases, such as spending on crisis communications, legal advice and marketing, and the use of consultancy contacts, the rules were not always followed. Crowther acknowledged a “few minor oversights” relating to spending on crisis communication and legal advice, but denies that consultancy contracts were misused.

Crowther says that his lab was huge, with “countless contracts and collaborations”. “I know that I will have made some accidental errors. But I can guarantee that no lab members worked for other organizations during their employment at ETH,” he adds.

Overall, the report concludes that Crowther conducted his research to a high level, but “failed to live up to the responsibility expected of him”.

Dark matter is hypothesized to make up about 27% of the Universe, but the nature of its particles remains unknown. Writing in Physical Review Letters, An et al. present a search for proposed dark-matter particles called dark photons using radiation from the Sun (H. An et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 171001; 2025). Their results narrow down the range of possible properties for the dark photon.

A young entrepreneur who was among the earliest known recruiters for Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has a new, related gig—and he's hiring. Anthony Jancso, cofounder of AcclerateX, a government tech startup, is looking for technologists to work on a project that aims to have artificial intelligence perform tasks that are currently the responsibility of tens of thousands of federal workers.

Jancso, a former Palantir employee, wrote in a Slack with about 2000 Palantir alumni in it that he's hiring for a “DOGE orthogonal project to design benchmarks and deploy AI agents across live workflows in federal agencies,” according to an April 21 post reviewed by WIRED. Agents are programs that can perform work autonomously.

“We've identified over 300 roles with almost full-process standardization, freeing up at least 70k FTEs for higher-impact work over the next year,” he continued, essentially claiming that tens of thousands of federal employees could see many aspects of their job automated and replaced by these AI agents. Workers for the project, he wrote, would be based on site in Washington, DC, and would not require a security clearance; it isn't clear for whom they would work. Palantir did not respond to requests for comment.

The post was not well received. Eight people reacted with clown face emojis, three reacted with a custom emoji of a man licking a boot, two reacted with custom emoji of Joaquin Phoenix giving a thumbs down in the movie Gladiator, and three reacted with a custom emoji with the word “Fascist.” Three responded with a heart emoji.

“DOGE does not seem interested in finding ‘higher impact work' for federal employees,” one person said in a comment that received 11 heart reactions. “You're complicit in firing 70k federal employees and replacing them with shitty autocorrect.”

“Tbf we're all going to be replaced with shitty autocorrect (written by chatgpt),” another person commented, which received one “+1” reaction.

“How ‘DOGE orthogonal' is it? Like, does it still require Kremlin oversight?” another person said in a comment that received five reactions with a fire emoji. “Or do they just use your credentials to log in later?”

AccelerateX was originally called AccelerateSF, which VentureBeat reported in 2023 had received support from OpenAI and Anthropic. In its earliest incarnation, AccelerateSF hosted a hackathon for AI developers aimed at using the technology to solve San Francisco's social problems. According to a 2023 Mission Local story, for instance, Jancso proposed that using large language models to help businesses fill out permit forms to streamline the construction paperwork process might help drive down housing prices. (OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment. Anthropic spokesperson Danielle Ghiglieri tells WIRED that the company ""never invested in AccelerateX/SF,” but did sponsor a hackathon AccelerateSF hosted in 2023 by providing free access to its API usage at a time when its Claude API “was still in beta.”)

In 2024, the mission pivoted, with the venture becoming known as AccelerateX. In a post on X announcing the change, the company posted, “Outdated tech is dragging down the US Government. Legacy vendors sell broken systems at increasingly steep prices. This hurts every American citizen.” AccelerateX did not respond to a request for comment.

According to sources with direct knowledge, Jancso disclosed that AccelerateX had signed a partnership agreement with Palantir in 2024. According to the LinkedIn of someone described as one of AccelerateX's cofounders, Rachel Yee, the company looks to have received funding from OpenAI's Converge 2 Accelerator. Another of AccelerateSF's cofounders, Kay Sorin, now works for OpenAI, having joined the company several months after that hackathon. Sorin and Yee did not respond to requests for comment.

Jancso's cofounder, Jordan Wick, a former Waymo engineer, has been an active member of DOGE, appearing at several agencies over the past few months, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, National Labor Relations Board, the Department of Labor, and the Department of Education. In 2023, Jancso attended a hackathon hosted by ScaleAI; WIRED found that another DOGE member, Ethan Shaotran, also attended the same hackathon.

Since its creation in the first days of the second Trump administration, DOGE has pushed the use of AI across agencies, even as it has sought to cut tens of thousands of federal jobs. At the Department of Veterans Affairs, a DOGE associate suggested using AI to write code for the agency's website; at the General Services Administration, DOGE has rolled out the GSAi chatbot; the group has sought to automate the process of firing government employees with a tool called AutoRIF; and a DOGE operative at the Department of Housing and Urban Development is using AI tools to examine and propose changes to regulations. But experts say that deploying AI agents to do the work of 70,000 people would be tricky if not impossible.

A federal employee with knowledge of government contracting, who spoke to WIRED on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press, says, “A lot of agencies have procedures that can differ widely based on their own rules and regulations, and so deploying AI agents across agencies at scale would likely be very difficult.”

Oren Etzioni, cofounder of the AI startup Vercept, says that while AI agents can be good at doing some things—like using an internet browser to conduct research—their outputs can still vary widely and be highly unreliable. For instance, customer service AI agents have invented nonexistent policies when trying to address user concerns. Even research, he says, requires a human to actually make sure what the AI is spitting out is correct.

“We want our government to be something that we can rely on, as opposed to something that is on the absolute bleeding edge,” says Etzioni. “We don't need it to be bureaucratic and slow, but if corporations haven't adopted this yet, is the government really where we want to be experimenting with the cutting edge AI?”

Etzioni says that AI agents are also not great 1-1 fits for job replacements. Rather, AI is able to do certain tasks or make others more efficient, but the idea that the technology could do the jobs of 70,000 employees would not be possible. “Unless you're using funny math,” he says, “no way.”

Jancso, first identified by WIRED in February, was one of the earliest recruiters for DOGE in the months before Donald Trump was inaugurated. In December, Jancso, who sources told WIRED said he had been recruited by Steve Davis, president of the Musk-founded Boring Company and a current member of DOGE, used the Palantir alumni group to recruit DOGE members. On December 2nd, 2024, he wrote, “I'm helping Elon's team find tech talent for the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in the new admin. This is a historic opportunity to build an efficient government, and to cut the federal budget by 1/3. If you're interested in playing a role in this mission, please reach out in the next few days.”

According to one source at SpaceX, who asked to remain anonymous as they are not authorized to speak to the press, Jancso appeared to be one of the DOGE members who worked out of the company's DC office in the days before inauguration along with several other people who would constitute some of DOGE's earliest members. SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment.

Palantir was cofounded by Peter Thiel, a billionaire and longtime Trump supporter with close ties to Musk. Palantir, which provides data analytics tools to several government agencies including the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security, has received billions of dollars in government contracts. During the second Trump administration, the company has been involved in helping to build a “mega API” to connect data from the Internal Revenue Service to other government agencies, and is working with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to create a massive surveillance platform to identify immigrants to target for deportation.

Earlier this week, at the Auburn Avenue Research Library in Atlanta, a couple dozen fellows commenced a year-long project designed to put the mission of preserving Black history back in the hands of community members.

“We want to open up a conversation asking, ‘What does it look like for a community of Black people to come together and decide what to collect?'” says Makiba Foster, cofounder of the Web Archiving School (WARC), a new training program that teaches practitioners methods of digital preservation built around an “ethic of care.”

“We don't want to depend on institutions for folks to have these kinds of skills. They will backtrack on us when it's beneficial to them.”

WARC could not have arrived at a more urgent moment. Since taking office in January, President Donald Trump has targeted diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) aggressively and vowed to fight “anti-white” racism. He first signed an executive order to end “radical and wasteful” diverse hiring practices in federal agencies, then followed that with another aimed squarely at DEI programs in the private sector. But it didn't stop there. In March, Trump signed an executive order accusing the Smithsonian Institution of having “come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology.” Taken together, the proclamations are part of the administration's broader attempt to sanitize so-called “woke ideology” from the annals of American life and “forge a society that is color-blind and merit based.” But not everyone views it that way.

“There is an attempt at dehumanization happening,” Bergis Jules, an archivist and WARC cofounder says. “The first act of taking away someone's humanity is denying the fact that you have a history. And if you're trying to take that away, then you don't believe those people need to exist.”

WARC's inaugural class—22 fellows whose backgrounds span everything from research and library science to visual and audio art—are training to become the next generation of Black “memory workers” with the right tools to digitally preserve the histories that are important to them. As many agencies, public and private, have quickly fallen in line with Trump's orders, Foster says she's not going to rely on legacy institutions to do that important work.

“When it's time to make a statement around DEI, and it's a bandwagon thing, it's cool. But when the rubber meets the road and someone's telling you can't do this, people quickly turn,” she says.

WARC is the flagship program of the Archiving the Black Web collective that Foster and Jules started in 2019, inspired in part by their work documenting the Black Lives Matter movement.

Their efforts come as scholars are sounding the alarm over Trump's latest war on museums—and history itself. “In this naive effort to control how the past is recorded and interpreted, the Trump administration has stepped into a minefield,” David Blight, president of the Organization of American Historians, wrote in The New York Times.

In March, a biography about baseball hall-of-famer Jackie Robinson was removed from the Nimitz Library in the US Naval Academy, along with 400 books tied to DEI. The following month, the National Park Service removed references to Harriet Tubman's role in fighting against enslavement on a webpage; that information has since been restored. In the executive order targeting the Smithsonian network of museums, Trump calls out, “The Shape of Power: Stories of Race and American Sculpture,” an exhibit at the American Art Museum, as part of a so-called coordinated effort to “portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.”

Meredith D. Clark, a professor of race and political communication at UNC-Chapel Hill, tells WIRED that museums are akin to “public trusts,” and the Trump administration's assault on them is an attempt to dictate who does and doesn't belong.

“One of the things that power needs to do in order to expand and conquer is to convince people that there is no hope in resistance. And a tool for doing that is to destroy heritage,” says Clark, who wrote We Tried to Tell Y'all: Black Twitter and the Rise of Digital Counternarratives. “You can see those patterns everywhere, from the Holocaust and the burning of books to, in more recent years, the destruction of historical reservoirs and artifacts in Syria.”

Even though they can be a cesspool of racism and bigotry, social media platforms, from X to TikTok, are now de facto outlets for resistance as digital media has become the primary mode of communication. As facts get easier to manipulate thanks to AI and lack of moderation, information—and our access to it—becomes even more vital. One way online activists and educators have traditionally fought back is through the creation of crowdsourced syllabi recommending resources around issues of police abuse, white supremacy, and race for educators.

“We saw it with Ferguson and Charlottesville,” Clark says of the Twitter campaigns from 2014, following the killing of unarmed Black teenager Michael Brown by police, and 2017, in the wake of the Unite the Right rally where violent protests broke out and a white supremacist murdered a woman with his car.

Foster says the country underwent a “pedagogical shift” during this time.

“Black people were saying that ignorance is no longer a defense. Folks were publishing reading lists, opening up their syllabi. All of a sudden you could educate yourself on these issues, and I wanted to document that,” Foster says. “When it comes to preserving an official record, they typically don't care what we think,” she says of large, often federally backed institutions, which is why social media has become crucial.

The National Libraries and the Internet Archive were, for a time, the principal institutions dedicated to cataloging the web. But “only a small set of people were involved in that community,” Jules says, “and Black folks studying to be archivists were not invited to those networks.”

A nonprofit that launched in 1996, the Internet Archive operates as a library of sorts: It includes 835 billion web pages, 44 million books and texts, and 15 million audio recordings, in addition to other artifacts. Many people today think of it as the web's collective memory. In April, the Internet Archive, which was already facing legal troubles in separate cases from Universal Music Group and the book publisher Hachette, was targeted by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency when the agency cut funding for the National Endowment for the Humanities, which supports the archive.

In spite of the administration's purge, Rudy Fraser, the creator of Blacksky, says he is “heartened by preservation efforts” he's seen so far, including from Harvard Law Library's Innovation Lab—which is rescuing federal datasets—and companies such as Joy Media, which leverage AI and VR/AR to scan and annotate African artifacts, making them accessible to people on the continent who otherwise can't view them.

In 2023, Fraser launched Blacksky, the custom feed and moderation service that quickly turned into the central meeting ground for many Black users on Bluesky. He tells me he also views Blacksky as a living archive. Currently its database holds 17 million posts from Black users over the last two years (excluding deletions and moderation removals). “Because the AT Protocol is public and Blacksky's implementation is open source, anyone with the technical chops could reconstruct the dataset—minus moderation actions—even if our primary databases disappeared,” he says. “Open source, decentralized tooling ensures that, if any single company becomes a nation-state target, the communities that rely on its infrastructure can keep operating.”

Preservation efforts have also taken the form of rogue civil rights courses across college campuses. When Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah's course on race, media and global history was discontinued by Columbia University in April, Attiah decided to “liberate my teaching work” by hosting it as an online course, aptly rebranding it “Resistance Summer School.”

“This is not the time for media literacy or historical knowledge to be held hostage by institutions bending the knee to authoritarianism and fear,” she wrote on her Substack. The outpouring of support was seismic. According to Attiah, within 48 hours, all 500 seats were filled; the waiting list currently has over 3,000 people on it.

It is still too soon to say just how much of a long-term impact Trump's attack on Black history is going to have on our population's historical literacy, but Foster and Jules say they are not deterred by the work ahead of them.

“What does it mean for the federal government, at this moment, to be stewards of Black people's history? It only takes the stroke of a pen to start dismantling things. So what does that mean looking forward?” Jules says.

Ultimately, road maps to a better future are impossible without grassroots preservation efforts, Clark says. “The destruction of those histories and records makes it harder for people to remember what that progress looked like. Both its successes and its failures. And it makes it harder for people to imagine what continued progress could look like. That is the whole point.”

The formal agenda of the Federal Communications Commission's open meeting this week seemed well in line with its normal wonky pursuits. There were items on satellite broadband, a licensing framework for the lower 37-gigahertz spectrum, and newly proposed rules that could help block robocalls. In the practiced government kabuki of these events, commissioners spoke, proposals were voted on unanimously, and chairman Brendan Carr, appointed by Donald Trump, ran things smoothly, though his demeanor was rather boisterous. An observer might conclude that despite the new administration, it was business as usual at the FCC.

This is an essay from the latest edition of Steven Levy's Plaintext newsletter.

Then came the regular press Q&A. Ever so politely, the beat journalists probed Carr about recent moves he'd made—like using the power of his role to investigate news organizations for airing stories that just happen to make Donald Trump unhappy. Notably, Carr has launched a probe into how CBS edited a 60 Minutes interview of then candidate Kamala Harris. Despite no evidence of journalistic malpractice, Trump demanded that the network should “lose its license” over the story. He also recommended other networks lose their affiliates “because they are just as corrupt as CBS—maybe even WORSE!”

This was before Trump came back to power, and Jessica Rosenworcel, then chair of the FCC, brushed it off. She noted that the agency didn't revoke licenses because a politician disliked how he was covered. Before Rosenworcel left office, the complaint was denied. But after Trump installed Carr as FCC chair in late January, he pulled the case out of the dustbin and started an investigation. So much for following Trump's January 20 executive order demanding “no Federal Government officer, employee, or agent engages in or facilitates any conduct that would unconstitutionally abridge the free speech of any American citizen.”

Carr's response to questions about CBS at the open meeting was: “All options remain on the table,” even the “death penalty” of the network's broadcast license. He also indicated that NBC and the other networks that have covered the case of the legal immigrant mistakenly deported to an El Salvadorian prison might be in similar trouble. His justification was that since broadcast outlets have exclusive access to their slice of public airwaves, their content must be in the public interest. If they don't like that, he said, they can be podcasters.

The trouble with this—well there are a lot of troubles with this—is that it's obvious that “the public interest” here is being interpreted as “stuff Donald Trump likes.” While the FCC can issue sanctions about “news distortion,” that term refers to egregious and consciously fraudulent reporting. The CBS case and the network coverage of deportations aren't even in the same universe as that kind of malfeasance. “This is one of the tools that the administration is using to censor and control the news media, and to punish anyone that dares to speak against our government,” the remaining Democrat on the commission, Anna Gomez, told me this week.

It's not only Democrats who are alarmed by this. In March, far-right crusader Grover Norquist—the guy who once said he wanted to drown government in a bathtub—was among the ultra-conservatives who signed a letter begging Carr to dismiss the case, saying it would “constitute regulatory overreach and advance precedent that can be weaponized by future FCCs.” Dude, it's the current FCC we have to worry about! When Carr tried to explain his complaints about news coverage, he said they were all about empowering local news as opposed to big networks. But Gomez told me that the stations themselves are spooked. “I've spoken to local broadcasters throughout the country, and they're nervous that they're going to get dragged before the FCC based on the content of their coverage,” she says.

How did we get here? Carr's background indicates that he might have been a straightforward leader of the agency. After several years as a legal adviser, he became a commissioner in 2017 and Joe Biden reappointed him in 2023. (Three of the five FCC commissioners, including the chair, are to be from the president's party.) As a lifelong Republican—his father was once one of Nixon's lawyers—he would be expected to champion conservative stances, like fighting net neutrality and sucking up to big telecom interests. His views on government regulating content seemed in sync with the First Amendment: After two House Democrats complained about Fox News after the January 6 insurrection, he released a statement saying, in part, “A newsroom's decision about what stories to cover and how to frame them should be beyond the reach of any government official, not targeted by them.”

But even before Trump elevated him to the chairmanship in January, Carr was veering into wing-nut territory. “When I was at the White House, he was like a thorn, always trying to make all kinds of weird MAGA moves,” says Tim Wu, who was Biden's special assistant in tech policy. “We refused to have anything to do with him, because he was playing by a different rule book. He was less like a commissioner and more a random podcaster.” One of those MAGA moves was writing the communications chapter in the notorious Project 2025 playbook that turned out to be the road map the White House is using to dismantle the government, though the chapter said nothing about regulating “news distortion.” As chair, Carr must now be listened to, especially as he veers into the censorship lane.

One irony of the Carr strategy is that he sits atop the FCC when the agency's literal powers are weaker than ever. In February, Trump signed an executive order reining in independent agencies like the FCC—essentially making himself a supercommissioner with ultimate authority. Also, a recent Fifth Circuit court decision seemingly stripped away the FCC's power to unilaterally impose fines. (Carr says that the reasoning was faulty, and the agency is appealing.)

Despite these limitations, Carr is still dangerous. The mere act of investigating—or even criticizing—a media company's actions, whether they involve objective journalism or a DEI policy, can have a chilling effect. (Carr is looking into Disney's efforts to promote gender and racial equity, which he sees as another reason to sanction media companies.) “While there are no formal decisions of the FCC, Carr is using his powers of intimidation and coercion,” says Thomas Wheeler, who was FCC chair during Obama's second term. Morality and justice aside, it's an effective strategy. “Point one, there's no vehicle to push back, because there's no final decision you can take to court. And point two is that it's not necessarily healthy to poke your regulator in the eye.”

Jonathan Nuechterlein, a former general counsel at the FTC, writing about another Carr overstep— he questioned Google because its YouTube TV service doesn't carry the faith-based Great American Family Network—opined that Carr doesn't need to make rulings or invoke fines to make a difference: “Jawboning” alone can be akin to enforcement. “A jawboning target cannot simply call the FCC's bluff,” he wrote, “because the Commission, and the Administration as a whole, enjoy great discretion to kneecap any disobedient company down the road in unrelated contexts, ranging from merger-approval proceedings to litigation settlements to the award of government benefits.”

The CBS case is proof of that. The network is a subsidiary of Paramount, which is seeking government approval of a multibillion-dollar merger with Skydance, a media company controlled by David Ellison. When Trump personally sued Paramount for a ridiculously high $20 billion due to CBS's editing, the company had an incentive to go into settlement talks—and apparently, impose extra oversight on 60 Minutes. This led the show's longtime leader to resign. When anchor Scott Pelley announced the change on the air, he specifically cited the Paramount merger as a motivator for the oversight. The assumed endgame: a settlement in Trump's favor, whereupon the president would order an end to the FCC investigation. At the April open meeting, Carr ducked a question about whether he would drop the issue if Trump ordered it.

People expect presidents to rail about their press critics. Using regulatory bodies to engage in government censorship—didn't I hear about an executive order banning that?— is something quite different. It's straight out of the authoritarian handbook, and must be called out strongly. That's what led a bipartisan group of former FCC commissioners to file a letter on March 26, objecting to the CBS investigation. Failure to dismiss the complaint, they wrote, “would suggest that the Commission has been transformed into a tool of White House-driven speech suppression.”

Behind the strong language of the letter, however, is a tale of submission. According to Wheeler, the call to sign the letter went out to all the former commissioners since the Bush years, including six chairs. “Out of those 24, we could only get 5 to sign that filing, and only two chairmen—because of the fear of retribution,” he says. Carr's blustery censorship may be less alarming than the silence of those who stand by as our rights erode.

When clothing designers place an order at Katty Fashion's factory in Iași, Romania, they expect a bespoke service. If necessary, the factory will even rejig its production lines to make whichever garment a designer commissions. “From order to order, we may have to adapt,” says Eduard Modreanu, the company's technical lead. “We cannot create one production line or shop floor that fits everyone.”

This adaptability is useful given the many diverse clients and orders Katty Fashion juggles, but it could also help future-proof the company against climate shocks. Katty Fashion is part of an EU-funded project called R3GROUP, which aims to help firms boost the resilience of their supply chains against disruptions caused by climate change and other factors.

“Let's say there's going to be flooding in Germany, and we get our materials from Spain,” says Modreanu. “They cannot get here any more.”

As part of the R3GROUP project, Katty Fashion has worked with researchers to build a forensic understanding of where their textiles and accessories such as buttons and zips come from. It has revealed certain potential weak points, such as Spain and Portugal—countries that may increasingly be prone to heat waves or drought in the coming years.

Using this data, along with information gleaned from news and weather reports, the company is developing a digital twin of its supply chain and factory processes that will analyze the vulnerability of its supplier network in real time. If supply issues mean a garment has to be made in a slightly different way, a companion model will also suggest how to reconfigure production lines and worker shifts accordingly.

The Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the vulnerability of global supply chains. Companies were so hammered by logistics issues between 2020 and 2022 that many took up a strategy of “reshoring”—opting for suppliers closer to home so as to reduce delays. Some firms even decided to make completely different products, such as the gin and whiskey distilleries that began churning out hand sanitizer.

US president Donald Trump's recent tariffs provided another shock to the supply chain system. As manufacturers weighed the possibilities of reshoring jobs in the US, many found that bringing the supply chains back to America wouldn't be cost-effective, and instead contemplated moving factories to territories less impacted by tariffs.

But while the pandemic crunch was solved relatively quickly, and Trump's tariffs remain unpredictable, the next big shock is likely to last longer. Climate change is already disrupting global supply chains, for instance by exacerbating droughts in Taiwan, where water supplies are crucial for semiconductor manufacturing. Digital twins—virtual models of physical systems—are one way to prepare.

R3GROUP is also working with companies in the metals and plastics industries, says Tjerk Timan, project coordinator and EU project manager at France's Industrial Technical Centre for Plastics and Composites. But while some firms are actively thinking about how they can adapt to climate-change-related threats, others are more focused on current competition. “We see a bit more of a head-in-the-sand strategy at the moment,” he says.

Abhi Ghadge, associate professor of supply chain management at Cranfield University in the UK, says there has been “a general kind of negligence” in terms of climate resilience, though that is beginning to change.

Building a detailed understanding of a supply chain can, however, be incredibly difficult, especially for smaller companies. Who supplies their suppliers? Which key raw material is about to become subject to a shortage? Tracking such details requires long-term commitment and investment, says Beatriz Royo, associate professor at the MIT-Zaragoza Program in Spain.

Mindful of this, professional services firm Marsh McLennan launched a system called Sentrisk last year that it claims can automatically analyze a company's shipping manifests and customs clearance records to build up a picture of its supply chain. Sentrisk relies on large language models to read potentially billions of PDF documents, depending on the client in question, and automatically trace where individual materials and parts come from. “It could misread something, of course,” says John Davies, Sentrisk commercial director—though he emphasises that the system relies on artificial intelligence only to read documents, not extrapolate beyond them. There's no chance of it hallucinating a network of suppliers that doesn't exist.

Sentrisk combines this supply chain analysis with data on climate risks in specific locations. “If you're to invest in the construction of a new fabrication plant, maybe you can choose a location that is less likely to be impacted by water shortage,” says Davies.

Another challenge is that digital twins require constant updating, says Dmitry Ivanov, professor of supply chain and operations management at the Berlin School of Economics and Law. “It's not like a house that you build and the house exists in this form for 100 years,” he says. “Supply chains change every day.”

And while we have a reasonably good idea of how climate change will affect the planet as a whole in the coming years, the exact location, timing, and magnitude of specific disasters is tricky to predict. This is where new tools for climate-risk modeling and extreme weather prediction come in. Semiconductor and AI giant Nvidia has a platform called Earth-2, which it hopes will address this challenge, with the help of other organizations including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

The idea is to use AI to provide earlier warnings of a drought or flood, or to more accurately predict how a storm will develop. Some parts of the world only have relatively high-level information about current weather patterns; Earth-2 uses the same type of AI that sharpens pictures in your smartphone camera app to simulate higher-resolution data. “This is really useful, especially for small regions,” says Dion Harris, senior director of high-performance computing and AI factory solutions at Nvidia.

Companies can feed their own data into Earth-2 to improve predictions even further. They might use the platform to model climate and weather impacts in specific geographies, but the overall scope of the project is vast. “We are building the foundational elements to create a digital twin of the Earth,” Harris says.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Inside the Battle Over OpenAI's Corporate Restructuring","https://www.wired.com/story/open-ai-nonprofit-transition-activism/","Fri, 02 May 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Last October, the news that OpenAI was planning to simplify its unusual nonprofit structure caught the attention of economic-justice activist Orson Aguilar. He feared that the ChatGPT maker's plan to transition into a more conventional company, from which investors could generate unlimited returns, would financially hurt the working-class communities he has spent nearly 30 years fighting to protect.

Aguilar's new organization, LatinoProsperity, focuses on intergenerational wealth building, and he believed cutting-edge AI chatbots such as ChatGPT would become an integral part of many good-paying jobs of the future. But after reading about OpenAI's desires, he worried that transitioning into a public-benefit corporation empowered to chase profits would enrich the already wealthy and neglect the startup's stated mission to benefit all of humanity with AI.

Aguilar decided to make a phone call that day, kicking off a series of events that eventually led him to become one of the leading voices battling over OpenAI's future and the establishment of what may become the deepest-pocketed charitable foundation in the world.

Today, OpenAI's for-profit business is controlled by a nonprofit, and the returns for investors are capped. But as OpenAI's ambitions have grown, and staying on the cutting edge has required it to raise significantly more funding, investors have demanded greater payback.

OpenAI said a recent $40 billion investment round propelled its valuation to $300 billion, but 75 percent of the pledged cash is contingent on the startup completing a structural revamp by early next year. A byproduct of the move, the AI startup said in a December blog post, would be the creation of “one of the best resourced nonprofits in history”—albeit one with less power over what products OpenAI builds and for whom.

Aguilar is co-steering a coalition of advocacy groups that met with San Francisco–based OpenAI in March and is pushing the California attorney general's office, which regulates the state's nonprofits, to ensure that the startup's restructuring adheres to the law. Their activism has already contributed to OpenAI forming a small advisory commission that includes legendary labor activist Dolores Huerta.

“Tech companies, they like to disrupt,” Aguilar says. “We can't let them disrupt our charitable system and get away with it. We have a tool already—a nonprofit OpenAI with a stated mission to do good things. It would be a shame if that was lost in the race of developing AI.”

OpenAI spokesperson Lindsey Held says the organization's restructuring “would ensure that as the public benefit corporation succeeds and grows, so too does the nonprofit, enabling us to achieve the mission” of AI broadly benefiting the public.

A group of tech industry heavyweights, including Elon Musk and Sam Altman, cofounded OpenAI as a nonprofit in 2015 with the goal of countering existing AI projects run by big, profit-driven companies. OpenAI planned to share its research with the public while focusing on developing AI systems that are highly capable and broadly helpful.

But as development grew more expensive and ChatGPT became an overnight sensation upon its debut in 2022, OpenAI has increasingly shifted toward withholding some of the key details about its research for security and competitive reasons. It's also now trying to generate significant revenue from its services.

Musk, who went on to start an OpenAI competitor, sued the ChatGPT maker and its CEO Altman for allegedly abandoning its original foundational principles. Musk lost a preliminary bid in federal court last month to block OpenAI from transitioning to a public-benefit corporation that can legally pursue both profits and societal benefits. (Another OpenAI competitor, Meta, has expressed support for Musk's efforts to block the restructuring.)

OpenAI's investors, including Microsoft and several venture capital firms, poured tens of billions of dollars into the startup, making a bet that they could find a way to capitalize on the so-called capped-profit venture that sits under its nonprofit parent. After the restructuring, those investors could see their returns materialize as soon as 2027, when OpenAI hopes to hold an initial public offering of the public-benefit corporation, according to a person briefed on internal discussions at the company who asked to remain anonymous to protect industry relationships.

Post-restructing, OpenAI plans to have an affiliated nonprofit. But what remains unclear is how much of its current value and potential future profits will be split between its nonprofit and the for-profit arm, as well as what sort of control either entity will have over the other. OpenAI's current nonprofit division reported about $21.1 million in net assets as of December 31, 2023, according to its most recent publicly available federal tax filing.

Aguilar contends that valuing OpenAI's nonprofit entity even a penny short of its fair market worth would be unlawful, and anything but total independence from OpenAI would allow commercial imperatives to corrupt the charity. “Let's fairly value this and get it independent,” he says.

Aguilar's first call last October was to Fred Blackwell, executive director of the San Francisco Foundation, an organization that gives grants to social justice groups, and its chief impact officer, Judith Bell. In the 1990s, the two of them had learned about dozens of nonprofit hospitals and health insurance giants across the country that were converting into for-profit companies, aiming to better compete in an era of emerging treatments and new technologies.

As part of some of the conversions, health care executives had found ways to boost payouts for themselves while hollowing out funding for affiliated philanthropic entities. Bell and her then-colleagues at the advocacy group Consumers Union zeroed in on California law stipulating that any money held by nonprofits belongs to the people of the state forever and can only ever be used for charitable purposes. In exchange, nonprofits and their donors are entitled to tax breaks.

The law also states that California's attorney general has to approve conversions and the handling of imperiled charitable funds. A former California official who was involved in conversion reviews but is not authorized to speak about them publicly says it's typically a cordial process meant to help organizations lawfully transition to their desired structure—but outside input is welcome.

Bell eventually helped form a broad coalition of labor and community groups to lobby the AG's office over the health care conversions. That advocacy helped nonprofits retain significant shares in newly established companies, a set of arrangements that Bell estimates saved $15 billion in charitable money from being stolen by businesses and their investors. Three of the state's biggest independent foundations by assets—the California Endowment, California Wellness Foundation, and the California Health Care Foundation—emerged from that advocacy. And the for-profit companies also have done just fine, Bell believes. “You can protect the charitable assets and allow these companies to go forth in the for-profit world,” she says.

Late last year, Bell, Blackwell, and Aguilar decided to dust off the old playbook. They commissioned a legal memo that reiterated the power of the attorney general over the irrevocable status of charitable funds and called up their contacts to form a coalition of what is now over 50 community organizations working together to try to influence the future of one of the hottest tech companies in the world.

Blackwell says some members of the group are concerned that OpenAI's plans could threaten the integrity of the nonprofit sector as a whole. Donors, they argue, may be reluctant to continue contributing if they feel that money earmarked for the public good could be peeled off into for-profit pursuits.

The coalition urged California attorney general Rob Bonta to carefully review the OpenAI conversion and launched a campaign in January to attract public attention to the issue. The effort has garnered widespread support, including from some former OpenAI employees and AI researchers, who have also urged Bonta's counterpart in Delaware—where OpenAI is chartered—to ensure its mission isn't undermined by the restructuring. (Both attorney general's offices have said they are investigating the matter but provided few details.)

By March, OpenAI wanted to meet with Aguilar's advocacy coalition. At the San Francisco Foundation's offices, Blackwell, Aguilar, and another coalition leader sat down with two of OpenAI's global affairs staffers, including Debbie Mesloh, a former senior adviser to then-California attorney general Kamala Harris.

OpenAI's Held says the meeting raised a “number of misconceptions about our corporate structure—many of which seemed to echo those voiced by Musk.” Aguilar says OpenAI wanted feedback on evolving its nonprofit mission. But left unaddressed were core questions about the amount of funding and independence OpenAI would afford to the charitable arm.

Another attendee at the meeting was Daniel Zingale, a retired former adviser to several California governors who is now consulting for OpenAI. Mesloh and other company leaders who had known Zingale from California politics wanted his help convening a group of luminaries from the philanthropic world to give advice about how OpenAI should spend its charitable funds and distribute its technology to other nonprofits. In 2023, OpenAI's current nonprofit arm gave out over $2.6 million in grants, including to education institutions, AI safety groups, and economics researchers.

Zingale says the advocacy by Aguilar's outside coalition helped play a role in the founding of OpenAI's advisory commission, which began meeting April 21 and whose recommendations are due by July 20. (OpenAI spokesperson Held says the commission was born out of a long-held “desire to engage in more ways with the wider nonprofit community.”) Whether the commission ultimately tackles the concerns raised by the activists remains unclear.

Its members include veteran political adviser Jack Oliver, former media executive Monica Lozano, and 95-year-old labor activist Huerta. They did not respond to requests for comment.

Zingale also helped recruit Robert Ross, who previously spent about a quarter century as CEO of the California Endowment, one of the nonprofits that emerged from the health care conversions of the '90s. Ross says his former organization is widely recognized as a nonprofit-to-profit conversion success, and he wants the same to be true of OpenAI.

“This is a big damn deal in civic and political circles that will have enormous consequences for civic society and marginalized and underserved communities,” Ross says. “Our task is more on the spending side—how should the assets be deployed. However, it's incomplete if we don't speak to issues of governance. I suspect you'll see a report that will speak to both issues.”

Aguilar says he is skeptical of the advisory panel's efforts. Though the commission is supposed to come up with recommendations for how OpenAI can help ensure everyone has the opportunity to benefit from AI tools, Zingale and Ross both say they have little experience using AI themselves.

“This is a fascinating endeavor for me, because what I know about AI could fit into a thimble,” says Ross, adding he is eager to learn from others who are more knowledgeable.

Google's NotebookLM Android and iOS apps are expected to launch on May 20, according to app store listings. The apps are currently available for preorder.

Since its launch in 2023, the AI-based note-taking and research assistant has only been accessible via desktop. Google is now gearing up to make the service available on the go.

NotebookLM is designed to help students, professionals, and researchers better understand complex information through features like smart summaries and the ability to ask questions about documents and other materials. The research assistant also lets you generate AI podcasts, called Audio Overviews, to make it easier to digest complex topics. 

According to screenshots on the app listings, the dedicated apps will allow users to create new notebooks and view the ones they have already created. They can also upload new sources from their device and view the ones they have already uploaded in each of the notebooks. Plus, the apps will allow you to listen to the Audio Overviews you have generated on the go.

In addition to mobile, the apps will be available on iPads and tablets, where you'll have a bigger screen to multitask.

You can choose to preorder the app on the App Store or pre-register for it on Google Play. If you do so, the app will be automatically downloaded onto your phone on May 20.

Given that the apps are expected to become available on the first day of Google I/O, the tech giant will likely share more information about them at the annual conference in a few weeks.

Apple has changed its App Store rules in the U.S. to let apps link users to their own websites so they can buy subscriptions or other digital goods. 

This change comes after a U.S. court ruled in favor of Epic Games in a case against the iPhone maker, ordering the latter not to prohibit apps from including features that could redirect users to their own websites for making digital purchases.

“The App Review Guidelines have been updated for compliance with a United States court decision regarding buttons, external links, and other calls to action in apps,” Apple said in a blog post.

The lawsuit that Epic Games brought in 2020 concerned the amount of control Apple had over transactions done in apps hosted on its App Store. In 2021, the game studio won an injunction that ordered Apple to give developers more options to redirect users to their own websites so they could avoid paying the tech giant a 30% cut.

After its appeal against the injunction failed, Apple last year started allowing other apps  to link out and use non-Apple payment mechanisms, but it still took a 27% commission, and also added what critics called “scare screens.” 

This week's ruling means Apple must stop showing these “scare screens,” and the company has already removed guidelines around how these screens and links should contain certain language. 

We have asked Apple to confirm if it would stop charging apps a commission on payments made via external links, and we will update the story if we hear back.

As for Apple, it's not happy with the ruling. “We strongly disagree with the decision. We will comply with the court's order and we will appeal,” the company said in a statement.

Spotify, which has also been fighting with Apple over the same issue in various geographies, has already submitted a version of its app to the U.S. App Store with links to let users buy its subscription externally.

OpenAI says it'll make changes to the way it updates the AI models that power ChatGPT, following an incident that caused the platform to become overly sycophantic for many users.

Last weekend, after OpenAI rolled out a tweaked GPT-4o — the default model powering ChatGPT — users on social media noted that ChatGPT began responding in an overly validating and agreeable way. It quickly became a meme. Users posted screenshots of ChatGPT applauding all sorts of problematic, dangerous decisions and ideas.

In a post on X last Sunday, CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the problem and said that OpenAI would work on fixes “ASAP.” On Tuesday, Altman announced the GPT-4o update was being rolled back and that OpenAI was working on “additional fixes” to the model's personality.

The company published a postmortem on Tuesday, and in a blog post Friday, OpenAI expanded on specific adjustments it plans to make to its model deployment process. 

OpenAI says it plans to introduce an opt-in “alpha phase” for some models that would allow certain ChatGPT users to test the models and give feedback prior to launch. The company also says it'll include explanations of “known limitations” for future incremental updates to models in ChatGPT, and adjust its safety review process to formally consider “model behavior issues” like personality, deception, reliability, and hallucination (i.e., when a model makes things up) as “launch-blocking” concerns.

“Going forward, we'll proactively communicate about the updates we're making to the models in ChatGPT, whether ‘subtle' or not,” wrote OpenAI in the blog post. “Even if these issues aren't perfectly quantifiable today, we commit to blocking launches based on proxy measurements or qualitative signals, even when metrics like A/B testing look good.”

we missed the mark with last week's GPT-4o update.what happened, what we learned, and some things we will do differently in the future: https://t.co/ER1GmRYrIC

The pledged fixes come as more people turn to ChatGPT for advice. According to one recent survey by lawsuit financier Express Legal Funding, 60% of U.S. adults have used ChatGPT to seek counsel or information. The growing reliance on ChatGPT — and the platform's enormous user base — raises the stakes when issues like extreme sycophancy emerge, not to mention hallucinations and other technical shortcomings.

As one mitigating step, earlier this week, OpenAI said it would experiment with ways to let users give “real-time feedback” to “directly influence their interactions” with ChatGPT. The company also said it would refine techniques to steer models away from sycophancy, potentially allow people to choose from multiple model personalities in ChatGPT, build additional safety guardrails, and expand evaluations to help identify issues beyond sycophancy.

“One of the biggest lessons is fully recognizing how people have started to use ChatGPT for deeply personal advice — something we didn't see as much even a year ago,” continued OpenAI in its blog post. “At the time, this wasn't a primary focus, but as AI and society have co-evolved, it's become clear that we need to treat this use case with great care. It's now going to be a more meaningful part of our safety work.”

Airbnb started rolling out an AI-powered customer service bot in the U.S. last month, CEO Brian Chesky said during the firm's first-quarter conference call on Thursday. 

Chesky said 50% of Airbnb's U.S. users are already using the AI bot for customer service, adding that the company plans to roll out the feature to all its users in the country this month.

“One thing I'll say about AI [is that] it is definitely making the customer experience easier […] It has already led to a 15% reduction in people needing to contact live human agents,” he noted during the analyst call. 

Last year, the company told TechCrunch that it was testing the technology, but in a limited manner and only for certain queries. 

“I think there is a lot of potential for applying AI to the business. We think a lot about how AI is going to change the experience at the consumer layer over time,” Airbnb co-founder Nathan Blecharczyk told TechCrunch at that time. 

Unlike companies like OpenAI, Google, Perplexity and the slew of startups building AI agents (AI tools that can perform tasks on a user's behalf), Airbnb seems to be taking a more measured approach with AI. Chesky said in February that the company would use AI for customer service before it started implementing it for other uses like travel planning or booking tickets, as he believes the technology is still in its early days. 

Meanwhile, its competitors Expedia and Booking.com are investing heavily on the technology, launching AI features like building itineraries, trip planning, and real-time updates for travel. 

Airbnb's reported a total revenue of $2.27 billion for the first quarter, up 6% from a year earlier. The company, however, forecast current-quarter revenue slightly below analysts' expectations, and indicated that it was expecting travel demand to slow down as the global tariff war hurts sentiment and discourages discretionary spending.

Plenty of startups hit a wall after their first few rounds of funding, having grown too big for venture funds but still in need of cash. For startups specializing in industrial-scale hardware, which includes many climate tech companies, the problem is especially acute because the capital requirements are so large.

Infrastructure funds have long filled that gap, but many have been hesitant to dive into climate tech. 

One firm thinks that spells opportunity, though. Ara Partners recently raised an $800 million infrastructure fund focused on reducing carbon emissions in industrial sectors, which historically have been hard to decarbonize.

Ara had initially targeted $500 million, the firm told TechCrunch, but saw strong support from new and existing investors, including pension funds, insurance companies, endowments, foundations, and sovereign wealth funds from around the world.

The new fund has already made three investments, including in an Ireland-based household organic waste recycler and a biofuels terminal developer. The fund's decarbonization strategy focuses on repurposing existing assets for new low-carbon developments.

This significant fundraise arrives at a time of political uncertainty over decarbonization in the U.S. but increasing clarity around its economics. Many companies have been able to drive down costs of low- and zero-carbon technologies in recent years, making them cost competitive with existing approaches. 

Ara, for example, previously invested in Divert through one of its private equity funds. The company donates food that's still good and, for food that isn't edible, turns the waste into biogas that can be sold or used to generate electricity and heat on-site. Compared with the alternative — sending the waste to a landfill where it generates methane pollution — Divert's approach makes a lot of sense environmentally and financially.

The investment firm said it will announce its fourth investment under the strategy “shortly.”

Spotify said on Friday that Apple has approved its U.S. app update that will allow users to access pricing information and external payment links. The approval comes days after a U.S. judge ordered Apple to stop charging commissions on purchases through iPhone apps.

“In a victory for consumers, artists, creators, and authors, Apple has approved Spotify's U.S. app update,” Spotify spokesperson Jeanne Moran said in a statement to TechCrunch. “After nearly a decade, this will finally allow us to freely show clear pricing information and links to purchase, fostering transparency and choice for U.S. consumers.”

She continued. “We can now give consumers lower prices, more control, and easier access to the Spotify experience. There is more work to do, but today represents a significant milestone for developers and entrepreneurs everywhere who want to build and compete on a more level playing field. It's the opening act of a new era, and we could not be more ready for the show.” 

The updated app, version 9.0.40, is rolling out now on the App Store. Spotify is now one of the first major apps to get a new update, opening up purchases.

Spotify submitted the update to Apple yesterday, noting that it could tell customers about different subscription options and how much each one costs right within the iPhone app. Users will also be able to link out to purchase or change their Spotify subscription plan on the company's website, where its transactions won't be subject to Apple's 30% service charge on in-app payments. Plus, Spotify said it would now be able to tell U.S. customers about promotional offers in the app.

Apple said on Wednesday that it will comply with the court's order but that it strongly disagrees with the decision and will appeal.

U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said on Wednesday that Apple violated an order to reform its App Store to allow developers to send customers to their websites to make purchases. According to the ruling, Apple not only failed to comply with the order but also did so willfully, with the intention of establishing new anticompetitive barriers.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","The US has approved CRISPR pigs for food","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/02/1116059/the-us-approves-crispr-pigs-for-food/","Fri, 02 May 2025 08:00:00 GMT","

Pigs whose DNA makes them resistant to a virus could be the first big consumer product using gene editing.

Most pigs in the US are confined to factory farms where they can be afflicted by a nasty respiratory virus that kills piglets. The illness is called porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, or PRRS.

A few years ago, a British company called Genus set out to design pigs immune to this germ using CRISPR gene editing. Not only did they succeed, but its pigs are now poised to enter the food chain following approval of the animals this week by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

The pigs will join a very short list of gene-modified animals that you can eat. It's a short list because such animals are expensive to create, face regulatory barriers, and don't always pay off. For instance, the US took about 20 years to approve a transgenic salmon with an extra gene that let it grow faster. But by early this year its creator, AquaBounty, had sold off all its fish farms and had only four employees—none of them selling fish.

Regulations have eased since then, especially around gene editing, which tinkers with an animal's own DNA rather than adding to it from another species, as is the case with the salmon and many GMO crops.

The company claiming it can restore lost species also wants to patent them.

What's certain is that the pig project was technically impressive and scientifically clever. Genus edited pig embryos to remove the receptor that the PRRS virus uses to enter cells. No receptor means no infection. 

According to Matt Culbertson, chief operating office of the Pig Improvement Company, a Genus subsidiary, the pigs appear entirely immune to more than 99% of the known versions of the PRRS virus, although there is one rare subtype that may break through the protection.

This project is scientifically similar to the work that led to the infamous CRISPR babies born in China in 2018. In that case a scientist named He Jiankui edited twin girls to be resistant to HIV, also by trying to remove a receptor gene when they were just embryos in a dish.

That experiment on humans was widely decried as misguided. But pigs are a different story. The ethical concerns about experimenting are less serious, and the benefits of changing the genomes can be measured in dollars and cents. It's going to save a lot of money if pigs are immune to the PRRS virus, which spreads quite easily, causing losses of $300 million a year or more in the US alone.

Globally, people get animal protein mostly from chickens, with pigs and cattle in second and third place. A 2023 report estimated that pigs account for 34% of all meat that's eaten. Of the billion pigs in the world, about half are in China; the US comes in a distant second, with 80 million.

Recently, there's been a lot of fairly silly news about genetically modified animals. A company called Colossal Biosciences used gene editing to modify wolves in ways it claimed made them resemble an extinct species, the dire wolf. And then there's the L.A. Project, an effort run by biohackers who say they'll make glow-in-the-dark rabbits and have a stretch goal of creating a horse with a horn—that's right, a unicorn.

Both those projects are more about showmanship than usefulness. But they're demonstrations of the growing power scientists have to modify mammals, thanks principally to new gene-editing tools combined with DNA sequencing that lets them peer into animals' DNA.

A large project is underway to disease-proof pigs using CRISPR to change their DNA. Are people next?

Stopping viruses is a much better use of CRISPR. And research is ongoing to make pigs—as well as other livestock—invulnerable to other infections, including African swine fever and influenza. While PRRS doesn't infect humans, pig and bird flus can. But if herds and flocks could be changed to resist those infections, that could cut the chances of the type of spillover that can occasionally cause dangerous pandemics.  

There's a chance the Genus pigs could turn out to be the most financially valuable genetically modified animal ever created—the first CRISPR hit product to reach the food system. After the approval, the company's stock value jumped up by a couple of hundred million dollars on the London Stock Exchange.

But there is still a way to go before gene-edited bacon appears on shelves in the US. Before it makes its sales pitch to pig farms, Genus says, it needs to also gain approval in Mexico, Canada, Japan and China which are big export markets for American pork.

Culbertson says gene-edited pork could appear in the US market sometime next year. He says the company does not think pork chops or other meat will need to carry any label identifying it as bioengineered. ""We aren't aware of any labelling requirement,"" Culbertson says.

Human “bodyoids” could reduce animal testing, improve drug development, and alleviate organ shortages.

The animals, the first to have been created by Colossal Biosciences, have fluffy coats and curly whiskers.

Colossal Biosciences claims it has revived an extinct species, but scientists outside the company are skeptical.

The U.S. has been carrying out a bombing campaign in Yemen in recent months, as part of an aggressive effort to target militant Houthi rebels who have sworn a vendetta against Israel's actions in Gaza. A new report suggests that, when it comes to dropping bombs, the Pentagon may be taking its cues from a not altogether reliable source: social media.

Drop Site News writes that “serious allegations have emerged that the U.S. military has been relying, in part, on anonymous X accounts who post coordinates that they dubiously claim contain military assets.” The outlet notes that the government has been known to use sophisticated AI programs that algorithmically sift through open-source data to assist with government targeting capabilities. If that were the case, there are plenty of sketchy “open source investigators” online who could be responsible for feeding inaccurate information to those algorithms.

For example, Drop Site notes that an amateur OSINT X account, @VleckieHond, identified a particular location in Yemen as the site of an underground Houthi base in early April. On April 28th, CENTCOM carried out an airstrike at that location that reportedly killed eight civilians. It all raises the question: is the government getting its information on where to drop bombs from random online accounts? I certainly hope the answer is no, but, honestly, in this day and age, nothing seems beyond the pale.

This week, @VleckieHond apologized for having previously suggested that the location was an underground base: “Allright, time for me to go through the mud,” Vleckie posted. “Based on satellite imagery I'd marked this quarry as an underground base, and tweeted is out as such. I'm fairly certain Centcom doesn't take their targeting data from Twitter, but this still is a very severe mistake.” She added: “I should never have posted it.”

The report notes that there's no direct evidence that the government used the open source information to assist in its targeting, but states that @VleckieHond's account has been cited before in defense publications:

To be sure, it may be a mere coincidence that the amateur sleuths identified the location before CENTCOM struck it, but the account used for the Sana'a strike is known to officials in the military, increasing the potential likelihood that it was relied on—at least, in part—for the tragic targeting. @VleckieHond has been publicly cited by reputable military-linked publications, including the influential Combating Terrorism Center at West Point Sentinel, which referred to the “ever-resourceful analyst @Vleckiehond,” in an April 2024 report citing her analysis on U.S. air operations against the Houthis.

Gizmodo reached out to the Defense Department for comment.

Pete Hegseth's Defense Department has been rocked by ongoing turbulence ever since Trump took office. Hegseth, who previously served as a Fox News personality, was humiliated last month after accidentally texting war plans involving the Houthis to the head editor of The Atlantic. Many other related scandals have popped up since then, and one of Trump's national security advisors, Mike Waltz, was booted on Thursday. Earlier this week, the Navy also lost a $60 million jet after it slipped off an aircraft carrier amidst evasive maneuvers in the Red Sea.

Disney goths unite! The world of Twisted Wonderland is finally set to arrive stateside as an anime this October just in time for spooky season in this halfway to Halloween trailer announcement.

The Disney+ series will adapt the Book of Heartslabyul arc fans might be familiar with as it centers Yuuken, the main character of the franchise's previous iterations through the popular Disney game and manga series, who is invited to join Night Raven College by a mysterious masked figure.

The school of Dark Magic has seven houses, one for each of the Disney Villains featured including: Maleficent, Hades, Scar, The Evil Queen, The Queen of Hearts, Jafar and Ursula. We'd like to join the Hades house, please because that's definitely a premise we can get behind. Watch the trailer below which features the game's theme song.

The trailer from Disney+ showcases studios Yumeta Company and Graphinica's anime, showrun by chief director Takahiro Natori (Tokyo Mew Mew New) and directed by Shin Katagai (The Ossan Newbie Adventurer, Became Invincible) as reported by Crunchyroll. The previously announced news also named Yoichi Kato (City Hunters: Shinjuku Private Eyes) as the series writer with animation art by Haruka Nakano and Akane Sato, based on the franchise's original aesthetic and animation by Yana Toboso. It has been greenlit for three seasons on the platform. 

After some quick research into the Cheshire-smiling demon cat named Grim, there's no need to say more: I am so in. I'd seen some pieces of the manga art and game materials before, but now with the official series premiering with such a darkly fun concept surrounding villainous teens and iconic Disney baddies, I'm very excited to see more. The looks are Disney bound gothic goals, and the concept is going to add to more fun for the spooky niche of Disney fans ready to embrace the Dark Academia aesthetic.

Twisted Wonderland drops on Disney+ this October.

They can't steal your password if you don't have one.

Microsoft now uses passkeys by default for all new accounts, helping its users stay secure by ensuring that their passwords can't be stolen by not having one. Microsoft will ask you for an email address when creating an account for the first time. It will then send a verification code to confirm your identity, and once done, it will become your default credential for your new account.

After you've created your Microsoft account and signed in, the company will ask you to add a passkey. Once you have done so, you can use Windows Hello or your device's biometric security features to access your account.

Passkeys have been around for almost a decade, with Windows 10 getting support for passwordless sign-in in July 2015. However, it took some time for the standard to gain traction, with Google, Apple, and Microsoft rolling it out to their respective operating systems in 2022.

Furthermore, personal Microsoft accounts only received this feature in 2024. Still, this is a welcome development, as it will make accessing your Microsoft account easier and more secure. After all, this is one less password you need to remember among the hundreds, if not thousands, of passwords you keep for your numerous accounts.

The company has updated the user experience for its login pages by detecting the best authentication method from the start instead of offering all the possible options.

“For example, if you have a password and “one-time code” set up on your account, we'll prompt you to sign in with your one-time code instead of your password. After you're signed in, you'll be prompted to enroll a passkey. Then the next time you sign in, you'll be prompted to sign in with your passkey,” said Microsoft Identity & Network Access President Joy Chik and Microsoft Security Corporate VP Vasu Jakkal. “This simplified experience gets you signed in faster and, in our experiments, has reduced password use by over 20%. As more people enroll passkeys, the number of password authentications will continue to decline until we can eventually remove password support altogether.”

Passwordless accounts will make it harder for bad actors to illicitly access accounts, as they can no longer steal credentials through phishing, keylogging, SIM swapping, and more. And even if you lose your passkey device, you're still protected, as anyone who wants to access your data must use your biometrics to open it. Someone determined and with unlimited resources might still be able to circumvent passkey protection, but for the average person, this should be more than enough to increase their data security.

Intel explained the rationale behind its High-NA EUV strategy at its Intel Foundry Direct 2025 conference this week. Despite persistent questions around cost-effectiveness, Intel has championed its use of the new High-NA EUV chipmaking tool with its forthcoming 14A process. However, Intel has not yet fully committed to using the new tool in production, but it has an alternative production flow of its 14A node that uses standard Low-NA EUV as a backup plan.

Intel has already received a second high-NA EUV tool, installed in its Oregon fab, and the company says the technology is progressing well. However, due to continuing development, the ~$400 million ASML Twinscan NXE:5000 High-NA EUV machines haven't been used in a production environment yet, so Intel isn't taking any risks.



“[..]The first one is, Intel still has the option to have either a Low-NA or a High-NA solution on our 14A technology, and its design-rule compatible, there will be no impact to the customers, depending on the path that we choose. Second, High-NA EUV is performing to the expectations, and we will introduce it at the right time,"" said Dr. Naga Chandrasekaran, EVP, CTOO & GM of Intel Foundry Technology and Manufacturing.

""We already have data on 18A as well as 14A that shows yield parity between our Low-NA-based solution and a High-NA-based solution. So, we are continuing to make progress on the technology front and ensuring that we have the right options available for us to make sure the solution we deliver to our customers has the lowest risk and the best reward in terms of the decisions we make,” Naga explained.

Intel will only use High-NA EUV on a small number of layers of the 14A node (the exact number isn't known), while other machines of varying resolutions will be used for the other layers. That means the decision between the two machines will only impact a select portion of the manufacturing process, but Intel says using triple-patterning with a Low-NA EUV (more below) machine instead of High-NA produces the same results.

Because both techniques are design-rule compatible, Intel's customers won't have to change their designs regardless of the company's decision on the final manufacturing flow, either with or without High-NA EUV, which helps defray concerns that customers might have with Intel embracing an as-yet unproven production technology.

Additionally, Intel's claim that both production flows offer the same yields signals that there won't be severe time-to-market repercussions if High-NA EUV development hits a snag, or if Intel chooses not to deploy it due to economics. Employing multipatterning often reduces yields, but Intel's claim of yield parity speaks to the advances of modern multipatterning, particularly in the field of overlay technology.

Most of the public-facing conversations about High-NA EUV have centered around cost, there's plenty of industry speculation that High-NA isn't as cost-effective as multi-patterning with Low-NA EUV, but there are still numerous technological hurdles to bringing the machines into production. Most of the challenges center around the universe of complementary technologies required to make High-NA viable, like resists, photomasks, and computational lithography, among others, which have to be optimized for the new machines. However, Intel adopted ASML's machine first to get a leg up on the competition, and it has already produced 30,000 wafers using High-NA lithography during the development phase. As a representative explained later in the event, Intel still sees significant cost savings due to eliminating around 40 process steps.



“Finally, I want to talk about High-NA EUV. Why do we do this? It's very simple; It's lower cost. In the middle picture, you see a pattern that has been generated by a single pass High-NA EUV and a pitch that is comparable to the pitch that we need for 14A. The right-hand side shows a very similar pattern generated with a traditional approach, where we use three EUV exposures [triple patterning], and overall about 40 process steps to generate this pattern.""

""So, overall, we see much shorter, simpler flow, and this is the type of application where we use High-NA in 14A, which reduces the cost compared to the multi-pass 0.33 NA EUV [Low-NA]. Additionally, this provides the option to de-populate the metal layers and get additional performance enhancement.”

Intel didn't specify whether or not its comparisons are based on a full-reticle-sized print. High-NA can only print half of a reticle at a time, requiring two prints to create one reticle-sized processor and relying upon stitching to bring the two prints together into a single cohesive unit. In contrast, die that are equal to or smaller than a half-reticle size will only require one print with High-NA EUV. In contrast, Low-NA EUV machines can process a full reticle-sized die in a single print.

Intel has plenty of scar tissue from its 10nm node failures that ultimately ended in the company losing its chipmaking lead over TSMC, and it chalks the 10nm issues up to making too many big bets on new manufacturing techniques and technologies at once.

The decision to develop an alternative Low-NA production flow is designed to prevent repeating those past mistakes, and Intel has also de-risked other types of advances by developing alternative solutions in the past.

For instance, the company developed its new backside power delivery system with the 18A node, an industry first, while simultaneously developing gate-all-around (GAA) transistors, a first for Intel. To ensure a backup plan, the company employed a more robust de-risking strategy with its 18A process that included developing an internal-only trial process node without backside power. However, development went well with both GAA and backside power delivery, so Intel pushed forward with the full version of the 18A node.

Intel rival TSMC has confirmed it will not use High-NA with its competing A14 node, and it hasn't indicated when it will employ the new High-NA EUV tool in volume production. Intel had originally planned to use High-NA with its 18A process, which arrives before the 14A node. Intel later changed those plans, saying that the process node's unexpectedly fast development meant the machines wouldn't be ready in time.

Nvidia has yet to officially reveal Blackwell-based graphics boards for professional visualization (ProViz) applications, but such cards are already undergoing testing in the wild by interested parties in Geekbench. An OpenCL benchmark result of Nvidia's upcoming RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell Workstation Edition graphics card has emerged, confirming rumored specifications of the GPU and memory while raising questions about performance.

Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell Workstation Edition add-in-board is based on the GB202 graphics processing unit (GPU) with 24,064 CUDA cores (188 streaming multiprocessors, 128 CUDA cores) allegedly operating at up to 2,617 MHz and carries 96 GB of memory with ECC, according to the Geekbench listing. By contrast, Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5090 — the best graphics card for gaming money can buy these days — features the GB202 GPU with 21,760 CUDA cores operating at up to 2,410 MHz and carries 32 GB of GDDR7 memory.

At first glance, the new RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell Workstation Edition graphics board should easily beat its gaming counterpart, but this is not the case as the unit scores 368,219 points in GB6 6.4.0 OpenCL benchmark, whereas the GeForce RTX 5090 can score around 376,858 in the same benchmark. A 2.3% performance difference is hardly a big deal, but given significant hardware differences between the boards, it is natural to expect the new ProViz card to beat the gaming board.

However, there are a couple of caveats. First up, we are dealing with a pre-release product with pre-release drivers, so the performance of the RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell Workstation Edition can improve when it is launched with final drivers. Secondly, the TGP of the RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell WE can be capped, and therefore its compute performance is lower than that of the GeForce RTX 5090, which can go all the way to 575W. Thirdly, the current driver limits memory visible to OpenCL applications to 24 GB (well, 23.8 GB, according to the detailed GB6 results) even though the unit carries 96 GB onboard. This proves that the driver is not final.

Also, it should be noted that based on a previous report, this the RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell is not Nvidia's flagship ProViz offering, as the range-topping model is expected to be called the RTX Pro 6000 X Blackwell.

""There is no question that Huawei is one of the most formidable technology companies in the world""

China is not significantly behind the U.S. when developing AI hardware and software, said Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, at the Hill and Valley Forum. While Chinese companies have made remarkable progress with AI services and software, Huang's comments mainly refer to Chinese AI hardware. Coincidentally, Huawei has started to ship its latest AI system, which is largely deemed competitive with Nvidia's GB200 NVL72, reports Financial Times. However, there is a catch.

""China is not behind anybody, China is right behind us, we are very, very close,"" said Huang at the sidelines of the Hill and Valley Forum, where business leaders and lawmakers met to discuss technology and national security, according to Bloomberg Podcasts.

Regarding hardware, China has numerous companies developing AI chips that are more or less competitive against Nvidia's AI hardware. Huawei is ahead of everyone else as its AI strategy spans from its Ascend 900-series AI accelerators to servers to rack-scale solutions for cloud data centers. Recently, the company announced CloudMatrix 384, which packs 384 dual-chiplet HiSilicon Ascend 910C interconnected using a fully optical mesh network. So far, Huawei has sold over 10 CloudMatrix 384 systems to Chinese customers, which signals that some would like to try domestic alternatives to restricted Nvidia hardware.

""There is no question that Huawei is one of the most formidable technology companies in the world, and they are incredible in computing, they are incredible in networking technology, and in software capabilities, all of the essential capabilities to advance AI. And they have they've made enormous progress in the last several years,"" said Huang.

This Huawei CloudMatrix 384 system spans 16 racks: 12 compute racks each housing 32 Ascend 910C accelerators, plus four dedicated racks managing optical connectivity via 6,912 optical transceivers at 800G LPO speeds. CloudMatrix 384 achieves roughly 300 PFLOPs dense BF16 compute, nearly double Nvidia's GB200 NVL72, with 2.1 times higher memory bandwidth and over 3.6 times greater HBM capacity using HBM2E. CM384's optical interconnects provide substantial bandwidth advantages, including 2.1 times better scale-up and 5.3 times better scale-out capabilities. However, it falls short of Nvidia's GB200 NVL72 efficiency, consuming 2.3 times more power per FLOP, 1.8 times more per TB/s memory bandwidth, and 1.1 times more per TB of HBM memory.

Shipping 10 CM384 systems is hardly a big deal per se, especially considering that Chinese technology firms like Alibaba, ByteDance, and Tencent reportedly invested $16 billion in Nvidia's H20 HGX GPUs in the first quarter, anticipating U.S. export restrictions called the AI Diffusion Rule set to begin in mid-May.

Nonetheless, 10 systems may be the start. Huawei reportedly has about a million HiSilicon Ascend 910C, enough for 2,600 CloudMatrix 384 systems. Then again, 2,600 CM384 clusters can deliver about 780 ExaFLOPS of dense BF16 compute. One needs around 4,300 of Nvidia's GB200 NVL72 machines (or around 312,000 B200 AI GPUs) to get similar performance. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo estimated that shipments of GB200 NVL72 racks alone in 2025 could reach roughly 25,000 – 35,000 racks, but in addition, the company will also ship GB300 NVL72 racks as well as B100, B200, and B300 AI GPUs.

This means that Nvidia alone will supply orders of magnitude more AI compute performance than Huawei this year. However, Huawei has technologies that may rival those of the American company.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:medscape.com","Gastric Cancer Prevention: Focus on High-Risk Groups","https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/gastric-cancer-prevention-new-aga-update-reflects-latest-2025a1000aqq","Fri, 02 May 2025 11:54:22 GMT","



 

 May 02, 2025  

Clinicians can help reduce gastric cancer incidence and mortality in high-risk groups through endoscopic screening and surveillance of precancerous conditions, such as gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM), according to a new clinical practice update from the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA).

The AGA update supports additional gastric guidance published so far in 2025, including a clinical guideline on the diagnosis and management of gastric premalignant conditions (GPMC) from the American College of Gastroenterologists (ACG) and upper GI endoscopy quality indicators from ACG and the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE).

“The synergy of these three publications coming out at the same time helps us to finally establish surveillance of high-risk gastric conditions in practice, as we do in the colon and esophagus,” said Doug Morgan, MD, professor of medicine in gastroenterology and hepatology and director of Global Health programs in gastroenterology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Alabama.

Morgan, who wasn't involved with the AGA update, served as lead author for the ACG guideline and co-author of the ACG-ASGE quality indicators. He also co-authored the 2024 ACG clinical guideline on treating Heliobacter pylori infection, which has implications for gastric cancer.

“The AGA and ACG updates provide detail, while the QI document is an enforcer with medical, legal, and reimbursement implications,” he said. “We have an alignment of the stars with this overdue move toward concrete surveillance for high-risk lesions in the stomach.”

The clinical practice update was published in the February 2025 issue of Gastroenterology.

Gastric cancer remains a leading cause of preventable cancer and mortality in certain US populations, the authors wrote. The top ways to reduce mortality include primary prevention, particularly by eradicating H pylori, and secondary prevention through screening and surveillance.

High-risk groups in the United States should be considered for gastric cancer screening, including first-generation immigrants from high-incidence regions and potentially other non-White racial and ethnic groups, those with a family history of gastric cancer in a first-degree relative, and those with certain hereditary GI polyposis or hereditary cancer syndromes.

Endoscopy remains the best test for screening or surveillance of high-risk groups, the authors wrote, since it allows for direct visualization to endoscopically stage the mucosa, identify any concerning areas of neoplasia, and enable biopsies. Both endoscopic and histologic staging are key for risk stratification and surveillance decisions.

In particular, clinicians should use a high-definition white light endoscopy system with image enhancement, gastric mucosal cleansing, and insufflation to see the mucosa. As part of this, clinicians should allow for adequate visual inspection time, photodocumentation, and systematic biopsy protocol for mucosal staging, where appropriate.

As part of this, clinicians should consider H pylori eradication as an essential adjunct to endoscopic screening, the authors wrote. Opportunistic screening for H pylori should be considered in high-risk groups, and familial-based testing should be considered among adult household members of patients who test positive for H pylori.

In patients with suspected gastric atrophy — with or without GIM — gastric biopsies should be obtained with a systematic approach, the authors wrote. Clinicians should take a minimum of five biopsies, sampling from the antrum/incisura and corpus.

Endoscopists should work with their pathologists on consistent documentation of histologic risk-stratification parameters when atrophic gastritis is diagnosed, the authors wrote. To inform clinical decision-making, this should include documentation of the presence or absence of H pylori infection, severity of atrophy or metaplasia, and histologic subtyping of GIM.

Although GIM and dysplasia are endoscopically detectable, these findings often go undiagnosed when endoscopists aren't familiar with the characteristic visual features, the authors wrote. More training is needed, especially in the US, and although artificial intelligence tools appear promising for detecting early gastric neoplasia, data remain too preliminary to recommend routine use, the authors added.

Since indefinite and low-grade dysplasia can be difficult to identify by endoscopy and accurately diagnosis on histopathology, all dysplasia should be confirmed by an experienced gastrointestinal pathologist, the authors wrote. Clinicians should refer patients with visible or nonvisible dysplasia to an endoscopist or center with expertise in gastric neoplasia.

If an index screening endoscopy doesn't identify atrophy, GIM, or neoplasia, ongoing screening should be based on a patient's risk factors and preferences. If the patient has a family history or multiple risk factors, ongoing screening should be considered. However, the optimal screening intervals in these scenarios aren't well-defined.

Patients with confirmed gastric atrophy should undergo risk stratification, the authors wrote. Those with severe atrophic gastritis or multifocal/incomplete GIM would likely benefit from endoscopic surveillance, particularly if they have other risk factors such as family history. Surveillance should be considered every 3 years, though shorter intervals may be advisable for those with multiple risk factors such as severe GIM.

Patients with high-grade dysplasia or early gastric cancer should undergo endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), with the goal of en bloc, R0 resection to enable accurate pathologic staging and the intent to cure. Eradicating active H pylori infection is essential — but shouldn't delay endoscopic intervention, the authors wrote.

In addition, patients with a history of successfully resected gastric dysplasia or cancer should undergo endoscopic surveillance. Although post-ESD surveillance intervals have been suggested in other recent AGA clinical practice updates, additional data are needed, particularly for US recommendations, the authors wrote.

Although type 1 gastric carcinoids in patients with atrophic gastritis are typically indolent, especially if less than 1 cm, endoscopists may consider resecting them and should resect lesions between 1and 2 cm. Patients with lesions over 2 cm should undergo cross-sectional imaging and be referred for surgical resection, given the risk for metastasis.

The guideline authors suggested thinking about screening and surveillance on a patient-level basis. For instance, only those who are fit for endoscopic or potentially surgical treatment should be screened for gastric cancer and continued surveillance of GPMC, they wrote. If a person is no longer fit for endoscopic or surgical treatment, whether due to life expectancy or other comorbidities, then screening should be stopped.

In addition, to achieve health equity, clinicians should take a personalized approach to assess a patient's risk for gastric cancer and determine whether to pursue screening and surveillance, the authors wrote. Modifiable risk factors — such as tobacco use, high-salt and processed food diets, and lack of health care — should also be addressed, since most of these risk factors disproportionately affect high-risk patients and represent healthcare disparities, they added.

“This update provides clinicians with a framework for understanding the natural history and epidemiology of gastric polyps, as well as guidance on best practices for the endoscopic detection and classification of gastric polyps, best practices for the endoscopic resection of gastric polyps, and best practices for endoscopic surveillance following resection,” said Hashem El-Serag, MD, professor and chair of medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine and director of the Texas Medical Center Digestive Diseases Center in Houston.

El-Serag, who wasn't involved with the clinical practice update, has researched and published on consensus around the diagnosis and management of GIM.

“Stomach polyps are commonly found during routine endoscopic procedures. They are mostly asymptomatic and incidental, and therefore, clinicians may not be prepared ahead of time on how to deal with them,” he said. “The appropriate management requires proper identification and sampling of the polyp features and the uninvolved gastric mucosa, as well as a clear understanding of the risk factors and prognosis. Recent changes in the epidemiology and endoscopic management of gastric polyps makes this update timely and important.”

The update received no particular funding. The authors disclosed receiving grant support, having consultant relationships with, and serving in advisory roles for numerous pharmaceutical, biomedical, and biotechnology firms. Morgan and El-Serag reported having no relevant disclosures.

Audiometry-measured hearing loss in older adults accounted for up to 32% of incident dementia cases over 8 years in new research, significantly larger than previously reported estimates. Investigators found larger dementia prevalence estimates in people aged 75 years or older, women, and White individuals, whereas self-reported hearing loss was not associated with dementia risk.

“This cohort study suggests that treating hearing loss might delay dementia for a large number of older adults. Public health interventions targeting clinically significant audiometric hearing loss might have broad benefits for dementia prevention,” the investigators wrote.

They added that future studies should consider that “self-reporting may underestimate hearing-associated dementia risk.” 

This study was led by Emily Ishak, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York City. It was published online on April 17 in JAMA Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery.

This study's generalizability was limited owing to the inclusion of only self-identified Black and White adults. Classifying dementia using hospital and death records may have led to reduced sensitivity toward including milder cases, and a potential survivor bias may have influenced the findings. Additionally, information about appropriate hearing aid use, fit, and compliance was unavailable; and the cumulative effects of hearing loss on the risk for dementia were not assessed.

The ARIC Neurocognitive Study was funded by the National Institutes of Health. Several investigators reported receiving grants from and having ties with various sources. Full details are provided in the original article.

Growing up, “food poisoning,” to me, meant throwing up repeatedly after eating the mayo-based potato salad several hours after it was put on the picnic table on July 4. But that version (probably Staphylococcus aureus–toxin mediated) is not the most common form. US data from 2024 showed 1392 bacterial caused foodborne illnesses from contaminated food, a nearly 25% increase from 2023.

But wait — there's more! Reported bacterial/protozoan foodborne hospital admissions and deaths increased more than 100% from 2023 to 2024. The 2024 increases were mostly concentrated in 13 outbreaks, 12 due to Listeria spp, Salmonella spp, or Escherichia coli. It is important to realize that reported numbers are probably huge underestimates of the actual foodborne illness burden (an estimated 48 million illnesses; 1 out of 6 Americans each year) because most people with foodborne illnesses do not seek medical care and, thus, the illness is not reported. One estimate is that only 1 in 30 actual cases is reported. Among the 10 million foodborne illnesses or so that are reported annually, 128,000 require hospitalization and 3000 are fatal. 

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)/US Department of Agriculture (USDA) sent notices for 296 food recalls in 2024. One that made news involved E coli O157:H7 in quarter pounders in more than a dozen states. Another 2024 food recall was related to Salmonella-contaminated cucumbers in nearly three dozen states. Several recent Listeria monocytogenes notices included one in 2024 related to Boar's Head deli meat in 19 states and another in 2025 due to supplement shakes in 21 states.

And these are just the bacterial/protozoan-driven cases. Food is also a common vehicle for Norovirus transmission particularly if a Norovirus-infected person handles food. Among foodborne pathogens, Norovirus, along with Shigella spp, is one of the lowest inoculum infectors (as little as 10-100 virions), so both can spread like wildfire from the index case. Uncommonly, Rotavirus spp, astroviruses, adenoviruses, and Sapovirus spp are associated with foodborne illness.

Over 30 pathogens cause foodborne; the box shows the top offenders and their outcomes. However, in most years, “the big 6” comprise most US cases: Norovirus (5 million per year), Campylobacter spp (~2 million per year), nontyphoidal Salmonella spp (~1.5 million per year), Clostridium perfringens toxin (900,000 per year), E coli (360,000 per year), and Listeria spp (125,000 per year).

That said, hepatitis A, Shigella spp, S aureus toxin, Cryptosporidium, and Cyclospora are major players in some years and in some regions.

Cryptosporidium (in contaminated irrigation water) and Cyclospora (in imported produce) are the most common parasites. Toxoplasma gondii is also an unusual but medically important cause of food poisoning (undercooked meat). Overall, foodborne illnesses peak in summer, mostly due to bacteria/protozoa, but show secondary winter peaks due to Norovirus (~25% of all Norovirus infections are foodborne). 

Symptom onset varies widely, from less than 12 hours (S aureus toxin) to more than a month (hepatitis A) (Figure). Presentations may or may not involve acute systemic signs or symptoms (fever, myalgia, headache, fatigue) but most include vomiting/diarrhea. Frankly bloody stools are characteristic of nontyphoidal Salmonella spp, Shigella spp, and Campylobacter spp. Certain pathogens produce downstream or nongastrointestinal signs or symptoms (eg, jaundice for hepatitis A, joint symptoms after infection with Campylobacter spp, hemolytic uremic syndrome after infection with E coli O157:H7). 

The many clinical variations for the more than 30 pathogens are beyond the scope of this discussion, but information on each is found on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website. 

The foods most often associated with foodborne illnesses are leafy produce and unpasteurized dairy products, followed by poultry (particularly ready-to-eat products), beef, pork, and eggs. Scenarios commonly associated with foodborne illnesses include prepared foods left at unsafe temperatures (picnics, buffets, restaurants); incompletely washed (particularly imported) produce; incompletely sanitized counters, sinks, cutting boards, and prep areas; and contaminated meat grinders, slicers, and packaging machinery. 

Although foodborne illnesses occur at all ages, pediatric providers know that children younger than 5 years are more susceptible (as are older adults and immunocompromised hosts) and more affected than older children or adults. Among children younger than 5, Norovirus, nontyphoidal Salmonella (40% of pediatric foodborne bacterial illnesses) and Campylobacter are generally the most frequent pathogens. 

Although less common than Salmonella and Campylobacter, Shiga toxin–producing E coli (in undercooked meat) leads to hemolytic uremic syndrome in 1 in 7 children under the age of 5. 

Listeria (usually from processed meats, raw milk, and raw or soft cheeses) is an important although uncommon foodborne illness that is dangerous for pregnant mothers and infants (and immune-compromised hosts). Cronobacter sakazakii is also uncommon but important with a high mortality rate in infants and has been associated with powdered infant formula, where it sometimes survives in a dry state for over 2 years.

A helpful site for families concerned about foodborne illness in their children is https://www.foodsafety.gov/people-at-risk/children-under-five. Also, the Consumer Reports May-June 2025 edition has a nice section on foodborne illnesses that may help your patients' families. Note that other top offenders include raw shellfish, sprouts, ground meats, unpasteurized juices or cider, and raw flour (eg, in cookie dough).

The US food supply has been among the safest in the world, but that seems to be changing. Expect more frequent issues since many FDA/USDA safety systems are being reduced or eliminated. Some systems remain intact as of April 20, 2025, such as the CDC's FoodNet surveillance system. That said, examples of dismantled systems include the March 2025 elimination of the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods and the National Advisory Committee on Meat and Poultry Inspection. So, expect more foodborne outbreaks. 

Finally, so much of foodborne illnesses would be eliminated if we could begin irradiating food. Given popular resistance to things being irradiated and the healthcare retrenchment underway, this is not likely.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

Among patients with non–trauma-related pain, adding music therapy to standard analgesia in the emergency department (ED) reduced pain and anxiety compared with standard care alone.

""In this study, we found that music therapy, when combined with standard analgesia, effectively reduced pain and anxiety in patients presenting to the ED, particularly those with non–trauma-related pain,"" the authors wrote. ""Our study highlights the potential benefits of music therapy in ED, though its application should be tailored to specific clinical settings and available resources,"" they added.

The study was led by Chuenruthai Angkoontassaneeyarat, Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. It was published online on April 11, 2025, in the International Journal of Emergency Medicine.

The study was limited by its single-center design, small sample size, lack of blinding, and the limited reproducibility and cultural specificity of the music therapy provided. Additionally, environmental factors such as the atmosphere in the ED, overcrowding, and noise levels may have influenced the results, and pre-ED analgesic use could have affected pain and anxiety outcomes.

A survey of adults with severe mental illness reported obesity in 42% of participants, along with poor diet quality and ineffective weight management despite efforts, highlighting gaps in current weight management approaches.

""The high levels of overweight and obesity in this sample along with the high proportion who report actively managing their weight, suggests that current weight management options are inadequate in addressing the specific needs of people with SMI [severe mental illness], namely medication management,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Gemma D. Traviss-Turner, Leeds Institute of Health Sciences, University of Leeds, Leeds, England. It was published online on April 23 in Nutrients.

Due to the cross-sectional nature of the study, researchers could not establish causality or temporal relationships between food consumption, medication use, weight management, and weight change. The assessment of diet quality was not comprehensive. Additionally, the reliance on self-reported data may have affected the accuracy of medication use and food consumption reporting. Data on height and weight were missing for some participants. Furthermore, the sample excluded inpatients, potentially missing more severe cases and those on higher doses of antipsychotic medications.

An international expert panel has recently released a comprehensive set of recommendations for optimal insulin injection techniques and equipment.

The group, called the Forum for Injection Technique and Therapy Expert Recommendations (FITTER), last issued recommendations for insulin injection practices in 2016. The new document, part of the group's “FITTER Forward” initiative, “provides an updated rationale for the importance of proper injection technique training and its impact on diabetes management,” they wrote.

The writing panel, composed of 16 diabetes specialist physicians and allied health professionals from 13 countries, was led by David C. Klonoff, MD, medical director of the Dorothy L. and James E. Frank Diabetes Research Institute of Mills-Peninsula Medical Center, San Mateo, California, and clinical professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.

“Overall, FITTER Forward aims to better equip healthcare professionals (HCPs) to advance diabetes care by empowering people with diabetes and their caregivers to correctly and safely deliver insulin,” Klonoff and colleagues said in the document, Advance Insulin Injection Technique and Education With FITTER Forward Expert Recommendations, published in the April 2025 issue of the Mayo Clinic Proceedings.

The recommendations are organized into four sections:

“Insulin therapy will have limited/unpredictable effects if not delivered properly. Therefore, time spent by HCPs and [people with diabetes]/caregivers on injection technique education is essential for improving clinical outcomes and reducing healthcare costs,” authors of the study wrote.

Section 1 advises that insulin should be injected subcutaneously rather than intramuscularly to avoid hypoglycemia. “Healthcare professionals should understand how the design of insulin delivery devices (especially needles) interplays with technique and physiology to affect injection force/pain/outcomes,” Klonoff and colleagues wrote.

All needles used for insulin delivery must be long enough to reliably administer insulin to the subcutaneous adipose tissue but short enough to avoid accidental intramuscular injection. HCPs are advised to discuss the pros and cons of various needle lengths with patients or their caregivers to determine individual needs.

Section 2 covers insulin storage and handling as well as injection technique procedures. Skin sites used for injection must have sufficient subcutaneous fat, and these areas should be rotated to avoid lipodystrophy. Separate detailed instructions are given for proper injection techniques with pens and with syringes. These have not changed since the previous FITTER recommendations, the authors noted.

Postinjection best practices include removing the pen needle from the pen after each use and not reusing pen needles or syringes. However, the guidance acknowledges that needle reuse is a common practice worldwide and may be necessary in some circumstances. HCPs are advised to educate patients about the consequences of reusing needles and to recommend that they carry sufficient backup supplies.

The document also addresses non-insulin injectables including glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists and glucagon. Some patients will have initially learned injection techniques with these agents prior to starting insulin and may be using both simultaneously. Recommendations for needle length, site selection, and rotation are the same for these as for insulin, the authors said.

Section 3 focuses in detail on lipodystrophy, a fat tissue disorder that can arise from repeated injections into the same skin site. This in turn can lead to erratic insulin absorption with increased risks for both hyper- and hypoglycemia. The most common type of lipodystrophy is lipohypertrophy, involving enlargement of adipocytes, presenting as swelling/nodules.

A meta-analysis of 37 studies demonstrated that lipohypertrophy was associated with significantly worse A1c, greater glycemic variability, and higher total daily insulin doses. “Therefore, it is critical that HCPs explain the importance of lipohypertrophy risk reduction and encourage [people with diabetes] to take an active role in self-detection. Lipohypertrophy detection should be a routine part of diabetes-related complication assessment,” Klonoff and colleagues recommended.

Section 4 covers “pharmacoadherence.” Providers should ensure that the patient receives adequate education and support when starting insulin therapy, including addressing anxiety. The section provides educational strategies and warning signs that a review of injection technique might be warranted. Providers are advised to review reports from continuous glucose monitoring to make sure the patient's glucose levels are consistent with their prescribed regimen.

The statement ends with a note that the guidance is meant to be used globally, regardless of socioeconomic status or geographic region. “We encourage HCPs, healthcare authorities, payers, and manufacturers to take action to support equitable resource allocation and access to evidence-based injection education,” Klonoff and colleagues wrote.

They concluded, “There is great opportunity to improve diabetes management through responsive collaboration and optimizing the basics of injection technique using the FITTER Forward recommendations. Equipped with these updated insulin injection technique recommendations and strategies for education, HCPs can improve the likelihood that their patients optimally use insulin with minimal complications.”

The FITTER Forward advisory board was funded by embecta, a manufacturer of injecting devices. FITTER Forward members received an honorarium from embecta for their participation in the advisory board but not for manuscript development. Klonoff has served as a consultant for Afon Technology, Atropos Health, embecta, Glucotrack, Lifecare, Novo Nordisk A/S, Samsung, SynchNeuro, and Thirdwayv and has participated on the data monitoring board for Fractyl Health.

Almost 1 in 4 adults in England have found inaccuracies or missing information in their medical records, new research has shown. 

The findings come from a nationally representative poll carried out by BMG Research on behalf of Healthwatch England in March this year.

Researchers surveyed 1800 adults in England online. Of those, 23% reported errors in their records.

Around 12% of respondents said they had been refused treatment because of missing or inaccurate information. 

Another 10% reported being prescribed incorrect or inappropriate medication. 

Just under 10% said they had received potentially unsafe treatment as a result of errors. 

Among those who spotted problems:

Healthwatch noted that such inaccuracies are often caused by human error, especially when NHS staff are “stretched” and “under significant pressure.”

It is unclear how many of the patients were able to correct their records. Healthwatch called for improvements in record keeping and clearer guidance on patients' rights to amend their records.

“Sadly, even when patients spot gaps or errors in their records, it can be a nightmare to get it fixed,” commented Jacob Lant, chief executive of National Voices, a coalition of health and social care charities in England. 

He urged the government to make it easier for patients to update their records, including those unable to use the NHS App. 

The survey findings come after a government announcement last October to introduce a single patient record across the NHS. 

The new system is expected to summarise patient health information, test results, and clinical letters in the NHS App. It aims to give patients more control over their health data and improve information sharing among NHS staff. 

New legislation is also planned to enable record sharing across NHS trusts, GP surgeries, and ambulance services. This is intended to speed up care, reduce duplicate testing, and minimise medication errors.

The Department of Health and Social Care has estimated that better data access could save NHS staff about 140,000 hours per year, increasing face-to-face time with patients and improving outcomes.

Further details are expected in the forthcoming NHS 10-Year Health Plan.

 DISCLOSURES Authors and DisclosuresAuthor

The understanding of fat has evolved in recent decades. Once regarded as nothing more than passive storage reservoirs for fat, adipocytes are now recognized as critical players in metabolic and endocrine processes. Fat may even be regarded as an endocrine organ, with the metabolic contribution of adipocytes changing as they enlarge in tandem with increasing obesity. Expanding adipose tissue undergoes alterations that not only promote insulin resistance but also produce pro-inflammatory factors.

“It's become clear from the literature that people with obesity often have a pro-inflammatory state, based on various biomarkers measured in the blood,” Karen Corbin, PhD, RD, associate investigator of Translational Research Institute, AdventHealth, Orlando, Florida, told Medscape Medical News.

Mechanisms linking obesity and inflammation are intricate and far-reaching, according to Alan Saltiel, PhD, professor of medicine and director of the Diabetes Research Center, University of California San Diego. “In recent decades, the quest to find a mechanism connecting the pathogenesis of obesity to insulin resistance and diabetes has shed light on a close relationship between caloric excess and activation of the innate immune system in most organs that play a role in energy homeostasis,” he told Medscape Medical News.

Inflammation may represent a “bridge” linking obesity to its comorbid conditions, such as type 2 diabetes. Understanding inflammation may also illuminate what drives obesity, beyond excess caloric intake.

The relationship between obesity and inflammation might be seen as a “tough chicken-and-egg question,” said Saltiel. “Obesity definitely causes inflammation; and inflammation, in turn, makes people more susceptible to weight gain through reducing energy expenditure and possibly through mechanisms in the brain that we don't fully understand, which reduce the brain's sensitivity to satiety hormones.” 

Research supports the role of both the “chicken” and the “egg.” For example, a population-based study found that an array of baseline inflammatory markers (eg, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP], interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, IL-1Ra, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor–a, and high-molecular-weight adiponectin) were strongly associated with indicators of obesity (elevated weight, body mass index [BMI], waist circumference, and body fat percentage). After adjustment for obesity predictors, hs-CRP and IL-1Ra were inversely associated with changes in obesity indicators during 7-year follow-up. Almost all associations were attenuated after further adjustment for baseline BMI. “These findings suggest that the inflammatory markers, although highly associated with obesity, do not predict weight gain,” the authors concluded. “This could translate into inflammation being a result of obesity, rather than a contributing factor to it.”

On the other hand, inflammation may contribute to fat storage, according to a paper by Jianping Ye and Jeffrey N. Keller. The inflammatory response may induce energy expenditure “in a feedback manner to fight against energy surplus in obesity.” A deficient feedback system (sometimes called inflammation resistance) reduces energy expenditure, leading to energy accumulation, and in turn, contributing to obesity. Caloric restriction may inadvertently contribute to energy saving, which may be one reason it's so difficult for people with obesity to lose weight and sustain their weight loss.

Saltiel's research focuses on “trying to understand the signaling pathways in cells.” He described fat cells as playing an important part in controlling metabolism, “If you look at pictures of fat cells, at first glance, they look like marshmallows. But they're much more than simply ‘blobs.' They're actually on the cutting edge of sensing the energy in our bodies.” These cells go through a “decision-making process of whether it's a good time to store or to burn energy.” The cells must be able to sense “how much energy they have on board and send a signal to the other cells in the brain, liver, and tissues, instructing them what to do.”

Fat cells have hormonal receptors that are sensitive to adrenaline, insulin, and other hormones, Saltiel explained. “They're very plastic, so they enlarge when we feed them and shrink when we fast.” He noted that pictures of fat cells in mice deprived of food for 24 hours, showed cells that are half the size of fat cells in recently fed mice. 

However, he continued, there are types of fat cells, some more adaptable than others. “In a normal setting, fat cells shrink when we fast and expand when we feed. When they expand and shrink, they sense that they have more or less energy and release hormones accordingly. Pathways in fat cells sense the breakdown or storage of energy, and then change the expression of genes that encode for these hormones.” 

Leptin, discovered in the 1990s, is the most well-known hormone released in response to feeding, he said. “After we eat and the fat cell is full, it releases leptin, which travels to the brain, tells the brain we're satiated and we should stop eating, and tells the brain to release hormones that increase the breakdown of fat and increase energy expenditure.” Saltiel described this as a “rheostat” or “feedback loop.” 

“When we fast, we release fatty acids from fat cells,” Saltiel stated. “They travel to the liver, muscle, brain, and pancreas to instruct those cells to perform a variety of functions, including the release of other hormones.”

In the setting of inflammation, this process can be disrupted. Inflammation dampens the responsiveness of the fat cell to these signals, so they become less plastic and less adaptable. “Adipose tissue responds to overnutrition by mounting an immune response.” The resulting inflammation induces insulin resistance. Additionally, the adipose cells “become more efficient at storing rather than releasing energy, and inflammation may be implicated in suppressing the release of energy and promoting its storage.”

Several questions about this process are subjects of current investigation, Saltiel said. “The first is what triggers the inflammatory response in adipose tissue that occurs in the setting of positive energy balance and drives storage rather than release.” Trying to understand this entails looking at immune cells residing in adipose tissue; what leads to changes in those cells and how those changes take place.

“One hypothesis, which I think is an oversimplification, is that it's mechanical stress on the fat cell that triggers inflammation,” Saltiel commented. “It's been suggested that the fat cell expands to accommodate the fat, but it ‘hits a wall' because there isn't enough room to expand. That process could trigger inflammation.”

Another hypothesis he cited is that “bacterial products are released into circulation because of the ‘leaky gut' that occurs during obesity, resulting in inflammation.” Other mechanisms include adipocyte death and hypoxia, which develops due to the expansion of adipose tissue and reduction in oxygen tension. “However,” Saltiel noted, “it's unclear whether this hypoxia is a consequence of adipose tissue expansion or whether it directly causes obesity-associated metabolic disease.”

Saltiel thinks the answer probably incorporates several hypotheses, together with “other changes in circulating nutrients that make inflammation more likely to happen and prime the fat cell to mount an inflammatory response.”

He noted that inflammation in obesity is “ low-grade and chronic, rather than acute. The long-term effects of inflammation have downstream impact, which is the second major question we're trying to understand.”

The third question is which particular pathways, triggered by inflammation, change energy balance, promote energy storage, and repress energy use. “A lot of us are working on that question, and there's controversy surrounding the mechanisms.” Some studies have utilized an anti-inflammatory antibody or small molecule, with “results that are mixed or modest, or show no effect at all.” The problem, Saltiel explained, is that “there's probably a redundancy of pathways, so we don't know which specific pathway to target or whether to target a combination of pathways.” 

But if the main action of inflammation in obesity is to reduce energy expenditure, then blocking that process by increasing energy expenditure alone is “likely to have a modest effect, at best. This may be why it doesn't always help to tell people to ‘simply exercise more.' People get hungrier and compensate by eating more to balance out the energy expenditure.”

Anti-inflammatory therapy could potentially work if combined with therapy that blocks energy intake, such as a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), Saltiel speculated. “But no one has conducted that study yet; and commonly used anti-inflammatory agents like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, for example, won't target inflammation in adipose tissue. It would be interesting to see if other anti-inflammatory drugs coupled with GLP-1 drugs could work together to improve weight loss and metabolic effects.”

The gut microbiome is garnering increasing attention as a potential connector between inflammation and adipose tissue function. A growing body of research demonstrates that disruption of gut microbiota activates the adaptive and innate immunity in the intestine and raises the inflammatory level.

Corbin has studied the role of gut microbiota in obesity. Her research focuses on the role of gut microbiota in directly contributing to energy balance by “harvesting energy” from undigested components of the diet.

“Of the calories a person eats, most are absorbed in the small intestine,” she explained. “Calories from fiber and resistant starch aren't digestible, so they end up in the colon. The role of high-fiber diets in preventing illnesses such as colon cancer, or promoting cardiovascular health, is well-known. But what we didn't know 50 years ago is that, with the right kinds of microbes, nondigestible carbohydrates will be fermented. This is beneficial because fermentation produces primarily short-chain fatty acids, an energy source, and these get reabsorbed by the human being.” 

Corbin and her collaborators discovered that the energy produced by the microbes in a healthy colon affects energy balance. They measured energy intake, energy expenditure, and energy output (fecal and urinary) in participants in a metabolic ward, under strictly controlled environmental conditions. Compared with the standard Western diet, the Microbiome Enhancer Diet (MBD) led to an additional 116 ± 56 kcals (P < .0001) lost in feces daily, with no changes in energy expenditure, hunger/satiety or food intake (P > .05).

“When we fed people the MBD, high in fiber and resistant starch and low in processed foods, people lost more calories in excretion and had massive growth and remodeling of the microbes,” summarized Corbin, a spokesperson for The Obesity Society.

These findings may lay the groundwork for potential “precision nutrition,” although several questions still need to be elucidated, said Corbin. Does the gut microbiota play a causal, not merely an associational, role in linking diet and human obesity? What's the magnitude of its effect size? What's the impact of caloric restriction or overfeeding on the microbiome? Does inflammation contribute to the dynamics of microbiota involvement? And do individuals with obesity benefit from some version of the MBD, not only in terms of weight loss but also in reducing inflammation?

Diets that include foods associated with lower inflammation might be linked to improvements in microbiome diversity and function. Typically, these include consumption of unrefined and minimally processed foods, nutrients including fiber, mono- and poly-unsaturated fatty acids and lean protein sources, and avoidance of red meat, high-fat dairy foods, saturated and trans fats, and processed foods. The Mediterranean diet, for example, has been shown to reduce inflammatory markers and overweight/obesity, and has improved the population of the gut microbiota. “Given that our MBD had many of the same components as the Mediterranean diet, one could hypothesize that inflammation is a means whereby the microbiome is related to energy balance and adipose function,” Corbin suggested.

“We need a happy, healthy, well-fed microbiome,” she added. “In addition to upgrading one's diet to include prebiotics and reducing foods associated with inflammation and damage to the microbiota, incorporating some extra physical exercise will also help promote negative energy balance.” 

Today's discoveries may revolutionize our understanding of the mechanisms that drive obesity, including inflammation. Both experts hope that these new insights into inflammatory mechanisms will lead to improved management of obesity and its sequelae.

 May 02, 2025  

On April 28, the Spanish Iberian Peninsula experienced a general blackout starting at 12:33 PM Central European Summer Time (CEST). Despite the disruption, hospitals across the country maintained urgent medical care thanks to independent power systems and the efforts of healthcare professionals. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez confirmed that emergency services continued without incident, supported by backup generators.

As electricity was progressively restored throughout the evening, Spain's Ministry of Health reported ongoing coordination with all regional health authorities, especially those considering a request for a formal state of emergency.

“Many hospitals have regained power from the grid, while others continue to rely on backup generators,” a spokesperson from the Ministry stated. “In several cases, these systems were replaced by military emergency units without complications.” The Ministry also stressed the importance of adhering to care recommendations from regional health services, which have begun reorganising clinical activities to prioritise urgent patient needs.

By early the following morning, Spanish Health Minister Mónica García expressed condolences and noted that as the country returned to normal, the healthcare system was “progressively regaining full functionality with stability and reliability.” According to National Grid Operator Red Eléctrica, 99.95% of power supply had been restored by 7:00 AM CEST.

Throughout the morning, regional health authorities began reporting on conditions in their local healthcare facilities:

Hospitals in Madrid reported no overnight incidents, and full electrical service had been restored, according to the Community of Madrid's Health Department. Emergency fuel supplies are in place to prepare for any future outages. All healthcare centres are resuming normal operations, and patients requiring imaging services will be redirected if equipment remains offline. No losses of vaccines or temperature-sensitive medications were reported.

Carlos Mazón, president of the Valencian Government, reported that most hospitals in the region were operating under normal conditions, though four facilities — Vinaròs, La Pedrera (Dénia), Torrevieja, and Requena — were still using generators. He confirmed that home care services were ongoing, and that outpatient and primary care centres were expected to function at near-full capacity the following day, provided no further electrical or IT disruptions occur.

In response to the nationwide blackout, the regional government of Castilla-La Mancha suspended all scheduled medical appointments and procedures in public hospitals. Health Minister Jesús Fernández Sanz urged patients not to attend previously scheduled visits, stating: “If you have any scheduled activity, we will cancel it; do not come, as we cannot attend to you.” The goal, he added, was to minimise electricity usage and preserve generator function by limiting non-essential operations.

By Tuesday, regional authorities reported a gradual recovery. Fernández Sanz noted that between 37% and 40% of scheduled outpatient consultations for that day were ultimately not carried out.

During the night, the Asturian Health Department confirmed that care services remained active in several regions. In Jarrio, Cangas del Narcea, Avilés, Oviedo, Arriondas, Mieres, and Langreo, primary care centres and hospitals continued to operate. In Gijón, urgent care was consolidated at Jove and Cabueñes Hospitals overnight, while emergency services remained available at the health centres in Candás and Villaviciosa.

Health authorities in Navarra announced that all health centres would open on Tuesday. Non-urgent interventions were expected to proceed as planned, although certain high-tech, non-urgent procedures would be rescheduled. Officials emphasised that ongoing healthcare services remained subject to real-time assessments of infrastructure stability. The region continues under alert according to the Navarra Territorial Emergency Plan, and the emergency response cabinet remains active.

In Galicia, President Alfonso Rueda confirmed that the regional healthcare system continues to provide care across hospitals, emergency departments, and primary care centres. Special attention was given to individuals using home respiratory devices, who were invited to recharge their equipment at Continuous Care Points. Information services remained available through the emergency hotlines.

Hospitals managed by the Servizo Galego de Saúde (Sergas), Galicia's public healthcare system, began gradually returning to normal on Tuesday following the restoration of the power supply. According to reports from healthcare unions and staff, urgent clinical activities were prioritised. However, some disruptions continued, particularly in IT systems and laboratory operations, due to lingering telecommunications issues.

Healthcare services in Cantabria were operating normally on Tuesday following the nationwide power outage on Monday. The regional health authorities expect to recover all postponed surgeries and diagnostic tests “probably by next week,” according to Health Minister César Pascual.

Most cancellations involved elective surgeries, as operating theatres require substantial power and energy conservation was necessary. A limited number of diagnostic procedures were also affected. While detailed figures were not available, Pascual stated that all postponed procedures would be rescheduled, following established protocols. He added that this week's activity levels are already reduced due to the May Day holiday.

Although healthcare centres in Andalucía have resumed general operations, primary care services remain disrupted due to unresolved IT system outages. As a result, medical appointments at primary care clinics are being postponed, although facilities remain open to provide information and support to the public.

To safeguard vulnerable populations, the Andalusian Health Service has begun contacting patients who rely on home medical devices requiring electricity. These include oxygen concentrators, dialysis equipment, infusion pumps, and monitoring systems, among others, according to a statement from the regional Health and Consumer Department.

In Cataluña, the Regional Health Department has rescheduled outpatient consultations and non-urgent surgeries that were suspended on Monday. Although electricity has been restored, the healthcare system remains on high alert until the emergency status in the region is officially lifted.

To reinforce communications during future disruptions, hospitals have been equipped with radio transmitters, the Health Department reported on Tuesday.

A third of patients with high-risk prostate cancer identified as biomarker-negative by an artificial intelligence (AI)–derived tool were safe to forgo long-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Patients identified as biomarker-positive by the tool had a 14% absolute reduction in the estimated 15-year risk for distant metastasis with long-term vs short-term therapy.

“This digital pathology AI biomarker was successfully able to differentiate benefit from [short-term ADT] vs [long-term ADT] and identify approximately one third of men with high-risk [prostate cancer] who may be spared the cost and morbidity of [long-term] ADT without jeopardizing [distant metastasis] outcomes,” the authors wrote. “By sparing these men from unnecessary prolonged ADT, our findings not only contribute to personalized treatment strategies but also alleviate the burden of adverse effects and impaired quality of life associated with extended therapy.”

The study, led by Andrew J. Armstrong, MD, ScM, Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, was published online in Journal of Clinical Oncology.

The inclusion of patients with slides of both biopsy and transurethral resection of the prostate specimens may have affected model accuracy. Complete clinical data and quality digital pathology images were required for biomarker score generation. Additionally, supervised and self-supervised modeling approaches had limitations as they might propagate biases present in labeled and unlabeled data.

The study was supported by Artera Inc and through several grants from the National Cancer Institute. Six authors reported being employed with Artera, and seven authors declared having stock and other ownership interests with Artera. Several other authors disclosed receiving research funding and having other ties with various sources.

Youth with obesity but without type 2 diabetes were 31% less likely to develop type 2 diabetes if they were prescribed a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist medication instead of an older-generation obesity medication, according to findings presented at the Pediatric Academic Societies (PAS) 2025 Meeting.

“This study offers compelling early evidence that GLP-1 receptor agonists [GLP-1 RA] may help delay or even prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes in adolescents with obesity — a population at particularly high risk,” Alaina Vidmar, MD, the medical director of the Obesity Medicine and Bariatric Surgery Program at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, told Medscape Medical News.

“While the findings are not entirely surprising given what we know about the metabolic benefits of these medications in adults, it's encouraging to see such a significant risk reduction in a real-world pediatric cohort,” said Vidmar, who was not involved in the study.

Lead investigator Priya Mohan, MD, a third-year pediatric resident at UH Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland told attendees that she considers adolescents “a ‘high-alert' group for chronic diseases, in that they are old enough to develop them but young enough to bear the brunt of disease progression long-term.”

An estimated 20% of US adolescents have obesity, with Black and Hispanic youth disproportionately affected, Mohan said. “This reflects a complex mix of factors, including systemic racism, wealth inequities, political marginalization, and a broken food system,” she said.

Meanwhile, type 2 diabetes in adolescents with obesity is a growing public health concern, she said. “Once considered an adult-onset disease, type 2 diabetes is now increasingly seen in youth, with an incidence of 13.8 per 100,000 per year,” Mohan said. Children with obesity have four times the risk of developing type 2 diabetes as those with a normal body mass index.

“The question remains, when treating obesity in adolescents, what tool is the most useful in this population in not only weight management but also preventing obesity-related complications and sequelae?” Mohan said.

Mohan and colleagues analyzed data from TriNetX, a large, retrospective multicenter and multinational database collected from electronic medical records (EMRs), to identify youth aged 10-19 years with obesity but without type 2 diabetes who were prescribed an obesity medication. They identified 5719 youth who were prescribed any GLP-1 medication, including semaglutide, lixisenatide, albiglutide, liraglutide, exenatide, tirzepatide, or dulaglutide.

They identified 23,700 youth who were prescribed another obesity medication, including bupropion, naltrexone, phentermine, topiramate, orlistat, or metformin.

The researchers then used propensity matching to compare the 5719 patients who received a GLP-1 with 5719 who received an older-generation obesity medication, with no significant differences between the groups in terms of age, gender, race, ethnicity, or average A1c. However, the group who received GLP-1s had an average body mass index (BMI) of 42.2 compared with 40.4 for those receiving another obesity medication (P < .001). The GLP-1 group was also in the 97th percentile for BMI compared with the 96th percentile for the other group (P = .046).

Five years later, 4.3% of those taking GLP-1s had developed type 2 diabetes compared with 6.2% of those who took a non–GLP-1 obesity medication (risk ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.59-0.81).

The study's limitations included its retrospective design, missing data from the EMR database, and the standard limitations associated with propensity matching.

“These are very exciting findings,” Melanie Cree, MD, PhD, an associate professor of pediatric endocrinology at Children's Hospital Colorado in Aurora, Colorado, told Medscape Medical News. “Adolescent type 2 diabetes is not the same as adult type 2, and we know from the TODAY study that the development of type 2 diabetes in youth can lead to a much shortened lifespan and comorbidities,” she said.

“We tried in the RISE study to see if metformin or short-term insulin could be used to delay or prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes and they did not. Since all other methods previously tested failed to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes onset, it is great that GLP1-RAs appear to be the first drug category to decrease this risk.” 

The clinical implications of these findings are that GLP-1 medications can decrease the risk for cardiometabolic disease and risk markers in adolescents, Cree said. She was interested in whether a minimal amount of time with GLP-1 treatment was required or whether a certain amount of weight loss was needed to determine which teens are most likely to benefits.

“Our work in teens with PCOS [polycystic ovary syndrome] has shown that oral semaglutide treatment that leads to more than 5% weight loss improves reproductive features of PCOS and MASLD [metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease] severity,” Cree said. “In adults, GLP-1 RA use has been shown to improve sleep apnea, MASLD, congestive heart failure, and hypertensive kidney disease, to name a few conditions.”

No external funding was noted, and Mohan had no disclosures. Cree had consulted for Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. Vidmar had received consulting fees from Rhythm Pharmaceuticals Inc, Hippo Technologies Inc, and Guidepoint Inc, and grant funding from DexCom Inc.

The recent death of a 38-year-old runner and the hospitalization of a 21-year-old, both in apparently good health, due to cardiorespiratory arrest during the Movistar Madrid Half Marathon has reignited the debate on whether cardiovascular incidents in sports can be prevented through pre-sports medical evaluations. What advice can primary care professionals offer individuals engaging in intense physical activity?

To address this issue, Univadis Spain, a Medscape Network platform, spoke with Leonel Diaz-Gonzalez, coordinator of the Sports Cardiology Working Group of the Spanish Society of Cardiology, and cardiology head at the High-Performance Center of the Higher Sports Council, Madrid, Spain.

Despite the concerns following the Madrid half-marathon, the current data do not indicate a relative increase in “the number of cases of sudden death or cardiovascular incidents during intense sports activities. The incidence remains the same at approximately 1.5 cases per 100,000 athletes. However, the growing number of participants in intense sports events has led to an absolute increase in the number of cases,” Diaz-Gonzalez explained.

However, there is no need for an alarm if no relative increase is observed. For now, “it is simply a matter of statistics: The more athletes, the higher the number of cardiovascular incidents,” he continued.

Although the number of deaths from sudden cardiac arrests during sports is rare, efforts should be made to reduce them. One approach is for primary care professionals to guide patients to engage in sports activities.

“It is a great idea in theory, but we must acknowledge that primary care is already overwhelmed. The limited time professionals have with patients makes it challenging to provide tailored recommendations and complementary tests based on their health status,” noted Diaz-Gonzalez.

Diaz-Gonzalez offered the following simple recommendations:

The type of tests needed depends on the profile of the athlete in question.

The requirement for health certification depends on the country and sport. In Spain, health tests are generally not mandatory for participation in sports events.

Diaz-Gonzalez noted, “It would be ideal to conduct these tests, but in practice, it is very challenging. Stress tests are logistically complex for large-scale events. Although electrocardiograms are simpler, the challenge lies in interpreting the results. This would require a sufficient number of experienced cardiologists.”

Diaz-Gonzalez declared no conflict of interest.

 May 02, 2025  

DENVER — Adolescents with rheumatologic conditions should undergo screening for depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation at least once a year at rheumatology appointments, according to a new guidance on mental health concerns from the American College of Rheumatology.

“These kids see their rheumatologist very frequently, even more frequently a lot of times than their primary care doctor, so we're the ones who are really in a position to try to identify and facilitate interventions for mental health problems,” Andrea M. Knight, MD, MSCE, a pediatric rheumatologist and associate professor of pediatrics at The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, told Medscape Medical News.

Knight is a co-author of the new, first-ever guidance statements for addressing mental health concerns in youth with rheumatologic conditions. [Editor's note: As of this article's publish date, the guidance is not available on the website of Arthritis Care & Research.] Until recently, too little evidence existed to develop guidelines, but “now that we're accumulating some literature and data, we really feel like there should be guidance for providers,” Knight said.

The guidance, developed by the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) Mental Health Guidance Statement Taskforce and endorsed by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), make 11 recommendations that had sufficient supportive evidence and received at least 80% consensus agreement by a Delphi Panel.

The task force was formed in 2019 with pediatric rheumatologists, pediatric behavioral health providers, patients, and parents and began with 34 statements to assess for evidence and consensus, along with input from an open comment period. The ACR Committee on Quality of Care then reviewed the statements, resulting in the list of those with the strongest empirical evidence.

The guidance statements are “important and long overdue,” CARRA member Kaveh Ardalan, MD, MS, co-director of the Duke Children's Myositis Center and co-leader of the Duke Pediatric Lupus Clinic in Durham, North Carolina, told Medscape Medical News. “Pediatric rheumatology investigators have uncovered high levels of emotional distress that often persists even after patients achieve disease remission,” Ardalan said. “The guidance statements highlight the important role that pediatric rheumatologists have in identifying emotional distress in their patients and connecting them with evidence-based mental health care.” 

The guidance statements address patients aged 12 years or older, but Knight hopes that future iterations will address younger patients as more evidence becomes available.

“Recognizing that these mental health issues are important even for younger kids — we certainly have seen that in our qualitative work — we really wanted to have guidance, but it was basically the lack of literature,” she said.

Aside from the annual screening recommendation, the only other statement with the highest level of evidence — and the only one with 100% consensus — was that patients who demonstrate moderate to severe symptoms, with or without suicidal ideation, should be urgently assessed by a mental health specialist to advise on evidence-based treatments, including possible pharmacological and/or psychological treatments.

Five statements had the second highest level of evidence, based on randomized trials: 

The guidelines include a table of more than a dozen screeners, with times to complete ranging from under 2 minutes to 30 minutes, that have been validated to ages as young as 6 years old.

The four remaining statements have level 3 evidence, relying on nonrandomized controlled studies: 

Ardalan found the most helpful aspect of the guidelines to be the standard of care they set in defining “high-quality care.”

“Specifically, high quality care includes addressing not only physical health concerns but also the ‘whole patient', which includes their psychosocial well-being,” he said. “That has at times been controversial among pediatric subspecialists, so these guidance statements represent an important advancement in terms of conveying the field has reached consensus on the importance of integrating mental health care into pediatric rheumatology practice.” 

The task force recognized that barriers and challenges exist to implementing the guidance, particularly time and resources, Knight said.

“For a lot of people, it would be a new part of their practice, and that's always something that requires some time and resources and training,” including staff involvement and new clinic protocols, she said. “There's a lot of legwork that goes on in terms of preparing to do a practice change.”

The scarcity of pediatric mental health providers and services is another challenge, but online resources are beginning to fill that gap, Knight suggested. In addition, a CARRA workgroup is compiling resources to eventually provide a list for providers.

Despite the challenges, two abstracts at the CARRA 2025: Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance Annual Scientific Meeting demonstrated ways in which pediatric rheumatology clinics have already begun working to incorporate mental health screening into their practice.

One of the abstracts presented at CARRA described a quality improvement project that led a rheumatology clinic to integrate mental health screening and treatment into care for youth with juvenile dermatomyositis. Emily K. Datyner, MD, a pediatric rheumatology fellow at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, said the clinic's first goal was to increase mental health screening for all patients with juvenile dermatomyositis aged 8 years or older who came in for routine follow-up appointments. They aimed to screen 80% of patients, up from 0%, by January 2025.

Starting in January 2024, they used the Screen for Childhood Anxiety and Related Emotional Disorders for patients aged 8 years or older and the Patient Health Questionnare-9 modified for adolescents for patients aged 12 years or older. Patients completed the screenings on tablets from the front desk at check-in, with results shown to providers at the visit. Providers followed an algorithm for next steps on positive screens, which included consultation with social work, referrals to a mental health provider, and offering participation in an existing cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program integrated into the clinic.

They achieved 84% screening by January 2025, with 24% positive anxiety screens, 11% positive depression screens, and 9% positive suicidal ideation screens. Four patients have been referred to the integrated CBT clinic.

That quality improvement project showed that adhering to the new ACR mental health guidance statements is feasible, Ardalan said, with the clinic achieving high rates of screening in real-world practice.

“The availability of an integrated CBT intervention was also important for ensuring timely access to care for patients who screened positive,” Ardalan told Medscape Medical News. “Many other sites can learn from these approaches, though resources for electronic health record integration and accessible CBT mental health intervention are likely to be more limited at many sites and may require some time to develop.” 

Another abstract presented at CARRA described the use of a change package to facilitate implementation of depression screening at pediatric rheumatology clinics at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta; Atrium Health Levine Children's in Charlotte, North Carolina; and Medical University of South Carolina Children's Health in Charleston, South Carolina. Emily Vara, DO, of the Medical University of South Carolina, and colleagues reported screening 87% of patients for depression, mostly using Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System measures and the Patient Health Questionnare-9. Among the 21% of patients who screened positive, 92% received an appropriate response.

“The breadth in responses to screens — such as connecting with a PCP, referral to a social worker, and providing educational pamphlets — really underscores the two main categories of guidance statements regarding addressing mental health needs: Collaborative approaches to managing mental health concerns and providing education and a clinic environment that promotes mental health and normalizes mental health struggles,” said Tamar Rubinstein, MD, MS, a pediatric rheumatologist at Children's Hospital at Montefiore in Bronx, New York, a leader of CARRA's Mental Health Workgroup, and one of the coauthors of the new guidelines.

Rubinstein was not involved in that study but told Medscape Medical News that the investigators “thoughtfully approached the problem of addressing mental health from the standpoint” of determining what first steps a low-resourced clinic could take. “I think this is a great example to clinics that may have small staffs and no dedicated attached or associated mental health providers,” she said, “namely, to first assess readiness, educate staff on free and easy-to-use screeners and screens with free, non-intensive trainings, and leveraging community resources and established partnerships, such as through primary care, to help address identified concerns.”

The Vanderbilt quality improvement project was supported by CureJM Foundation, and the authors reported no disclosures. The implementation project for the Georgia and Carolinas clinics was funded by a CARRA/Arthritis Foundation Implementation Science Grant, and the authors reported no disclosures. Ardalan and Rubinstein had no disclosures.

A new study shows that even a moderate dose of caffeine alters brain activity during sleep, increasing complexity and nudging neural systems toward a high-efficiency processing state, especially in young adults during deep sleep.

Left column shows statistical differences (blue: reduced during caffeine, red: increased during caffeine), while SVM/LDA columns show classification accuracy between conditions (green). Dots indicate statistical significance (gray: p < 0.05, white: p < 0.01). Study: Caffeine induces age-dependent increases in brain complexity and criticality during sleep.

Caffeine ingestion leads to a reduction in long-range temporal correlations and also causes an increase in brain complexity, especially during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep.

A recent study in Communications Biology assessed sleep electroencephalography (EEG) reports to understand the effects of caffeine on the brain, particularly during sleep.

Caffeine can have a disruptive effect on sleep quality by raising sleep latency and reducing sleep efficiency. On the contrary, research has demonstrated caffeine's neuroprotective qualities, particularly against Parkinson's disease (PD). Therefore, the impact of caffeine on health is complex. Given the widespread consumption of caffeine-containing products, it is crucial to understand the effects of caffeine on the brain during sleep across various age groups.

Caffeine delays the onset of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and worsens the quality of awakening. Lack of sleep deteriorates the proper functioning of sleep-related brain processes. It also leads to other health issues such as weight gain, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and depression.

Despite encouraging progress in research, existing knowledge on the mechanisms by which caffeine alters brain dynamics during sleep is in its early stages. There are not only direct effects through adenosine signaling, but also a host of downstream effects on other neurotransmitter systems, as well as complex interactions that drive the diverse effects of caffeine on brain function and sleep architecture. Additionally, these complex interactions may affect the balance between neural excitation and inhibition, which plays a key role in how the brain processes information during different sleep stages.

This study conducts an in-depth assessment of caffeine's effects on the brain's electrophysiological signals while sleeping. The specific focus was on brain complexity and criticality. Periodic and aperiodic components in the EEG spectra were disentangled, thereby improving upon existing power spectral investigations.

A previous study has shown that caffeine increases brain entropy during wakefulness. However, whether similar effects extend to sleep EEG signals is still unknown. This study also assessed whether caffeine-induced changes in slow-wave sleep (SWS) and increased lighter sleep stages (e.g., N1 and N2) resulted in an increase in EEG complexity during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. The authors note that some of the observed increases in brain complexity may be partly due to caffeine shifting the proportion of lighter NREM stages, making it difficult to disentangle direct effects on brain dynamics from indirect effects via changes in sleep architecture. Additionally, it explored age heterogeneity in how caffeine impacts the brain, given that adenosine receptor density decreases with aging, which reduces the time spent in deep sleep.

Sleep EEG data were collected from 40 healthy participants under caffeine (200 mg) and placebo conditions during two non-consecutive nights. Entropy measures, complexity metrics, and power spectral density (PSD) were extracted from the EEG. Machine learning (ML) and inferential statistics were separately used for NREM and REM sleep.

Concerning caffeine-driven changes in EEG oscillations, statistically significant reductions in power in the alpha, theta, and delta frequency bands were noted in NREM sleep. For delta and theta, this spanned parietal and central channels. Across parietal and frontal channels, a widespread increase in beta power was noted, which could be attributed to elevated GABA levels. During REM sleep, theta power was lowered in the occipital, parietal, and temporal channels.

Caffeine affected the aperiodic component of the spectrum. The change in the scaling behavior of the EEG spectra was attributed to altered EEG self-similarity, which could be associated with the shift in neural criticality. The discrepancies observed between the corrected and uncorrected spectral power indicate that the aperiodic component of the power spectrum may be a candidate EEG feature modified by caffeine. The study emphasizes that correcting for the aperiodic component reveals caffeine's effects on rhythmic brain activity that might otherwise be missed, highlighting the importance of separating these components in EEG analysis.

All EEG complexity measures exhibited a consistent increase under caffeine. Both the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) scaling exponent and the slope of the aperiodic activity showed a consistent reduction, implying a shift towards the critical regime. Although the caffeine-induced alterations in brain signals were widespread and prominent during NREM sleep, a weaker effect that was limited to the occipital regions was observed during REM sleep.

The most accurate association between caffeine and placebo sleep EEG was obtained via Spectral Sample Entropy as a feature in NREM sleep. The overall agreement between the single-epoch and subject-wise ML results indicates the sensitivity of the selected features of the caffeine effect and the robustness of the observations.

The random forest (RF) classifier, trained on all extracted features, achieved significantly higher decoding accuracy in NREM sleep than REM sleep. The complexity and criticality-related measures performed considerably better than the spectral features for classifying caffeine and placebo samples during NREM. The distribution of features ranked by importance during REM was found to be more heterogeneous and less structured.

Caffeine exerted significant effects during NREM sleep on several EEG features in both young (20–27 years) and middle-aged (41–58 years) adults. The younger age group exhibited more prominent effects. However, caffeine-induced changes in REM sleep were only significant in the younger age group, affecting specific features, including sample entropy (SampEn), spectral entropy (SpecEn), Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZc), and the DFA scaling exponent. The study found no significant age differences in the impact of caffeine during NREM sleep, but clear age-related differences were seen in REM, suggesting that age-related changes in adenosine receptor density may diminish caffeine's effect on REM sleep in middle-aged adults.

The authors also discuss that the observed shift in brain activity patterns reflects a movement toward a theoretical “critical regime” or “edge of chaos,” where the brain is thought to be most sensitive, adaptable, and efficient at processing information.

This study demonstrated that caffeine intake resulted in a significant increase in EEG complexity, particularly during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Caffeine also affects the brain, allowing it to process information most efficiently. Compared to the middle-aged group, younger adults exhibited a significantly increased brain entropy response to caffeine during REM sleep.

The effects were more widely distributed in NREM compared to REM sleep. However, the authors caution that these findings are based on healthy adults, and that caffeine's effects may differ in individuals with sleep disorders or neurodegenerative conditions. Results should also be interpreted in the context of both direct and indirect changes to sleep architecture.

Virtual pulmonary rehabilitation is a safe, effective alternative to traditional pulmonary rehabilitation programs for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who also require supplemental oxygen, according to a new report. The report is published in the March 2025 issue of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases: Journal of the COPD Foundation, a peer-reviewed, open-access journal.

COPD is an inflammatory lung disease, comprising several conditions, including chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and can be caused by genetics and irritants like smoke or pollution. The disease affects more than 30 million Americans and is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide.

Pulmonary rehabilitation is an exercise and educational program supervised by a health care professional, which helps people with chronic breathing difficulties. These programs teach people how to manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life. Pulmonary rehabilitation programs are traditionally held in person; however, virtual or online programs are also available.

In this new report, the authors examined the feasibility, safety and effectiveness of a virtual pulmonary rehabilitation program for people with COPD who did and did not require supplemental oxygen. The report compared the attendance rates, safety and improvements in symptoms, mood and exercise capacity for the two groups.

Virtual pulmonary rehabilitation allows for increased access to these programs, which benefit people with COPD, regardless of their supplemental oxygen use. In our study, 99% of participants participated safely without any adverse effect, and participants in both groups had improvements in clinical outcomes. Our findings demonstrate the need to increase use of virtual pulmonary rehabilitation programs to help improve the quality of life for people with COPD. By evaluating each patient's situation and incorporating virtually accessible programs, we can offer more individualized care for patients.""

       Colorized transmission electron micrograph of influenza A/H1N1 virus particles.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the National Institutes for Health (NIH) today announced the development of the next-generation, universal vaccine platform, Generation Gold Standard, using a beta-propiolactone (BPL)-inactivated, whole-virus platform.

This initiative represents a decisive shift toward transparency, effectiveness, and comprehensive preparedness, funding the NIH's in-house development of universal influenza and coronavirus vaccines, including candidates BPL-1357 and BPL-24910. These vaccines aim to provide broad-spectrum protection against multiple strains of pandemic-prone viruses such as H5N1 avian influenza and coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and MERS-CoV.

Our commitment is clear: every innovation in vaccine development must be grounded in gold standard science and transparency, and subjected to the highest standards of safety and efficacy testing.""

Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., HHS Secretary

The program realigns BARDA's operations with its statutory mission under the Public Health Service Act—to prepare for all influenza viral threats, not just those currently circulating.

""Generation Gold Standard is a paradigm shift,"" said NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya. ""It extends vaccine protection beyond strain-specific limits and prepares for flu viral threats - not just today's, but tomorrow's as well - using traditional vaccine technology brought into the 21st century.""

Generation Gold Standard, developed exclusively by NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID):

Clinical trials for universal influenza vaccines are scheduled to begin in 2026, with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval targeted for 2029. The intranasal BPL-1357 flu vaccine, currently in advanced trials, is also on track for FDA review by 2029.

Hypertension is a major public health concern, affecting millions worldwide and increasing the risk of heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. It is typically characterized by persistent high blood pressure, which can result from multiple mechanisms, including increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), inflammation, and oxidative stress. Although pharmaceutical treatments are available, they often come with side effects, making the search for natural, side-effect-free alternatives increasingly important. Egg whites, known for their high-quality protein content, also contain various bioactive peptides with proven antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antihypertensive properties. Recent studies have shown that egg white proteins, even after depleting ovotransferrin, can still provide effective antihypertensive peptides.

A study (DOI:10.48130/fmr-0024-0026) published in Food Materials Research on 30 December 2024 by Jianping Wu's team, University of Alberta, highlights the potential of egg white proteins as a valuable functional food ingredient for addressing high blood pressure.

In this study, the antihypertensive effects of ovotransferrin-depleted egg white hydrolysate (OD-EWH) were evaluated in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), with egg white hydrolysate (EWH) serving as the reference. The rats were administered 1 g/kg body weight per day of either hydrolysate for 9 days. The results showed that both OD-EWH and EWH significantly reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP), with OD-EWH lowering SBP to 160.47 mmHg and EWH reducing it to 159.42 mmHg, compared to the untreated group (178.07 mmHg). Both treatments also reduced mean arterial pressure (MAP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), without affecting heart rate. Further analysis revealed that both hydrolysates upregulated the expression of ACE2, an important enzyme in regulating vascular health, in the aorta. While EWH also decreased ACE and AT1R levels, OD-EWH had no significant effect on these proteins but increased the AT2R level. In the kidneys, both OD-EWH and EWH reduced renal ACE levels, but did not affect ACE2, MasR, or AT1R/AT2R expression. Additionally, OD-EWH significantly enhanced the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in the aorta, suggesting a mechanism for blood pressure reduction through improved nitric oxide production. Both hydrolysates also attenuated vascular oxidative stress, as indicated by reduced nitrotyrosine staining. However, only EWH reduced vascular inflammation markers like VCAM-1, while OD-EWH did not affect markers of inflammation. These findings suggest that OD-EWH may reduce blood pressure through the modulation of the renin-angiotensin system, eNOS activation, and antioxidant effects, making it a promising functional food ingredient for hypertension management.

The study underscores the potential of egg white hydrolysates, especially those depleted of ovotransferrin, as effective natural antihypertensive agents. By modulating the RAS, enhancing eNOS expression, and reducing oxidative stress, OD-EWH offers a promising approach for managing high blood pressure. This research highlights the importance of natural, cost-effective food-based solutions in combating hypertension and opens the door for further innovations in functional food development aimed at improving cardiovascular health.

Plasma-activated medium (PAM) shows tumor-fighting effects against the rare form of cancer known as synovial sarcoma, an Osaka Metropolitan University-led research team has found.

The group irradiated a mammalian cell culture medium with non-thermal atmospheric-pressure plasma to produce PAM and conducted in vitro tests using human cells and in vivo tests using mice with this type of soft tissue sarcoma.

Graduate School of Medicine student Hana Yao, Associate Professor Hiromitsu Toyoda, and Professor Hiroaki Nakamura, and Graduate School of Engineering Professor Jun-Seok Oh were part of the team that verified the effects of PAM on synovial sarcoma.

Human synovial sarcoma cells exposed to PAM prepared with 5 minutes of plasma irradiation had only a 21% survival rate compared to the control. In mice with this form of cancer, daily injections of PAM around the tumor for four weeks resulted in the reduction of the tumor volume to approximately 46% and final tumor weight to about 59% compared to the control group.

""Not only do our results indicate that PAM has anticancer effects on synovial sarcoma at the cellular and organismal levels, but there also were no obvious side effects such as weight loss or poor appetite observed in the mice,"" stated Professor Toyoda. ""We aim to further develop our studies using PAM and introduce a new treatment option for synovial sarcoma.""

The results were published in Biomedicines.

A new research paper was published in Aging (Aging-US) on April 2, 2025, as the cover of Volume 17, Issue 4, titled ""Decreased mitochondrial NAD+ in WRN deficient cells links to dysfunctional proliferation.""

In this study, the team led by first author Sofie Lautrup and corresponding author Evandro F. Fang, from the University of Oslo and Akershus University Hospital in Norway, discovered that cells from people with Werner syndrome (WS)-a rare genetic disorder that causes premature aging-have low levels of a molecule called NAD+ in their mitochondria. This molecule is essential for energy production, cellular metabolism, and maintaining cell health. The researchers also found a potential way to improve cell function in WS patients, pointing to new directions for treating age-related decline and other premature aging disorders.

Werner syndrome leads to signs of aging much earlier than normal, including problems such as cataracts, hair loss, and atherosclerosis by age 20 to 30. The team found that when the WRN gene is missing or damaged, cells cannot maintain healthy NAD+ levels in their mitochondria. As a result, the cells age more quickly and stop growing properly. When the researchers boosted NAD+ levels using nicotinamide riboside (a vitamin B3 compound) the affected stem cells and skin cells from patients showed less aging and improved mitochondrial activity.

""Interestingly, only 24 h treatment with 1 mM nicotinamide riboside (NR), an NAD+ precursor, rescued multiple pathways in the WRN−/− cells, including increased expression of genes driving mitochondrial and metabolism-related pathways, as well as proliferation-related pathways.""

The study also found that the WRN gene helps regulate other important genes that control how NAD+ is made in the body. Without WRN, this system becomes unbalanced, which affects how cells function, grow, and respond to stress. Although adding more NAD+ helped some cells look healthier, it could not completely fix the growth problems in other types of lab-grown cells. This suggests that while NAD+ supplementation is beneficial, it cannot fully replace the essential functions of the WRN gene.

These findings offer new insights into the biological mechanisms of aging and reinforce the therapeutic potential of targeting NAD+ metabolism in age-related and genetic diseases. Future studies will aim to better understand how subcellular NAD+ regulation interacts with mutations like those seen in WS. Finally, this research supports ongoing efforts to develop NAD+-based treatments that could slow cellular aging and improve quality of life for patients with premature aging conditions.

Staying active during your 40s and 50s could help your brain resist early Alzheimer's changes, especially if you follow WHO activity recommendations, this study finds.

Study: Physical activity changes during midlife link to brain integrity and amyloid burden. Image Credit: goodluz / Shutterstock

In a recent article published in the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia, researchers investigated how changes in physical activity during midlife may impact brain changes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in individuals at higher risk of developing the disease.

Their findings indicate that becoming physically active at the levels recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) was associated with reduced amyloid burden in the brain, and both becoming and remaining active, even at less than recommended levels, were linked to greater cortical thickness in areas vulnerable to AD, compared to remaining sedentary. Conversely, remaining sedentary was implicated in reduced cortical thickness in areas vulnerable to AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) begins with a long preclinical phase marked by early brain changes, such as neurodegeneration and amyloid-β (Aβ) buildup, which may be detected through biomarkers years before symptoms begin to emerge.

Researchers believe that up to one-third of cases are linked to modifiable lifestyle factors, and there is increasing interest in AD prevention through behavioral changes, particularly physical activity.

Sedentary behavior is a known risk factor for dementia, while midlife physical activity has been shown to reduce the risk of AD and cognitive decline. This could be through pathways such as improved mental and cardiovascular health.

Midlife is a crucial period because age-related brain changes and AD pathologies often begin then, especially in people at genetic or familial risk. While prior studies have shown cross-sectional links between physical activity and reduced AD biomarkers, few have examined how changes in activity levels – especially adherence to WHO recommendations – affect the progression of AD-related changes in at-risk individuals.

In this study, researchers assessed a critical research gap by investigating whether increases in physical activity, including adherence to WHO guidelines, are associated with lower Aβ burden and better brain structure in cognitively unimpaired middle-aged adults at risk for AD.

They analyzed data from 337 cognitively unimpaired participants in Catalonia from a larger study on preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). Participants, aged between 45 and 65 and mostly with a family history of AD, had physical activity data collected at baseline (2013–2014) and follow-up (approximately 4 years later). Only those with MRI and/or amyloid-PET data at follow-up were included.

Physical activity was assessed using a questionnaire that recorded the weekly minutes of moderate or vigorous activity. Participants were grouped based on observance of WHO physical activity guidelines at both time points: maintained sedentary, maintained non-adherence, became adherent, became non-adherent, and maintained adherence. A continuous measure of activity change was also calculated.

Brain amyloid burden was assessed through positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, and cortical thickness in AD-sensitive regions was measured using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The AD-signature region was defined using a composite of medial temporal lobe areas vulnerable to early AD atrophy.

Statistical models examined how physical activity group and changes in activity predicted amyloid burden and cortical thickness at follow-up, adjusting for age, sex, education, apolipoprotein E (APOE)-ε4 status, and the time between assessments.

Sensitivity analyses also controlled for cardiovascular and mental health factors such as symptoms of depression and anxiety.

It is worth noting that brain imaging outcomes were measured only at follow-up, so causality cannot be firmly established. Additionally, 99.4% of participants were Caucasian, which limits the generalizability of the results to other populations.

Participants were categorized into five groups based on adherence to the WHO physical activity guidelines. Nearly 30% remained sedentary, while 15.7% became adherent to their treatment. Those who became adherent showed the greatest increase in physical activity minutes. No significant group differences emerged for age, education, sex, or APOE-ε4 status.

Participants who maintained sedentary behavior had significantly lower cortical thickness in Alzheimer's disease (AD)-sensitive brain regions than those who maintained or became adherent, or even those who were non-adherent but not sedentary. Additionally, those who became adherent had a significantly lower amyloid-β (Aβ) burden than those who became non-adherent, a finding that remained statistically significant even after correction for multiple comparisons. The difference in amyloid burden between those who became adherent and those who remained sedentary was also present but less robust.

A dose-response association was found, with increased physical activity correlating with a lower Aβ burden; however, this dose-dependent effect was not observed for cortical thickness. These results remained largely robust after adjusting for cardiovascular risk and mental health scores, although some associations with cortical thickness were attenuated after these adjustments.

The study reveals that increased or sustained physical activity during midlife is associated with a lower Aβ burden and greater cortical thickness in AD-vulnerable brain regions, underscoring its potential neuroprotective effects.

Even partial adherence to activity guidelines (i.e., non-adherent but not sedentary) appeared beneficial. A dose-dependent relationship between increased activity and reduced Aβ supports this link.

Strengths of this analysis include longitudinal design, biomarker data, and adjustment for confounders. However, the study is limited by the observational nature of the survey design, limited ethnic diversity, the use of self-reported physical activity, and the inability to rule out reverse causation due to brain outcomes being measured only at follow-up. Potential unmeasured mediators, such as sleep or neurogenesis, were also not assessed.

Overall, the findings suggest that adopting the WHO-recommended physical activity during midlife may enhance resilience against early AD pathology, even in individuals at risk.

Researchers found that COVID-19 lockdowns were linked to a 4% drop in pre-term births in Europe and Australia and a 37% rise in antenatal depression screenings. However, most other birth outcomes and health disparities showed no significant change due to the limited data available.

Study: The association of COVID-19 lockdowns with adverse birth and pregnancy outcomes in 28 high-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Image Credit: Corona Borealis Studio / Shutterstock

In a recent review published in the journal Nature Human Behaviour, researchers conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on adverse birth and pregnancy outcomes (ABPOs) during the pandemic. The review focused on publications comparing these impacts in high-income countries (HICs) between January 2019 and June 2023, both before and during the pandemic.

A random-effects meta-analysis of 132 studies revealed that the first lockdown significantly reduced pre-term birth rates (specifically spontaneous pre-term births) in Europe and Australia, and increased positive depression antenatal screening rates. The analysis also identified an 18% decrease in neonatal mortality associated with lockdown. However, this finding should be interpreted with caution due to the strong influence of a single extensive study and the need for further time-adjusted analysis. While the study also attempted to elucidate inequalities between regions, ethnic groups, and deprivation levels, insufficient data prevented these analyses and underscored the need for further research on the topic.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic prompted several governments to impose social distancing measures, known as ‘lockdowns', to mitigate disease transmission and curb infection rates. Research during these non-pharmaceutical interventions suggests that these lockdowns may have inadvertently triggered alterations in adverse birth and pregnancy outcomes (ABPOs), specifically, exacerbated stillbirth rates in low- to middle-income countries (LMICs) and reductions in pre-term birth (PTB) rates in high-income countries (HICs).

Previous examinations of these trends have highlighted substantial regional differences between LMICs and HICs, which may be attributed to variations in the stringency of national lockdown policies, disparities in healthcare systems, and COVID-19 epidemiology, including infection rates and testing. Even within HICs, healthcare access and socioeconomic disparities between different ethnic groups and deprivation cohorts are expected to have resulted in a spectrum of ABPO outcomes, but prior studies have provided conflicting findings.

The present review aims to address these inconsistencies in the literature by collating, synthesizing, and reanalyzing data from publications that evaluate the association between COVID-19 lockdowns and ABPO outcomes. It focuses on HICs and further investigates if variations in continental regions, ethnic groups, time periods (first versus subsequent lockdowns), and deprivation levels altered ABPO outcomes during and shortly after the pandemic.

Publications for study inclusion were obtained through a custom search of three online scientific repositories: EMBASE, Web of Science, and MEDLINE/PubMed. Additionally, preprints (MedRxiv) and unpublished reports were manually obtained.

The search and subsequent screening process conforms to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and was registered on the PROSPERO registry. The inclusion criteria comprised: 1. COVID-19 lockdown (intervention), and 2. ABPO outcomes, and 3. HICs derived population (except Sweden, which did not enforce a lockdown). Potential publications were screened via a cascade of title and abstract screening, duplicate removal, and full-text screening.

Study data was extracted using a custom tool developed in Microsoft Excel and included: 1. study characteristics (total births and outcomes), 2. deprivation, and 3. ethnicity. Missing data were obtained through personal emails to study authors or proxy estimates (when authors did not respond).

Meta-analyses were conducted for variables of interest with at least three corresponding studies. Outcomes were analyzed using random-effects models adjusted for heterogeneity and continent (region). Subgroup analyses were undertaken where applicable (e.g., for studies reporting outcomes from second or subsequent lockdowns). Deprivation was estimated using the Area Deprivation Composite Index scores.

The initial custom search strategy identified 14,215 records (titles) that met the eligibility criteria. Deduplication narrowed this down to 9,780. Full-text screening identified 207 eligible studies. Studies with overlapping populations, time periods, or outcomes were excluded from the meta-analyses, resulting in a final study dataset of 132. Summary statistics revealed that these studies included participants from 28 countries, with Europe (45%) and North America (41%) comprising the bulk. Cohort studies were the most common (86%), followed by cross-sectional publications (11%).

Meta-analyses revealed that pre-term births (PTBs) significantly declined (-4%, specifically spontaneous PTBs) during lockdown periods. This finding remained robust even after adjusting for long-term trends (11 studies, -3%), but was found to be limited to the first lockdown. Notably, high inter-study heterogeneity and subsequent subgroup analyses revealed that these findings were significant only for European and Australian continental regions and not for North America, Asia, South America, or the Middle East.

Analyses of stillbirth data did not find any credible evidence of an association between pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 lockdown periods. While 18 studies explicitly tested for low birth weight (LBW), no credible evidence supporting an association was observed. For other outcomes, the overall pooled analyses showed no significant association for caesarean sections or sepsis (based on limited studies). However, substantial regional variations were observed despite no overall association for:

Neonatal mortality was associated with an 18% decrease during lockdown (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74–0.91); however, the researchers noted that this pooled estimate requires cautious interpretation and further time-adjusted investigation.

The only other significant overall finding was the increase in antenatal depression screening rates, which were observed to rise by 37%. Unfortunately, inequality-based analyses could not be undertaken due to insufficient data availability, characterized by high inter-study heterogeneity and limited data for subgroup analyses.

The present meta-analysis revealed a reduction in spontaneous pre-term births (in Europe and Australia) and an increase in positive antenatal screening for depression following the implementation of COVID-19-associated lockdown restrictions. The study also found a decrease in neonatal mortality, though this needs further confirmation, and highlighted significant regional differences in neonatal admissions and maternal readmissions. They further highlight a lack of sufficient data on the impacts of inequalities on these trends, underscoring the need for further research in the field.

The authors suggest that COVID-19 lockdowns served as a natural experiment, and the uneven associations observed require further exploration, potentially through mixed-methods research, to understand the underlying health determinants and barriers to care. These findings indicate that broad, umbrella lockdown approaches can have unequal consequences, suggesting that targeted policies and tailored support structures are necessary to better promote maternal and neonatal health.

Even mild COVID-19 cases can trigger lingering symptoms, especially in women and younger adults, while severe cases show a strong link to long-term fatigue, brain fog, and joint pain, setting COVID-19 apart from other respiratory infections.

Study: Risk of post-acute symptoms among adults: A comparison study of severe COVID-19, pneumonia, and influenza. Image Credit: Lightspring / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal PLOS One, researchers at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, USA, assessed the associations between the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the risk of post-acute symptoms.

Among symptomatic COVID-19 patients, nearly two-thirds regain their usual health status within one or two months, while others experience protracted recoveries. According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, long COVID is defined as sequelae that persist for at least three months following the initial infection. However, other studies suggest post-acute COVID-19 as symptoms lasting up to 120 days after recovery.

Further, while long COVID is more likely in subjects who had the most severe initial disease, individuals with mild initial disease also develop symptoms. Some studies have observed differences in long-term sequelae between COVID-19 and influenza. Moreover, while post-acute COVID-19 has been repeatedly studied, few studies have focused on the nuanced delineations of acute disease severity or compared it to other infectious respiratory diseases.

In the present study, researchers examined the risk of post-acute COVID-19 across severity levels of initial illness among US adults. They extracted data from the Clinformatics Data Mart database. Eligible subjects were aged ≥ 18 years and had clinically diagnosed or lab-confirmed COVID-19 in 2020, with continuous inclusion in the database from January to December 2020, and reported symptoms at diagnosis.

 Characteristics of disease cohorts.

Similar criteria were used for individuals with influenza during the 2018–19 influenza season. Moreover, another cohort was created for subjects diagnosed with pneumonia in 2018. The primary outcome was the presence or absence of symptoms four weeks, three months, and six months after COVID-19 diagnosis. The following symptoms were considered: fatigue, cough, dyspnea, anosmia, ageusia, arrhythmias, brain fog, insomnia, joint pain, general pain, muscle weakness, and headache.

Potential predictors of symptoms were gender, ethnicity/race, age, US region, and comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, obesity, dementia, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], chronic renal disease, and ischemic heart disease). The disease severity index was adapted from the World Health Organization. The 10-point severity index was modified, and only six levels were considered.

These were severity level 3 (symptomatic but ambulatory), 4 (symptomatic with emergency department visit), 5 (hospitalized), 6 (hospitalized and required supplemental oxygen), 7 (hospitalized and required mechanical ventilation), and 8 (hospitalized and required mechanical ventilation plus renal dialysis or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). Logistic regression models examined the relationship between post-acute symptoms and the infectious agent.



 Presence of symptoms by cohort over time.

The COVID-19, flu, and pneumonia cohorts included 121,205, 20,844, and 29,052 subjects, respectively. Across cohorts, the most common gender was female, the race was non-Hispanic White, and the US region was the South. Consistent with other studies, females were found to be more likely to develop post-acute symptoms. The most common comorbidity across cohorts was hypertension. Notably, the flu cohort had the lowest frequencies of all comorbidities, except for asthma, and the pneumonia cohort exhibited higher frequencies, except for obesity. Interestingly, while racial and ethnic minorities often face higher risks for acute COVID-19, this study observed mild reductions in adjusted post-acute risks among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic individuals within this insured population. An unexpected finding was a regional difference, with patients in the Northeast showing the greatest risk of post-acute symptoms.

In the COVID-19 cohort, fatigue, dyspnea, and joint pain were the most common symptoms after four weeks. In the flu cohort, joint pain, fatigue, and cough were the most common after four weeks, while dyspnea, fatigue, and cough were the most common for pneumonia subjects. In the COVID-19 cohort, the odds of any symptom after four weeks were 1.12 for severity level 5, 1.16 for level 6, 1.46 for level 7, and 2.64 for level 8 compared to severity level 3.

While symptoms tended to decrease over time, they persisted across all severity levels at three and six months, although the increased odds of having symptoms remained highest for the most severe initial cases (levels 7 and 8) compared to the least severe (level 3). The specific symptoms experienced also varied by age, with younger adults having increased risks for anxiety and headache, while older adults had increased risks for brain fog and fatigue. The presence of a comorbidity increased the odds of post-acute symptoms at all time points. The comorbidities with the highest increase in odds were rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and ischemic heart disease.

 

Further, the odds of any symptom in the flu cohort compared to COVID-19 were 0.77 at four weeks and three months and 0.68 at six months. Conversely, the corresponding odds ratios for pneumonia subjects were 2.24, 2.41, and 2.46, at four weeks, three months, and six months, respectively. The most common symptoms after four weeks were fatigue in the COVID-19 cohort, dyspnea in the pneumonia cohort, and joint pain in the flu cohort. After six months, the most common symptoms were the same for the pneumonia and flu cohorts, but joint pain was the most common symptom in the COVID-19 cohort.

The odds of any symptom, except for cough, were lower for the flu cohort than for COVID-19 subjects at all time points. Likewise, the odds of any symptom, except for headache and brain fog, were higher for the pneumonia cohort than the COVID-19 cohort at all time points. The odds of headache were lower in the pneumonia cohort than in the COVID-19 cohort. There were no differences in the odds of brain fog between the COVID-19 and pneumonia cohorts.

The findings corroborate prior observations that fatigue, dyspnea, and joint pain are the most common persistent symptoms after acute COVID-19. The highest risk of post-acute symptoms was found in people with rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, or ischemic heart disease. Symptoms observed four weeks after initial COVID-19 were likely to improve later. However, appreciable levels of symptoms lingered that correlated with the severity of the initial COVID-19 episode. Although individuals with less severe initial illnesses had a lower risk of persistent symptoms, the paper notes that, because their numbers are significantly larger than those of hospitalized patients, they contribute substantially to the overall population burden of post-acute COVID-19.

The post-acute symptoms differed among the three diseases, likely reflecting the differences in their pathophysiology, comorbidity levels, and age distributions. Overall, COVID-19 symptomatology cannot be perfectly described by pneumonia or influenza symptomatology, and there are differences in symptom prevalence and the time to resolution that better characterize long COVID, indicating that this persistence is unique to COVID-19. The study acknowledges limitations, including its reliance on administrative health claims data from an insured population during the early phase of the pandemic, which may affect generalizability and requires careful interpretation.

Every year, more than 100 million animals are used globally in biomedical research, yet over 90% of drugs that appear effective in animal trials fail during human clinical testing.1 This staggering disconnect raises a critical question: Are we relying on the wrong models to understand and treat human diseases?

In response, a new frontier in biomedical science has emerged — organoids. Organoids are miniaturized, simplified versions of human organs that are grown in vitro from stem cells. These three-dimensional cellular structures self-organize to mimic the architecture and function of their tissue of origin, offering a promising new avenue for studying human development, disease, and drug responses.2,3

Ethical concerns, high attrition rates in drug development, and significant advances in stem cell technology drive this mounting interest in reducing or even replacing animal models. However, the growing popularity of these models in academic, regulatory, and industrial settings also poses the question of whether organoids can fully replicate the complexity of human disease and ultimately replace animal models in biomedical research.

Organoids are three-dimensional (3D) multicellular structures that are grown in vitro and mimic key functional and structural aspects of real human organs. They are typically derived from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), such as embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), or adult stem/progenitor cells isolated from tissue biopsies.2

The process begins by guiding these stem cells through a series of developmental cues using growth factors, extracellular matrix components, and mechanical signals to induce them to self-organize into complex structures resembling the target organ. These cues mirror embryonic development and are tailored to produce specific tissue types. The resulting organoids exhibit cell diversity, polarity, and in some cases, rudimentary organ-level functions.2,4

Numerous types of organoids have been successfully developed since the inception of this technology, including brain organoids with layered neural tissues, liver organoids displaying metabolic and detoxification functions, intestinal organoids with crypt-villus structures, and kidney, pancreatic, and tumor-derived models.3,4

Organoids are distinct from traditional two-dimensional (2D) monolayer cultures, which lack spatial complexity, and from spheroids, which are less organized and do not mimic organ-specific architecture or function. Moreover, their ability to retain patient-specific genetic and epigenetic profiles also makes them valuable tools for personalized medicine. However, the reproducibility and scalability of organoid culture systems remain ongoing technical challenges.4,5

Organoids have emerged as powerful platforms for modeling human diseases and evaluating therapeutic responses in a physiologically relevant, human-specific context. Their ability to recapitulate the 3D structure, cellular diversity, and gene expression patterns of native tissues makes them especially valuable in studying complex diseases that are difficult to model in animals or 2D cultures.

For example, brain organoids have been instrumental in uncovering how the Zika virus disrupts neurodevelopment, leading to microcephaly. These models showed that the virus preferentially targets neural progenitor cells — a finding that was not observed in studies that used traditional murine models.6

Similarly, gut organoids have transformed cystic fibrosis research by offering personalized platforms for drug testing. Patient-derived intestinal organoids can predict cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator response, including the response for rare mutations, which has enabled the development of tailored therapeutic strategies.7

In oncology, patient-derived tumor organoids preserve the molecular and histological characteristics of the original tumor, offering a highly personalized platform for drug screening. Liver cancer organoids, for example, have been used to identify subtype-specific vulnerabilities and novel therapeutic targets, such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway inhibitors.2–4

Beyond individual case studies, organoids are also increasingly being used in high-throughput drug screening to assess toxicity and efficacy profiles. Their ability to model patient-specific responses allows researchers to stratify treatment regimens, reducing trial-and-error in clinical settings and advancing the goals of precision medicine.2,5

Animal models, especially mice, have long been the cornerstone of biomedical research due to their physiological similarities to humans and their manipulability. However, cross-species differences in gene expression, developmental timing, and immune responses have been a limiting factor in the relevance of animal models for human disease.3

Organoids present several advantages over animal models:

However, organoids also have certain limitations. They lack the systemic interactions found in whole organisms, such as immune system interplay, hormonal regulation, and blood flow dynamics, which are critical for studying infections and immunotherapies. Most organoids are also limited in size, vascularization, and longevity, which constrains their utility in studying chronic conditions or whole-body pharmacokinetics 3,5

Nevertheless, organoids surpass animal models in capturing species-specific disease processes. For example, mouse models failed to replicate Zika-induced microcephaly unless the virus was injected directly into fetal brain tissue, whereas brain organoids naturally recapitulated the condition due to human-specific cellular responses.3,6

The integration of organoids with in silico models and microfluidic platforms like organs-on-a-chip further enhances their physiological relevance. These hybrid systems can mimic multi-organ interactions and dynamic microenvironments, bridging the gap between in vitro models and in vivo biology.8

Read the latest research news on organoids

With increasing regulatory recognition, organoid models are gaining traction in the pharmaceutical industry. The United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Modernization Act 2.0, passed in 2022, reduced mandatory animal testing requirements for preclinical drug development, allowing for validated non-animal alternatives such as organoids to be used for investigating new drug applications.1

Pharmaceutical and biotech companies are now actively integrating organoid models into their research and development strategies. Hubrecht Organoid Technology, a spin-off of the Hubrecht Institute, has partnered with global pharmaceutical companies to provide patient-derived organoids for drug screening and biomarker discovery. Similarly, Emulate Inc. uses organoids in conjunction with organ-on-chip systems to simulate tissue interfaces and physiological responses with high precision.9

These platforms are also attracting significant investment. Venture capital and public-private partnerships have channeled substantial funding into 3D tissue technologies, particularly in oncology, gastrointestinal disease, and neurology. This growing financial commitment underscores industry confidence in organoid systems as scalable, predictive, and ethically advantageous alternatives to animal models.9

However, regulatory agencies still require robust standardization and validation before organoid data can fully replace animal studies. Moreover, issues such as batch-to-batch variability, scalability, and reproducibility remain significant hurdles.9

Organoids are poised to become indispensable tools in integrated research strategies. Future improvements, such as vascularization, the incorporation of immune cells, and automation for high-throughput screening, could expand their applicability.5

Furthermore, initiatives such as the Human Cell Atlas are advancing the field through the development of standardized protocols, funding, and cross-disciplinary collaboration.10 As technologies such as gene editing, single-cell sequencing, and bioengineering evolve, organoids will continue to further our understanding of the complexity of human tissues and diseases.

a, Single-cell profiling of human organoids (left) and of human primary tissue samples (right) provides complementary information. Data integration between single-cell profiles from organoids and primary tissues makes it possible to investigate the same cell type in both contexts, allowing each approach to play to its strengths. b, The Organoid Cell Atlas Portal will implement key features for analyzing and interpreting single-cell data from human organoids in the biological context provided by HCA profiles of their in vivo counterparts. 10

Organoids represent a transformative step in the field of human disease research. Their ability to replicate key features of human tissues offers an opportunity to reduce reliance on animal models, increase experimental relevance to humans, and personalize medicine.

Furthermore, although organoids are not yet ready to entirely replace animal models, their strengths in human-specific biology, drug testing, and disease modeling make them vital to biomedical research. The future of disease modeling lies in integrating organoids, animal studies, and computational models to accelerate the development of safe and effective therapeutics.

ATLANTA (May 2, 2025) – U.S. Soccer has announced the hiring of Vicky Jepson as full-time head coach of the U.S. Under-20 Women's National Team.

Jepson's hire is subject to the completion of her visa and work permit process.

Vicky comes to U.S. Soccer from Tottenham Hotspur in England's Women's Super League, where she served as first team senior assistant head coach since 2021. In March of 2023, she served as the interim head coach for the remainder of the 2022/23 campaign, leading the squad to secure its position to remain in the Women's Super League, and since then has served as the top assistant through the 2023/24 and 2024/25 seasons.

“We are thrilled to welcome Vicky Jepson to our Youth National Team staff,” said Tracey Kevins, the U.S. Soccer Head of Development for the Women's and Girls' YNTs. “Vicky brings a wealth of experience, tactical knowledge and a proven track record of developing talent for the highest levels. Her leadership will be instrumental in driving our U-20 program, which serves as a crucial step in our National Team pathway.”

During Jepson's time in North London, Spurs reached their first-ever FA Cup Final and Jepson earned her UEFA Pro License in June of 2024, becoming one of 17 female coaches to have completed the course with the England Football Association. In addition to her Pro License, Jepson holds UEFA “A” License and has worked across the full spectrum of the elite talent pathway, from U-11s to the senior professional level.

“It's hard leaving Tottenham Hotspur after four memorable years at the club, but I'm moving on to work for the most progressive organization in the world for women's football,” added Jepson. “Working alongside the incredible leadership of Tracey, (U.S. Soccer Sporting Director) Matt Crocker and of course a serial winner in Emma Hayes is an amazing opportunity. I can't wait to get started.”





Before joining Spurs, Jepson served as manager at Liverpool Women, having earlier held the role of assistant manager, where she was named FA Female Development Coach of the Year. She spent more than 10 years at Liverpool in various youth development roles and then with the First Team.

Jepson, 37, takes over the U.S. U-20s as the squad prepares for the 2025 Concacaf Women's U-20 Championship in Costa Rica, which will send the top four finishers to the 2026 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup in Poland.

“I'm truly honored and excited to start my next chapter with the U.S. Soccer Federation,"" said Jepson. “I'm well aware of the great work that has been done in the past, that is being done currently under Emma and Tracey, and I know there are some ambitious plans for the future. I'm passionate about developing this next generation and I look forward to providing them with challenging and valuable experiences to help them grow as people and players. There is such a rich pool of talent in the USA and I'm so proud to be part of the players' journey to senior international football.”

Jepson has experience working on the international level as well. She worked for the England FA as a scout, coach educator and head coach for the England U-17 Women's National Team, coaching the team through qualifiers and at the UEFA Women's U-17 Euros.

Jepson becomes the fifth full-time head coach in the U.S. Soccer Women's and Girls' Youth National Team programs under Kevins, who coached the U.S. U-20s in the last two FIFA U-20 Women's World Cups, the latter of which saw the USA finish third, its best placing since winning the 2012 FIFA U-20 WWC.

Carrie Kveton is the current U.S. U-19 head coach, Katie Schoepfer is the U.S. U-17 WNT head coach, Ciara Crinion is the U.S. U-16 GNT head coach and recent hire Vanessa Mann heads the U-15 GNT. Head coach positions for the U.S. U-23 WNT and U.S. U-18 WNT remain open but are slated to be filled in the near future.

The United States mens' and women's national teams will soon be back in action, with Emma Hayes' side set to play two friendlies at the end of May, and Mauricio Pochettino's men prepped to start their Gold Cup run in June.

In this week's roundtable, FOX Sports soccer reporters Doug McIntyre and Laken Litman look ahead to the upcoming international windows and look back at the last week in American soccer.

1. Johnny Cardoso scored his fourth goal of the La Liga season last week. What are the chances that he starts in central midfield for the U.S. at this summer's Gold Cup? 

It's not impossible. While Cardoso has never really replicated the form he's shown with Real Betis for the national team, his standout performances in one of the world's best leagues continue. Also, few USMNT jobs should be safe after last month's losses to Panama and Canada. In the latter defeat, U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino pulled starting midfield trio Tyler Adams, Weston McKennie and Christian Pulisic — arguably his three most important players — off the field with 30 minutes remaining and the Americans down a goal. As for Musah, Poch has deployed him mostly as a winger or fullback, and the 22-year-old hasn't gotten off AC Milan's bench since manager Sérgio Conceição pulled him 22 minutes into a 2-2 tie with Fiorentina on April 5. If Pulisic moves back to his usual spot on the the wing with the U.S., it wouldn't shock me to see Cardoso, who has also been unlucky with injuries since Pochettino took over, finally get an extended look alongside Adams and McKennie. 

2. Brenden Aaronson didn't make the USMNT for the Nations League finals, but he just helped Leeds earn promotion back to the English Premier League. Will he make the World Cup squad next summer? 

I'd put money on it. It probably helped Aaronson and a few other regulars who just missed out not to be involved last month, given how poor the U.S. was over the two games. The 24-year-old runs and flights — two qualities that were sorely lacking in Los Angeles. The Philadelphia Union product is also a better player than he was when he last played in the Prem in 2022-23. He gained Bundesliga and Champions League experience last year while on loan to Germany' Union Berlin, and played 44 games (and scored nine goals) in England's second tier this term. He's also added some muscle to his frame, which should make him more physically prepared for the Premier League this time around. 

3. Pochettino recently watched Watford take on Burnley in the Championship, presumably to scout left back Caleb Wiley. Will Wiley make the Gold Cup cut? 

Keep in mind that Burnley, which was also promoted this weekend, also has an American in forward Luca Koleosho, although Koleosho would need to petition FIFA for a one-time switch of association from Italy in order to rep the U.S. I don't believe that has happened to date. 

As for Wiley, the Nations League games showed how thin the USMNT is at left back behind Antonee ""Jedi"" Robinson. With Kristoffer Lund apparently not in Pochettino's plans, right-footed Joe Scally filled in for Jedi against the Panamanians, while Columbus's Max Arfsten manned the left corner versus Canada. The 20-year-old Wiley, who is on loan from Chelsea until the end of the season, is at least as deserving of a look there along with fellow 2024 Olympian John Tolkin of Bundesliga side Holstein Kiel. 

4. The Women's Champions League final is set with Barcelona taking on Arsenal at Jose Alvalade Stadium in Lisbon, Portugal on May 24. Do the underdog Gunners have a chance to upset two-time defending champion Barça?

After a slow start to the season, Arsenal has been on a winning rampage. The Gunners have won 13 of their last 15 Women's Super League games and finished second in the table behind Chelsea. Over the weekend, they shocked eight-time UWCL winners Lyon, beating the French side 5-3 on aggregate. Lyon wasn't particularly dangerous in its attack, which was a surprise on its own given the talent the squad has, while Arsenal ended up winning the second leg match 4-1 with goals from Mariona Caldentay, Alessia Russo and Caitlin Foord.

Will that trio be enough vs. big bad Barca? Barcelona, which has won three of the last four Champions League titles, has a lethal attack that just gashed Chelsea 8-2 on aggregate. Arsenal's defense, which stars USWNT outside back Emily Fox, has a major challenge ahead as it will try to stop (or at least slow down) a squad that features stars like Aitana Bonmati, Salma Paralluelo, Alexia Putellas and Claudia Pina. Chelsea's defense, which includes USWNT center back Naomi Girma, had no response for those players.

Barcelona looks unstoppable right now – they're so strong on the ball and can finish in the final third. Arsenal will have to try and match that quality in order to pull off a major upset.

5. Trinity Rodman is out indefinitely as she works through pesky back issues, Mallory Swanson has not yet played for the Chicago Stars this season due to personal reasons, and Sophia Wilson is expecting her first child this year. Do Emma Hayes and the USWNT have anything to worry about given the ""Triple Espresso"" is unable to train with the team until further notice?

No. From a competitive standpoint, the USWNT will not play in a major tournament until the 2027 World Cup, leaving the star power trio plenty of time to take the time they need and return to the squad when they are ready. Of course Hayes would love to have a full strength roster for every camp and every friendly, but she's also focused on growing and developing the player pool so that when playmakers like the ""Triple Espresso"" are unavailable, there are plenty of choices to come in and fill the void.

Some players have already proven they can take on that role, including Alyssa Thompson, Catarina Macario and Ally Sentnor, all of whom were quite impressive during the most recent USWNT camps. Additionally, forward Mia Fishel recently returned to the pitch after a long layoff recovering from a torn ACL and scored a goal for Chelsea on April 23. She was invited to the USWNT's April camp as a training player, and will likely be called into the full squad later this month. Hayes is filling out the depth of her squad quite nicely despite not having some of her biggest stars.

6. The USWNT's next camp begins at the end of this month and includes matches against China and Jamaica. Are there any new players who could receive a call up?

The new faces here are actually familiar ones. Fishel should return to the fold now that she's building minutes with Chelsea and scored her first goal in more than a year. She was a training player during the April window, and given her relationship with Hayes (who briefly coached her at Chelsea before joining the USWNT), it would seem like a natural inclusion to this roster.

Croix Bethune also recently returned to the pitch following an injury. The Washington Spirit midfielder was named 2024 NWSL Rookie of the Year and won a gold medal at last summer's Paris Olympics. Then she sustained a freak knee injury while throwing out the first pitch at a Washington Nationals game. She had a setback that derailed her return, but last weekend Bethune played 10 minutes in the Spirit's 3-0 loss to Gotham. It would make sense if Hayes called her up as a training player later this month.

Mandy McGlynn shares her dream vacation destinations, possible career paths after NWSL and professional soccer, pets, and more in this edition of Kickin' It.  

“Kickin' It” is a fun Q & A that consists of all non-soccer questions for players to get a break from the usual soccer talk.

Coming off a debut with United States Women's National Team and a Goalkeeper of the Year nomination, Mandy McGlynn goalkeeping prowess is a hot topic in the NWSL.

In this edition of “Kickin' It,” get to know Mandy behind the scenes of her outrageous goalkeeping skills. 

Be on the lookout for a feature article detailing Mandy McGlynn's story later this week.

All for XI: Your goal in college was to join the medical field. Now that you are a professional soccer player, has that changed?

Mandy McGlynn: As I keep getting deeper into my professional soccer career, that keeps slipping away more and more. I'm so far removed from taking the GRE. So, it's not completely off the table. I would love to work with athletes, recovering athletes at some point if I use my medical degree, but I've also found this is also a really cool opportunity just to build your brand as a person and kind of whatever you want to put your name on is fun. Right now, I've been working on sourdough bread making and been kind of slowly putting together Safe Hand Sourdough by me. So, we're going to see how that goes. Just doing it locally here in Utah when I can.

All for XI: Did you have any goalkeepers you looked up to growing up?

Mandy McGlynn: I was obsessed with the national team goalkeepers. I loved Hope Solo and I loved Tim Howard. I was always there for the World Cups and the Olympics and so growing up with that, they were my idols. I actually went to the 2015 World Cup in Germany and met Hope Solo. That was so cool and that kind of painted the picture of, oh, I could do this. Tim Howard, he's just literally legendary in everything that he does.

All for XI: Do you have any pets?

Mandy McGlynn: I have two cats, Domingo and Sabrina!

All for XI: Any recent TV or movie obsessions?

Mandy McGlynn: I just got re-obsessed with the Hunger Games. So, I rewatched all the Hunger Games because I read the new book about Haymitch's games. So that was kind of just all over my radar. I'm just really into trashy, like reality TV. So, I will watch all the Temptation Islands, Love is Blind, all that stuff. That's my jam.”

All for XI: What would you bring from back home in Jacksonville to Utah?

Mandy McGlynn: Oh my gosh, the beach. I would bring a beach. I am so landlocked here. It's funny when you grow up in Jacksonville because you don't go to the beach as much as like other people do and now every time I'm home, I'm like, ‘Mom, we need to go see the sunset, the sunrise, we need to go to the beach' and she's like, what? I would definitely bring a beach. I've been so much. I'm going to be visiting Jacksonville more than I ever had this year, for sure. 

All for XI: Do you have any dream vacations or places you want to travel to?

Mandy McGlynn: I really want to go to Greece. I want to see all the white houses and live my Mama Mia! moment. Australia, too, because I have a really good Australian accent, so I just want to test it out. Have you seen my British one? 

A post shared by Utah Royals FC (@utahroyalsfc)

Fans will be patiently waiting for the Australian accent to debut, but in the meantime...

Soccer in the United States might not find a greater moment than right now, in the middle of a three-year stretch when the U.S. hosted Copa America last year, the FIFA Club World Cup this year and the 2026 World Cup next — with the final taking place at MetLife Stadium.

As the sport continues to make inroads in the United States, American soccer great Landon Donovan told The Post on Thursday that he could feel the excitement building and the interest growing by leaps and bounds. 

Donovan had been in New York for a media brunch promoting the upcoming Club World Cup that's set to take place across 12 venues in the U.S. beginning June 14 in Miami.

“I can feel it anecdotally, and then I can feel it just in the attention around [the sport],” Donovan said.

The expanded Club World Cup will bring the top teams from across the globe together for a best-on-best tournament, which will include Inter Miami and the Seattle Sounders from the MLS.

But the biggest facilitator will be the World Cup taking place next year and how far the U.S. Men's National Team can go in the global tournament. The men have advanced past the Round of 16 just once — the 2002 World Cup, when they reached the quarterfinals — dating back to 1990, when they qualified for the first time following a stretch of nine tournaments in which they failed to qualify.

“We could spend 10 years growing the sport organically … but one iconic moment next summer takes it exponentially higher,” Donovan said about any momentum for soccer in the U.S. “There's nothing that can replicate that, and that's part of the reason why I'm so passionate about when our national team doesn't play well or doesn't play proud. That's why it bothers me, because the opportunity, literally, the sky's the limit. I mean literally, for these guys.”

Donovan, who played in three World Cups for the United States and was named by The Guardian as the greatest male U.S. soccer player of all time in 2015, explained that the biggest thing for the United States to be successful in 2026 is playing with “pride.”

Though the major focus is on 2026, Donovan is excited for Americans to get a taste of the Club World Cup this summer. MetLife Stadium will host matches, including the championship game.

The American soccer great believes, similar to March Madness, that fans would fall in love with teams they'd never been exposed to until now.

“I've just learned with fandom, like there's no one reason someone becomes a fan,” Donovan said. “Sometimes it's a moment. Sometimes it's a fan. Sometimes you go to watch another team, and then all of a sudden, that team catches your eye.”

Among the notable teams in the Club World Cup are Manchester City, Chelsea, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, along with Saudi giant Al Hilal.

Luca de la Torre

San Diego F.C. | USA

Para leer en español, haz click aquí.

When I was 15 years old, I left San Diego to live in London on my own. I was going there to play for Fulham, but I didn't bring a coat. There are no seasons in California so I just never had to own one. I remember freezing every day at the train station until someone took me to go buy one. 

At that age, moving halfway around the world by yourself is completely crazy. Looking back at it, I'm surprised it was even legal.

Now that I'm home playing for San Diego FC, I've thought a lot about why I decided to leave. 

I've always been a pretty relaxed person. I'll “go with the flow” and not complain. In some ways that's good as a professional athlete, because it helps you show up every day and work hard no matter how you feel. Respect authority. Do what you have to do. Those are pretty basic things that set you up for success in football. It's a lot like how I imagine the military would be. You get told where to be, what time to be there, when to eat, what to eat, how to train, how to rest. It's difficult for some people to live like that, but I've always enjoyed the routine of it.

In a lot of ways, the decision to move to London was made before I was even born, for two key reasons: 

1) My dad had already decided that I was going to be a professional footballer (like a lot of dads before him). 

2) I was born with the right blend of athleticism, ego and willingness to do what people told me. 

This combination led me to dribble through cones my whole childhood. You can ask anyone who grew up in Carmel Valley the same time that I did. Every single day that I wasn't playing a game, my dad would take me to a park after school, and we'd start practicing. Left foot, right foot, in the air, on the ground, around a dog. On some days I hated it, but the truth is that it's the greatest gift anyone has ever given me. 

Those hours with my dad developed my relationship with the ball, and my absolute favourite thing about football is creativity. The feeling when you've come up with something on the spot to solve a difficult problem ... It's special. It's the reason I fell in love with the game. 

The same goes for watching other players come up with moments of magic. As a kid, I never watched full professional matches, just YouTube videos of Messi, Neymar, Iniesta, and Brazilian Ronaldo. And then I would go out and try to replicate it. 

When you're a kid, football just feels different.

When I was 13, my dad got an email from Fulham. They wanted me to come train with them for a week. We went, and after a few more trials over the next two years, they made me an offer. Somehow, it felt like the easiest decision to make. It's pretty crazy to read myself typing this up right now, but that was 100% where my head was at. 

Joining Fulham felt so natural. Just go with the flow. This is what young players do if they want to become professional. 

Of course, there was no San Diego FC back then. No MLS on my doorstep. It would have made a huge difference for me to go to a San Diego game with my dad, and see a great player in my position. My mom wanted me to get into a good college (she went to Stanford), and I could have done that by staying in the city. 

Had San Diego FC existed at that time, I wonder if I would have left. 

It's a privilege to be back home. I live here with my wife, close to my parents, and every other Saturday I play in front of 30,000 people from my city.

Fulham was hard. Everyone talks about the weather, but that was probably the least difficult thing. The brutal part was the culture shock. I was thrown into a professional environment as a 15-year-old, without the close physical support of my family. I didn't make that many friends at my school, and even though I was staying with a host family, I felt lonely. I joke with my mom now that she raised me over Skype.

I'd always been one the best players on my teams in San Diego, but the players at the Fulham academy were fighting for their lives, because to have a kid on a pro contract is a big deal financially to a lot of families in England. Your teammate was also your rival, the guy who was going after your spot on the team. You'd say “good morning,” but you were both thinking, I'm going to crush this guy.

A few days after I'd arrived, I was already wondering if coming to London was the right call. And then I remember we were training one day, when out of the blue these two players squared up and started punching each other. 

It was a real fistfight. I just couldn't believe it. 

Despite all that, I managed to show up every day and do my best. For any kids reading this, that is the main lesson I hope you'll take away from this story. You never know for sure if you'll make it in football, but if you show up every day, no matter the circumstances, your chances are higher. That's guaranteed. 

I saw so many players get eaten up by the stress, physically and mentally. Sometimes I would make friends on the team, and overnight they'd be gone. 

They were sold or loaned out. You never saw them again. 

Fast forward seven years, and I was facing the giant black hole between the academy and the first team. I'd already seen plenty of really good players get sucked into it, and as a 22-year-old with only 14 first-team games, I was a prime candidate to be next. 

In a way that really woke me up. The idea of getting lost in the system terrified me. I did a lot of thinking, and I decided to take more responsibility for my own situation. 

No more “going with the flow.” 

I sacked my agent and got a new one. When Fulham wanted me to sign a new deal, I refused. I played as many games with the reserve team as I could, so that I'd attract interest from other clubs. That change in mentality completely saved my career. I ended up signing for Heracles Almelo, a club playing in the Dutch Eredivisie, and it was like starting a new life as a player. To be important, to play regularly, to feel that you have a purpose ... I can't stress enough how critical that is to the mental health of players. It gave me the confidence to be more ambitious. 

I wanted to go to a World Cup, and by taking my chances I made it happen.

Hay que soñar en grande, as they say in Spanish. 

When Heracles was relegated in my second season, I was signed by Celta Vigo. La Liga was a dream come true, both for me and my dad, and the Spanish side of our family reached out to him to congratulate us. Of course there were challenges in Vigo: I arrived with a Spanish last name but no ability to speak the language. My dad tried to fix it by not speaking to me in English for a whole year. I also had injuries, and changes of coaches that didn't go my way, but that happens with all players. What I remember the most are all the special moments.  

Goals. Assists. Playing in the most beautiful stadiums in the world. 

I loved playing in Vigo, and I loved living there.

Then last summer, I was with the U.S. National Team in Kansas when Tyler Heaps, the San Diego FC sporting director, flew out to see me. MLS had finally arrived in San Diego, and he wanted me to be there for it. But as much as I loved the idea of coming home, it was difficult to convince me to leave Vigo. I wasn't ready to make such a big step. I needed to be 100% sure that it was the best thing for my career. 

When the national team qualified for the World Cup, the coach gave every player a coin, and when we got it, we saw that it was inscribed with a phrase. 

“Behind the mountain is another mountain”

I'm not big on quotes, but I like that one. Playing for Celta had been my mountain for so long, and now that I'd reached the top, it was difficult to walk away from it. 

But things happen so fast in football. I got an ankle injury in August, and pretty soon I felt like I needed a change to get my game back together. When the January transfer window opened, it was 100% clear that the best thing for me was to go. 

When we met in Kansas, Tyler had said a lot of things that I liked. The style of play would be brave and attacking. We were going to dominate the ball and create as many chances as possible. The academy would be modelled on Right to Dream, which means that every kid who plays for the academy is guaranteed to leave with a professional contract or a degree. That part really struck home for me. Especially when I think about the kids that I grew up playing with in San Diego. So many of them were good enough to go pro. When I was 13, almost every single U14 national team starter was from the Southern California area. Three of us played on the same Sunday League team in City Heights. Most of those kids didn't make it because they were born in a city without a professional team and didn't have a clear path. 

That seemed like a really noble thing to do, and something that would make a huge difference to their lives. To have the chance to be part of that felt like a special opportunity. 

It was about time. When I look at the list of expansion teams that arrived in MLS before San Diego, I can't believe that it took so long. This is a football city, everyone knows that. This sport is in the blood of the people here. 

It's a privilege to be back home. I live here with my wife, close to my parents, and every other Saturday I play in front of 30,000 people from my city. It gives me a lot of pride to say that. 

I can guarantee you that I'll do everything I can to help this team be successful. 

To give those fans a reason to show up.

To help kids in this city fall in love with the game, the way I did. 

That's my mountain now. 

Jamal Musiala on his journey so far: “We had just moved from Germany to England for my mum to finish her degree, and I was still learning English. I kind of spoke a mix of German and English and ‘Football.'” 

On his 18th birthday, Estêvão writes a touching tribute to his mom and dad: “You will always be my two biggest idols. Whatever I achieve, I will owe it to you.”

Four years ago, Alisson Becker lost his father. He pens this letter to his family — at home and at Liverpool F.C.: “I know that a part of my Dad is still here with us, too.”

The past couple of weeks have been hard for Real Madrid – the elimination from the UEFA Champions League vs Arsenal, the Copa del Rey final defeat to Barcelona, falling four points behind the Catalans in La Liga and players falling prey to injuries.

Eduardo Camavinga and Ferland Mendy are out for at least two months and will be unavailable for the FIFA Club World Cup in the summer. Antonio Rudiger and David Alaba are also out for six-eight weeks putting their involvement in the competition in jeopardy.

However, it is not all bad news for Real Madrid because AS reports that the Spanish capital giants are confident of recovering Eder Militao for the Club World Cup in the USA.

While the Brazilian is unlikely to feature before the end of the league campaign, his recovery is progressing well, and Real Madrid expect him to be available for the Club World Cup, set to take place from 15 June to 13 July.

Out due to an ACL injury he sustained late last year, Militao has resumed ball work since the March international break and is now undertaking high-intensity exercises at Valdebebas. 

The next steps are partial integration into group training, followed by full sessions. So far, everything is proceeding as planned.

Caution remains essential in Militao's case, as this is his second cruciate ligament injury in under 18 months. However, the Brazilian returned to play just six and a half months later after his first injury and club's medical staff believe he is on a similar timeline now.

Militao is regularly working with the ball and performing high-impact, high-intensity exercises, as he is deemed ready for that stage. These sessions are carried out with Real Madrid's recovery staff, particularly Jaime Salom, who has closely overseen his rehabilitation. 

In addition, Militao has been working with his personal trainer, Romario Queiroz, who has travelled from Brazil to help the defender through his rehab.

Getting minutes before the league season ends appears unlikely. However, if recovery stays on course, Militao should be training with the group consistently by the end of May and will have a couple of weeks to prepare for the Club World Cup. 

Naturally, he will lack match rhythm after such a long absence, but Real Madrid's group at the tournament – featuring RB Salzburg, Al Hilal, and Pachuca – could allow him to ease back into competitive action

The future of Jonathan Tah will be a hot topic in the transfer market as we slowly approach the summer transfer window.

The German international is expected to leave Bayer Leverkusen at the end of the season and join another club on a free transfer.

Barcelona have been linked with a move for Tah for the longest time. However, the Catalans' deal to sign the German has stalled in recent weeks, most likely due to finances and an inflated wage bill.

Real Madrid, too, have been lurking in the background, waiting for an opportunity to get their hands on Tah. 

However, a recent report from Florian Plettenberg suggests Manchester United, too, have now entered the race to sign Jonathan Tah.

The Premier League giants want to reinforce their ranks in the defensive unit, with the German emerging as the ideal option.

Man United have already started talks with the player's management, exploring an opportunity to sign the defender on a free transfer.

This might not bode well for Real Madrid, who already have a strong competitor in the form of Barcelona, in the race to sign Tah.

The report adds that the Catalans remain keen on acquiring the services of Tah, who has been linked with a move to Catalonia in the past.

Real Madrid, therefore, have a fight on their hands if they are to sign the Leverkusen star, who has worked with Xabi Alonso over the past two years.

The Spanish giants, therefore, will be hoping to leverage Alonso, the most likely replacement for Carlo Ancelotti, to acquire the services of Tah.

Both Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, in fact, will remain involved in the race to sign Jonathan Tah as long as the Barcelona deal is not finalised.

Home > News > Kharja and Harkass Back Wydad to Impress at Club World Cup

Former Morocco international Houssine Kharja says Wydad Casablanca have one of the biggest fan bases in the world

Former Morocco international Houssine Kharja says Wydad Casablanca have one of the biggest fan bases in the world, and that representing the country at the FIFA Club World Cup is a moment of pride.

Speaking to FIFA's official website, Kharja said: “Wydad are one of the most supported clubs in the world. It's a real honour to carry Morocco's name in such a big competition.”

He praised Moroccan fans for their passion, recalling their strong presence at the World Cup in Qatar. “They lit up the stadiums there, and I think they'll have the same impact this time.”

Kharja also highlighted Wydad's supporters, describing them as “fierce and full of energy,” adding: “They can surprise anyone, even in the US.”

Defender Jamal Harkass echoed the pride, calling Wydad “a historic club with loyal fans who always show up, no matter what.”

He said: “The Club World Cup is one of the top tournaments in football. Every player dreams of being there. Of course, you want to win, but you can't be afraid, even if you're facing big names.”

Harkass believes the experience will help the squad grow, stressing: “Big players improve in big games – that's what we're aiming for.”



He added: “Football brings joy. It gives fans something to be proud of. That's a huge motivation, especially in a place like the US.”

Wydad Casablanca will represent Morocco in this new bloated Club World Cup. The African heavyweight have been drawn to Group G alongside Manchester City, Juventus, and Al-Ain, and they are on track to receive the biggest paycheck in its history – unlike anything seen in Moroccan or African football.

This year's tournament is set to be the richest in history. FIFA President Gianni Infantino said, “For the FIFA Club World Cup 2025, we confirmed a USD 1 billion distribution pot for participating clubs, plus a target USD 250 million in solidarity payments to non-participating clubs across the world – with all money entirely covered by the tournament revenues.”

In plain words, a $250-million check would go to the global solidarity fund to ensure that even those who don't go far benefit from the cash injection. So, unlike previous competitions, FIFA won't be pocketing a penny – all revenues will be distributed straight into club football.

“FIFA will neither retain any funding for this tournament,” promised Infantino. “All revenues will be distributed to club football, nor will it touch FIFA's reserves, which are set aside for global football development through the 211 FIFA Member Associations.”

Listen to Story

FIFA has announced its team of 117 match officials for the inaugural expanded Club World Cup, set to take place across the United States from June 14 to July 13. In a landmark move, referees will wear body cameras, and new rules will be introduced to crack down on goalkeeper time-wasting.

The FIFA Referees Committee has selected officials from 41 member associations, including 35 referees, 58 assistant referees, and 24 video match officials for the 32-team tournament, which spans 12 stadiums across 11 U.S. cities.

According to FIFA, the introduction of body cameras will offer fans an unprecedented perspective on the action, capturing the game from the referee's point of view. The body cam has been used very few times in football, but it has always been appreciated by the fans for its unique point of view.

Additionally, a stricter rule will penalise goalkeepers who hold onto the ball for more than eight seconds—opposing teams will now be awarded a corner kick instead of an indirect free kick.

""This is a great opportunity to give viewers a new experience, with footage from angles that have never been available before,"" said Pierluigi Collina, chairman of the FIFA Referees Committee. ""It also serves a valuable purpose in referee development, as being able to see exactly what a referee sees is crucial during training and debriefings.""

Collina also emphasised the historic nature of the appointments, noting that the tournament marks a significant milestone as the first edition of the Club World Cup in its expanded format.

""The referees selected have the unique privilege of being part of this first-ever edition. I'm sure they're all excited,"" he said. ""We've seen high standards of officiating in recent FIFA tournaments, so expectations are higher than ever. Maintaining that level is a challenge, but 'Team One' is working hard to contribute to the success of this groundbreaking competition.""Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: May 2, 2025Trending Reel

Filed under:

Bayern Munich's summer will look a lot different this year...

Bayern Munich supervisory board member Karl-Heinz Rummenigge is ecstatic to see the old format of the Club World Cup replaced with the new style tournament. 

“The old format had become a bit boring. You went there as a [UEFA] Champions League winner, and you knew that under normal circumstances you'd have one more trophy on board on the return flight. That's going to change radically now. The Club World Cup is a really difficult tournament with 32 teams. And the quality of the pitch—with twelve top European teams alone—will be challenging,” Rummenigge told Sport1's Stefan Kumberger (as captured by @iMiaSanMia). “It's a miracle what happened at FIFA. They abandoned a competition called the Confederations Cup in favor of a club competition. 

“That's never happened before – neither at UEFA nor at FIFA. We have to thank FIFA President Gianni Infantino for being willing to do that. I'm also sure this format is interesting. It will be a very interesting tournament for all of us.”

Rummenigge thinks it will be extremely important for his squad to be motivated for the competition, despite it coming after a long and arduous campaign. 

“I think it's important to fly there motivated to win this tournament. If there's such a tournament, and especially the first one in the USA, where the World Cup will also be held in 2026, it's an honor to participate. Secondly, I think you have to be motivated to go as far as possible. And ideally, you'll then be able to lift this beautiful trophy,” Rummenigge said. “I simply believe that when you're playing in a tournament, you have to approach it seriously and try to win. Whether you succeed at the end of the day is another question. After all, there are great teams competing – not just from Europe, but also from South and North America. They may have a home advantage, but as FC Bayern, you have to try.”

Real Madrid's next competitive goal, aside from the renewed fight for the LaLiga leadership, is the Club World Cup. This newly branded competition organized by FIFA this summer is seen as the great solution for a much more disappointing 24/25 season than initially desired by the white supporters.

In the context of this tournament, which brings together the best clubs on the planet, a transfer offer has been recorded that could reunite Real Madrid with a recent legend. According to information handled by the Saudi media '365Scores', Cristiano Ronaldo could change teams in the coming weeks to attend this tournament held in the United States.

From Saudi Arabia, they report that Cristiano Ronaldo would be in the sights of Al-Hilal, a team participating in the Club World Cup and set to face Real Madrid. ""An Al-Hilal official asked the recruitment committee to allow Ronaldo, the captain of the Al-Nassr team, to participate with them in the 2025 Club World Cup,"" states '365Scores'.

Those approaches to Cristiano Ronaldo, however, would not have come to fruition. Al-Hilal's attempts to secure the signing of the now captain of Al-Nassr, one of their most important players, have failed according to information published by 'Fichajes.com'.

So much so that ""The Portuguese player doesn't want to wear another jersey in Saudi Arabia"" even though his contract with Al-Nassr is nearing its end... without the possibility of extending said link with the Faris Najd on the horizon for the coming seasons.

With Cristiano Ronaldo's rejection of Al-Hilal's advances, the possibility of the former '7' white and Real Madrid crossing paths again is eliminated. That reunion, moreover, would have occurred in the first match of the Club World Cup for both teams, a match on June 18, 2025.

The end of Cristiano Ronaldo's soccer career is framed in a record of great prestige: he could be the first player to officially reach 1,000 goals. One of the important competitions to achieve this figure was the Asian Champions League, a tournament from which Al-Nassr was recently eliminated in their semifinal clash against Kawasaki.

That competitive setback could influence the decision Cristiano Ronaldo makes about his short-term competitive future. For now, he has rejected the opportunity to reunite with Real Madrid in the 2025 Club World Cup.

The FA's latest annual report contains a warning that new global competitions such as Fifa's Club World Cup risk devaluing the FA Cup — and that player fatigue could affect the performance of Thomas Tuchel's England team. 

Under a section headed “principal risks and uncertainties”, the annual report says the growing fixture congestion could have financial implications for the governing body.

It states: “The ongoing discussions regarding future structural changes to the game, such as the introduction of new tournaments (eg Fifa Club World Cup), further intensify this challenge. These changes have the potential to significantly reduce the downtime available to elite players, affecting their recovery and overall wellbeing.

“The introduction of more global competitions risks devaluing traditional domestic tournaments, such as the FA Cup, and may affect the performance of our national teams due to increased player fatigue and reduced time for international squad training. These factors could have financial implications for us.”

Fifa's new club competition takes place in the United States this summer, with Manchester City and Chelsea taking part. If City win the FA Cup they are due to play in the FA Community Shield less than four weeks after the final of the Club World Cup — they have already had an appeal to delay the start of their Premier League season rejected.

The MCC chairman, Mark Nicholas, appears to be tying himself in knots over the future of the Eton v Harrow match at Lord's, with the latest fixture between the public schools taking place on Thursday, 220 years after the first one there.

Nicholas said in 2023 he thought it was time for the game to be played elsewhere and that his three Old Etonian stepsons agreed. 

However, Nicholas has now told MCC's “historic fixtures” group he is “not in the business of culling fixtures”, that the members would ultimately decide their future and that his stepsons may have changed their view.

He told The Times this week: “We remain in contact with both schools. My stepsons' views have not changed.”

Documents in the British court case involving John Textor, the Crystal Palace co-owner who is being sued by Bruno Lage, the Portuguese manager who was head coach of his Brazilian club, Botafogo, make interesting reading.

Lage is claiming he had a contract to coach at Palace or Textor's French club, Lyon, for the 2024-25 season, with $3.6million (about £2.7million) to be paid to him and his technical staff.

Textor's submission to the court admits he signed the “alleged contract” in July 2023 but claims it is an “unenforceable agreement in law” and was merely an opportunity for Lage to negotiate to be the Palace or Lyon manager.

The Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, appears to have taken a social media aide to accompany and film him at the Pope's funeral in Rome this week.

A video montage on his Instagram account, lasting a minute and a half, shows a dark-suited Infantino in multiple shots greeting the good and the great who also went to the Vatican.

Newcastle United have taken legal steps to ensure that fans can access St James' Park via a small strip of land just outside the East Stand that is not owned by the club.

A company called St James Terrace Land, whose sole director, Robert Kalbraier, also runs a property firm, bought the land in April last year for £180,000 and since then a large metal container and a wooden fence have appeared and then been removed from the site.

The club have now launched a case in the civil courts aiming to secure a ruling that either fans are given private access across the strip of land or there is access for the general public — the action is not related to stadium development.

Sky Sports News is planning to have fewer staff presenters, with more working as freelancers, and a number of redundancies are likely — including some well-known faces — after a consultation process.

Its news team is also set to be restructured, with reporters told they will need to provide more “original newsgathering”. Sky Sports News insists the move is not to save money but rather to deliver the news more quickly and be more creative.

Soccer in the United States might not find a greater moment than right now, in the middle of a three-year stretch when the U.S. hosted Copa America last year, the FIFA Club World Cup this year and the 2026 World Cup next — with the final taking place at MetLife Stadium.

As the sport continues to make inroads in the United States, American soccer great Landon Donovan told The Post on Thursday that he could feel the excitement building and the interest growing by leaps and bounds. 

Donovan had been in New York for a media brunch promoting the upcoming Club World Cup that's set to take place across 12 venues in the U.S. beginning June 14 in Miami.

“I can feel it anecdotally, and then I can feel it just in the attention around [the sport],” Donovan said.

The expanded Club World Cup will bring the top teams from across the globe together for a best-on-best tournament, which will include Inter Miami and the Seattle Sounders from the MLS.

But the biggest facilitator will be the World Cup taking place next year and how far the U.S. Men's National Team can go in the global tournament. The men have advanced past the Round of 16 just once — the 2002 World Cup, when they reached the quarterfinals — dating back to 1990, when they qualified for the first time following a stretch of nine tournaments in which they failed to qualify.

“We could spend 10 years growing the sport organically … but one iconic moment next summer takes it exponentially higher,” Donovan said about any momentum for soccer in the U.S. “There's nothing that can replicate that, and that's part of the reason why I'm so passionate about when our national team doesn't play well or doesn't play proud. That's why it bothers me, because the opportunity, literally, the sky's the limit. I mean literally, for these guys.”

Donovan, who played in three World Cups for the United States and was named by The Guardian as the greatest male U.S. soccer player of all time in 2015, explained that the biggest thing for the United States to be successful in 2026 is playing with “pride.”

Though the major focus is on 2026, Donovan is excited for Americans to get a taste of the Club World Cup this summer. MetLife Stadium will host matches, including the championship game.

The American soccer great believes, similar to March Madness, that fans would fall in love with teams they'd never been exposed to until now.

“I've just learned with fandom, like there's no one reason someone becomes a fan,” Donovan said. “Sometimes it's a moment. Sometimes it's a fan. Sometimes you go to watch another team, and then all of a sudden, that team catches your eye.”

Among the notable teams in the Club World Cup are Manchester City, Chelsea, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, along with Saudi giant Al Hilal.

Filed under:

Will the former Bayern Munich coach jump to a club after the next Men's World Cup?

Germany men's national team coach Julian Nagelsmann recently extended his contract past the 2026 World Cup and through EURO 2028 — but the former Bayern Munich man will reportedly have an out, if a club wants to take it.

From Sky Sport DE journalist Florian Plettenberg, as captured by @iMiaSanMia:

Julian Nagelsmann (contract until 2028) has a release clause worth €7-8.5m in his DFB contract. The clause is valid for summer 2027. Nagelsmann will certainly lead the national team at next year's World Cup. But a return to club football before Euro 2028 is a possibility should a club activate the release clause [@Plettigoal]

This is an intriguing possibility.

Nagelsmann's extension through 2028 always raised some eyebrows. Would the young coach really take such a long stay with a national team, after the intensity of a yet-undecided World Cup tournament? It is certainly conceivable, but the presence of a manageable release clause opens up options.

Should Germany rock in 2026 it would not be out of the question to see Nagelsmann have his pick of prized club gigs — 

Elsewhere, Hansi Flick is reported to be taking his FC Barcelona stay year-by-year...as shared by The Athletic's Barça reporter Pol Ballús. It's far out but could all the remontadas happen — Nagelsmann back to Bayern and Flick back to the German men's national team?

Hansi Flick in talks to sign a one-year contract extension at Barça.

▪️ Nothing will be signed or announced before the end of the season. Full focus on games remaining and potential trophies to win.
▪️ Flick has rejected to sign a longer extension. He prefers to go year by year.

Probably not as long as Vincent Kompany continues bossing it.

The United States mens' and women's national teams will soon be back in action, with Emma Hayes' side set to play two friendlies at the end of May, and Mauricio Pochettino's men prepped to start their Gold Cup run in June.

In this week's roundtable, FOX Sports soccer reporters Doug McIntyre and Laken Litman look ahead to the upcoming international windows and look back at the last week in American soccer.

1. Johnny Cardoso scored his fourth goal of the La Liga season last week. What are the chances that he starts in central midfield for the U.S. at this summer's Gold Cup? 

It's not impossible. While Cardoso has never really replicated the form he's shown with Real Betis for the national team, his standout performances in one of the world's best leagues continue. Also, few USMNT jobs should be safe after last month's losses to Panama and Canada. In the latter defeat, U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino pulled starting midfield trio Tyler Adams, Weston McKennie and Christian Pulisic — arguably his three most important players — off the field with 30 minutes remaining and the Americans down a goal. As for Musah, Poch has deployed him mostly as a winger or fullback, and the 22-year-old hasn't gotten off AC Milan's bench since manager Sérgio Conceição pulled him 22 minutes into a 2-2 tie with Fiorentina on April 5. If Pulisic moves back to his usual spot on the the wing with the U.S., it wouldn't shock me to see Cardoso, who has also been unlucky with injuries since Pochettino took over, finally get an extended look alongside Adams and McKennie. 

2. Brenden Aaronson didn't make the USMNT for the Nations League finals, but he just helped Leeds earn promotion back to the English Premier League. Will he make the World Cup squad next summer? 

I'd put money on it. It probably helped Aaronson and a few other regulars who just missed out not to be involved last month, given how poor the U.S. was over the two games. The 24-year-old runs and flights — two qualities that were sorely lacking in Los Angeles. The Philadelphia Union product is also a better player than he was when he last played in the Prem in 2022-23. He gained Bundesliga and Champions League experience last year while on loan to Germany' Union Berlin, and played 44 games (and scored nine goals) in England's second tier this term. He's also added some muscle to his frame, which should make him more physically prepared for the Premier League this time around. 

3. Pochettino recently watched Watford take on Burnley in the Championship, presumably to scout left back Caleb Wiley. Will Wiley make the Gold Cup cut? 

Keep in mind that Burnley, which was also promoted this weekend, also has an American in forward Luca Koleosho, although Koleosho would need to petition FIFA for a one-time switch of association from Italy in order to rep the U.S. I don't believe that has happened to date. 

As for Wiley, the Nations League games showed how thin the USMNT is at left back behind Antonee ""Jedi"" Robinson. With Kristoffer Lund apparently not in Pochettino's plans, right-footed Joe Scally filled in for Jedi against the Panamanians, while Columbus's Max Arfsten manned the left corner versus Canada. The 20-year-old Wiley, who is on loan from Chelsea until the end of the season, is at least as deserving of a look there along with fellow 2024 Olympian John Tolkin of Bundesliga side Holstein Kiel. 

4. The Women's Champions League final is set with Barcelona taking on Arsenal at Jose Alvalade Stadium in Lisbon, Portugal on May 24. Do the underdog Gunners have a chance to upset two-time defending champion Barça?

After a slow start to the season, Arsenal has been on a winning rampage. The Gunners have won 13 of their last 15 Women's Super League games and finished second in the table behind Chelsea. Over the weekend, they shocked eight-time UWCL winners Lyon, beating the French side 5-3 on aggregate. Lyon wasn't particularly dangerous in its attack, which was a surprise on its own given the talent the squad has, while Arsenal ended up winning the second leg match 4-1 with goals from Mariona Caldentay, Alessia Russo and Caitlin Foord.

Will that trio be enough vs. big bad Barca? Barcelona, which has won three of the last four Champions League titles, has a lethal attack that just gashed Chelsea 8-2 on aggregate. Arsenal's defense, which stars USWNT outside back Emily Fox, has a major challenge ahead as it will try to stop (or at least slow down) a squad that features stars like Aitana Bonmati, Salma Paralluelo, Alexia Putellas and Claudia Pina. Chelsea's defense, which includes USWNT center back Naomi Girma, had no response for those players.

Barcelona looks unstoppable right now – they're so strong on the ball and can finish in the final third. Arsenal will have to try and match that quality in order to pull off a major upset.

5. Trinity Rodman is out indefinitely as she works through pesky back issues, Mallory Swanson has not yet played for the Chicago Stars this season due to personal reasons, and Sophia Wilson is expecting her first child this year. Do Emma Hayes and the USWNT have anything to worry about given the ""Triple Espresso"" is unable to train with the team until further notice?

No. From a competitive standpoint, the USWNT will not play in a major tournament until the 2027 World Cup, leaving the star power trio plenty of time to take the time they need and return to the squad when they are ready. Of course Hayes would love to have a full strength roster for every camp and every friendly, but she's also focused on growing and developing the player pool so that when playmakers like the ""Triple Espresso"" are unavailable, there are plenty of choices to come in and fill the void.

Some players have already proven they can take on that role, including Alyssa Thompson, Catarina Macario and Ally Sentnor, all of whom were quite impressive during the most recent USWNT camps. Additionally, forward Mia Fishel recently returned to the pitch after a long layoff recovering from a torn ACL and scored a goal for Chelsea on April 23. She was invited to the USWNT's April camp as a training player, and will likely be called into the full squad later this month. Hayes is filling out the depth of her squad quite nicely despite not having some of her biggest stars.

6. The USWNT's next camp begins at the end of this month and includes matches against China and Jamaica. Are there any new players who could receive a call up?

The new faces here are actually familiar ones. Fishel should return to the fold now that she's building minutes with Chelsea and scored her first goal in more than a year. She was a training player during the April window, and given her relationship with Hayes (who briefly coached her at Chelsea before joining the USWNT), it would seem like a natural inclusion to this roster.

Croix Bethune also recently returned to the pitch following an injury. The Washington Spirit midfielder was named 2024 NWSL Rookie of the Year and won a gold medal at last summer's Paris Olympics. Then she sustained a freak knee injury while throwing out the first pitch at a Washington Nationals game. She had a setback that derailed her return, but last weekend Bethune played 10 minutes in the Spirit's 3-0 loss to Gotham. It would make sense if Hayes called her up as a training player later this month.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=fifa+world+cup","Preparing for World Cup 2026","https://njbmagazine.com/monthly-articles/preparing-for-world-cup-2026/","Fri, 02 May 2025 15:36:15 GMT","

According to Gov. Phil Murphy, the FIFA World Cup 2026, with eight of its 104 matches being played at MetLife Stadium, including the final on July 19, is a once-in-a-lifetime economic engine for the entire region, generating up to $3 billion, attracting more than 1 million visitors, and creating some 14,000 jobs. “The biggest match of the biggest sporting event in history will be played right here in New Jersey, while being viewed by billions of people across the globe,” Murphy said.

The big question is: “Are New Jersey businesses ready to capitalize on the dollars the games will generate from visitors?” Attendees will not only need restaurants and lodging for the amount of time they may stay in New Jersey – MetLife games will span from June 13 through July 19 – but they may want to fill the long game gaps by visiting the state's tourism and cultural attributes. The economic benefits may filter down to bars and restaurants in local towns with large ethnic populations that may decide to hold World Cup watch parties during game times. 

Additionally, South Jersey will benefit from World Cup matches being held in Philadelphia. Since games will also be held in Boston, dedicated soccer fans may travel on the Northeast Corridor rail line to see games in Philadelphia, the Meadowlands, and Boston. In short, New Jersey will be home base for many fans who have tickets for World Cup games along the Northeast. 

All the major players involved in making the World Cup a success are doing their best to help businesses, both large and small, make sure they take advantage of the opportunities the games will present.

For Alex Lasry, CEO of the FIFA World Cup 2026™ NY/NJ Host Committee, a quality fan experience equates to businesses being ready to accommodate visitors. “Every day, all I'm thinking about is the fan experience; making sure people are able to get to and from the stadium in a safe and secure way, while making sure they have things to do when they are not at the stadium,” Lasry says.

The NY/NJ Host Committee is working with chambers of commerce, businesses, and city and county officials to make sure everyone is prepared for what Lasry says will be billions of dollars in economic impact. “We will be revamping our website (nynjfwc26.com), and putting together a toolkit and developing guidelines to help local businesses and organizations,” he says, adding that communications between FIFA ( Fédération Internationale de Football Association), federal, state and local officials is one of the most important undertakings right now because “the size and scope of this is unlike anything we have ever seen. We've had the Super Bowl, we've had Taylor Swift … we've had anything and everything in MetLife Stadium, but none of that is comparable in size and scope to the World Cup.”

At press-time, businesses can access a 2026 World Cup Reference Guide at https://diversechambers.com/world-cup. The brainchild of the Statewide Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of New Jersey (SHCCNJ), the New Jersey Diverse Business Advisory Council (NJDBAC – of which NJBIA is a member), Evolvere Consulting, and Juegos.Juegos, the guide is designed for businesses, organizations, and individuals looking to draw attention, generate revenue, and engage with the local and global audiences that the World Cup brings.

At a glance, it offers business recommendations, ideas, and opportunities for a variety of industries; FIFA guidelines; World Cup key dates; tips for holding independent festivals; ideas for World Cup-related art endeavors; and more. 

Gus Penaranda, CEO of Evolvere Consulting and NJDBAC member, explains that the guide emerged from discussions between Luis De La Hoz, chairman of the SHCCNJ, Elisa Charters, co-founder of Latina Surge, and himself. “We realized we were repeatedly all talking about the same thing and thought: ‘Why don't we write it all down and create a booklet?” Penaranda recalls. 

In addition to a guide, a Juegos.Juegos social scheduling app has been developed. Spearheaded by Elisa Charters and students from the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), the app provides what Penaranda describes as “one-stop shopping” for World Cup events. Small businesses can make themselves known to users, towns can post events, and fans, in general, can connect. 

In March, at a World Cup 2026 –101 event at New Jersey City University, the NJDBAC introduced an online map of the entire state – scheduled to go live in January 2026 – that will present bullet-pointed businesses, restaurants, hotels, sports venues, soccer team training sites, tourism sites, museums, concert venues, etc. It is expected to be merged into the Juegos.Juegos app. Advertising on NJDBAC's online map will range from $995 to $3,495 and comes with a range of features including online video of individual businesses.

SHCCNJ's De La Hoz emphasizes that the focus of the chamber and NJDBAC is getting Main Street businesses to benefit from the World Cup without having to pay a licensing fee to FIFA. 

“FIFA is focused on the stadium and on the Fan Fest, but not every day will be a game day. People will be looking for other activities. They need food, entertainment, and shopping, etc. We want small businesses to get a piece of that action,” De La Hoz says.

Though the games are some 400 days away, he stresses that businesses should start preparing now rather than later. “It is never too early to be prepared. You can't try and get ready a week before. You may not have enough time or resources. The better prepared you are, the better you will be able to capitalize on the event,” he says.

On June 10, the SHCCNJ and Evolvere will hold a “Countdown to the World Cup” event inside the American Dream mall at the Meadowlands. Similar to last year's inaugural event at the same location, its mission is to educate small businesses and municipalities on how they can benefit from the matches. Penaranda expects between 600 to 1,000 people to attend.

At press-time, he says a Countdown is also being planned in Atlantic City for the South Jersey/Philadelphia market. May 20 is the recommended date. 

Closer to ground zero of where the World Cup matches will be played is the Meadowlands Chamber of Commerce, where President Jim Kirkos and his team are making sure the economic impact of the games “will be as large as it could be.” 

This means community awareness and making sure towns and businesses understand the nuances of the World Cup. “We'll conduct educational sessions, assist businesses on marketing, customer service, and even intellectual property law [concerning FIFA brand guidelines] and international protocols, etc. … We want everyone to put their best foot forward,” Kirkos says. 

The chamber worked diligently with area hotels in learning about and adhering to FIFA requirements. “There needed to be signed agreements for hotel room blocks and agreements on rates for FIFA staff, officials and teams … it was complex,” Kirkos explains. “We used our relationships with member hotels to help them understand the agreements. We hosted information sessions with the FIFA accommodations team to answer questions about the agreements so we could expedite the signing. Those agreements were included by the Host Committee in the bid submission as required by FIFA.”

Kirkos also understands that not all businesses will experience a windfall of economic activity. “Just because the games will be played at MetLife Stadium doesn't necessarily mean people will find a restaurant on Ridge Road in North Arlington (some three miles away). So, what do we have to do? … We have to create the ‘there, there,'” he says. 

The chamber is using destination marketing organization (DMO) funds to showcase the Meadowlands region. “With that money, we're creating videos about the region's assets, updating our website, and getting smarter about using artificial intelligence and key word searches,” Kirkos says. “Quite frankly, we are turning over stones trying to find every possible way to leverage the World Cup so that New Jersey benefits.”

Before the NY/NJ Host Committee came into being, it was Choose New Jersey, the state's leading non-profit business attraction organization, that led a cohort that included the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, the New Jersey Sports & Exposition Authority, big-time soccer aficionado Gov. Phil Murphy, New York counterparts and private stakeholders, in pitching MetLife stadium and the region to FIFA. That was back in September of 2021. In June 2022, MetLife stadium was selected as a host city. In February of 2024, the stadium was selected to host the finals.

“That was monumental because all we heard was that the finals were going to go to Dallas, and maybe we'd get seven games,” says Wesley Mathews, president and CEO of Choose New Jersey. 

Among the reasons why FIFA chose the New York/New Jersey region is because its media market is 10-times the size of the Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan area. Additionally, the vast number of businesses here was also enticing to FIFA from a fundraising standpoint. 

Mathews, who sits on the board of the NY/NJ Host Committee, says fundraising is important, with close to $200 million needed to be raised. “Whether it's selling suits or sponsorship packages or putting together an unbelievable Fan Fest in Liberty State Park or Central Park, there's a lot of day-to-day work happening,” he says. 

While a lot of the money being raised is going towards hosting the games, infrastructure and security, Mathews hopes money will go towards “building out soccer as a [major] sport in New Jersey.”

Overall, he says the No. 1 legacy of the games for him is the impact of showcasing New Jersey as a premier North American destination for sports, business, and tourism. 

“Delivering a successful World Cup, having people coming here for the first time and seeing our [tourism] gems and wanting to return, and inspiring the next generation of soccer fans and players … that's the legacy we want New Jersey to have,” Mathews concludes.

Los Blancos are expected to make a change in the dugout this summer, but the new manager won't have an easy time fitting the pieces together

Real Madrid could be in trouble. Things aren't going well at the Santiago Bernabeu at the moment, and there is a real fear that they could finish the 2024-25 campaign without a trophy. That would be an immense failure for a club that brought in Kylian Mbappe last summer.

But there is reason to believe that some of this had been coming. Madrid were carried hard by Jude Bellingham at the end of 2023, and buoyed by Vinicius Jr in early 2024. And, crucially, Toni Kroos was there throughout it all, his metronomic pinging of the ball keeping Los Blancos afloat. None of that matters now, of course. Madrid are bad at football. Changes have to be made.

The ensuing moves are already underway. Carlo Ancelotti is already reportedly on his way out, with the Brazil job potentially beckoning. In turn, it seems that Xabi Alonso - long linked with the job - will come in - and he will have a serious task on his hands. Not only will be face the immense scrutiny of expectant fans, he will also be handed an awkwardly-assembled squad, with tons of talent and glaring holes.

Although Alonso has proved himself as a shrewd tactician with Bayer Leverkusen, this is by no means an easy assignment in just his second senior job in professional management.

Jack Draper expressed his concern for something that is becoming a growing issue on the ATP Tour.

At times during the 2024 campaign, players such as Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek complained about how gruelling the schedule was.

There was little turnaround between some tournaments last season and the introduction of two-week Masters 1000 events has been divisive to say the least.

After making the Madrid Open semi-finals, the British number one has had his say on a topic that continues to be a big talking point.

Though Jack Draper is still one of the younger players on tour, he has gained several years of experience on the circuit.

He experienced when each Masters 1000 event was one week, before they were changed to two-week tournaments in 2024.

There have been different opinions about the two-week events, but Draper does not approve of these tournaments lasting longer and he thinks the ever hectic schedule with less time off than before is concerning for the players.

“I think the way that the tour is at the moment and these two week events, and less weeks to be at home and train,” Draper told reporters. “It just seems that you are on a constant rabbit wheel and there is no way off it. I think that is scary to think about as a player.

“I know we are earning good money and playing in front of great crowds and it's something I love to do, but it is mentally very taxing and something that I hope potentially the ATP and the tours come together at some point and clean it up a little bit, I suppose, to make it so there is some more space to train and work on our bodies.

“I think for me the big thing is the quality can suffer a little bit, there is a lot of top players who are in and out with their performances and it is purely because it is overplaying.”

Draper expressed his concern for the tough nature of the ATP Tour, and Carlos Alcaraz previously expressed the same point of view.

Ahead of the 2024 Laver Cup, he said: “Many believe that this is a good calendar, but others think there are too many mandatory tournaments and there will probably be years with even more. 

“In a way, they are killing us. Right now there are many players injured due to the calendar and other factors, but at some point, there will be players who will have to skip tournaments because they have to take care of their bodies, families, and other aspects of life besides tennis.”

But during her pre-Madrid Open press conference, Aryna Sabalenka spoke up in favour of the longer WTA 1000 events.

“I prefer two-week tournaments because having a day off between matches allows you to relax more, go out to dinner with your team, and explore the city,” Sabalenka said.

“Maybe in a few years I won't be so interested in that and prefer to spend more time at home, but right now, that's my mentality.”","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Jack Draper has said he can ""win any match"" after moving a step closer to his first career clay title by defeating Matteo Arnaldi in straight sets at the Madrid Open.

The British No 1 bageled his Italian counterpart in the opening set, and although Arnaldi showed a touch more fight and skill in the second, Draper claimed the crucial break in the fifth game on his way to an emphatic 6-0 6-4 win.

The victory, sealed in just 77 minutes, sets up a final-four clash with Lorenzo Musetti at 7pm on Friday, live on Sky Sports, after the Italian's 6-4 6-3 quarter-final victory over Gabriel Diallo.

""I know I can win any match and lose any match. I am fearful I could lose but that helps me compete the way I do,"" Draper said, speaking on Sky Sports.

""I feel stronger every time I play.

""The last couple of years coming onto the clay, I felt against these guys I'd always be the one on the back foot, I'd always be the one defending.""

The 23-year-old has also leapfrogged 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic into the No 5 spot in the ATP world rankings.

""The next part of my game was just getting strong, getting more capable physically to do the things I know I can do and bully these guys. My forehand is doing a lot of damage, and I want to keep it up,"" Draper added.

""I have been doing everything in all areas pretty well and am excited to keep on going. Hopefully, it keeps coming together.

""I am just well prepared. I work really hard every day and do all the right things off the court and on the court. When I go out to play, I have a feeling it is going to be ok because I have prepared so well.""

It also keeps Draper on course for a second Masters 1000 title of the year, after Indian Wells in March.

Coco Gauff stormed into the semi-finals of the Madrid Open, dropping only two games in a 6-1 6-1 dismantling of defending champion Iga Swiatek.

Gauff and Swiatek had met 14 times previously, with the head-to-head heavily in favour of the five-time Grand Slam champion Swiatek at 11 wins to three, with Gauff never having beaten the Pole on clay.

But Swiatek's frustration grew as Gauff stormed back from 0-1 down to win 11 games in a row and 12 of the last 13.

Swiatek looked rattled, her composure cracking as the match spiralled out of her reach and in a rare lapse of composure, she was hit with a code violation for an audible obscenity.

""I was aggressive and played with margin. Maybe it wasnt her best level,"" Gauff said.

The American will now face Aryna Sabalenka after the world No 1 beat Elina Svitolina 6-3 7-5 to reach her sixth WTA-level final in the first four months of the season.

 Casper Ruud repeatedly showed his class under pressure on Friday at the Mutua Madrid Open, where the Norwegian overcame Francisco Cerundolo 6-4, 7-5 to reach the final at the clay-court ATP Masters 1000. 

 The 14th-seeded Ruud received treatment on his rib from the physio after just three games, but went on to save 15 of 18 break points he faced overall against Cerundolo, according to Infosys ATP Stats. With his one-hour, 54-minute win in the Spanish capital, Ruud advanced to his third Masters 1000 championship match and simultaneously ensured he will on Monday return to the Top 10 of the PIF ATP Rankings after just two weeks away. 

FINAL BOUND 🎟️@CasperRuud98 is through to his third Masters 1000 final after a 6-4 7-5 win over Cerundolo!@MutuaMadridOpen | #MMOpen pic.twitter.com/WrmgdYxg5S

 “I wasn't sure I was going to be able to finish the match, honestly,” said Ruud. “I felt something in my rib during the warm up, just towards the end before going out [on court], and I felt it in nearly every shot, especially the serve. Luckily, I got some quick treatment on it. There's not too much you can do, you only have three minutes [with the physio]. So I will go and check it out more now. 

 “I got a couple of painkillers, which is not the ideal thing, but at the same time in a situation like this, you have to do that now and then. I was able to just play one game at a time really. It was easing and getting better as the match went on.” 

 Awaiting Ruud in Sunday's final in Madrid will be fifth seed Jack Draper or 10th seed Lorenzo Musetti. Should he lift the trophy, Ruud will become the first Norwegian to triumph at Masters 1000 level since the series was introduced in 1990. 

 

 Ruud entered Friday's clash on a two-match losing streak against Argentina's Cerundolo, including a straight-sets defeat on the hard courts of Miami in March. Yet after holding serve from 0/40 in the opening game and then receiving the treatment on his rib, the Norwegian clinched the first set with a decisive break of serve in the 10th game. 

 The second set was a topsy-turvy affair, with both players' struggles on serve contributing to five breaks overall. A key turning point came in the fifth game, when Ruud saved all seven break points he faced to earn a 3-2 lead. Although he was unable to repeat that escape two games later, the Norwegian won four of five games from 3-4 to ensure he reached the final without having dropped a set across his five matches in Madrid so far. 

 After improving to 4-5 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Cerundolo, Ruud is up five spots to No. 10 in the PIF ATP Live ATP Rankings. The 12-time ATP Tour champion, who also reached Masters 1000 finals in Miami in 2022 and Monte-Carlo in 2024, could return to as high as World No. 6 on Monday if he lifts the Madrid trophy.

Ahead of her beloved French Open, the former world No 1 has never looked so vulnerable on clay

It may have come as a shock to many. On Thursday afternoon, Iga Swiatek was crushed on the court by Coco Gauff, suffering an ignominious 6-1, 6-1 defeat in just over an hour, in the semi-finals of the WTA 1000 in Madrid.

Her last major setback on clay came in 2019, at the French Open against Simona Halep (6-1, 6-0). Yet that was a completely different era: the Pole was just 18 years old and had not won any of her four Paris titles.

It's rare to see Swiatek distraught on a court, let alone on clay, her favourite surface. She has won 10 of her 22 titles on it. Yet this year, ahead of the French Open, the former world No 1 has never looked so vulnerable on this surface. In fact, her last title on the circuit came at Roland-Garros last year. Given her current momentum – or lack of it – a fifth title in Paris seems a long way off.

“Tennis for me it's the most logical [on clay], and also you can be more creative in terms of the tactics and everything, so I really enjoy that,” Swiatek said before the beginning of the Madrid tournament.

“Yeah, I think when I feel like I can use this on a match court, for sure I am more relaxed. I just know my weapons, I know I always have a plan B in my defense, which sometimes is impossible, you know, on faster hard courts, for example. So I just use that and it gives me confidence for sure.”

Her tactical sense, which has been her strength on clay in recent years, seems to have disappeared in 2025. Against Gauff in the semi-finals, she admitted it herself: even her plan B didn't work, because nothing was going right in the Polish player's game.

Her current shortcomings had already been seen in the previous rounds, but the fact that she won dismissed some of those questions. For a set and a half, she didn't show much against Philippine Alexandra Eala, in the first round, who had knocked her out a few weeks earlier in Miami. Against Diana Shnaider in the last 16, she was also pushed around in the second set before coming through. She also dropped a surprising first set 6-0 to Madison Keys in the quarter-finals.

“I didn't play well even on these matches that I won,” she admitted after her loss to Gauff.

She had earlier reflected: “I didn't really move well, I wasn't ready to play back the shots with heaviness, and, yeah, with that kind of game like, yeah, it was pretty bad.”

Following the conclusion of Stuttgart and Madrid, Swiatek has yet to win a single title on clay before Roland-Garros. Leaving aside the 2020 season, played during the Covid-19 pandemic, Swiatek has never yet arrived in Paris without a title.

She still has the WTA 1000 in Rome, which she has already won on multiple occasions (2021, 2022, 2024), to reverse a worrying trend. Swiatek doesn't seem to be worried, however.

“I'm not a different player than I was like for past years in terms of my attitude or my emotions,” she said, and when pressed on her evident lack of enjoyment on court, she replied: “Well, I'm not going to smile if it's 6-1, 6-1.”

Perhaps Swiatek's salvation will lie in the return of her enjoyment of the game. That seems to have been severely lost in recent weeks.

The 2025 French Open is less than a month away, and Novak Djokovic and Daniil Medvedev already know what they will be wearing at the tournament. Djokovic and Medvedev's outfits for the year's second Grand Slam were revealed by their clothing sponsor, Lacoste.

Djokovic and Medvedev share the same apparel sponsor, Lacoste, for their official match kits. The Serbian has been the face of the company since 2017, when he left Japanese clothing manufacturer Uniqlo. In 2021, he signed a contract extension with Lacoste that will end this year.

Djokovic will be wearing the all-too-familiar red polo shirt that matches the surface he will be playing on. The outfit features a symbolic maroon print inspired by the lines on a tennis court. The design is pretty much the same as the outfit Djokovic wore at the Australian Open and in other ATP events in the first half of the season, except that the color scheme is different. Djokovic's footwear sponsor is ASICS, and the first pictures of his shoe for the French Open have not been revealed.

Medvedev also has his own collection with Lacoste and is fully clothed by them from head to toe. The Russian became a brand ambassador back in 2019, and his contract is set to expire next year. Medvedev's French Open outfit is completely different in style and color.

Medvedev will wear a white polo t-shirt that features a very strange pink border at the bottom. He opted for blue shorts. Medvedev will complement the look with a blue wristband, white socks, and black shoes.

The two outfits are currently on sale on Lacoste's online shop in the United Kingdom. Tennis fans will need to confirm availability in their respective countries where Lacoste operates.

Djokovic is a three-time champion at the French Open, winning his most recent title in 2023. Last year, he advanced to the quarterfinals but withdrew from the tournament to undergo knee surgery. He will arrive in Paris without sufficient match play following early exits in Monte Carlo and Madrid. He chose to withdraw from the Rome Masters.

Medvedev is a former quarterfinalist at the clay-court Grand Slam but has lost in the first round five times in his career.

Winning a Grand Slam is considered the highest achievement in tennis, but some players are never able to repeat their triumphs. However, that doesn't mean they are not part of history. Many “one-Slam wonders” include iconic names such as Gastón Gaudio and the beloved Jana Notvona. Meanwhile, others become legends of their country, such as Francesca Schiavone.

The Italian made headlines in 2010 when she became the first woman from her country to win a Grand Slam singles title. Known for her clay-court strength and rare one-handed backhand in the WTA Tour, she followed her French Open title with another final appearance in 2011.

Schiavone turned professional in 1998 and competed for over 20 seasons. She reached a career-high singles ranking of No. 4 in January 2011 and made 70 Grand Slam main draw appearances. Few players matched her durability or consistency across two decades on tour.

Schiavone's biggest achievement came at Roland Garros in 2010, where she defeated Samantha Stosur in the final to win the French Open. “I wanted to win Roland Garros and become top 10,” she later told The Sit Down podcast. “That was the goal in my heart.”

The win not only made her the first Italian to achieve a singles Grand Slam title, she also broke Jana Novona's record to become the oldest first time female Grand Slam champion in the Open Era three weeks before turning 30 years old.

She nearly defended her title in 2011 but lost the final to Li Na. Across her career, Schiavone compiled a 40–17 record at Roland Garros and reached the second week of the tournament seven times. Her clay-court record remains one of the strongest among her generation.

In 2011, she also played the longest recorded women's singles match at a Grand Slam, defeating Svetlana Kuznetsova 6–4, 1–6, 16–14 in 4 hours and 44 minutes at the Australian Open. “Was a fight over the limits, both of us,” she told The Sit Down. “The day after, I couldn't walk.”

Schiavone finished her career with eight WTA singles titles — including Roland Garros — and seven runner-up finishes. In doubles, she reached a career-high ranking of No. 8 and was a finalist at the 2008 French Open.

She was also a cornerstone of Italy's Fed Cup success. Representing her country, Schiavone helped secure three Fed Cup titles in 2006, 2009, and 2010. She holds the Italian record for most overall wins in the competition.

Her style stood out in an era of baseline power. With a one-handed backhand and creative point construction, she often succeeded against more physically dominant players. She retired with 614 match wins across singles and doubles.

Schiavone announced her retirement at the 2018 US Open, closing a 20-year professional career. “I tried to do something that for me is very important, to leave something in this sport,” she said at the time. Her next goal: coaching at the highest level.

In 2019, she revealed she had been diagnosed with cancer but had completed chemotherapy. “I fought a tough battle and now I am still breathing. I have won this fight,” she shared on social media. In a later interview with the WTA, she said, “I'm healthy now. What happened, happened. For now, I'm fantastic.”

After playing professionally, she started coaching and has worked with players like Caroline Wozniacki and Petra Martić. As of January 2025, she is coaching young Austrian player Lilli Tagger. “I want to be a good coach for the next generation,” she said in 2024 to The Sit Down podcast. “And to enjoy life, even if I'm always running.”

Schiavone's Grand Slam win may define her in headlines, but her full legacy includes national team glory, career longevity, and a determined return from illness… All built on the same resilience that once took her to the top.

Iga Swiatek and her team are planning to take drastic measures following her disappointing defeat to Coco Gauff. The pair met in Thursday's Madrid Open semi-final, where Gauff demolished the reigning champion 6-1 6-1 in a little over an hour.

It's been a tough season for Swiatek, who has not even reached a final, and confessed that she struggled to find her form throughout the fortnight in Madrid. The 23-year-old must now attempt to defend titles in Rome and Roland Garros and, afterwards, she could reportedly skip Wimbledon and the grass season altogether.

Following her one-sided defeat to Gauff on Thursday, in which she hit 28 unforced errors and won only two games, Swiatek admitted that she needed a break.

“For sure, I want to have some days off, especially because I didn't have [any] after Stuttgart. I'll for sure chill, but honestly, the coaches will do the schedule, so I'll see,” she said.

There were questions over whether Swiatek would turn up at the Italian Open next week to defend her crown. But, according to Przeglad Sportowy Onet, she will complete the rest of the clay season as usual before making some tough decisions about the grass.

The world No. 2 is set to take a few days off before heading to Rome for the upcoming WTA 1000 event. Afterwards, everything will ‘depend' on Swiatek's results at the Italian Open and French Open.

If she suffers more disappointing losses, the five-time Grand Slam champion may reportedly skip the entire grass season, including Wimbledon, to take an extended vacation before turning her attention to the US Open and North American hard-court swing.

Grass is Swiatek's weakest surface, and the 23-year-old has just 130 points to defend on it. In 2024, she did not play any regular tour events on the grass, only competing at Wimbledon, where she reached the third round.

It has also emerged that Swiatek's grandfather passed away ahead of the Madrid Open, and the world No. 2 flew home for his funeral.

Swiatek has not spoken publicly about her loss, but her team confirmed the news to Polish media outlets.

The Pole will return to action in Rome next week and benefits from a first-round bye as one of the top seeds, meaning she won't need to play her opening match until later in the week.

Swiatek thrives in the Foro Italico - she has won the tournament three times in five appearances.

The world No. 2 will then head to Paris as she bids to win the French Open for a fourth time in a row and the fifth overall. But, if things don't go to plan on the clay, fans may not get to see her at the All England Club this year.

Elina Svitolina has elevated her game in 2025, capturing some of her biggest results since returning to tennis after maternity leave.

The Ukrainian has already reached four tour-level quarterfinals this season, her equal-highest number in a single year since her return. After deep runs at the Australian Open and Indian Wells, she claimed her first title of the year in Rouen, before toppling world No. 10 Elena Rybakina on her way to the Madrid Open semifinals.

LISTEN: The latest episode of The Tennis

Before she fell to world No.1 Aryna Sabalenka, Svitolina was yet to drop a set for the 2025 clay-court season, gaining the attention of 2010 Roland Garros finalist Sam Stosur.

“To go through and win a title, a 250, and then now obviously beat Rybakina to be going through [in Madrid],” Stosur said on The Tennis, “these kinds of results are proving ‘I'm here, I'm still someone to be worried about'.”

Projected to return to the world's top 15 next week for the first time since her return, Svitolina is well and truly proving that she is again a consistent contender.

Acknowledging that Svitolina was once primarily known as more of a ‘counterpuncher', Stosur credits the Ukrainian's recent ascent to becoming a more assertive and complete player.

“We've seen Svitolina since her comeback be a little bit more aggressive as a player,” Stosur said.

“But that's really smart from Svitolina, and maybe it's advice from Gael [Monfils] and the people around her as well to say you can't come back exactly the same.”

With her ability to critically think and adapt her game, Svitolina has developed into an opponent who can both dictate play while also withholding pressure.

At 30 years of age, the former world No.3 still has ample time to replicate her pre-return feats like being a Grand Slam semifinalist, and thanks to her results so far this season, such heights appear within reach again.

Stosur believes Svitolina's mental fortitude is one of her greatest strengths, meaning she cannot be discounted late in a tournament.

“She's very physical when she does play, but she's another one where she needs to grind out four, five, six, eight shots, whatever it may be. She can also do that,"" Stosur observed.

“She's just tough – day in, day out.”



With her game sharper than ever and her belief growing with each victory, Svitolina is carrying great momentum through the European spring with big title chances on the horizon.

Heading into the WTA 1000 event in Rome next week, the two-time Italian Open champion will be optimistic about her chances to again contend at one of her most successful venues.

Like any world-class athlete, the competitor inside Casper Ruud is constantly looking for more. There's a special kind of mindset required to stay elite, one that pushes boundaries, makes hard sacrifices and asks questions that ultimately lead back to, ‘How can I get better?'For Ruud, he identified 2025 as the time to challenge himself in new ways on the court. During a phone interview just before Indian Wells, the former world No. 2 shared why.“This point in my career, I'm very happy with where I am. I'm privileged, but it's a bit scary to get to that point and feel like you're too comfortable in the situation you're living,” he said. “You still have to push, you still have to try to be better, and you still have to go for more because the others behind you are definitely doing that.”

Expanding further, Ruud explained, “I think that's a human mistake to find yourself in the comfort zone too often. So I try to bring that to my game and say that these are my good strengths, but I need to develop the areas where I'm not that comfortable yet, and to widen the circle of my level as a tennis player. If that circle keeps growing bigger in the areas where it isn't now, it's a good thing.”At the time, Ruud had come off a “surprise” final showing at the Dallas Open before a stomach bug prevented him from any hope of taking his 2024 Acapulco runner-up effort one step further. He went 2-2 at Indian Wells and Miami ahead of a stretch of the calendar that has been his bread and butter the past several seasons: the European clay-court swing.

Twelve months after advancing to the Monte Carlo final and winning his first ATP 500 trophy in Barcelona, Ruud went 3-2 in his return to those tour stops. It's human nature to go through periods where head and heart aren't on the same page. While Casper the tennis player was eager to test his boundaries, Casper the person wasn't in sync with that ambition.“I've been kind of feeling not great mentally this year,” Ruud revealed to press on Thursday.“It just came down to me feeling like I'm running in this hamster wheel and I'm never kind of getting anywhere, or you're just stuck in it and I needed to kind of jump out of it a little to review where I was going and how I was feeling.”The 26-year-old came to terms that life on the road had taken its toll. Recognizing he needed help, Ruud noted he now has an outlet to discuss what's going on.“I've seeked help, which has really worked for me,” he said.In having—and trusting—that resource, a more familiar-looking Casper has resurfaced at the Mutua Madrid Open.

Ruud has gone eight for eight in sets played en route to the semifinals. His past two victories over Taylor Fritz and Daniil Medvedev marked his first two Top 10 wins of the year, and should the No. 14 seed defeat Francisco Cerundolo on Friday, an immediate Top 10 return awaits Ruud next week.🖥️📱 Click here for live coverage on TennisChannel.com (estimated start time 10 a.m., Friday, May 2)“I'm happy to feel more joy and feel like I'm in a better place, I guess, and feel like I'm waking up every day with a smile on my face,” he said. “So I am happy that I was honest with myself and felt like I needed some help, and it's been paying off quite quickly.”

In learning about Ruud's mental health admission, it perhaps adds greater context to the classy move in line with his character made Thursday. After reigning Madrid women's champion Iga Swiatek fell to Coco Gauff, 6-1, 6-1, and thus extending her hunt for a first title since clinching a Roland Garros three-peat last June, the Norwegian expressed empathy and support for the Pole on his X account.“Hey @iga_swiatek keep your head up. Like millions of other people, I love watching you play. Not your day today, but you inspire so many and you'll be back stronger than ever!!” Ruud encouraged.

When Ruud and I spoke a couple months ago about the concept of backing up results, he wasn't focused on the burden of his 2024 clay-court output to come.“You can't really think about points, points, points all the time. You have to enjoy each match and take it one at a time as well,” he commented.For someone navigating an everlasting hamster wheel, that outlook hits differently today. As getting out of bed with a sense of purpose and a beaming disposition are the points on the board that decide how one can get better.

Ruud is one of the best clay-courters in the world, but Cerundolo has enjoyed this head-to-head.ByZachary CohenPublished May 02, 2025 copy_link

Published May 02, 2025

On Friday, May 2, Francisco Cerundolo and Casper Ruud will play for a spot in the final of the Mutua Madrid Open. This is a massive match for both players, as neither has won a 1000-level event. That definitely weighs a little more on Ruud, who is a three-time Grand Slam runner-up and has been a mainstay in the Top 10. But Cerundolo has also been knocking on the door of Masters glory, so he surely wants a taste of it.Only one's journey will continue, and I tend to think it'll be the Argentine.A little over a month ago, we saw Cerundolo earn a straightforward 6-4, 6-2 win over Ruud in Miami. Yet, clay is the the surface that has brought Ruud most of the big moments in his career. But Cerundolo is 5-3 in their eight meetings, and two of those wins have come on clay.

Cerundolo is also in better form. Only six players have won more matches than him in the last 52 weeks, and his consistency has been off the charts since the start of 2025. Cerundolo's best level has always been good enough for him to compete with the top players on tour, but his game would always come and go. Now, he is working himself deeper and deeper into big events. A lot of that has to do with him cutting down on some of the big mistakes he used to make in rallies, which normally came in the form of over-hitting balls. He's also serving a lot better in 2025, and his already-stellar returning has improved.Cerundolo also has one of the biggest forehands on tour, and he generates pace effortlessly from that side of the court. That's what's interesting in this matchup, as Ruud normally has a big advantage from that wing. That's not the case here. Cerundolo's backhand has also been much more reliable than Ruud's in Madrid, meaning the Argentine could have an edge on both wings.

Ace the day with racquets, bags, stylish apparel and pro-level accessories.

The only thing Ruud definitively does better than Cerundolo is serve. He's also a little better when it comes to point construction. But Ruud isn't perfect with the ball on his racquet, and Cerundolo will take advantage if the Norwegian gives him enough. Also, while Ruud is a natural on clay, so is Cerundolo. So, the advantage in movement that Ruud had over some of his previous opponents won't be there.If Ruud was playing a little better to start the 2025 season, I probably would have given him a better shot here. But Ruud stumbled into clay-court season, so I'm not quite ready to put a lot of trust in him. Maybe if this was a best-of-five match, Ruud would be able to outlast Cerundolo with his superior ability to figure opponents out and make adjustments. But in a best-of-three- sprint, I think Cerundolo will smack the ball around and give Ruud some trouble.Pick: Cerundolo ML (+100)

Aryna Sabalenka's near-perfect 2025 season continues as she extends her lead atop the WTA rankings with a third straight run to the Mutua Madrid Open final. Aside from a near-miss in the finals of the Australian Open and subsequent Middle East hangover, the top seed has been the most dominant force in the women's game since last summer, when she captured her third major title at the 2024 US Open.Standing between the world No. 1 and her second WTA 1000 title of the season is on-again, off-again rival Coco Gauff, who is in the midst of another undisputed upswing after an emphatic week at the Caja Magica. After a slow start in her opening round, the 2023 US Open champion has been on fire, culminating with a 6-1, 6-1 drubbing of defending champion Iga Swiatek.Gauff leads Sabalenka 5-4 in their head-to-head, splitting their two 2024 meetings in Wuhan and the WTA Finals—the American winning the latter last fall in Riyadh.“Obviously Aryna is world No. 1, so it would be cool to play her in the final and give myself that challenge,” Gauff said in her post-match press conference, hoping to become the third woman this season to beat both Gauff and Sabalenka in back-to-back matches.Sabalenka has been efficient throughout the week in Madrid, winning in straight sets in all but one of her matches, and raised her level when she had to against both Marta Kostyuk and Elina Svitolina in the last two rounds. In a match that will likely come down to the margins, Sabalenka's extra power should give her the edge in these high-altitude conditions.

With local initiatives for new and returning players, and support from around the country, National Tennis Month is the perfect vehicle to drive the sport for a lifetime.ByTENNIS.comPublished May 02, 2025 copy_link

This article comes from the May 2025 edition of Racquet Sports Industry. Click here to read the full issue.National Tennis Month started just four years ago as a way to offer tennis providers a natural—and national—platform to help grow the game in their communities, and to help highlight their businesses. That first month, May 2021, involved a lot of quick patchwork, but everything got up and running. And importantly, it was now on the calendar for the month of May for the future.In the last four years, the USTA and other industry companies and groups, including USTA sections, have continued to devote more support and resources to National Tennis Month. NTM gives every tennis provider—teaching pros/coaches, facilities, park & recs, CTAs, NJTLs, retailers, manufacturers and more—an annual platform in which to bring new players into local programs, inspire lapsed players to re-engage with the sport, and energize existing players to play more (and buy more).There's a good chance, too, that NTM played a major part in this past year's 8.3 percent participation increase to 25.7 million tennis players in the U.S., and to the increase in retention this sport has experienced.

An important focus for NTM hasalways been the local aspect ofpromoting the game.

An important focus for NTM has always been on the “local” aspect of promoting the game. For the most part, programming and events are left up to whatever local tennis providers decide is best for their own communities.Significantly, providers of all types can also tie their regular programming into National Tennis Month, benefitting locally from this nationwide promotion. USTA section and local staff and volunteers also have been leaning into NTM, running events, exhibitions and promotions in May. In fact, a number of sections offer grants for providers that run programs for NTM (check with your USTA section).As interest in NTM has grown over the years, the USTA is tracking progress through registering events on Serve Tennis, and through reporting on local or state National Tennis Month proclamations that have been issued. This reporting, while not mandatory, has helped to show how the sport has been growing from year to year, and helps to state the case for continued support for this important annual initiative.

Verstappen and Piquet first confirmed that they were expecting ahead of the 2024 season finale in Abu Dhabi, with the new addition becoming a younger sibling to Piquet's daughter, Penelope.

The baby's arrival means that Verstappen is now the second father on the Formula 1 grid alongside Nico Hulkenberg, who shares daughter Noemi Sky with wife Eglė Ruskyte.

Asked on media day in Miami if he had any words of advice for Verstappen as a new parent, the Kick Sauber driver responded: “I hope it's a good sleeper.

Russell, meanwhile, added: “I think we're all professionals, but this is a personal part of your life. I guess for anyone who's had a kid, it's a pretty special moment. So yeah, all the best to him. As Nico says, I think for many people it probably brings things to your life.

Charles Leclerc believes Ferrari still don't have the potential to fight McLaren or Red Bull, but the Monegasque isn't letting that alter his targets at this weekend's Miami Grand Prix.

Ferrari have made a relatively slow start to the 2025 season with Leclerc's run to third in Saudi Arabia the team's only podium in a Grand Prix to date this year. The Scuderia have found themselves unable to take the fight to pacesetters McLaren, currently sitting fourth in the Constructors' Standings behind Mercedes and Red Bull.

Ahead of the Miami Grand Prix, Leclerc admitted that it hasn't been the start to the season the team wished for but he feels steps have been taken in the right direction to bring the squad closer to the front of the grid.

“It's not been the first part of the season we wished we had, but it's the first part of the season we had – so now we need to focus on what's ahead and try to improve just like we have in the last three races,” said Leclerc.

Leclerc: Ferrari have made 'good steps in the right direction'

“I think we've done good steps in the right direction and now it's all about building on that and hopefully having the first victory as soon as possible. I don't feel we quite have the potential on paper to fight the McLaren, and the Red Bull on good days, yet but we've got to take the points that are available and then whenever we will have the car to fight for wins we've got to be there to win.

“Having said all that I still go into this weekend with one goal in mind, which is to win on Sunday and we will do our best.”

Managing tyres is expected to be a key factor given the track surface and high temperatures expected in Miami. Last year tyre management proved to be one of the Ferrari's strengths, although Leclerc feels McLaren will have the edge in all departments this weekend.

“Tyre management is a big thing here, especially with the heat and the tarmac – the way it's done. I hope so [that the car is good on its tyre like last year],” Leclerc added.

Leclerc feels Ferrari doesn't have the edge on tyre management compared to McLaren 

“Last year McLaren was really strong, this year they are even much faster than last year so I think it's going to be tough to beat them. But we'll see.

“Whenever it was very warm this year – whether it's Bahrain FP3, Jeddah FP3 – they seem to be on another planet. I don't think what we have in the car is enough to beat them but let's wait and see.”

Yuki Tsunoda has revealed where he is currently at in terms of adapting to the Red Bull RB21, with the Japanese driver admitting that the process “needs more time” despite being happy with the progress he has made so far.

Tsunoda made the step up to the Milton Keynes-based outfit at Round 3 in Japan, the team having opted to move him from Racing Bulls while sending Liam Lawson – who had initially earned promotion but struggled in the two opening rounds – back to the sister outfit in Tsunoda's place.

Since then the 24-year-old has scored his debut points for the squad with a P9 result in Bahrain, though faced a disappointing end to his weekend last time out in Saudi Arabia after retiring following a first-lap collision with Alpine's Pierre Gasly.

Asked ahead of the upcoming Miami Grand Prix about how confident he is now feeling in the car, Tsunoda cited Qualifying as an area for improvement as he responded: “It just needs more time, I guess, to get used to it fully. I'm happy with the progress so far.

“The confidence is quite there, but just when you push 100% on the limit in Qualifying, that's where you kind of face it for the first time, right? Because you don't push 100% until then.

“The starting point is always slightly below where I want to be or where I used to start with in FP1, so it takes a bit more time to build up on new tracks. In Qualifying, most of the time so far I experience new behaviour from the car and I'm not always able to cope with it. I wouldn't say the car is super difficult – it just needs more time to define where the limit is.”

F1 FANTASY: Strategist Selection – What's the best line-up for the Miami Grand Prix?

Going into further detail, Tsunoda explained the differences between driving the RB21 versus his previous car, the VCARB 02, a challenger that he was more accustomed to after racing for the Racing Bulls team across four full seasons.

“I'll say it's not complicated [to drive the Red Bull] in the sense of trying to drive around, but it's still not easy, for sure,” the Japanese racer said. “In VCARB the car was a bit more lenient and forgiving with any directions. The Red Bull has a sharper, narrower window where it performs.

“It's not easier than VCARB, but better than I thought initially when I jump into Red Bull. This is the first time after joining Formula 1 [that I'm in a different car]. For four years I drove the same car and knew how to set it up and where the limit was.

Tsunoda has now competed in three race weekends at the wheel of the Red Bull RB21

“Now, I just naturally didn't have to think about it before, but now, in terms of set-ups… The set-up I tried a couple of time in Suzuka that I thought would be good, just didn't work out – even when in the car, the balance felt good, the lap time didn't reflect it.

“So that needs to come from experience, and sometimes you just have to accept the difficulties of the car. Like, if it feels like a lot of understeer or oversteer, but lap time is good, probably stick to that direction. It's a different approach. I'm learning as much as possible.

“The team is helping a lot with those directions. I just have to get used to it. But the limit, I just still don't know yet exactly. Like in Q3 in Saudi, I pushed a bit more and had a massive snap, which I didn't expect. It will get there. I just try to keep my head down and slowly build up.

“Even with the general environment [within the team], me and my engineer – he's Scottish, so a mix of Scottish English and my Japanese English – it's a bit interesting. Those things just need more time to blend in.”

Tsunoda has cited Q3 of Qualifying as a ""priority area to work on""

With Red Bull's Helmut Marko recently suggesting that Tsunoda has further progress to make when it comes to performing in Q3 of Qualifying, the driver admitted that he “definitely” agreed with this.

“To be completely honest, the last few races, I wasn't able to put it all together in Q3,” Tsunoda reflected. “I built up more through Q1 and Q2, and Q3 is certainly more of a push. But if you push slightly more than the car can handle – even 2% more than what the car wants – it just reacts super differently to what I used to be used to.

“So far, I can't really predict it yet. That will come with experience in the Red Bull. Hopefully it'll naturally come. I definitely haven't been able to extract the performance in Q3. It's something I need to work on.

“If I can qualify higher, there's a better chance to score points. You can be more flexible with the team on strategy. So yeah, definitely a priority area to work on.”

She ""was a force of nature and human rights advocate whose music is woven into our culture.”  


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



Jill Sobule, the singer-songwriter behind “I Kissed a Girl,” the first openly gay track to break into the Billboard Top 20, has died. She was 66.


	Sobule died Thursday in a house fire while staying with friends in a Minneapolis suburb, her manager, John Porter, told The Hollywood Reporter. The friends “lost Jill, their house and their dogs,” he added.




	The Denver native broke into the music industry in 1990 with her debut album, Things Here Are Different. Five years later, she released Jill Sobule, which included her 1995 song “I Kissed a Girl,” which is regarded as the first openly LGBTQ+ track to land atop the Billboard Top 20. The album also featured “Supermodel,” which was notably featured in the Clueless soundtrack.

	A human rights activist, Sobule's music touched on difficult topics, including the death penalty, anorexia nervosa, shoplifting, reproduction and the MAGA movement. 


	“Jill Sobule was a force of nature and human rights advocate whose music is woven into our culture. I was having so much fun working with her,” Porter shared in a statement. “I lost a client and a friend today. I hope her music, memory and legacy continue to live on and inspire others.”


	Sobule was most recently working on her autobiographical musical F*ck 7th Grade. The show was a New York Times Critic's pick and nominated for a Drama Desk award. An original cast recording of F*ck 7th Grade is set for release June 6 alongside a 30th anniversary Jill Sobule vinyl with her hit tracks “I Kissed a Girl” and “Supermodel.” 


	“Jill wasn't just a client. She was family to us,” said Ken Hertz, Sobule's longtime attorney. “She showed up for every birth, every birthday and every holiday. She performed at our daughter's wedding, and I was her “tech” when she performed by Zoom from our living room (while living with us) during the pandemic.” 


	Sobule was scheduled to perform in her hometown of Denver at Swallow Hill Music's Tuft Theater on Friday night with her “Jill Sobule Presents: Songs From F*ck 7th Grade & More” show. Now, an informal memorial will be held to honor her legacy this summer. 


	Survivors include her brother and sister-in-law, James and Mary Ellen Sobule; her nephews, Ian, Matthew and Robert; and Robert's wife, Irina.

Like a fantasy sports league, the app Mogul will allow users to compete on box office results, per screen averages, sentiment score, awards and more. 


							By 

	Caitlin Huston


Business Writer


MoviePass is launching its own kind of fantasy sports league, but for film releases, box office results and more. 


	The company behind the subscription service is launching a fantasy gaming platform called Mogul in which users can compete in tournaments, head-to-head matchups and solo challenges in which they predict box office results, weigh in on per screen averages, sentiment scores and awards. 




	MoviePass is planning an international beta launch of the product Thursday. The company says that 400,000 users have joined the early-access waitlist.

	Like in fantasy sports, users will create their own league with teams and players. In this version, each user will have a studio and will select movies, actors and directors.

	“In the same way you're playing around outcomes of games, here you're also playing around outcomes of box office and performance,” Stacy Spikes, co-founder and CEO of MoviePass, said in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. 


	At launch, the product will be in play mode with an in-game currency, but where no real money is exchanged. The plan is to move it to a second phase, in which users will be able to pay for upgrades, and eventually to a third phase in which users can win money. The app is backed by Mysten Labs and Animoca Brands and built on the Sui blockchain. 


	Over time, Mogul is designed to integrate with the MoviePass app and the company is mulling eventually introducing a model in which users pay an entry fee to compete or pay a fee per transaction on the app. 


	The launch of Mogul comes as MoviePass seeks to compete with other movie subscription services, which are often tied into the theaters themselves and thus can give out perks such as free snacks or early access to films. 


	 “We think you can't just stand still, and you need to think, ‘How can I create engagement? How can I create stickiness? How can I create return value? And how can I give value add? Whether it's just to the subscription or to the whole ecosystem,” Spikes said. 


	Spikes, who co-founded MoviePass and launched the service in 2011. Helios and Matheson bought a majority stake in the company in 2017, and the service lowered its price to $9.95 a month, which gradually drove the company to bankruptcy. Spikes reacquired the company in 2021 and relaunched in 2022. 

	











	Since then, MoviePass says it has had two profitable years with its new business model, which assigns a certain number of credits based on the title and the time and date of the movie showing. Spikes said the company has also been integrating more theater partners to allow users to choose their own seats and get QR codes within the app. 


	The company raised a seed financing round in 2023, led by Animoca Brands, a game software, blockchain and venture capital company, and the company said it was pursuing a Web3 strategy, which included using artificial intelligence to help create better marketing opportunities for studios. In 2024, the company received funding from Comcast's Forecast Labs. 


	“We ended 2024 profitably. We ended 2023 profitably,” Spikes said. “But we want better growth metrics, and so we want additional ways to put things in the ecosystem to be able to help continue with that.”

The actress starred in the original series, which ran from 1993 to 2002, before it was revived for two more seasons in 2016.

Gillian Anderson is teasing whether she would return for Ryan Coogler‘s planned X-Files reboot.


	The actress who played Agent Dana Scully in the original series recently shared during an appearance on ITV1's This Morning that she spoke to the Sinners filmmaker.




	“I spoke to [Coogler], and what I said was, ‘If anyone were to do it, I think you are the perfect person, and best of luck,'” Anderson said, adding that she told Coogler, “Call me.”


	As to whether The Salt Path actress would genuinely consider returning for the reboot, Anderson kept her response vague, saying, “At some point, if the phone rings and it's good and it feels like the right time, perhaps.”

The X-Files followed two FBI Agents, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) the believer and Dana Scully the skeptic, as they investigate the strange and unexplained, while hidden forces work to impede their efforts. The Emmy-winning series initially ran for nine seasons from 1993 to 2002, before it was revived for a 10th season in 2016 and an 11th season in 2018.


	Coogler has been eyeing an X-Files reboot for years, with the show's creator, Chris Carter, saying in 2023 that the Black Panther: Wakanda Forever director is “going to remount The X-Files with a diverse cast.”


	More recently, Coogler said on The Last Podcast on the Left, “I've been excited about that for a long time, and I'm fired up to get back to it. Some of those episodes, if we do our jobs right, will be really fucking scary. We're gonna try to make something really great, bro, and really be something for the real X-Files fans, and maybe find some new ones.”

It's the latest move by the Trump administration to utilize federal powers to control or hamstring institutions whose actions or viewpoints he disagrees with.


							By 

	The Associated Press



	President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order aiming to slash public subsidies to PBS and NPR as he alleged “bias” in the broadcasters' reporting.


	The order instructs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and other federal agencies “to cease Federal funding for NPR and PBS” and further requires that they work to root out indirect sources of public financing for the news organizations. The White House, in a social media posting announcing the signing, said the outlets “receive millions from taxpayers to spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as ‘news.'”

	It's the latest move by Trump and his administration to utilize federal powers to control or hamstring institutions whose actions or viewpoints he disagrees with. Since taking office, Trump has ousted leaders, placed staff on administrative leave and cut off hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to artists, libraries, museums, theaters and others, through takeovers of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Trump has also pushed to withhold federal research and education funds from universities and punish law firms unless they agreed to eliminate diversity programs and other measures Trump has found objectionable.


	The broadcasters get roughly half a billion dollars in public money through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and have been preparing for the possibility of stiff cuts since Trump's election, as Republicans have long complained about them.


	Paula Kerger, PBS' CEO and president, said in a statement last month that the Trump administration's effort to rescind funding for public media would “disrupt the essential service PBS and local member stations provide to the American people.”


	“There's nothing more American than PBS, and our work is only possible because of the bipartisan support we have always received from Congress,” she said. “This public-private partnership allows us to help prepare millions of children for success in school and in life and also supports enriching and inspiring programs of the highest quality.”


	The Corporation for Public Broadcasting sued Trump earlier this week over his move to fire three members of its five-person board, contending that the president was exceeding his authority and that the move would deprive the board of a quorum needed to conduct business.

	











	Just two weeks ago, the White House said it would be asking Congress to rescind funding for the CPB as part of a $9.1 billion package of cuts. That package, however, which budget director Russell Vought said would likely be the first of several, has not yet been sent to Capitol Hill.


	The move against PBS and NPR comes as Trump's administration has been working to dismantle the U.S. Agency for Global Media, including Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, which were designed to model independent news-gathering globally in societies that restrict the press. Those efforts have faced pushback from federal courts, who have ruled in some cases that the Trump administration may have overstepped its authority in holding back funds appropriated to the outlets by Congress.

""I think it's just the purest and we are so happy to have LISA on it,"" frontman Adam Levine said in a statement.

	Jessica Lynch



	Maroon 5 has returned with a major pop crossover moment. On Friday (May 2), the Adam Levine-fronted band unveiled their new single “PRICELESS” featuring BLACKPINK's LISA, released via 222/Interscope Records.

	The track marks Maroon 5's first-ever collaboration with a K-pop artist and offers a guitar-driven sound that nods to the group's early 2000s roots, paired with LISA's confident rap feature. The accompanying music video, shot on 35mm film and directed by Aerin Moreno, draws inspiration from Mr. & Mrs. Smith.

	“It's just a guitar-based song which we haven't really done in so long. It happened first for us while we were recording the album. I think it's just the purest and we are so happy to have LISA on it,” frontman Adam Levine said in a statement.

	He added, “The guitar intro is literally me playing into an audio message on my iPhone with an unplugged guitar. I actually got a little emotional recording ‘cause it was sort of reconnecting to our roots, which a lot of our fans have been saying ‘hey we want to hear that sound again.' It's been like over 20 years so I think it's time for that to return.”


	Teasers of the track, which Maroon 5 previewed on Instagram in late April, included Levine's falsetto vocals alongside a rap verse from LISA: “Yeah, talk is cheap boy stop it/ Got my love that's a real big profit.”


	In the days leading up to the confirmation of “Priceless,” Maroon 5 also teased the collab by posting an Instagram photo from behind of the lead singer and a mystery woman standing side by side, gazing out of a floor-to-ceiling window at a cityscapeLISA's IG Story also featured a clip with audio, showing the K-pop star lying back while seemingly filming a music video.


	The single also serves as the first preview of Maroon 5's upcoming 2025 album, which the band first teased during Levine's recent appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon (April 8).


	“PRICELESS” follows Maroon 5's 2021 album Jordi, which peaked at No. 8 on the Billboard 200. For LISA, the track adds to her growing list of international collaborations as a solo artist, following the success of her 2021 debut single “LALISA” and her ongoing work with BLACKPINK.

""I see what he did there,"" she wrote on Thursday.

	Seems like Mary J. Blige has given Travis Scott‘s new snippet from Jackboys 2 — which mentions her — her stamp of approval. 


	In the two-and-a-half-minute, Harmony Korine-directed trailer that Scott posted on his socials Wednesday night, he raps, “I blige bumping Mary.”


	“I see what he did there,” the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul wrote on X with laughing and smiling emojis.


	Scott has been steadily teasing the Jackboys 2 compilation project over the last month, hinting that he could drop it on his 34th birthday on Wednesday (which didn't happen). The Cactus Jack boss linked up with his signee Sheck Wes on “ILMB” last month, but it hasn't been confirmed if the single will appear on the upcoming album. He also previewed a pair of unreleased songs during his headlining Coachella set (Goldenvoice was fined $20,000 by the City of Indio because he went three minutes past the 1 a.m. curfew).


	Scott updated his online store with a digital Jackboys 2 pre-order, CDs with alternative covers, vinyl and various box sets.


	The first Jackboys compilation album was released in December 2019, featuring the label's stars Wes and Don Toliver as well as collaborations with Rosalía and Lil Baby on the remix of his Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hit “Highest in the Room,” Quavo and Offset on “Had Enough,” Young Thug on “Out West,” and the late Pop Smoke on “Gatti.” Jackboys debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 at the top of 2020 and also topped Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums.

Dove Cameron is back with “French Girls,” an espresso shot of electro-pop that finds her continuing to explore moody, campy dance-pop that won't quit.


	“There's a huge intersection between pain, heartbreak, joy and camp and levity. And that's where we found ourselves in ‘French Girls,'” Cameron tells Billboard. “The melodrama of being a muse for a sculptor or a painter. There's something so painfully romantic and also constricting about that. In ‘French Girls,' the thing that I was really obsessed with was this self-sacrificing mania about being a muse that is not healthy.”

	











	Aside from the song being inspired by her love for Paris and Parisian museums, she confirms that the chorus is a reference to Titanic, specifically the scene where Rose asks Jack to sketch her. And yes, she knows she's technically misquoting the movie. “The public remembers it differently than what it was: in the movie, it's ‘draw me like one of your French girls.' But ‘draw me' just didn't sing as well as ‘paint me'.” Given that a lot of people “collectively remember it” as “paint me like one of your French girls” anyway, she took the creative license to tweak the line for her song.

	“I'm definitely not talking entirely about myself,” she explains of the song. “I'm talking about all of the women in the industry that are considered these great, larger-than-life personalities, these Helen of Troy people that we remember in history as these icons of beauty and art who can also be the most tragic figures. In ‘French Girls,' it was just that (question of), ‘How far do we go to sacrifice ourselves for our art and for our love of what we do and for the people who love what we do?' Are we interconnected? What is this amalgamation of things that we're creating together as the audience and the person on the stage?”


	Speaking of the stage, it was just announced that Dove Cameron will serve as the opening act on several dates of Dua Lipa's Radical Optimism Tour in the U.K. and Ireland. You can find those dates below.


	June 20, 2025 – Wembley Stadium – London, EnglandJune 21, 2025 – Wembley Stadium – London, EnglandJune 24, 2025 – Anfield Stadium – Liverpool, UKJune 25, 2025 – Anfield Stadium – Liverpool, UKJune 27, 2025 – Aviva Stadium – Dublin, Ireland

					By Nellie Andreeva 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


	The most closely watched Little House On The Prairie casting search is over: 10-years-old Alice Halsey (Lessons in Chemistry, Days of Our Lives) has landed the role of Laura Ingalls in the Netflix reboot from showrunner Rebecca Sonnenshine and CBS Studios. 


	Halsey is the first cast member confirmed for the new series, described as part hopeful family drama, part epic survival tale, and part origin story of the American West. Casting Laura is considered key: she is the protagonist of the show as it is based on Laura Ingalls Wilder's semi-autobiographical novels and tells the story of the struggles and triumphs faced by those who shaped the frontier through her eyes.

	In the 1974 TV series, Laura was played by Melissa Gilbert who recently welcomed the new take on the classic books.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Per the official character description, Laura (Halsey) is a disruptor. Honest to a fault. Questions authority. She's our window into this adventure. An American icon in waiting. Forget your modern ideas of childhood — the stakes are high for children living in the 19th century. They have responsibilities — and freedoms — that seem extraordinary in this era of helicopter parenting. Mixed in with small pleasures and petty disputes with her older sister are true feats of survival and bravery. She is observant, tender, strong-willed, hot-tempered. She resists the bounds of 19th-century ladylike behavior — she likes to run barefoot and feel the sun on her face. She is curious and optimistic and fearless, like her father; resourceful and hardworking and honest, like her mother. She is quick to call out anyone who is cruel or unjust. She loves fiercely and unapologetically and is utterly devoted to her dog, Jack. She rubs some adults the wrong way — too many hard questions, too much personality, too much energy — but to the people who matter, she's a bright light. She absorbs every detail she sees around her, collecting them for stories she will someday share with the world. 


	Sonnenshine executive produces alongside Joy Gorman Wettels for Joy Coalition, Trip Friendly for Friendly Family Productions, Dana Fox and Susanna Fogel. Sarah Adina Smith will direct the first episode. She was a director and executive producer on the first two episodes of Apple TV+'s Lessons In Chemistry, which didn't feature Halsey. CBS Studios produces with Anonymous Content Studio

	











	Since its original publication in the 1930s, the Little House novels have sold over 73 million copies in more than 100 countries, translated into at least 27 languages. Their 1974 TV series adaptation has found new audience on streaming with 13.25 billion minutes viewed on Peacock in 2024.


	Halsey launched her acting career at the age of 7, playing Madeline Zott, the hyper intelligent — and wise — daughter of Elizabeth Zott (Brie Larson) in Apple TV+ praised limited series Lessons In Chemistry. She can be seen on Peacock's Days Of Our Lives as Rachel Black and heard as part of the main cast of Disney Jr.'s animated television series Kindergarten: The Musical, voicing twin sisters Kat and Ellie. Halsey also recently guest starred on the NBC comedy series Night Court.


	In a recent behind-the-scenes DoOL video. Halsey reveals that she first auditioned for a commercial when she was 3 but didn't get the part. After a break, she started acting again when she was 5-6 and soon booked Lessons In Chemistry.

Executive Editor, International & Strategy


EXCLUSIVE: Will Poulter (Midsommar), Kit Connor (Heartstopper) and Manu Ríos (Elite) are set to lead buzzy horror Rapture, which HanWay Films will be launching for the Cannes market.


	It's an intriguing premise. Set in Medieval England in the year 1348, the story alights on Lansley Abbey, a remote stone monastery in Yorkshire, which houses ten monks bound by a life of strict routine and devotion. Their fragile peace is disrupted by the arrival of a messenger – a man with haunting news from the outside world who rapidly shows symptoms of a mystery illness. A virulent plague is spreading through the land: marked initially by a hemorrhagic fever, it turns its victims into “revenants” — restless, undead beings. As the contagion closes in, Lansley Abbey becomes a battleground: desperate outsiders beg for refuge while the infected threaten to overrun its walls. The monks are torn apart by a moral rift — between those who believe they must care for the sick and those who want to protect the centuries of knowledge safe-guarded by the monastery. As death is fully unleashed, so too is the brothers' capacity for extraordinary acts of altruism and ruthless betrayal, forcing them to confront the ultimate question: what does it mean to be human?

Producers are Elevation Pictures (Infinity Pool), 2AM (Past Lives) and Brookstreet Pictures (The Brutalist). Eli Arenson (Lamb) is attached as director of photography.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Poulter and Connor reunite after recently starring in Alex Garland's Warfare. Spanish actor and singer Ríos also appeared in Pedro Almodovar's Strange Way Of Life.


	Gabrielle Stewart, CEO HanWay Films, said: “We have all been blown away by the vision Jordan has for Rapture. It is rare to have such an atmospheric and terrifying zombie horror film that inhabits such an authentic historical world, with complex characters grappling with the biggest moral dilemmas. It is no wonder he has already attracted such great casting in Will, Kit and Manu with more to come, backed by top tier producers.”


	Tannahill's plays include Late Company and Botticelli in the Fire. His novel The Listeners was shortlisted for the Giller Prize, and in 2024 was adapted into a limited series for the BBC.

	











	Tannahill is represented by CAA, Casarotto and Jackoway Austen. Will Poulter is represented by WME, Hamilton Hodell and Sloane Offer. Kit Connor is represented by Independent Talent, WME and Hansen, Jacobson. Manu Rios is represented by WME.

					By Dade Hayes 

Business Editor


Fubo CEO David Gandler says the company is sticking with its plan to launch a sports-focused pay-TV bundle in time for football season.


	Speaking to Wall Street analysts on Fubo's first-quarter earnings call Friday, Gandler addressed the sports bundle, which has long been prized by sports fans seeking a pure-play option to watch games.


	“We are working hard to secure content from non-Disney programmers for the new service,” Gandler said. “It is critical for Fubo subscribers that we are able to negotiate content licensing agreements at fair rates and terms. Our goal remains to launch the service for the fall sports season.”

	That concept may sound familiar. The joint venture Venu Sports, which was backed by Disney, Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery, pursued the same goal in 2024. The JV ended up shuttering before launch after Fubo successfully sued the media companies on antitrust grounds. As part of its settlement of the lawsuit, Disney agreed to acquire majority control of Fubo and combine it with Hulu + Live TV, though the deal is not expected to close until 2026.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Disney-owned ESPN, meanwhile, is also proceeding with a major streaming launch of its own timed for the start of college and NFL football: the long-in-the-works, stand-alone ESPN service.


	Asked by one analyst about progress on securing carriage with a range of networks for the sports service, Gandler didn't offer any specific updates but described the service as a key “growth opportunity” for Fubo.


	The nature of the sports TV landscape is such that Venu Sports was never likely to be a dominant player, especially because it was missing two key rights holders in NBCUniversal and Paramount Global. While those companies have carriage deals with Fubo, participating in a sports-focused bundle could be a non-starter, especially for NBCU given how crucial sports is as a driver of Peacock subscriptions and advertising.


	The quarterly report was generally downbeat. Total subscribers slipped 3% to 1.47 million, though the number came in slightly ahead of internal forecasts. Revenue of $407.9 million exceeded Wall Street analysts' consensus estimate, but an adjusted loss per share of 2 cents compared unfavorably to analysts' forecast of a break-even quarter. 


	Advertising slid 17% to $22.9M, with the company citing a carriage impasse with TelevisaUnivision, which resulted in its networks going dark on Fubo during the quarter. With those networks on the air, execs said ad revenue would have grown in the period.

	











	Shares in Fubo, which got a huge boost in January on the Disney and legal news, fell 12% in early trading on the quarterly numbers.

Executive Editor, International & Strategy


EXCLUSIVE: Luke Wilson (Legally Blonde) and Heather Graham (Boogie Nights) are aboard for comedy romance Getting Rid of Matthew, adapted by writer-director Hernán Jiménez (Love Hard) from Jane Fallon's novel. Emma Roberts (Holidate) is in talks to join the project.


	Alloy Entertainment (Purple Hearts) have developed the script and are producing. Architect have launched worldwide sales ahead of Cannes. Pic is due to shoot in October 2025, in Toronto, Canada.


	Roberts would star as Helen, “a young woman who follows her heart: it's led her to the bright lights of New York and to her dream job. And now it leads to Matthew (Luke Wilson): her brilliant, charismatic, impossibly confident boss. But Matthew's also married: to the long-suffering Sophie (Heather Graham), and so the ensuing affair must remain a secret.

	“Helen thinks confronting Matthew will solve the problem, but when he turns up at her doorstep – dishevelled, crying, and with all his worldly possessions – having dumped Sophie, Helen realises she's stuck living with a middle-aged baby, a self-obsessed man with arrested development who's spectacularly falling into a mid-life crisis, and who has a hell of a lot of bad habits.”

	Costa Rican filmmaker Hernán Jiménez adapted the script and will direct. The film follows his Netflix romcom Love Hard, starring Nina Dobrev. Jiménez's credits include the screenplay for Amazon's A Million Miles Away, starring Michael Pena. Leslie Morgenstein and Elysa Koplovitz Dutton will produce through Alloy Entertainment. 


	Former TV producer Fallon has written twelve novels, including her debut Getting Rid of Matthew which was published in 2007 and swiftly became a UK top 10 bestseller. It has since been translated into more than 20 languages.


	Architect's Calum Gray said: “Getting Rid of Matthew is a delicious, subversive and riotously funny comedy about the dangers of getting what you asked for. Anchored by three beloved comedy performers, the film will be an escapist Saturday night treat, and a repeat watch for modern global audiences.”


	Jiménez commented: “I read Jane's novel in a single-sitting – it has such a livewire energy to it, and she completely inhabits the chaotic, loveable and mischievous Helen. Audiences are going to fall in love with Emma in the role, and delight in her increasingly manic attempts to ditch Matthew!”

	











	Alloy has produced three films in a row for Netflix, including the Adam Sandler comedy You Are SO Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah, Sabrina Carpenter's Work It! and Sofia Carson's Purple Hearts, along with box office genre hit Tarot for Sony. On the TV side, Alloy has produced Netflix's You, starring Penn Badgley, both iterations of Gossip Girl, the Pretty Little Liars franchise and The Vampire Diaries, and its successful spinoffs The Originals and Legacies.

Executive Editor, International & Strategy


EXCLUSIVE: Oscar winner Angelina Jolie is set to star in the feature adaptation of hit Scandi novel Anxious People for A Man Called Otto and World War Z director Marc Forster.


	Based on A Man Called Ove author Fredrik Backman's novel, the film is being launched ahead of the Cannes market by Black Bear and Hope Studios with the former handling international sales and WME Independent handling domestic.


	The uplifting comedy, set on the day before Christmas Eve, sees investment banker Zara (Jolie) begrudgingly find herself mingling with a group of strangers at an open house. When a reluctant bank robber inadvertently takes the group hostage, chaos and oversharing ensues, secrets are revealed and literally nothing goes according to plan. The movie is described as being “about a crime that never took place, a would-be bank robber who disappears into thin air, and eight extremely anxious strangers who find they have more in common than they ever imagined…Through an ingeniously constructed story, Anxious People explores the enduring power of friendship, forgiveness, and hope — the things that save us, even in the most anxious times.”

	The story has been adapted for the screen by Oscar-nominated screenwriter David Magee, known for movies including A Man Called Otto, Life of Pi, and Finding Neverland.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The movie will reunite some of the key players behind the 2022 feature adaptation of A Man Called Otto ($110M global box office), also based on Backman's novel. Hope Studios' Fredrik Wikström Nicastro (A Man Called Otto) and Renée Wolfe (A Man Called Otto) of 2DUX2 will produce, with Forster, Magee and Neda Backman executive-producing.


Maleficent, Girl, Interrupted and Tomb Raider actress Jolie was a Tony winner last year for producing on Broadway musical The Outsiders. She most recently starred in Pablo Larraín's Oscar-nominated biopic about Maria Callas and directed First They Killed My Father. Forster's credits include Monster's Ball, which earned Halle Berry an Oscar, Finding Neverland, The Kite Runner, James Bond film Quantum of Solace, World War Z, and A Man Called Otto.


	“Fredrik's novels speak to our shared humanity in a way that really moves audiences, and we're proud to be able to deliver another heartwarming and hilarious adaptation of his work”, said producer Wikström Nicastro.

	











	Forster described the story as “filled with humor, heart, chaos, and unexpected hope.”


	Producer Renée Wolfe added: “Anxious People is a uniquely warm and heartfelt story that speaks to our chaotic times by asking us to step outside of our own stories and slow down enough to actually see one another. It is set a week before Christmas and highlights a time when generosity and giving are values that are more in focus. Sometimes funny, sometimes dramatic and always entertaining, Anxious People is a book that has sold over 6 million copies world-wide and, with Angelina Jolie playing the lead and Marc Forster directing, will surely prove to be a movie that will captivate millions more.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Lisa Vanderpump Reveals What She Knows About Kyle Richards' House Hunting","https://entertainmentnow.com/bravo/kyle-richards-mansion-lisa-vanderpump-neighborhood/","Fri, 02 May 2025 16:03:36 GMT","

Lisa Vanderpump spilled tea on Kyle Richards' recent house hunting in her neighborhood.

The former “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star confirmed that Richards toured a mansion right across from her Villa Rosa estate.

During a May 1 appearance on “Watch What Happens Live,” Vanderpump joked about Richards' real estate tour in her neck of the woods. “Let me talk about this,” Vanderpump said to host Andy Cohen. “She [had] a clothes shop that was like 100 yards from my restaurant. And then she continuously comes up to me.”

“I mean, doesn't she get the message? It's almost like she wants to sit on my lap,” Vanderpump cracked of her former friend.

When Cohen reminded her that Richards didn't buy the house, Vanderpump replied, “Because the offer wasn't accepted. She isn't always totally transparent, as we've seen on the show.”

“No, no, let's talk about this,” Vanderpump continued. “This house is 15 foot from me. Fifteen foot. She went there four times. This house used to be Channing Tatum's. I used to have a plan to dig a tunnel underneath the road to get to Channing Tatum. But he sold it. And then Kyle tried to buy it. Like, why would you go there four times? I mean, why doesn't she just ask to stay in my guest bedroom?”

A post shared by Kyle Richards (@kylerichards18)

The house in question is a 6-bedroom Beverly Hills property located a few feet from Villa Rosa, where Vanderpump and her husband have lived for nearly 15 years.

According to TMZ, Richards toured the house multiple times with her realtor daughters and “really liked” it. The house was ultimately sold to another buyer for $6.9 million in February.

Vanderpump told TMZ, “A shame [Richards'] offer wasn't accepted because she'd finally be able to move into Beverly Hills.”

A rep for Richards denied that the RHOBH star ever made an offer on the property because she had concerns about the area's fire hazard.

During an Amazon Live Q&A with fans on April 28, Richards said she simply decided to stay in the Encino home she bought with her ex, Mauricio Umansky, in 2018. “I decided to stay here for a while. I just decided against that,” Richards told fans during her livestream.

A post shared by Watch What Happens Live! (@bravowwhl)

Vanderpump and Richards have been in a feud for several years. Their friendship ended during filming for RHOBH season 9, when Vanderpump's husband, Ken Todd, kicked Richards out of Villa Rosa during an argument.

During Cohen's “Watch What Happens 5” segment, Vanderpump was asked to list the top five things that she would do if Richards had bought the house across the street from her.

“Okay, first thing, put my house on the market,” Vanderpump joked.

“My doorbell ring would be ‘Goodbye Kyle!'” she continued. “I have an electric fence that would sort out that straight hair she's got. My swans are attack swans, Hanky and Panky.”

“The number one thing I would do, I think it has to be put my house on the market,” Vanderpump added.

The Tony Awards will take place on June 8 at Radio City Music Hall and air on CBS. Cynthia Erivo hosts.

Past Tony winners Sarah Paulson and Wendell Pierce were on hand at “CBS Mornings” to announce the big award nominations. They joined hosts Gayle King, Tony Dokoupil and Nate Burleson in a giddy segment to make the proclamations.

Paulson started with the Best Actress In A Leading Role In A Play. Sarah Snook's multi-role “The Picture of Dorian Gray” has earned her the nomination. Mia Farrow in “The Roommate” is the venerable actress' best work. Sadie Sink's “John Proctor is the Villain” role is being praised. Laura Donnelly is up for “The Hills of California. And LaTanya Richardson Jackson in “Purpose” puts the actress up.

Pierce took on the Best Actor In A Leading Role In A Play. George Clooney is up for his take on “Good Night and Good Luck.” Cole Escola is getting recognized for his work in “Oh, Mary!” Daniel Dae Kim is getting praise for his work in “Yellow Face.” Jon Michael Hill and Harry Lennix are vying for a win thanks to “Purpose.” Finally, Louis McCartney gets the nod for “Stranger Things: The First Shadow.”

Other highlights include the Best Play Revival section which includes “Eureka Day,” “Our Town,” “Romeo + Juliet,” and the aforementioned “Yellow Face.” Best New Play features the previously mentioned “John Proctor Is The Villain,” “Purpose,” and “Oh, Mary!” Those three are joined by “English” and “The Hills of California.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Hallmark Stars Adorably Admit to Having ‘Zero Chill' Over Critics Choice Nominations","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/critics-choice-reality-tv-nominations/","Fri, 02 May 2025 15:11:11 GMT","

It was a big day for multiple Hallmark stars as nominees for the seventh annual Critics Choice Real TV Awards were announced on May 1, 2025, honoring “excellence in nonfiction, unscripted and reality programming across broadcast, cable and streaming platforms,” per a press release. 

Sisters Ashley Williams and Kimberly Williams-Paisley adorably admitted to having “zero chill” over both being nominated in the same category, and Jonathan Bennett was rendered speechless as he received three nominations, including for Best Male Star of the Year — a category fans get to vote for. 

A post shared by Kimberly Williams-Paisley (@kimberlywilliamspaisley)

Williams hosted the first season of “Small Town Setup,” which premiered in January on Hallmark+. Before its debut, she told EntertainmentNOW it was “insane” that her big sister also landed a hosting gig on a dating show, FOX's “Farmer Wants a Wife,” months after her. 

Now the siblings' shows are actually competing against each other in the Critics Choice Real TV Awards' category for Best Relationship Show. The other contenders are ABC's “The Golden Bachelorette,” and three Netflix shows — “The Later Daters,” “Love Is Blind,” and “Love on the Spectrum.” 

After the nominees were announced, Williams-Paisley shared a screenshot of a text exchange she had with her younger sister. She wrote, “OMG OUR SHOWS BOTH NOM FOR CRITICS CHOICE AWARDS!!! 😆” 

Williams replied, “OMG YAY US!! 😂” and Williams-Paisley responded, “DYING 😆😆😆😂😂😂”

In the caption of her post, Williams-Paisley wrote, “My sister @ashleywilliamsandcompany and I had ZERO CHILL today when BOTH our reality dating shows got nominated for @ccrealtv awards! 🎉❤️❤️😁😁😁”

While Williams was filming “Small Town Setup” in August 2024, she told her sister — who was recovering from intense vocal cord surgery — to look into potentially hosting a show because it was fun and would cause less strain on her physically than a big acting gig. Like magic, Williams-Paisley was offered the FOX gig shortly after. 

Laughing, Williams told EntertainmentNOW, “I was like, ‘Are we about to be hosting dating shows at the exact same time? This is the most insane thing in the entire world!”

Bennett's husband, Jaymes Vaughan, sweetly commented, “That's my baby!!! So PROUD of you. This is only just the beginning.”

Rachel Boston, who appeared as a guest judge on the series, chimed in, “Love this so much!!!!!!”

When Shawna Delong won the trip of a lifetime to watch longtime Hallmark star Marcus Rosner film his latest project, she never expected to wind up in the movie. But when “The Final Victim” co-starring Brittany Bristow premieres on Lifetime, Delong will make her onscreen debut right alongside them. 

In late April 2025, Rosner told EntertainmentNOW that DeLong won the epic trip during a raffle held on board Expedia Cruises' “Cruising With Friends” fan trip in January featuring him, Jesse Hutch, and Jen Lilley. There was no promise of a walk-on role, but Rosner said he wanted to make the trip extra special for Delong — a fellow Canadian who flew from Ontario to Edmonton with her mom, Kimberley Delong, and was “so enthusiastic” about being there. 

“If she was nervous, she did not show it,” Rosner marveled. “She had the greatest disposition for this event. Like, she just seemed excited and interested, but also quite calm. She didn't seem overwhelmed at all, which was great, because I could totally see a fan getting this experience and being overwhelmed. Shawna was seemingly the perfect pick.” 

Rosner was able to coordinate the cool prize package with Expedia Cruises because “The Last Victim” was produced by Northern Gateway Films, the Canadian production company he co-founded. Noting that Shawna and Kim “were just thrilled to be here,” Rosner first had lunch with them at a favorite spot in Edmonton, Chianti. 

Once they got to the movie set, Rosner decided to elevate the experience, explaining, “We got Shawna into a cop uniform. She appears early in the movie, in the background, as I'm sort of walking up to interview Brittany's character. I play a cop, a detective in the film, and you'll see a shot of Shawna in the back.” 

“But then later that week,” Rosner continued, “we did a night shoot on top of this rooftop in downtown Edmonton, and in this scene, we are about to raid the killer (who's) up there. So Shawna's in there, behind me. She's got the earpiece on, she's bringing up the rear as we're sort of swatting this killer. Yeah, it was great and she was amazing.”

Rosner also invited his brothers to join the scene, dressed as fellow cops, and wrote on Instagram that it was an “unforgettable” night of filming. The “Notes of Autumn” star said he was impressed by how relaxed Shawna was throughout the whole experience, including filming overnight until 5 a.m. and when a medical emergency occurred on the set. 

“We had a medical situation with somebody on set one night that we haven't encountered before,” he told EntertainmentNOW. “I won't say exactly what happened, but it was very stressful for a bit, and Shawna and her mom very quietly came up at one point. They were like, ‘Should we leave?' And I was like, ‘Nah, stick around, things will be touch and go for a bit, but you guys can stay.' They just didn't stress me out at all. It was very cool with them being around.”

A post shared by Marcus Rosner (@marcus_rosner)

Although Rosner frequently has visitors watching from the sidelines on movie sets, this was the first time a fan has won a trip like this with him. He told EntertainmentNOW he was very relieved Shawna enjoyed it, because he often worries it won't be very fun for bystanders. 

“Anytime someone comes to watch, I always feel this great insecurity or self-consciousness, because I know that it'll be less glamorous than they were imagining,” he said. “It'll be more tedious than they were imagining, and it'll take longer, and their interest may devolve into boredom, and then I will feel sort of responsible for that. So that's always my underlying fear.” 

“But if Shawna and Kim felt any of that along the way, they didn't express it, and they just seemed excited in all the ways,” he smiled, adding that he's open to doing something similar in the future.

In fact, Rosner said that now that he has multiple fan experiences under his belt, he's definitely open to participating in more. Rosner told EntertainmentNOW in the fall that he was a bit nervous about agreeing to take part in several fan events for the first time, including December's first-ever Hallmark Christmas Experience.  

But in April, looking back on the event, Rosner gushed, “I loved that weekend, I loved hanging out with those people, I loved the way Hallmark ran it. It was just, like, perfectly spaced out. I never felt overstretched. I always felt like I knew what I was doing, and just the level of clarity and organization was so greatly appreciated.” 

Rosner and his wife also set sail with fans on the Expedia Cruises excursion in early January, a five-day trip to the Bahamas, where Shawna won the trip that led to her upcoming movie debut. Rosner said he suspects “The Final Victim” will air on Lifetime in the fall and said he's also just wrapped a new Hallmark Christmas movie. 

Meanwhile, Expedia Cruises plans to announce which stars will be aboard its 2026 “Cruising With Friends” trip soon, with details to be released first on via its private Facebook group.

When cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was inadvertently shot and killed by a live round on the set of “Rust” in October of 2021, it seemed unfathomable to me that production would ever be completed — let alone that I would be tasked with reviewing the finished product one day. 

“Twilight Zone: The Movie” and “The Crow” were both released in spite of similar tragedies (in addition to more recent examples like “American Made” and “Deadpool 2,” whose stunt performer deaths sparked considerably less attention), but that was before the internet had so thoroughly flattened every film into the context of its own creation. The horror took on a life of its own when second assistant camerawoman Sarah Jones was fatally struck by a freight train on the first day of filming “Midnight Rider” in February 2014, and the Facebook group that crew members started to oppose resuming the shoot had swelled to more than 10,000 members by April of that year.

And what happened on the set of “Rust” caused such an instant firestorm that most of the film's production team — huddled together in a tent as police and medical personnel began to address the situation — first learned that Hutchins was dead by reading about it on their phones. 




			Popular on IndieWire		






By the time the sun went down that day, “Rust” had become inextricable from the calamity that had occurred in a small New Mexico church on the 12th day of the film's production. And while armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed has since been convicted of involuntary manslaughter for her role in the accident, the enduring mystery as to why a live round was loaded into that weapon — and the persistent question of star/producer Alec Baldwin's culpability in firing it — has only made it more difficult for the movie to escape the dark shadow cast by its production. 

“Rust” was completed for that very reason. 

In a bid to create some closure of their own, much of the original cast and crew reunited in the spring of 2023 to finish what they had started 18 months earlier. Some only agreed to do so at the direct urging of Hutchins' husband, who received an executive producer credit as part of a settlement, and insisted that finishing the movie was the best way of honoring his late wife's memory and dedication to her craft. 

 










In that light, whether or not “Rust” is a good movie would seem to be irrelevant; a masterpiece wouldn't be “worth” the loss of Hutchins' life, and a disaster wouldn't make her death any more senseless than it was to begin with. Still, I can't help but feel as though reviewing the film — a film that's about to be dumped into a handful of theaters in tandem with its low-profile release on VOD — is a critical step in the project's transition from a cursed production to a lasting monument. 

I emphasize the purpose of reviewing “Rust” in part because there's so little else of consequence to say about the movie, a competent but uncompelling Western whose story is saddled with the unfortunate irony of being about an accidental shooting. The triggerman is a 13-year-old orphan named Lucas Hollister (Patrick Scott McDermott, making the most of this grim opportunity), whose younger brother depends on him to protect their late parents' Wyoming ranch from wolves and other predators. One fateful morning in 1882, Lucas aims his rifle at a four-legged trespasser, only to hit a human villain hiding just over the ridge. The law holds the boy accountable despite his lack of malice, only for Alec Baldwin — of all people — to save Lucas from a noose by murdering all of his jailers.

 










The two fugitives make a break for the Mexican border: young Lucas and Harland Rust, a legendary outlaw who also happens to be his maternal grandfather. Harland has never met the kid before, and — underneath his cartoonishly gruff exterior, and layers of lily-gilded dialogue like “You tell any son of a bitch who comes after me that he will shake hands with the devil himself” — it's clear that the old man is eager to make up for lost time, even if Lucas just wants to get home to his little brother. 

And so the long-estranged relatives trek across a rugged sweep of the American Southwest, the hostility between them (very) slowly thawing into something that resembles love as they elude bounty hunters and have campfire heart-to-hearts. Those conversations largely boil down to Harland saying things like “This ain't no game, boy,” and “There's alive and there's ain't — try to focus on the former,” but even the most derivative aspects of Souza's script resonate with an inescapable awareness of life's cruelties. While Hutchins' memory is obviously most palpable in the movie's sweeping vistas, backlit interiors, and dusky skies, it's hard not to feel her presence when sheriff Wood Helm (an effective Josh Hopkins), hot on Harland's trail, laments the random illness that has befallen his own son. 

 










Much of Hopkins' performance is wasted on the lopsided “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly” triangle — completed by a devil-eyed Travis Fimmel as ruthless bounty hunter Fenton “Preacher” Lang — that needlessly warps “Rust” well beyond the two-hour mark, but every second of bloat is an extra opportunity to savor the beauty of a film that only exists to be looked at. Hutchins lensed a relatively small fraction of the footage that appears in the finished edition of “Rust,” as several actors had to be recast and their scenes reshot (the church scene was scrapped altogether), but co-credited cinematographer Bianca Cline has honored her late colleague by adhering to the details and lighting choices left behind in Hutchins' notes. 

As a result, the footage is not just impressively seamless, but also beautiful throughout. The film's digital gloss dovetails with the rustic elementalism of its genre, whereas so many other recent Westerns have forced those two aesthetics into direct confrontation with each other. Clunky as “Rust” can be when its script tries to navigate how the regrets of one generation might seed the hopes of another, the film's photography creates a nuanced conversation between the heartbreak of the past and the promise of the future. In this case, that promise will remain eternally unfulfilled. 

 










“Some things in this life you can't get back, I reckon,” Harland laments. It's the one truth that “Rust” conveys all too well. 

“Rust” is now playing in theaters and on VOD.

[Editor's note: The following contains spoilers for “The Last of Us” Season 2, Episode 3, “The Path.”]

Asked which of Ellie's relationships they were most excited to see on screen in “The Last of Us” Season 2, star Bella Ramsey didn't hesitate to pick Dina, played by actress Isabela Merced. Ramsey described the character's beloved queer love interest as the “most prevalent” person in Ellie's life this season and gave IndieWire a glimpse into the odd-couple dynamic we saw taking shape in Episode 3, “The Path.” 

 










“She's so brilliant, and I'm really excited for people to see how wonderful she is and how much light and energy and humor she brings to this season,” Ramsey said of Merced. “She really just had this unwavering energy about her the whole time, which was really great for being on set. When I was like an old tired grandpa, she'd be like this little sprite that would come in and just make everybody party.”

Reviewing the apocalyptic drama's latest installment, IndieWire's Ben Travers analyzed how Ellie's road to revenge might impact her self-image. In Episode 3, we see our grieving hero trying on a hardened, cool-guy exterior in memory of Joel (Pedro Pascal) — but even admitting to herself that it doesn't fit. 

“She's trying on a persona she admired and lost,” writes Travers, referencing a scene where Ellie acknowledges she's “trying to sound like a badass.” “She's becoming Joel as a way to remember him.” 

Not even Pascal, HBO's hunkiest Chilean-American actor, can make romance mid-mushroom-Armageddon sound like a good idea, but Ellie's complex grief is at the core of her compelling will-they-won't-they with Dina. Toss in Dina's ex-boyfriend, Jesse (Young Mazino), and the narrative layers he'll be bringing to the table later, and you've got the sort of drama that demands to be a TV show.

“The sort of triangle of the three of us is something that's really cool and was really fun to play,” Ramsey said. “It's really important that we continue to have representation on screen that doesn't feel like it's ticking a box in terms of representation.”

Known for major adaptations (“Dora and the Lost City of Gold”) and big franchises (“Alien: Romulus”), Merced was prepared for the pressure that came with adapting “The Last of Us” video game. She told IndieWire, “Having that experience of not wanting to upset a fan base with my portrayal was essential. And then also myself being a fan, not wanting to upset myself, I think, is the biggest fear I have. I'm my own worst enemy, my own biggest critic, so I definitely don't want that.”

 










Describing the mood on the production, Mazino said, “The vibe of the set was chilled. The story we were creating was not.”

“The Last of Us” Season 2 airs new episodes on Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on HBO and Max.

Paul Mescal has worked with auteurs and iconic actors alike, but the star is now revealing one of the first future co-stars he was truly starstruck by: Josh O'Connor. 

The duo lead “The History of Sound,” which will debut at Cannes after being in the works for four years. The project was first announced in 2021, with a press statement from director Oliver Hermanus (accurately) citing how O'Connor and Mescal were “two of the most promising actors of their generation.” 

The shoot was planned for 2022; however, the production was delayed due to financing amid the pandemic and later, guild strikes. The film was instead shot in 2024, after O'Connor and Mescal had already respectively become big stars. Yet Mescal still remembers just how in awe he was of O'Connor at the start of his own career post-“Normal People” success back in 2020.

“We had a sweet Zoom,” Mescal told Vanity Fair about after O'Connor reached out to him as a fan of the series. “He was one of the first people that I was starstruck by after ‘Normal People' came out. He's now one of my best friends, and I just adore him.” 

Both Mescal and O'Connor later separately became attached to “The History of Sound.” Mescal plays singer Lionel who falls for his fellow New England Conservatory student David (O'Connor) in the adaptation of Ben Shattuck's World War I-set short story. And Mescal and O'Connor's friendship only grew during filming the queer romance. 

“We felt very boyish in each other's company throughout,” Mescal said of filming with O'Connor. “I've always said this to Josh, but he brings out a childlike version of me. I haven't felt that kind of degree of boyishness in myself for a long time.”

As for how long it took to bring “The History of Sound” to the screen, Mescal marveled at the er, history of the film itself. “How many times do you hear people who really try and get something made over five, 10, 15 years, and it just falls away?,” Mescal said. “I remember feeling very lucky. Like, we have to enjoy this. Because we'll come across other opportunities in our life where we love a script as much as this, and we just don't get to get it made.”

He added, “The thing that I'm most proud about is that the feeling I had when I read the script for the first time is what I got when I saw the film for the first time.”

[Editor's note: The following interview contains some spoilers for “Another Simple Favor.”]

No one has ever seen Paul Feig — not even on an airplane — in anything less than formalwear, whether a three-piece suit or a dandyish necktie or pinstripes, sometimes cutting a classy silhouette with a martini in hand. The filmmaker and head of Feigco Entertainment also has his own Artingstall's London dry gin brand, so of course it made sense to meet up with the writer/director and his “Another Simple Favor” star Elizabeth Perkins for drinks at Columbus Circle's Mandarin Oriental hotel in New York.

 










Feig's sequel “Another Simple Favor,” now streaming on Prime Video, is the follow-up to his 2018 box-office hit about neighboring mothers on edge (Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick) whose suburban ennui drives them to murder and mayhem. The latest film flings us to Italy's island of Capri, with Emily (Lively) out from behind bars for the alleged murder of her twin sister and now marrying into Italian mafia royalty, and she's asked true-crime podcaster Stephanie Smothers (Kendrick) to be her maid of honor.

It's a fun and frothy affair that also introduces a few new characters into the mix (like Elena Sofia Ricci as Emily's imperious mother-in-law-to-be) and reacquaints us with some old ones (Henry Golding as Emily's bitter, hard-drinking ex-husband). And one character is a bit of both, as the great comedic chameleon Elizabeth Perkins steps in to take over as Emily's memory-impaired and permanently soused mother, Margaret, after Jean Smart passed on the sequel due to scheduling issues. 

Perkins steals the scene in “Another Simple Favor” alongside her co-star Allison Janney, playing Emily's aunt Linda, who has schemes of her own and also has to keep Margaret in check and on an even keel and, at times, literally walking straight. It's disappointing this film is heading straight to streaming, as the original grossed more than $97 million worldwide. Lively, meanwhile, is a headline-grabbing star for reasons good and bad, thanks not only to the success of “It Ends with Us” last year but also to her ongoing litigious feud with that film's director, Justin Baldoni. Meanwhile, Lively's hair, as in “It Ends With Us,” is a special effect of its own. Needless to say, theatrical earnings were left on the table here.

 










Plus, the press has mounted rumors of a supposed feud between Kendrick and Lively that director Feig has vehemently denied. These are not the reasons to see the movie, of course, but they're all attention-getting factors regardless, ripped from the pagebook of dishy Hollywood classics of supposed offscreen drama that here would've likely brought new audiences to theaters. This time, they'll just have to tune in from home to check in on the latest conniving (and eventually truth-serum-laced) days and ways of two characters born from what's become a 21st-century cult favorite.

IndieWire spoke to Feig and Perkins about their new film, those rumors, while lingering into discussions of the great '70s movies they love, and a little bit about Feig's upcoming thriller “The Housemaid.” That film will mark his return to theaters after three consecutive direct-to-streaming offerings (including “The School for Good and Evil” and “Jackpot!”) since COVID.

This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity and length.

IndieWire: Elizabeth, you're always playing boozy characters, whether in “Weeds” or “Sharp Objects.” You were the draw for me to see this movie! Why do people keep coming to you for this kind of part?

Elizabeth Perkins: Well, I come from a long line of heavy drinkers, so I've got it in my bones. I don't know, I think it started on the show “Weeds.” My character was consistently drunk. So people saw me do that, and thought, “We know she can play a drinker really well.” My drama teacher in college said that the key to playing drunk is to act like you're not drunk, so you play against it, like, “I really am sober.” [Slurs words.] That's what everyone who's drunk does: They try to convince you that they're not.

 










There's a quote from your character on “Weeds” that's one of my favorites, and you're holding a martini: “I don't vomit from drinking — I vomit when I think about my life.”

Perkins: Oh, I love that line. That whole scene. I had so much fun on “Weeds.” Actually, Paul worked on that.

Paul Feig: That's where we met. I directed three episodes.

Perkins: They actually were talking about doing a remake of it, and I was sort of like, I don't know what you would replace marijuana with. I thought maybe mushrooms.

Feig: When they first announced “Breaking Bad,” I thought, “that's ‘Weeds!' They just took ‘Weeds' and made it meth.”

Perkins: Actually, Mike White, who's of “White Lotus” fame now, I've known him for years, wrote a play — god, it's got to be like the early '90s — called “Pot Mom.” It was sort of making the rounds of small L.A. theaters, and it starred Laurie Metcalf before she did “Roseanne.” So when I got the script for “Weeds,” I was like, “Isn't this Mike White's play?”

Feig: Everything is inspired by everything.

Elizabeth, you were also stepping into the shoes of Jean Smart. Is that surreal somehow? 

Perkins: Paul was like, “Make it your own. Feel free to make it your own.” But the one throughline was the wig. Paul, was that something you gave to Jean, or was it in the script?

 










Feig: I think it was in the script, yeah. She wears these terrible wigs.

Perkins: And then it kind of moves and doesn't stay on her head. But if you have to follow someone, you follow the queen. I mean, I've always been just in love with Jean Smart. She just makes the boldest choices, and she can get away with it, because she's so committed all the time.

The wig is like one of Celia Hodes' cancer wigs on “Weeds.”

Perkins: It reminded me [of that]. When they first put it on, I was like, “Can we make it not quite like…” The first one was really stiff, so we tried to loosen it up a bit. I hated that Celia Hodes cancer wig so much. She wouldn't let me change it, [“Weeds” creator] Jenji Kohan. I was like, “Can we just change it? Why would she just have this really ugly wig?” She's Celia. She's way too vain. Anyway, not judging.

Paul, you've long had an aversion to making sequels and, of course, have a number of films like “Bridesmaids” where people are always asking, “Where's the sequel?” Why did you break your no-sequel rule this time?

Feig: Just the timing just felt right. It was during the pandemic. The first movie really took off being on streaming, and then when it went to Netflix, a year or two later, it went through the roof, but we had already been talking about it then at that point. And I love these characters. I love Blake and Anna. I really, really love them. It was fun doing the first movie, and I thought, yeah, why not? There's more to explore with them. It just felt like we could get away with it. But then it was terrifying, because it was like, we've got to make it really good, because it's one of my favorite movies I've done, it's the first one. So I was like, if you make something not as good, it's going to back-poison the original one.

 










Perkins: I personally love seeing these two women together. Blake and Anna together, especially when you just see them standing next to each other… I mean, Blake is so, “Hi, I'm a giant goddess,” and Anna's like a little mouse driving a race car. [Also] I think I just spit across the table.

Feig: I can think of worse things.

It's fine. “Elizabeth Perkins just spit on me.” I'll take it. It's like Faye Dunaway's gay assistant she supposedly threw a salad at. I'd be grateful to have that salad thrown at me.

Perkins: I want to know what precipitated the throw. I want to hear the lead-up. 

I'm sure someone just told her no.

Perkins: Or it could be like — oh, what's that moment with Sharon Stone, that great movie. This is such a long story, I'm not going to go into it, but she goes, “My Diet Coke is warm, mother.” Her mother is her assistant running around.

Feig: [Faye Dunaway] auditioned for a show, a pilot that I was directing back in 2005, and she came in, and she didn't want to read with the casting director. In fairness, sometimes that's always like a thing. Actually, it wasn't even the casting director. It was somebody who was just reading robotically. And so I was like, “Can I read with you?” So I had to read with her. I acted with Faye Dunaway. She's done all the seminal movies. Just blew my mind.

 










Perkins: She was on the pulse of that great '70s resurgence.

Feig: Totally. “Bonnie and Clyde” and “Network.”

Perkins: And “Chinatown.” And I'm sorry, but “Mommie Dearest.” That was the '80s though, right?

It's funny they had Faye Dunaway auditioning in 2005. I'm sure she loved that.

Feig: Oh, I know. I heard a few phone calls of her with the people at the front desk. She could have thrown a salad through the phone.

Paul, why set and shoot the movie in Capri?

Feig: I know it like the back of my hand. I've been going there for 30 years, my wife and I every year. Hardly any movies have been shot there. The one with Clark Gable and Sophia Loren, I think. [“It Started in Naples.”] It's just hard to get around. The logistics are horrendous there. But I got inspired by Giovanna Battaglia, who's the fashion editor of French Vogue, got married to some rich hedge fund guy there. They took over the whole island. And I was like, “I want to recreate that wedding.” And so we did. And actually, where Blake gets married in our movie, that's where Giovanna got married. We hired the same people to build that deck out.

Elizabeth, what about Allison Janney? Had you crossed paths before as co-stars?

Perkins: Well, as actors, we've never crossed paths. We've been friends for like 25 years. We just have the same circle of friends. I see her all the time. And she had a small part in the movie “Miracle on 34th Street.” She played a lady asking about a toy at the department store where I worked, but we didn't work together, and it's been like this for years and years and years. Like, oh, she's doing that and I'm over here and she's doing that. I adore her. To me, she's just iconic, and she's so super talented.

 










When I saw you were both in this movie together, I knew you'd be playing someone insane.

Perkins: We didn't even talk about the relationship or what either one of us were going to do. We just kind of showed up, and she became the overbearing older sister, and I was kind of like the quiet one. I was just confused.

Feig: Tell the story about the lemon.

Perkins: When we walk into the wedding, we're doing all these takes playing around. Right before he yelled, “Action,” Allison handed me a lemon. She goes, “Hold that.” And so I'm holding this lemon, and we start walking in, and she grabs the lemon out of my hand. She goes, “Put that back.” And that's what it's like to work with Allison. To throw me off. The weirder, the better.

There's this “twincest” moment in the movie where Blake Lively's character Emily is basically molested by her other twin sister, Charity. How did you pull that off, with either a body double or post-production effects?

Feig: It was a face replacement. We found this great body double for her who could act, and so we acted against her, but it was fun watching Blake. Blake had to work with her to say, “I'm going to do this. I'm going to do that.” And we had to find somebody who was in Italy. Italians speak with their hands, and so we had to make sure that she moved like Blake, and the woman was a dancer also. She was an actress and a dancer, and so she was great. And so, we just really did face replacement for that bed scene.

 










Perkins: The differences between the twins are so subtle. That's so definitive. She committed to those subtleties.

Feig: She's a very underappreciated actor.

She's appreciated as a star but not as an actor, and those two aren't always inextricable. 

Feig: This character comes out, and you're like, wow, that's so not Blake. Blake's just this earth mother, kind of lovely, the best mom I've ever met.

Perkins: Doting around four kids, literally with her mom.

Feig: She doesn't dump them with the nanny. The press keeps wanting to create this feud with Anna and Blake. It does not exist. It does not exist. It makes me crazy. That is pure misogyny. Pure misogyny. Two women together, they're going to fight. It's like, are you kidding me? And I get in trouble when I try to knock those rumors down online, because people are like, “Oh, don't get involved.” It's like, I want to get involved, because I see these people. They're my friends. And I literally will come from something where they're having fun and joking, getting along, and then someone comes out, “Oh, they're fighting.” And it's like, I think I know better than you guys.

Perkins: No one would ever say that about two guys on a show. No one would ever say, “Ryan and Josh Brolin hate each other.”

Feig: Even if they are, they won't say anything. They'd be fighting in the street like, oh, they're just having fun. I've been in the middle of those things. It's so uncomfortable. 

 










Paul, including “Another Simple Favor,” your last three movies have gone straight to streaming. Are you excited to get back to theaters with “The Housemaid,” and was the streaming movie wrought out of the pandemic?

Feig: It was definitely COVID. It was also who was buying the movies that I wanted to do. And the movies, the last few movies I did, the streamers wanted them, and studios didn't necessarily want them.

Perkins: Watching a movie with an audience is just so different. Whenever you can pause the movie to go make a snack, you're gone.

Feig: Or just get up and go make a snack and leave the movie running. “I didn't understand that part.” It's like, because you were in fucking the kitchen.

Not to encourage second-screen viewing, but one thing working in this film's favor is that if people don't remember or didn't see the original, they can look up the plot on their phone.

Feig: That is the joy of streaming. It's so just, “I heard about that. I'm going to watch it now,” versus get in your car…

Perkins: My husband, who's a cinematographer, when we're watching a movie, we draw the shades, we turn off the phones. He's a real stickler about that. And we have the largest TV that you can ever have in your home, and we try to turn it into an event, because that's what I miss about it. That's why I love to go to live theater again. You make a plan. You buy the ticket, you go, it becomes something you're invested in. So it's more of an experience.

 










Feig: The scary thing about streaming is it's very easy to turn it off after a minute. If you go to a theater, for at least 10 minutes, you hung in.

Perkins: I have walked out of a couple movies. I walked out of “Blue Velvet.” At the time, I don't know if it was the mood I was in that day, but I was like, come on. I was with a friend of mine, and he was enjoying it […] then I went and saw it again. I think it was maybe 10 years later, and maybe I was hormonal. Maybe I was in a mood that day, because it's actually a brilliant film. I was not ready for it.

David Lynch's death early this year was a devastating one. Normally, when a celebrity dies, I'm sad, but go, “OK.” It was different this time.

Perkins: For me, it was Norman Jewison. The whole '70s. I was born in 1960, so in 1978 when these great movies were happening, I was 18 years old. The actresses I grew up with, the filmmakers I grew up with.

Feig: Some of the '70s movies are so good. That was the last decade when movies were made basically for adults.

Perkins: The first film I ever saw, other than “Please Don't Eat the Daisies,” was “2001: A Space Odyssey.” I saw it at the Waverly. I must have been, I don't know, 13. 

Feig: Were you high?

Perkins: No, my dad wanted to see it, so he took me, being a good dad. My parents were divorced. He was trying to be a good dad: “I know! I'll take her to the movies for the movie I want to see.” 

 










Feig: My parents took me to see it, but everybody in the theater was high except my parents.

Perkins: At the end, I was like, “I want to be in the movies.”

Feig: I was so wigged out by that movie; it freaked me. I love spaceships. So I was like, “Oh, cool.” And then by the end, I was like, “Oh, that's a giant baby. What's happening?” When I was in film school, they were showing it on the big screen at USC Film School. The Norris Theatre was fantastic, and I went to see it, and I watched it twice in a row. I couldn't believe how great it was.

Perkins: That happened to me with “McCabe and Mrs. Miller.” My favorite film of all time. It was a moment. I sat there twice, and I got popcorn, and came back. When I look at where the industry is right now, and all these great filmmakers going — because it all happened so fast — streaming and this and that, and theaters shutting down and nobody really knowing what's going on… I'm hoping for that great indie renaissance that happened in the '70s. It happened in the '90s. It's what we need right now.

A lot of movies lately tell you how to feel, in a way they didn't necessarily in the 1970s.

Feig: That's what we always call studio notes. You go like, OK, “I see the studio note. People aren't getting this, and I'm susceptible to it too.” I test-screen the hell out of my movies just to make sure the majority of the audience gets it. But sometimes you go like, we have to explain this thing, because they're not getting it, even though the smartest people in the audience get it. But when you're making a commercial film, it's kind of got to hit a wide swath of the audience.

 










Perkins: Say you're going to make a film for the 15-year-old audience, but then you also have this other audience, which is a larger demographic and has more money. Why aren't we making films for adult audiences? I don't mean adult films, I mean for adult audiences. Maybe we could go see “Coming Home,” or you could go see “Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore.”

Feig: That's where I do think streaming is filling a void, because they can be a little more niche that way. So that's the good thing. [The studios are] still a little scared.

Perkins: But I wish that the studios wouldn't be scared, because those movies then become classics.

Paul, what can you say about your next movie, “The Housemaid” with Amanda Seyfried and Sydney Sweeney? You're adapting a novel I still haven't read.

Feig: It's a very, very dark thriller, but it's still very fun. Let's just say that. The problem when you're a filmmaker and you do a book adaptation, and people always go like, “Oh, I got to read the book first.” It's like, “No, don't read the book.” I know, but if you haven't read the book, they're like, “See the movie first and then read the book.”

Perkins: I love that Paul always makes films that to me feel very female-centric and features women in the protagonist's roles. I really appreciate them.

 










They've certainly never been male-centric as far as I can recall.

Feig: No, I have no interest in that. I think guys are doing OK.

“Another Simple Favor” is now streaming on Amazon Prime Video.

Neil Young has announced a new album—his first with his recently assembled touring band, the Chrome Hearts. He leads Talkin to the Trees with a reliably on-the-nose protest song, “Lets Roll Again,” rallying the American car industry to “protect our children” by manufacturing electric vehicles at a rate to match China, which is “way ahead—they're building clean cars.” (“That's hard to swallow!” he adds.) Check out the video below, along with the album tracklist.

In verses to the tune of Woody Guthrie's “This Land Is Your Land,” Young zeroes in on Elon Musk: “If you're a fascist, then get a Tesla/If it's electric/It doesn't matter/If you're a Democrat, then taste your freedom/Get whatever you want, and taste your freedom.” The video accompanies the verse with a “Heil Tesla” image depicting Musk's Nazi-style salute.

Talkin to the Trees is out June 13. It includes Neil Young and the Chrome Hearts' debut single, “Big Change.”

R.E.M. have shared a new benefit EP titled Radio Free Europe 2025. The five-track project includes a new remix of the band's 1981 debut single, “Radio Free Europe,” reworked by producer and longtime R.E.M. collaborator Jacknife Lee. The EP is out now digitally, and a vinyl edition is out on September 12 via Craft. Proceeds from the vinyl will go to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), the editorially independent, nonpartisan, and nonprofit 501(c)(3) corporation that inspired R.E.M.'s early single. Listen to the new EP below.

Radio Free Europe 2025 was overseen by the band's original producer Mitch Easter, who first recorded R.E.M. at his Drive-In Studio in 1981. That session included recordings of “Radio Free Europe,” “Sitting Still,” and the instrumental “Wh. Tornado,” all of which appear on the new EP.

Radio Free Europe 2025 arrives as Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty celebrates its 75th anniversary, and just ahead of World Press Freedom Day on Saturday, May 3. The organization currently broadcasts news to 23 countries in 27 languages, making critical information available in regions where a free press is either banned or threatened by the presiding government. RFE/RFL is currently under threat amid President Donald J. Trump's widespread funding cuts, though a federal judge recently ruled that his administration must restore the $12 million that Congress had appropriated for the organization.

Speaking on the importance of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in press materials, R.E.M. bandleader Michael Stipe said: “Whether it's music or a free press—censorship anywhere is a threat to the truth everywhere. On World Press Freedom Day, I'm sending a shout-out to the brave journalists at Radio Free Europe.” Stipe also discussed the new music on CBS Mornings, and you can watch his interview on Instagram.

Bassist Mike Mills continued the sentiment: “Radio Free Europe's journalists have been pissing off dictators for 75 years. You know you're doing your job when you make the right enemies. Happy World Press Freedom Day to the ‘OG' Radio Free Europe.”

Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty's president and chief executive, Stephen Capus, added: “To me, R.E.M.'s music has always embodied a celebration of freedom: freedom of expression, lyrics that make us think, and melodies that inspire action. Those are the very aims of our journalists at Radio Free Europe—to inform, inspire, and uphold freedoms often elusive to our audiences. We hold dictators accountable. They go to great lengths to silence us—blocking our websites, jamming our signals, and even imprisoning our colleagues.”

Listening to Tovi's “Jiggy” is what I imagine it was like to sit in a dark room in 1994 taking in Bone Thugs' group prayer on “Mr. Quija” for the first time. The Philly drill weirdo pushes the hushed, faded-out flows Ot7Quanny and NR Boor have tinkered with to the brink, rapping like a vengeful mummy back from the afterlife. Every time I show Tovi's cryptic, horrorcore-adjacent rap to a friend, the immediate response has been a hand on my shoulder, followed by, “Are you doing alright, man?” As expected, “Jiggy” is a psychedelic, barely one-minute oddity with a flickering beat that sounds half-finished in the best way and gruff whispering that's so over-the-top you'll need to rely on the captions in the music video. His lyrics aren't actually that spooky—lots of talk of getting money and BBLs—but he says them like he found them written on a basement wall in red paint. However “Jiggy” came to be, I am just glad to have Tovi popping out from the shadows every six months or so to drop 90 seconds of unholiness.

Who could forget the strained hope of post-vaccination social life? Masks in the park. Elbow bumps. Portable hand sanitizer. The irrational belief that plexiglass partitions could fend off the COVID-19 virus as we dined indoors, as if swirling, microscopic vapor particles would halt and retreat like obedient soldiers. We later learned that breath aerosols simply wind around these barriers, drifting like cigarette smoke, partition be damned.

Amid the pandemic, and because of it, Norwegian avant-garde artist Jenny Hval considered less nefarious vapors. As live performances became a public health liability, Hval revived her teenage fascination with perfume, and christened her ninth album Iris Silver Mist after a beloved scent of the same name. The $320 fragrance from French company Serge Lutens, crafted in the mid-1990s by renowned nose Maurice Roucel, has been called “the powderiest, rootiest, most sinister iris imaginable,” as scent authority Luca Turin put it in his five-star review. For Hval, the perfume evokes the stages of its making: an alchemic transformation from plant matter to glorious vapor; a “flower that is a root that has died, been resurrected and finely grated,” as she has described it. The 13 songs indebted to this scent examine such grand states of flux: between present and past, tactile and intangible.

Of all the liminalities Hval mines on Iris Silver Mist, the most intriguing and prevalent is performance itself. On the sauntering “I don't know what free is,” Hval questions the definition of creative practice: “I tried to ask ‘What is a performance?'/What is to write?” she sings, her clean falsetto arching over synthesized organ thrums, threatening to vanish at any moment. The earthier “All night long,” with its skeletal percussion and rippling, fingerpicked guitar, portrays performance as the ultimate expression of existence: “As long as I'm performing I am not choosing, or dying/I am performing in the speed of light,” Hval says, speaking softly but plainly. Following this revelation, the song opens into a cosmic jazz refrain, and Hval demonstrates an even purer act of performance: nonverbal singing that mirrors the melody with the unfettered charm of a child humming to a car radio.

Impermanence is a threat and a delight across Iris Silver Mist. “Instruments packed/The stage lights are cut/The beer you just spilled on the floor has dried out,” she sings on “The gift”; like perfume, the spilled beer changes over time, once fresh and now sticky and stale. On “The artist is absent,” the record's clubbiest number, Hval sings in a register so high her words are almost indecipherable. She warns of “a stage without a show/A hazy silhouette… A club without a club” atop gritty synths and a driving beat that collapses into a tangle of distortion. An ambient hiss seeps into the following song, “Huffing my arm,” where Hval murmurs with sibilance as shoes clomp on wooden floorboards; one imagines she has slipped into some less corporeal realm. There is no way to decipher who is wandering the empty halls and who is haunting them.

At its most mystical, Iris Silver Mist imagines acts of mutation that feel more at home in the dream world than the waking. On the radiant opener “Lay down,” Hval refers to herself as a “guardian of the in-between” as a thick fog of Badalamenti synths blooms under clacking percussion and birdsong. Then a scythe simply appears in Hval's hand, ready to sever the mortal thread. The word “scythe” suggests annihilation, but it becomes a thing of fragile beauty when uttered by Hval, whose consonants are so soft you'd think she was naming a blossom rather than the blade that might hack it down.

The teeming, askew lounge ballad “To be a rose,” a highlight, shapeshifts with similar dreamlike ease. A rose morphs into a cigarette; its smoke spills onto a stage, rising like pale streamers. Hval describes singing in her room as her mother smokes on the balcony. “Long inhales and long exhales performed in choreography,” she sings over brass-tinged synths and breezy, stadium-sized toms. As smoke dances through the air, Hval observes it “twirling like our real body.” Here, among the album's many phases of evaporation and sublimation, Hval briefly fuses with the body she was birthed from. At this moment, after a yearning build, the song breaks open, and Hval's glinting voice cuts through like a wire halving clay. Impermanence is a symptom of transformation; on Iris Silver Mist, Hval extols this reality, inviting us to seek out the beauty in each stage. Even a vanishing scent reveals subtle notes as it fades.

7.2

Genre:

Electronic

Label:

On her fourth album, the ambient folk artist Satomimagae imagines a world without names, lines, or borders—anything that could distinguish one thing from an absolute whole. What we might call “leaves” on “trees” here are simply shades upon shades. Every difference is negated. Listening to it feels like waking up from anesthetic, an experience in which there is no delineation between self and other, inner and outer.

Taba, the album's title, is a Japanese term for bundling and sheafing, gathering material together. True to its name, the album sounds as though Satomimagae has extracted all the world's resources and fed them into a juicer on quiet mode. Other than the rich open voicings of her guitar—the only distinguishable instrument on the album—it is difficult to determine the source of each sound; the electronic blurs into the acoustic, raw sounds blend into heavy audio manipulation. You'd be hard pressed to find a dominant emotion anywhere on the album, either. But Taba's strength is in its indeterminacy: Its vagueness cathects a largeness of mood.

While Satomimagae's previous albums felt more insular, the outside world begins to creep in on Taba. She finds the resonances between the natural landscape and the subject experiencing it. On “Ishi,” brushy textures slide past one another while crickets tweedle in and out of focus. On “Many,” a foreboding drone creates a grounding force while Satomimagae sings a pleading melody which sounds like loneliness calcified. By track five, “Mushi Dance,” the meeting point between inner and outer becomes psychedelically absurd, the music terrifically strange. Phasers fill the gray space while chirping birds provide a counterpart to Satomimagae's guitar, the boundaries between the human and avian disintegrated.

While making Taba, Satomimagae gave focused attention to the various sounds of life outside her home studio in Tokyo, carrying a recorder wherever she went. We hear, among many other things: crickets, birdsong, wind, waves, babbling brooks, children—all of which eventually become indistinguishable from Satomimagae's own recording techniques and electronic effects. What sound like waves on “Metallic Gold' might also be speakers deprived of a musical source, hissing out air. What sounds like a brook on “Spells” might be the liquidy click of a recorder turning on and off. Rather than depicting a static, predictable world, these songs find in nature a kind of unsettling dynamism that shifts, moves, transforms, and folds in on the self.

The relatively linear and lucid songwriting of Satomimagae's previous albums gives way to something much more impressionistic and improvisatory. On “Omijinai”she hums idly, quietly establishing a pattern of tension and resolution between skeins of guitar. On “Tonbo,” her guitar is a textural tool, poised and paced, while equally capable of giving over to flights of spontaneous emotion. With one eye on the world, Satomimagae conjures her own shivery, bucolic ecosystem, inviting her listener to find in these sounds some kind of experiential truth. There is something essential and indescribable driving this music. You can't quite put your finger on what it is, but at times it is so beautiful you could just about live off of it.

							By 

	Tessa Stuart



	A few weeks after the November election, Allison Riggs and her husband were over at her parents' house in Durham, North Carolina for dinner. Riggs, a candidate for state Supreme Court, was still waiting for her race to be called, but she wasn't overly concerned with the delay. 


	A former elections lawyer, she knew that in close contests, the final results can often take days or weeks. And this race was close: On the evening of November 4, Riggs trailed by 10,000 votes, before she ultimately closed the gap, winning by a margin of just 734 out of more than 5.5 million ballots cast.


	Riggs, who was already serving on the North Carolina Supreme Court after being appointed by Gov. Roy Cooper to finish out the term of a retiring justice, assumed the counting (and recounting) would run its course and, at some point, the election would be certified. But 178 days later, the race still hasn't been called. 


	The ongoing saga represents both a breathtaking escalation in the GOP's war on free and fair elections, and a crucial test of the strategy Donald Trump's legal team explored using in 2024 but didn't need to, since he won.

	











	That night in Durham, at her parents house, was the first moment Riggs got the sense that this wasn't going to be a normal, protracted race. Offhand, her mother mentioned she had received some post-election “junk mail” from the Republican Party of North Carolina. “It said, ‘Your vote may be the subject of a protest.

	When she saw it, Riggs knew exactly what the mailer was — and she couldn't believe her opponent was challenging her own mother's vote. She'd later learn he was challenging her father's vote, too. Riggs' parents were among more than 65,000 North Carolina voters whose ballots her rival was seeking to have thrown out after those votes were lawfully cast and accepted by the state board of elections.

	In the run-up to last year's election, observers warned that Trump was contemplating a series of novel strategies to call the 2024 election results into question. All around the country, Republicans were taking control of election boards with the power to certify, or to refuse to certify, election results, and on the campaign trail, Trump was raising questions about the legitimacy of certain ballots — including those cast by military and overseas voters, and their children, some of whom are citizens but have never lived in the U.S. 

	











	Trump didn't end up using any of those tactics in the end — he didn't need to, as he won the 2024 election handily without them. 


	But Republican Court of Appeals Judge Jefferson Griffin — Riggs' opponent in the state Supreme Court race — appears to have taken a page out of the book Trump threw away. Griffin has refused to concede, even after two recounts confirmed Riggs' narrow victory. Instead, he filed a lawsuit arguing the state board of elections improperly allowed 60,000 people to register without providing their driver's licenses or Social Security numbers, and an additional 5,500 overseas voters improperly cast ballots without presenting a photo ID. 


	In January, the Supreme Court of North Carolina — the court on which Riggs continues to serve, as this all shakes out — intervened to prevent certification of the election and to allow Griffin's challenges to proceed through the lower courts. (Riggs recused herself from the matter.)


	The dispute has slowly been working its way through the courts since then, leaving a cascade of conflicting rulings in its wake as it does. The state board of elections unanimously upheld the election result and the local Superior Court dismissed Griffin's suit, before the North Carolina Court of Appeals — the court on which Griffin himself sits — ruled in their colleague's favor, declaring some 60,000 votes should be thrown out unless those voters came forward to verify their identities. (Griffin did not vote on the matter.) That decision was appealed to the state Supreme Court, which upheld it in part, declaring a smaller number — a few thousand votes — might be invalid. A federal district court has now stepped in, staying the state Supreme Court's order, while a judge considers the case; that judge — a Trump appointee — has indicated he plans to issue a ruling in the coming days.

	Riggs for her part, is committed to fighting to the very end. And as a former voting rights lawyer, she is uniquely prepared and motivated to see the case through to the end. 


	Riggs grew up in rural West Virginia, the eldest of four children. Both her father and one of her brothers served in the military and were deployed overseas. Riggs herself got an undergraduate degree in microbiology, a masters in history and, finally, a law degree at the University of Florida. As a law student after the 2000 election, Riggs became involved in the effort to restore voting rights to disenfranchised Floridians. 

	











	“When you talk about the Florida election in 2000, you think, ‘Oh, 537 votes decided who became president of the United States.' But in reality, there were tens of thousands of Floridians who were never allowed to cast a ballot because they had been permanently disenfranchised after a youthful mistake or an interaction with the criminal justice system.” 


	Now, she's fighting to ensure that voters who lawfully cast votes in November aren't retroactively stripped of their right to vote. There's more at stake than her election alone if Griffin and the Republican Party of North Carolina are allowed to reverse the outcome, Riggs says: “If this unconstitutional process happens, the toothpaste is out of the tube. You can't ever put it back in. People who would want to overturn election results that they don't like in the future have the green light; they wouldn't have a federal court saying ‘No, we're not going to put up with this.'”


	As this fight rages on, the U.S. House of Representatives just passed the SAVE Act — legislation that Princeton history professor and Rolling Stone contributor Sean Wilentz has called “the most extraordinary attack on voting rights in American history [and] an attempt to destroy American democracy as we know it.”

	The SAVE Act is unlikely to make it through the U.S. Senate, but as Rolling Stone recently reported, it's part of a larger GOP jihad on voting rights across the country, with Republicans in state legislatures having introduced more than 2,000 election-related bills since legislative sessions began in January. 


	Riggs, for her part, is digging in. “I am committed to fighting day in and day out in federal court until we get this right,” she says. “However long it takes, however hard I need to fight, I won this election. The voters spoke and the voters who put trust in me to continue serving in my constitutional office. Now this is my chance to keep faith with them and to fight for what they hired me to fight for, which is their constitutional rights.”

	There is an alt-timeline in which Rust, writer-director Joel Souza's pulpy and pathos-fueled Western, is just another tale of an outlaw in his autumn years. It's simply the latest entry in a genre whose century-plus history is filled with similarly modest sagebrush epics. After a brief theatrical run, a slightly longer tenure on VOD and a lifetime of cable re-runs every Father's Day, this frontier opus would trot off into the sunset as a footnote in Alec Baldwin‘s post-30 Rock, pre-reality TV show career. You know, the kind of perfectly watchable mediocrity you'd be content to catch on Starz at 1am on a weeknight.


Rust would very much like to be all of those things. It is not. It cannot be. This austere throwback is fated to be forever known as the movie in which its star accidentally fired a gun with a live round and fatally wounded a crew member. Even without the ensuing investigations, trials, near-trials, no-contest pleas, hurled accusations and media brouhaha surrounding every aspect of the aftermath, it would still be a film haunted by what happened to the late cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on set. There's a true-crime aura that hangs over every scene like a shroud — an unshakable sense that you're not watching a Western so much as a ghost story.

	











	Oh, Rust most definitely is a Western, complete with horses, gunfights, and men who appear to bathe once every financial quarter. And it's one that benefits from a funereal look that favors gorgeous silhouettes posed against horizons, dusky landscape portraits, and the sort of inky, shadow-heavy interior shots that would make The Godfather‘s Gordon “Prince of Darkness” Willis proud. There are some images here that make you gasp, others that communicate in shorthand a sense of history fading away, and still others that do some heavy lifting in terms of getting you emotionally engaged. The fact that Hutchins' work here is the best thing the movie has going for it only compounds both the irony and the tragedy. (Bianca Cline is co-credited for the cinematography, and while it's impossible to suss out who lit and lensed which specific scenes, it's safe to assume that Cline was working from a template set down by her predecessor.) There are plentiful arguments as to why production should have ceased after that accident, and why the eventually finished end result should never seen the light of day. That this film puts Hutchins' talent and sense of artistry on such prominent display is a major reason to give it a release, limited or otherwise. Her legacy is right up there onscreen.

	Yet Rust‘s bona fides as a moving tribute to a victim of on-set carelessness, down to its credits-roll dedication and highlight of a Hutchins quote about always striving to make things better, can't fully counteract a certain tabloid-fodder feeling. Are we taking in a horse opera aiming for the moody, revisionist strains of the great, gritty 1970s Westerns, or rubbernecking at the scene of a crime? This is what viewers have to contend with. This is what we can't help but talk about when we talk about Rust, whether Baldwin, Souza, or anyone else involved like it or not. We do not envy the marketing team. It's one thing to recognize that the death of a key creator, due to a perfect storm of horrific circumstances that are still being debated over (and likely always will be), is embedded into the movie's DNA. It's another to try to ignore it or willfully push it out of your mind while engaging with its death-of-the-west narrative.


	Right, the story. An old-timey font informs us we're in the Wyoming Territory, “The Year of Our Lord 1882.” Lucas Hollister (Patrick Scott McDermott) tends to the family ranch and the care of his younger brother, Jacob (Easton Malcolm). Their parents have long since left this earthly plane. A trip into town begets an encounter with a bully, which later begets self-defense, a killing and a trial. Lucas is set to hang. Two strangers come to visit. One is the boys' grandaunt; she's played by Frances Fisher, which instantly brings to mind the both the gravitas of Unforgiven and the memory of how she once turned a simple declaration (“She's going to live!”) into a clinic on why it's not just the dialogue but the way you deliver it that matters.

	The other is Harlan Rust, a graybeard desperado who rides into town and liberates Lucas from the promise of a hangman's rope. This is Baldwin's character, and appearing some 25 minutes into Rust, his entrance sets the film properly, if belatedly into motion. Harlan's job is to ferry the boy to freedom far from the clutches of the law. A sheriff (Josh Hopkins) with one foot in the modern world — he's “kept files, used forensics, instead of just relying on good, old-fashioned pursuit and capture” to bring fugitives in — goes after them. So does a bounty hunter (Dune: Prophecy‘s Travis Fimmel) with a penchant for Bible quotes. Along the way, the duo bicker, and bond, and encounter a host of interchangeable character actors who appear to have waited their entire career for the chance to appear in a grungy Western.

	











	All of this would be forgettable, unremarkable, a decent diversion to kill time between Louis L'Amour novels and Gianni Garko Italo-Western marathons. And then the memory of notoriety rears its head, and once again, you find yourself questioning the good, bad and ugly taste of it all. Rust will indeed be a footnote in Baldwin's career, but not in the way he might have hoped. It will be a testament to the work of a brilliant cinematographer, but not in the way you, or anybody else, wants it to be — an ending, rather than a beginning.

	It's been a bumpy road for Halo developers Bungie over the last few years. After releasing its last big game, Destiny 2, in 2017, the once-industry leading studio has mostly focused on frequent updates and upheavals surrounding the cooperative online shooter — which have fluctuated in quality between middling (2023's Lightfall) and groundbreaking (2024's The Final Shape). Despite having helped define the last 25 years of first-person shooters with the original Halo trilogy, Bungie has spent the last decade focusing exclusively on live-service games like Destiny.


	And while the franchise helped usher in the current era of gaming where live-service models are intended to take over players' lives for years on end (think: Fortnite and Call of Duty: Warzone), the landscape has become more tumultuous since Destiny arrived in 2014, as publishers race to get their piece of the now-saturated market. For every surprise hit like PlayStation's Helldivers 2 (2024) that manages to break through the noise, there's far more flops, with games like Anthem (2022) and Concord (2024) arriving dead on arrival and shuttering their servers shortly after launch. In a market where ongoing games are only as good as their last update, even successful titles like Diablo IV (2023) regularly take a beating as fan interest ebbs and flows seasonally.

	











	With an unstable market dominated by a select few games, now might be the worst possible time to debut a new live-service shooter, but that's exactly what Bungie hopes to do with this year's Marathon (out Sept. 23). As the first new game produced by the studio since its acquisition by Sony Interactive Entertainment in 2022, Marathon has a lot riding on its success — even more so than most. Just two years after being folded into the PlayStation Studios portfolio, Bungie was hit was massive layoffs in August 2024 (losing 17 percent of its staff) while Sony themselves quietly killed multiple live-service games in the wake of Concord's disastrous implosion — including one set in PlayStation's flagship The Last of Us universe.

					The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time		
	









	But everyone loves an underdog story. Could one of the industry's most beloved studios defy the odds and make the next great online shooter? Based on early impressions from Marathon's closed alpha test (running April 23 to May 2), the answer's unclear — but potentially dire. Rolling Stone participated in the playtest; here are our biggest takeaways.

	











	Although it's new to many, Marathon is actually a revival of one of Bungie's earliest series. Before Halo: Combat Evolved made Xbox a household name, the Marathon trilogy (released annually from 1994 to 1996) attempted to give Macintosh its own killer IP. Set on a futuristic sci-fi world, the games played similarly to Doom, serving as Apple's answer to the first-person juggernaut that had taken PC by storm.


	2025's Marathon isn't exactly a direct follow-up but is set in the same world as the originals. Players take on the role of Runners, survivors of a human colony tasked with scavenging resources from the planet Tau Ceti IV in the year 2893. Runners aren't like the average person, having opted to sacrifice their mortal forms for cybernetically constructed bodies that can be reprinted to use over and over after every death.


	The game is an extraction shooter — a genre where players are tasked with infiltrating a zone, scavenging resources and completing missions while surviving environmental threats and assaults by other Runners, before finding an exfiltration point to escape with their bounty. Unlike battle royale games like Fortnite and Warzone, or even hero shooters like Overwatch and Valorant, the extraction shooter is a somewhat less saturated genre (at least to mainstream audiences).

	The reigning king of the genre is 2017's Escape from Tarkov, a game with a dedicated hardcore audience, but the most popular extraction shooter the general public might've actually played is Helldivers 2, which exploded in users after arriving in early 2024. Both games are known for their extreme difficulty, highly dependent on squad cooperation and survival, making them far less accessible to casual players than something like Fortnite.


Marathon aims to bridge the accessibility gap, streamlining the gameplay to some core hero abilities for each distinct Runner and providing solid, yet familiar gunplay that Bungie has perfected while developing Halo and Destiny. Players are assigned to three-person squads and dropped in a zone of their choice from a growing list as they progress. The goal is simple: get in, fill your pockets, and get out in under 25 minutes.


	Being simple doesn't make it easy, however, as the world is filled with hazards. The most frequent opponents are CPU-controlled enemies that patrol outposts filled with loot. Breaching these areas and killing bots will trigger periodic airdrops of more AI enemies, in increasing frequency and threat levels. Environmental dangers are also prevalent, with certain chambers booby trapped to fill with toxic gas and acidic natural hazards waiting to chip away at precious health. You can also just fall to your death, a common occurrence for anyone who chooses a Runner without a dedicated double jump or dash ability to soften their descent.

	











	The biggest threat players will face are other human-controlled Runners. Up to six squads can appear on the same map in groups of three (meaning 18 players total) — all with the same basic goal. While games like Warzone are PvP (player vs player) and Destiny are PvE (player vs environment), Marathon is technically PvPvE (player vs player vs environment), meaning that fire fights between users can turn into larger skirmishes against the CPU-controlled baddies and the hazards of the world to boot.


	The first thing Marathon asks players to do is choose a Runner, each with their own distinct abilities and gameplay styles. In the closed alpha test, four were made available: Locus, Glitch, Blackbird, and Void. Each Runner adheres to a basic archetype that should be familiar to anyone who's played a class-based game before.


	Locus is a soldier-type with a shoulder-mounted missile launcher, energy shield, and passive traits like a boost thruster and tactical sprint. Glitch is another more mobile rogue-type, with a double jump, slide, and a prime ability that amps up her dexterity. Blackbird and Void are stealthier types, with the former taking on recon duties to reveal enemy locations and the latter capable of turning invisible and shrouding the squad in smoke.


	Two more Runners will be available at launch, but during the playtest, it was most common to see squads filled with dupes of Blackbird and Void. With their ability to both ping enemy squads and veil their allies, the reconnaissance Runners held much higher value in most maps than the ones predicated on moment-to-moment action. Partly because the goal is to avoid trouble when possible, and the inherent advantages of tricking other players for easy kills, it's easy to see why they'd be favorites. The size of each map and the rhythm of each incursion means that there aren't going to be that many shootouts, and the move sets of Locus and Glitch aren't so overwhelmingly powerful that they outweigh the importance of stealth.


	Bungie has confirmed that there will be two additional Runners at launch, and of course more to come post-release, but for now it's just these stock characters.


	After starting up a run on a chosen map, players must make their way around different facilities, raiding trunks, chests, and wall-mounted med bay packs for … mostly junk. There's credits, grenades, shield and health kids to scavenge, on top of tons of materials whose inherent value isn't really made clear at first — or ever, really. Although backpacks can be upgraded to house more loot, most of what's found will quickly fill up your inventory after just a couple of minutes searching. Most of what's found doesn't really apply to the gameplay in real time — even the guns pilfered from enemy corpses end up being marginal upgrades best used as a swap once ammo is low.

	











	The core gameplay loop boils down to creeping through buildings, killing CPU enemies, and hopefully avoiding getting shot in the back of the head by another team long enough to escape with the payload intact to add to your overall inventory for the next go around. On death, everything is lost — and death comes hard, fast, and frequent. It can be incredibly frustrating to trudge around a map in relative silence for 20 plus minutes lining your pockets, only to end up with nothing after catching a long-range bullet from someone else looking for some action.


	Over time, the pattern becomes clearer as corporate contracts tied to specific loot types give some of the inventory purpose. Individual contracts can be selected prior to dropping into a match, and are the game's primary form of long-term progression, allowing for permanent upgrades that make each run a little more meaningful. But for the first couple of hours, it's hard to see the forest beyond the trees. What's the point of nabbing all this stuff if it doesn't have a direct payoff? What value do all these grenades and stimulants have if you're barely going to be engaging in conflict?


	When there is engagement, gunplay is tight. True to their roots with Halo and Destiny, Bungie knows how to make shooting feel good. But outside of clearing out platoons of robots with crunchy trigger pulls and well-timed headshots, there's not enough moment-to-moment action to fill up each 25-minute mission. Players inevitably resort to racing around trying to find other squads to fight for a thrill, but even then, the Heat system limits how fast or long players can sprint, meaning it ends being a schlep to stumble on a potential encounter.


	Not really!


	The game's setup somewhat resembles Apex Legends, the 60-person battle royale that also sees three-man squads dropped into a sprawling map to fight for survival. But where Apex's movement is fast-paced and its ever-dwindling map size forces players together over time to ratchet up tension, Marathon feels slow and mundane by comparison. Depending on the circumstances, it's entirely possible to drop in, grab your payday, and dip out without ever even running into another squad — which frankly shouldn't be possible.


	A game of Apex always begins quietly, but it's a given that the resource collection and strategic movement will ultimately end in a frenzy toward the end. Here, it's plausible that the biggest risk factor will be getting left behind during exfiltration and having to wait a minute for the exit interval while hiding in hopes nobody comes to take your pocket junk.

	











	There are moments when the game's vision comes into play. Creeping through an eerily lit laboratory, rustling through lockers and chest only to pause at the rat-a-tat of machine gun fire in the distance — there's a moodiness to the proceedings that superficially resembles the grim science fiction setting the developers want to create. But beyond those few and far between emergent moments, the game is genuinely boring.


	Bungie has managed to master both the pulse-pounding thrill of PvP multiplayer with Halo and the loot-filled cooperative dungeon crawl with Destiny, and theoretically, Marathon should fall in a sweet spot just in between. And while its uniquely colorful visual design and world-building differentiate it from umpteen other shooters on the market, its world is hollow and devoid of life — and most tragically, excitement.


	There will be some diehards who have managed to wring the juice out of Marathon after just over a week of playtesting, but they'll be in the minority. As a live-service game, it's obviously intended to start out with a foundation to build upon over time, but right now, just a few months shy of its release date, what's on display feels undercooked. If it were free-to-play game, there might be enough to warrant an initial time investment without a sunken cost, but the game is planned to launch as a premium paid title, although likely less than a full-priced $60 or $70 game.


	On paper, Marathon should have all the makings of a pretty slick multiplayer experience. In practice, it's overplaying its hand. While a streamlined approach to the extraction shooter genre from the studio behind Halo and Destiny sounds like a recipe for casual and hardcore gamer gold, the execution leaves all the hype behind. An 18-person survival game set to a ticking clock shouldn't be this sleepy.

	Sure, the game is still technically a work-in-progress, but without a major delay to overhaul or add on new systems that makes faster, more meaningful, and most importantly, more fun, it feels like this could end up being just another flash in the pan games players will quickly forget.


Marathon is scheduled to release on Sept. 23 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Windows PC.

	Six days after previewing the song at the semi-annual Light Up The Blues charity show, Neil Young has officially released “Let's Roll Again” from his upcoming LP Talkin' To the Trees, which arrives June 13. It may sound like a sequel to his 2002 September 11 song “Let's Roll,” but it's actually a plea for auto manufacturers to act responsibly and create more electric vehicles.


	“C'mon Ford, C'mon GM,” he sings. “C'mon Chrysler, let's roll again/Build somethin' useful, people need/Build us a safe way for us to be/Build us somethin' won't kill our kids.”


	This doesn't, however, mean he wants people to support Elon Musk and buy Teslas. “If yer a fascist/Then get a Tesla,” he sings. “If it's electric, it doesn't matter.” (Two decades back, Young created his own electric vehicle, Lincvolt. The saga is chronicled on his 2009 LP Fork in the Road.)


Talkin' To The Trees is Young's first album with his new band, the Chrome Hearts, which includes guitarist Micah Nelson, organist Spooner Oldham, bassist Corey McCormick, and drummer Anthony Logerfo. (The band is essentially Promise of the Real minus Lukas Nelson, with Oldham added in.) In January, Young shared the Talkin' To The Trees album cut “Big Change.”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Neil Young assembled the Chrome Hearts last year after unspecified health matters forced him to call off a tour with Crazy Horse last summer at the halfway point. They played their first show of the year at Light Up The Blues on April 26. The set included not just the live debut of “Let's Roll Again,” but also the first performance of “Ordinary People” since 1988.

	They recorded Talkin' To The Trees late last year at Shangri-La studios in Malibu, California, with producer Lou Adler. Young's longtime associate John Hanlon served as the engineer. “In my humble opinion, this is shaping up to be a completely unique and soulfully introspective album of songs,” Hanlon wrote earlier this year on the Neil Young Archives, “that run the gamut from a palette of beautiful acoustic style pastels to in-your-face loud, irreverent rock ‘n roll paint splatter on the canvas in the vein of a Jackson Pollack painting.”

	











	Neil Young and the Chrome Hearts kick off a world tour June 18 at Dalhalla, Rättvik, Sweden. The U.S. leg begins August 8 in Charlotte, North Carolina, and wraps up September 15 in Los Angeles.

	President Donald Trump suggested that congressional Republicans should expel Democratic lawmakers from Congress in response to a so-far small impeachment push that has not been endorsed by party leadership. 


	In a lengthy Truth Social post published late Thursday night, the president wrote: “The Democrats are really out of control. They have lost everything, especially their minds! These Radical Left Lunatics are into the ‘Impeachment thing' again. They have already got two ‘No Name,' little respected Congressmen, total Whackjobs both, throwing the ‘Impeachment' of DONALD J. TRUMP around.” 


	“The Republicans should start to think about expelling them from Congress for all of the crimes that they have committed, especially around Election time(s),” Trump continued, calling Democrats “very dishonest people that won't let our Country heal” and “total LOWLIFES, who hate our Country, and everything it stands for.”


	“Perhaps we should start playing this game on them, and expel Democrats for the many crimes that they have committed,” the president wrote.

	Democrats are not wholly on board with the idea of impeaching Trump for a third time, with House Democratic Conference Chair Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.) telling Semafor that impeachment is “not an exercise that we're willing to undertake.” Last week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said impeachment was “too far away to even judge,” as a viable option for the current moment. 


	There is no evidence that Democrats committed any crimes against Trump — as he claimed in his post on Thursday, mentioning Sen. Adam Schiff, specifically — but the president has repeatedly made his thirst for revenge clear, and since taking office again has moved to exact it both through social media directive and through leveraging the hard power of the federal government he now controls.


	In March, after months of threats on the campaign trail, Trump attempted to undo preemptive pardons granted to members of the Jan. 6 committee whom Trump had singled out as potential prosecution targets. “The ‘Pardons' that Sleepy Joe Biden gave to the Unselect Committee of Political Thugs, and many others, are hereby declared VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.

	While no member of Congress has yet been charged by Trump's administration, the White House seems to be getting comfortable with using the justice system to retaliate or make an example of political rivals. The FBI last week made a public show of arresting Milwaukee Judge Hannah Dugan after accusing her of obstructing the arrest of an undocumented migrant. The administration has also launched an investigation into Chris Krebs, the former Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, who in 2020 debunked false claims that Trump had lost the election to fraud. 


	The retribution is only just beginning. On Wednesday, White House “Border Czar” Tom Homan was asked by a reporter why the administration doesn't just “arrest the leaders” of sanctuary cities and sanctuary states, “for harboring and shielding illegal aliens, actually, terrorists from deportation.” Homan's response can only be interpreted as a threat: “Wait and see what's coming.”

The fascination with extra-terrestrial life extends well before the arrival of ET on our cinema screens. For some, the possibility of what could exist beyond our planet isn't just a fleeting curiosity; it's become an ongoing pursuit, with dedicated individuals investing time and effort into documenting potential UFO sightings.

It appears their dedication may have paid off.

Now referred to as Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), these mysterious sightings are drawing serious attention. The UAP Disclosure Fund is at the forefront, actively monitoring for any unusual activity and advocating for governmental transparency regarding such encounters.

A panel was convened on May 1st by the group, working alongside the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability. The event brought together congress members and principal UAP specialists and saw the unveiling of an extraordinary new photo that depicts a presumed UAP.

 This substantial image was shared on X, previously known as Twitter, and captures what looks like a large white disc over the landscape where New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Colorado meet, reports the Mirror. 

Described as having been taken by a civilian pilot from above, the post detailing the image says: ""Captured near Four Corners at FL210-estimated 600-1,000 ft in diameter, silver-hued, disc-shaped.

""Released moments ago by @LueElizondo during our ""Science, National Security and Innovation"" panel. Several speakers confirmed DoD and IC hold hundreds of similar UAP images + sensor files still classified. It's time for full declassification and open scientific analysis.""

A photograph purporting to show a UAP has sparked intense debate, with some hailing it as proof of extraterrestrial life and others dismissing it as a hoax. The image, shared by Lue Elizondo, appears to show a large, disk-shaped object hovering in the air.

However, many have questioned the authenticity of the photo, with some suggesting it is simply a picture of a crop circle. One person wrote: ""This is clearly a crop circle, not a UAP. Mislabelling known terrestrial phenomena erodes public trust and undermines legitimate disclosure efforts. Please correct this mistake - your reputation is on the line.""

Others have mocked the poor quality of the image, with one commenting: ""WOW is that 14k virtual reality definition? I can make out every detail of it. ....at least have the s****y photo professionally scanned for God sakes. The flash is glaring off it.""

Lue Elizondo, a former Pentagon official, has been a prominent figure in the UAP community, having joined the Pentagon's UAP programme in 2008. He has long claimed that the Pentagon is hiding evidence of UFOs from the public.

After leaving his government role in 2017, Luis Elizondo made the astonishing claim that he had worked with ""alien"" technology during his time at the Pentagon, and even alleged that ""bodies"" had been recovered from several sites. In his 2017 book, Imminent: Inside the Pentagon's Hunt for UFOs, Elizondo revealed his shocking take on the infamous 1947 Roswell incident in New Mexico, stating that not one but two flying saucers were involved, and that ""four deceased non-human bodies"" were recovered from the wreckage and subjected to examination.

He further alleged: ""I have held in my hand material that scientists for the US government have conducted research on, and they've said: 'This is very special material, it's highly unlikely that it's made by human beings – and it's engineered.""

Elizondo also claimed to have handled biological samples that defied explanation, saying: ""I've also held in my hand biological samples, tissue samples, that have been removed from human beings – that when analysed, do not behave like anything that we are normally used to associating with being a natural part of the human body, and certainly looks to be some sort of technical device.""

Elizondo is now on a mission to push the government to come clean about the alleged alien conspiracy, but a recent photo has sparked a backlash from some of his fans. He has stated: ""I wanted to be able to tell the American public my experiences and what the government has been doing for a very long time, not just when I was in the program, but for decades about the government's interest in UFOs.""

They're getting lost in the saucer.

A new photo claiming to show a 1,000-foot-wide UFO in the American Southwest has been released by unidentified aerial phenomenon disclosure activists — but critics claim the “disclosure” is more of an embarrassing mistake.

Controversial former Department of Defense employee and activist Luis “Lue” Elizondo hosted a UAP Disclosure Fund-organized panel during which he released an alleged photo of a “1,000-foot”-wide, silver, disc-shaped flying saucer.

“Captured near Four Corners at FL20 — estimated 600 – 1,000 ft in diameter, silver-hued, disc-shaped,” the UAP Disclosure Fund posted on X.

“Several speakers confirmed [Department of Defense] and [Intelligence Community] hold hundreds of similar UAP images + sensor files still classified,” the advocacy group alleged, adding, “It's time for full declassification and open scientific analysis.”

The grainy photo was allegedly snapped by a commercial airline pilot in 2021 flying at 21,000 feet near the Four Corners landmark joining parts of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Colorado, Elizondo claimed.He pointed to the apparent shadow cast by the large “lenticular” object as part of the evidence for the existence of a physical craft in the photo.

The UAP disclosure advocate claimed the photo was taken by an “average camera” — but stated he “could not vouch for the veracity of this photograph, because I didn't take it,” video showed.

Critics were quick to challenge the presentation — with many eagle-eyed debunkers claiming the photo merely showed irrigation circles that are common in desert climates.

Noted UAP debunker Mick West pointed out that shadow patterns in the hills are counterfactual to the claim that the object is creating its own shadow, according to a blog post.

Elizondo has previously come under fire for presenting evidence of UAPs or UFOs that were later debunked — with the Pentagon pushing back against claims that alien life is present on Earth.

The UAP Disclosure Fund panel included US Reps. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) and Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.) and Harvard astrophysicist Professor Avi Loeb for a discussion Thursday in Washington, DC.

Astrophysicist and nuclear engineer Eric Davis, another member of the panel, claimed during the event that there are four types of alien species that have visited planet Earth, namely “grays,” “Nordics,” “reptilian” and “insectoid.”

Thrilling new play based on the global horror phenomenon makes North American debut in limited run at STC.

Shakespeare Theatre Company has announced the addition of a strictly limited two-week engagement of the thrilling new play, Paranormal Activity: A New Story Live on Stage, a special add-on production for the 25/26 season. An original story set in the world of the terrifying Paranormal Activity film franchise, the production will run in STC's Harman Hall from January 28 – February 7, 2026. The show is presented in a co-production with Chicago Shakespeare Theater, Center Theatre Group, and American Conservatory Theater.

The haunting thriller is written by celebrated playwright Levi Holloway, whose Tony-nominated Grey House premiered on Broadway in 2023. The production is directed by Felix Barrett, pioneering founder and artistic director of the acclaimed Punchdrunk — whose immersive Sleep No More played more than 5,000 performances in a record-breaking 14-year run.

Synopsis: James and Lou move from Chicago to London to escape their past… An original story set in the world of the terrifying Paranormal Activity film franchise, this thrilling new play will haunt you long after the lights go out. We can't say anything else.

Paranormal Activity's sold-out UK premiere was hailed “a delicious mix of fear and excitement” (North West End) — urging “make sure you have someone's hand to hold” (Yorkshire Times).

“Writing Paranormal Activity: A New Story Live on Stage, collaborating with Felix Barrett in London — working to create an actual nightmare — has been a dream,” said playwright Holloway. “We strived to create something impossible, mixing the familiar with the uncanny, heart with horror. American audiences have a nose for honesty on stage and little patience for anything else. They'll find it here, right alongside all the mischief we've made to trouble their sleep.”

Tickets for the STC run of the show are currently available exclusively to 25/26 season subscribers. Tickets will go on sale to the general public later this summer.

My 20-minute presentation at the UAP congressional briefing on May 1, 2025 (of which the full video, including presentations by other panelists, is accessible here) started with the following statements.

Let us be honest: there are objects in the sky that we do not understand. When we do not understand what 85% of the matter in the universe is, we invest billions of dollars to find out the nature of that dark matter. Given that the U.S. government reports about Unidentified Anomalous Objects (UAPs), I say: let us invest a billion dollars in figuring out their nature through rigorous scientific research. If we find that all UAPs are human made, some by adversarial nations, then at the very least we will have at our possession state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and sensor systems that are of great value for national security. On the other hand, even if one in a billion of these UAPs happens to be extraterrestrial in origin, its discoverers will be awarded the Nobel prize. This is a win-win situation.

On the day before the congressional briefing, I visited the Pentagon and echoed these sentiments. If we do not find evidence for extraterrestrial technologies, I will be proud that the AI tools and sensors being developed will be used to protect our nation against human-made terrestrial threats.

The scientific study of UAP offers a unique opportunity to spend a billion dollars on AI and frontier science and make taxpayers happy. There is no bigger scientific question that the public cares about than “Are we alone?” If there are smarter kids on our cosmic block, we can learn from them.

Recovering an extraterrestrial gadget might provide us with access to advanced technologies faster than it would take us to develop them from scratch. Our current scientific knowledge is an island in an ocean of ignorance. A civilization that benefitted from millennia of science after discovering quantum mechanics, might have quantum-gravity engineers that attach a negative mass to a payload and allow it to escape gravity without fuel.

The briefing was attended by the honorable House Representatives Anna Paulina Luna, Nick Begich, Eric Burlison and Tim Burchett. I showed the cover page of a New-York Times Magazine feature story: “How a Harvard Professor Became the World's Leading Alien Hunter?” and mentioned that I was not happy with that reporting and told the editor: if we cannot trust what you publish about science, how can we believe what you post about politics?

New scientific knowledge does not fall into our lap. I reiterated a new variant of my bet with Elon Musk, namely I am willing to put 1% of my net worth against 1% of his net worth and check whether Elon is the most accomplished space entrepreneur since the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago.

Subsequently, I described the extensive work done by the Galileo Project team, including the construction and operation of three new UAP observatories that will collect new data on a few million objects per year by monitoring the sky in the infrared, optical, radio and audio, and searching for outliers using state-of-the-art AI software.

The Galileo Project is also planning to search for large pieces of the interstellar meteor IM1 using a robot with a video feed. I concluded with a sunset photo of me with Art Wright, who served as party chief of our first ocean expedition to retrieve spherules from IM1's fireball site in the Pacific Ocean. Art is a problem solver, an admirable outlier in today's culture of virtue signaling. His approach is the one I embrace for resolving the mystery of UAPs.

In a podcast interview earlier this week, I was asked: “What would you like to be remembered for?” My answer was: “For my future work. The best is yet to come.”

Many of my colleagues adopt what they regard as the voice of reason in avoiding UAPs. At the same time, they brush anomalies under the carpet, by cataloging near-Earth objects with unusual trajectories as “Empty Trash Bag Objects” — implying that they are broken pieces of human-made satellites pushed by sunlight, and by labeling anomalous interstellar objects like `Oumuamua — which exhibited a similar push away from the Sun, as “Dark Comets”.

Starting this summer, the Rubin observatory in Chile, funded by NSF and DOE, might find family members of `Oumuamua that could be studied further with the Webb telescope. Labeling anomalies with names that imply conventional interpretations and then insisting that there is nothing anomalous about them, is not a wise long-term strategy. Reality does not care about our ignorance. While most humans insisted that the Earth is at the physical center of the Universe, the Earth continued to revolve around the Sun. This was captured by the phrase attributed to Galileo Galilei: “Epour si mouve.”

Following the scientific tradition established by Galileo, we must seek more evidence in figuring out anomalies. With the investment of a billion dollars in resolving the nature of UAPs, we are likely to gain new knowledge. In reply to a question by the moderator, Lue Elizondo, I highlighted my hope that the younger generation will find the nature of UAPs out of raw curiosity and without being trapped in prejudice. This is why I am excited to construct a Galileo Project observatory in a new science education campus near Purdue University, Indiana, aimed to inspire the next generation of curious kids.

I choose every day to think like a kid and not interpret anomalies as manifestations of known things. It is not an easy choice, being surrounded by colleagues who pretend to behave like the adults in the room and insist that they know the answer in advance.

Discovering extraterrestrial life has tantalized the public imagination as far back as Epicurean philosophers in Ancient Greece. Yet despite centuries of speculation, the search for alien lifeforms remains frustratingly behind the starting line. For the most part, the various proclamations have fallen well short, with countless false alarms ranging from alien radio signals to UFO fragments beneath the Pacific giving most a healthy dose of skepticism when evaluating new ""evidence"" of alien lifeforms. And yet, studies find that belief in extraterrestrial life is at an all-time high, with nearly a quarter of Americans stating that they'd seen a UFO with their own eyes. 

But those yearning for credible evidence of alien lifeforms may be in luck, as researchers from the University of Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy claim to have found the most compelling argument yet of extraterrestrial life. The study, published in the scientific journal Astrophysical Journal Letters, states that atmospheric analysis of the planet K2-18b revealed the presence of two gases that, on Earth, are created only by microbial organisms. 

The team obtained this evidence using NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, a telescope designed to study the earliest periods of the universe and a key cog in astronomers' search for life beyond our planet. This evidence, it argues, suggests K2-18b, a sub-Neptune planet nearly nine times larger than Earth and 124 light-years away, may be covered by a hydrogen-rich ocean full of organisms like phytoplankton. If confirmed, it would be the first proof of extraterrestrial life and a major leap in man's understanding of the cosmos.




Led by Professor Nikku Madhusudhan, the researchers used NASA's $10 billion space telescope to measure the atmospheric components of K2-18b through a process called the transit method. Used by NASA to discover over 3,000 new exoplanets, an easy way to understand it is to imagine a solar eclipse in miniature: as a planet orbits a star, it reaches a point where it passes directly between its star and the satellite, temporarily blocking some of the starlight reaching the telescope. Interestingly, the light changes color as it passes through the atmosphere, allowing scientists to measure its size, temperature, and chemical composition. 

Madhusudhan previously made headlines in 2023 when his team used this method to discover the presence of methane and carbon dioxide in K2-18b's atmosphere  –- the first ever found in an exoplanet located in a star's habitable zone. This isa strong indicator that the planet could be hospitable. During this study, the team also found small traces of dimethyl sulfide, a compound made of sulfur, carbon, and hydrogen, which astrobiologists have long considered a potential indicator of extraterrestrial life. 

This time, looking at a different set of wavelengths, Madhusudhan found stronger evidence — up to a supposed 99.7% certainty  — that K2-18b's atmosphere contained two gases typically generated by lifeforms like algae: dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide. According to Madhusudhan, this evidence suggests that K2-18b is a Hycean planet, a name used to describe exoplanets covered by a hydrogen ocean potentially teeming with life. 




While scientists applauded Madhusudan's work, they also remain skeptical. For starters, some are wary of the study's novel use of the James Webb Telescope, noting this type of data was difficult to obtain and decipher. Others, like Director of the Seti Institute's Carl Sagan Center Nathalie Cabrol, expressed concern over the data itself, it comes with several caveats. For instance, not only were the detection levels low enough to be a false positive, but the gases' infrared indicators were so similar that the telescope couldn't distinguish between them. Stephen Schmidt, an astronomer at Johns Hopkins, likewise noted to the Scientific American that the findings were ""pretty noisy,"" possibly a result of ""statistical fluctuations."" The researchers, for their part, state that there is a .3% chance of statistical error, well below the 0.00006% typically required of scientific discoveries. 

The study's conclusions are also somewhat controversial. While dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide are formed on Earth exclusively by living organisms, it doesn't mean they cannot be made abiotically. In fact, scientists have found several instances of such, even once discovering them on a lifeless comet. One paper posited that an inhospitable magma ocean could also produce these gases on K2-18b. Such arguments highlight the greatest concern regarding the study: it's missing the planetary context necessary to adequately evaluate its results, like the composition of the planet's surface or atmosphere. 

Madhusudan, for his part, cautioned that additional observations were required to confirm his team's results, particularly the need to investigate the potential abiotic production of dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide. With these caveats in mind, the Cambridge study's lasting impact may be that it kicks off an exciting era of experiments centered on K2-18b. Whether it results in the ultimate discovery, however, remains to be seen.","{'href': 'https://www.slashgear.com', 'title': 'SlashGear'}","other"

The film illustrates the near-impossibility of upward mobility during the segregation era.

This article contains light spoilers for Sinners.

Sinners is a symphony of vampire bites, gunshot wounds, people being staked in the heart and left to burn alive. Ryan Coogler's film about twin gangsters trying to strike it rich in the Jim Crow South rapidly swerves toward supernatural horror when an ancient vampire seeks a way into the juke joint the twins have set up with their ill-gotten gains. But the true horror in the film is the economics of Jim Crow, which drives every event in the plot, including the vampire bloodbath that ultimately cuts the musical revelry—and the twins' dreams—short.

Coogler's films tend to incorporate deep historical research that gets revealed subtly through brief, easy-to-miss moments and story details. Sinners is almost two movies in one: a vampire slaughterhouse film that's also a period piece about the near-impossibility of upward mobility in the segregation economy. The sawmill the twins convert into their juke joint becomes a bloody trap from which there is no escape, much like the system they are born into and seek to transcend.

The movie's protagonists, the Smokestack Twins, known as Smoke and Stack (both played by Michael B. Jordan), are flamboyant entrepreneurs and World War I veterans returning  from Chicago to Clarksdale, Mississippi, a city long associated with the blues, in the 1930s. One of the twins remarks that Chicago is merely “Mississippi with tall buildings,” and the viewer is left to speculate why, but history offers at least one possible explanation. In 1919, just after the end of World War I, Black veterans in Chicago would have witnessed one of the worst race riots of that “Red Summer” of lynchings, sparked by the death of a Black teenager named Eugene Williams, who drowned after a white man threw rocks at him while he was swimming in Lake Michigan. Williams had apparently drifted across an invisible whites-only line that the man who killed him was enforcing. The police refused to arrest the perpetrator, and dozens of Black and white people were killed in the ensuing violence, which saw white mobs rampaging through Black neighborhoods.

Black World War I veterans, some of whom defended their communities during the riot, were themselves frequently targeted for racial violence rather than admired for their service, as the Equal Justice Initiative notes; segregationist legislators feared they would return and expect to be treated as equals. The Mississippi Senator James K. Vardaman warned that, for the Black soldier, military service was “but a short step to the conclusion that his political rights must be respected.” The historian Chad Williams writes in Torchbearers of Democracy: African American Soldiers in the World War I Era that “conflict in the South and the major urban race riots of the postwar era reflected the conscious determination of many black veterans, emboldened and politicized by their army experience, to resist continued subjugation.”

That context helps explain the twins' cavalier attitude toward the white man they purchase the juke joint from in the film. When Smoke and Stack tell him they'll kill any KKK member who trespasses on their property, the seller, secretly a Klan leader, falsely insists the KKK no longer exists. In actuality, the second incarnation of the Klan remained influential, but Klan denial was a common propaganda strategy. We later learn that the capital the twins use to buy the property was stolen from the Irish and Italian mobs in Chicago, for whom the twins worked before returning to Mississippi. It would have been very difficult for them to acquire that seed capital otherwise; as the legal scholar Mehrsa Baradaran has noted in her study of the racial wealth gap, white banks at the time generally would not extend credit to Black borrowers.

The strict separations of the Jim Crow economy are illustrated in perhaps the most striking shot in the movie, when a young Chinese American woman, Lisa Chow, crosses the street to speak with her mother in their whites-only shop. Until that point, we have been shown only the Black side of town, where the Chows also maintain a store. The sweeping shot reveals that the town's white residents are mere feet away, but they might as well be on a different planet. Part of a group of immigrants to Mississippi known as the Delta Chinese, the Chows are neither Black nor white and are allowed to sell to both customer bases at the same time.

The twins soon discover, however, that the same segregated economy that deprives them of seed money means that their clientele cannot afford to pay for their products in cash. “The black peon is held down by perpetual debt or petty criminal judgments; his rent rises with the price of cotton, his chances to buy land are either non-existent or confined to infertile regions,” W. E. B. Du Bois wrote in 1907. “If by accident or miracle he escapes and becomes a landholder, his property, civil and political status are still at the mercy of the worst of the white voters, and his very life at the whim of the mob.” This century-old observation is almost a summary of the film's setting, just without the vampires.

The film conveys two forms of peonage prominent in the 1930s South—labor arrangements not far removed from slavery. One is convict leasing, which we see as Stack, his cousin Sammie, and a veteran bluesman called Delta Slim pass by a chain gang on their drive to the juke joint. Because the Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery “except as punishment for a crime,” many southern states passed laws that, in practice, allowed authorities to arrest Black people for minor crimes such as “loitering” or “vagrancy” and then coerce them to work for free under heinous conditions.

The other is sharecropping, the details of which are the catalyst for the eventual vampire massacre. Early on in the film, we see Sammie, an aspiring musician and preacher's son, picking cotton in the morning so that he can fill his quota and spend the rest of the day playing his guitar. Under the sharecropping system, Black people and poor whites were kept in an interminable cycle of debt by landlords, no matter how hard they worked, and so were bound to continue—Du Bois described it as a form of serfdom. Landlords would pay sharecroppers in “scrip,” paper or wooden tokens that could be used to purchase only highly marked-up goods from the landlords' own stores. As the writer Michael Harriott notes, the Chows' shop would have been one of the few places in town where Black residents could expect fair prices.

The twins successfully pack the juke joint with customers who are intoxicated by Sammie's supernatural skills with a guitar—Delta Slim describes Black music as a kind of magic, and in another striking scene, Sammie's playing summons the spirits of the revelers' ancestors and descendants. But the twins soon discover that much of their clientele can purchase drinks only with scrip—which means breaking even on their investment will be impossible. Their business faces other barriers: A plot point that sees the twins stealing electricity for the juke joint recalls the fact that most of the South, kept poor and underdeveloped by the demands of the segregated economy, didn't have electricity until the New Deal, under FDR.

Elsewhere in the film, the Irish vampire Remmick, pursued by Choctaw vampire hunters, tricks his way into the protection of a pair of Klan members living near Clarksdale and turns them into creatures of the night. Shortly after Stack realizes that the juke joint isn't making enough money, Remmick shows up with his progeny. Attracted by Sammie's virtuoso playing, they ask to be invited in but are rejected because they are white; another aspect of the era was that white businesses could sell to Black customers, but Black businesses were limited to Black clientele. As vampires, they are forced to wait outside. When Mary, Stack's old flame and, in the parlance of the time, an octoroon who is passing for white, learns from Stack that the juke joint is unprofitable, she offers to go see if Remmick and the others have U.S. currency.

Mary becomes the vampires' first juke-joint victim and is then invited inside, where she promptly seduces and kills Stack, who later rises again as a vampire. But the entire reason any of this happens is that running a profitable business as a Black person in the Jim Crow economy is nearly impossible. If the Smokestack twins could borrow capital from white banks, they wouldn't have needed to rob the mob and leave Chicago. If the sharecroppers were paid with actual money, the juke joint would have been profitable. And if the juke joint were profitable, then Mary would never have walked outside and been turned by the vampires. The economic constraints imposed by segregation are what, in the end, expose the twins and their customers to the supernatural horror Remmick represents.

Interestingly, Coogler treats Remmick sympathetically, offering hints about Remmick's own experience of oppression and his doomed quest to seek out his loved ones, who are long dead. Remmick is a monster, but his homeland was colonized by some of the same rapacious forces that brought the twins' ancestors to America. The tragedy of persecuted people brought into bloody conflict with one another by forces beyond their control is a consistent theme in Coogler's films, including his two Black Panther movies.

Read: The tragedy of Erik Killmonger

The only unadulterated monsters in the film are the Ku Klux Klan, who show up at the juke joint the next morning to kill the twins and take back the property the Klan leader sold to them, thus pocketing the money. This outcome is foreshadowed earlier in the film, during a story Delta Slim tells as they are passing the chain gang. Slim recalls a friend who was lynched for carrying too much cash, which a group of white men assumed he had stolen. Slim's tale illustrates a deadly catch-22 of Jim Crow economics: Whatever Black people acquired, white people could take by force.

The final conflict between Smoke and the Klan ends in a satisfying Western-style shoot-out, but it also shows that the twins were always doomed. The powers that be in Clarksdale were never going to allow them to prosper. That's a different kind of horror story, one that is all the more terrifying because it lacks any supernatural element. Unlike vampires, the Jim Crow economy was real, and it shapes America to this day.

A prophecy by Baba Vanga is being widely discussed worldwide, largely because many of her past predictions have proven to be accurate. According to her latest forecast, a devastating war is expected to erupt in several European countries in 2025. Baba Vanga believed that this year would mark the beginning of humanity's decline, with war being a major contributing factor. Currently, rising tensions between India and Pakistan are adding to global anxiety. Meanwhile, in Europe, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war since early 2022 has not only impacted the continent but has also drawn in global powers such as the US, NATO, and the European Union, making the conflict even more dangerous.

Several of Baba Vanga's previous predictions have already come true, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2004 tsunami, and the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Among her other alarming prophecies is one predicting Muslim rule in Europe by 2043.

Baba Vanga was born in 1911 and died in 1996. She lost her eyesight in an accident during childhood, after which she reportedly gained the ability to foresee future events.

As per her prediction, ""As soon as Syria falls, expect a great war between the West and the East. In the spring, a war in the East will begin, and there will be a Third World War—a war in the East that will destroy the West.""

Vanga also warned that humans will likely come into contact with aliens. ""Humanity will make contact with extraterrestrial life, possibly leading to a global crisis or apocalypse,"" she said. This is currently being witnessed as US President Donald Trump said he will release all the documents filed by the country's intelligence, which gives researched information on aliens, when he comes into power. It's possible that this prediction is far more accurate than we'd like to believe.

Baba Vanga predicted that humans would develop telepathy to read each other's minds by 2025, allowing brain-to-brain interaction. Recently, Elon Musk's implant of a brain chip in a handicapped human showed success, as he was able to play video games with his brain via technology.

Timeline of Humanity's Inevitable Collapse According to Baba Vanga:

2025: A major conflict in Europe will severely impact the continent's population.

2028: Humans will begin to explore Venus as a potential energy source.

2033: Polar ice caps will melt significantly, causing sea levels to rise.

2076: Communism will spread across many nations.

2130: Humanity will make contact with extraterrestrial life.

2170: A severe global drought will affect large regions of the planet.

3005: Earth will go to war with a Martian civilisation.

3797: Humans will be forced to leave Earth as it becomes uninhabitable.

5079: The world will come to an end.

On the eve of the federal poll, the famed 36-year-old Darwin saltwater croc tips a Peter Dutton victory

On the eve of Australia's national poll to determine its next leader, two hunks of meat were dangled above a murky pool.

Attached to one line, the picture of prime minister, Anthony Albanese. Upon the other, the man who would dethrone him, the opposition leader, Peter Dutton.

In the water lurked a 36-year-old saltwater crocodile called Speckles.

Associate professor of Greek history at the University of Queensland, David Pritchard, says ancient Athenian democracy, the birthplace of democracy, was thick with ritual and magic. So it's only fitting Speckles was once again put to the test, this time with chunks of buffalo meat.

“That's a form of divination,” Pritchard says. “That is a form of interpreting portents to work out what is going to happen in the future.”

So whom did the gods of the tropical north ordain for electoral victory this Saturday?

Once again Speckles predicted the fall of a government – only this time, he was decisive. In 2022, the 4.8 metre saltie predicted, via plucked chook, that Albanese would defeat then prime minister Scott Morrison.

“He did it really really quickly,” Crocodylus Park's Jess Grills says. “Straight up for Peter Dutton.”

But while Speckles might have an unblemished record as an oracle, Pritchard cautioned against fatalistically accepting his verdict.

The historian says that while the ancient Athenians performed many similar rituals as part of their democracy and often looked to the gods for guidance, it was up to people to interpret signs from the divine.

“Keeping the gods happy was very important to the Athenians,” Pritchard says. “But they took control of their own lives.”

Which is another tradition that Anne-Marie Condé, senior curator at the Museum Of Australian Democracy At Old Parliament House, hopes lives on in the modern world.

Condé says she believes Australians are proud of the nation's innovations in democracy, from the pioneering of the secret ballot to universal suffrage to compulsory voting.

And this sense of ownership over the democratic process means that “we can have a little fun with it if we want to”. But she hopes the spectacle of Speckles adds to, not distract from, the duties of the day.

“It's fun watching crocodiles decide who might be the next prime minister,” Condé says. “But you know what: your vote does count, it's not a random thing.

“So it's great if people can have a bit of think before they vote to how they want to use that vote – because the outcome will determine the future of us all.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","other"

I am sure all of us have encountered CAPTCHA while browsing the internet. “Verify you are human”, “I'm not a robot”, “Select all the squares with traffic lights” — it has become a recognized if not begrudging part of our regular interaction with today's online content. We in part accept this mild inconvenience because we know (hope?) it makes us safer online. We trust the idea that they help prevent bots from spamming and abusing the services we all love. But what happens if the CAPTCHAS we encounter aren't always what they appear to be? What if cyber-criminals abused our trust of these safeguards to get us to lower our guard and launch attacks all under the illusion of security? You may have already guessed it, but this is exactly what is happening. Fraudsters are conducting psychological operations (psyops) that target the weakest link in any system — us. Social engineering is a form of psyops that targets the users of a system with the intent of exploiting human perception and behavior. Essentially, their goal is to trick legitimate users into taking actions that they might not ordinarily take under normal conditions — such as click on a dodgy link in an email, give a caller their password, or wire money to a “Prince” in Nigeria. In this specific case though, attackers are attempting to subvert our trust in companies whose primary purpose is to provide online security and keep us all safe. But we will get to that, let's dig in…

It all starts with an urgent sounding text message from what appears to be a trusted service provider (package deliver, toll road, the usual suspects) that requires immediate action. “Unusual activity on your account has been detected!” “You have an unpaid toll balance!” “Your package cannot be delivered!” Then they provide a useful link for you to click on that will presumably take you to the site to address this emerging “crisis”. Now, in the most common form of this attack, the link or thumbnail image will take you directly to a cloned phishing page that is impersonating your trusted service, and it will convincingly prompt you to input your credentials. However, doing so will save your login information for attackers to use to access the real site with your info and conduct any sort of fraudulent activity under your account. This is one of the types of attacks that Allure Security sees happening at scale every single day across the internet. Many users have already become wise to this type of scam due to the sheer mind-numbing number of attempts we receive. However, attackers have not used their laurels for resting, instead they are continuously iterating and trying new variations with the hope of catching us off guard. In a recent campaign we investigated, instead of sending users directly to the phishing site, scammers instead would link them to an intermediary resource. If you were unlucky enough to click on this attack you would see something like the following in your browser:

You might glance at this while going about your busy day and think to yourself “at least it's not one of those ones where you have to click on all the images or type out the impossible to read letters — who has time for that?” before clicking the checkbox feeling good that your choice in service providers is keeping you secure. Or so you think.

What is really going on behind the scenes is far from innocuous. What appears to be a “security check” is actually acting as a proxy to another website — a phishing page stealing credentials. If we investigate the source code of the proxy page, we will immediately notice a few red flags:

    First, the full code contains no actual links or included resources you would expect from the well-known security vendor being impersonated. 

    The right-click context menu has been disabled and the key combinations for common shortcuts like developer tools have been intercepted and disabled to slow down any attempts at analysis. Not a common feature of legitimate websites.

   Investigating the code associated with the “Verify you are human” checkbox reveals an interesting base64 encoded string that is being assigned to a variable targetURL and then decoded and set to the JavaScript property “window.location.href”. This is a property that represents the URL of the current webpage. This technique is commonly used to redirect your browser to another page. The decoded string containing the true destination URL is shown below:

You may notice the long random looking string appended to the phishing domain in the decoded URL and wonder why it is there. Good instincts! If you were to browse to the URL without including that specific string in your request, you would be automatically redirected to YouTube. Attackers do this intentionally to prevent automated security scanners and researchers from discovering it while keeping the true nature of the site hidden from everyone but it's intended victims — the recipients of that initial text message. Victims must first click through the fake CAPTCHA site to unlock and gain access to the intended payload.

We're now seeing clear evidence of attackers impersonating trusted security vendors—not just donning the disguise of a harmless bystander, but cloaking themselves in the very authority meant to protect. It's no longer a wolf in sheep's clothing — it's a wolf in shepherd's clothing. Their aim is psychological: to exploit our trust in protective signals by deploying a decoy — a fake CAPTCHA that masks the true destination and intent of their attack.

This is more than just a technical ruse. It's psychological warfare — a textbook case of PsyOps, where adversaries exploit our trust in familiar security signals to bypass our defenses. And unlike simple credential theft, this kind of manipulation targets our instincts, habits, and assumptions.

But here's the critical insight: If attackers can evolve, so can we.

By analyzing these phishing kits and fraud tactics not just for their payloads but for their psychological framing, we as defenders can start to build countermeasures that address both the technical and human layers of the attack surface. That means designing better user education, fine-tuning detection systems to spot these proxy-layered phishing campaigns, and sharing intelligence to disrupt campaigns early.

At Allure Security, we believe that understanding attacker mindset is key to outmaneuvering them. Every fake CAPTCHA, every encoded redirect, every impersonation attempt is a data point we can use to make defenders stronger. Because in the end, it's not just about technology — it's about trust.

So next time you see a “Verify you're human” checkbox, you might want to ask: Who's verifying who?

The image of the UAP in question. (Google/Airbus/Maxar via SWNS)

By Dean Murray

A bombshell image of a potential 1,000 ft-wide flying saucer revealed at a U.S. congressional hearing may have already been debunked.

UAP (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena) whistleblower Luis Elizondo, a former U.S. Army counterintelligence officer, held up a grainy image taken from a civilian airplane over rural southwestern United States.

It purported to show a silver circular disc casting a vast shadow over the landscape.

The ""Understanding UAP: Science, National Security & Innovation"" event on Thursday, May, was held in Washington, D.C. in collaboration with the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability and included members of Congress and leading UAP experts.

Taking the stand, Luis Elizondo showed off the photograph said to be taken in the Four Corners region, and said: ""It is a lenticular object, and if we look at the shadow being cast it is significantly large. It is (taken at) about 21,000ft, taken by a civilian pilot.

""The object, potentially, is anywhere between six hundred to a thousand feet in diameter. It is a lenticular object, and it is silver.

(Oversight Committee/UAPDF via SWNS)

""But this is an example of one of many, many, many incidents involving commercial and private pilots, and guess what? They don't know where to report it. Guess what? Congress has no idea this is happening on a regular basis. That's a problem.

However, he added: ""I cannot vouch for the veracity of this photograph, I didn't take it.""

But internet sleuths may have found a simple explanation for the image, which probably reveal it as an optical illusion.

A comparison with Google maps in the same region show two irrigation circles, with one darker than the other to make it appear as its shadow.

UFO analyst and ""skeptic"" Mick West commented online: ""This UFO photo shows two irrigation circles. The roads are perfectly aligned, and the ""shadow"" is in the wrong direction. It makes you wonder why Elizondo gets fooled by things like this.""

The UAP Disclosure Fund had said on X, regarding the hearing: ""Captured near Four Corners at FL210—estimated 600-1,000 ft in diameter, silver-hued, disc-shaped. Released moments ago by Luis Elizondo during our “Science, National Security & Innovation” panel.

""Several speakers confirmed DoD & IC hold hundreds of similar UAP images + sensor files still classified. It's time for full declassification and open scientific analysis.""

Doctors at Iran's Isfahan University of Medicine recently documented the case of a 23-year-old male whose head dropped to a 90-degree angle because his neck muscles could no longer support it.

Cervical Kyphospholiosis (CKS), aka “Dropped Head Syndrome,” is a serious medical condition characterized by weakness in the neck extensor muscles, which renders them unable to support the weight of the head. It is usually associated with various neuromuscular conditions, including mitochondrial myopathy, congenital myopathy, motor neuron disease, or anatomical abnormalities. such as an unusually large head, but doctors at an Iranian university recently reported a previously undocumented case of CKS caused by years of substance abuse.

The 23-year-old  unnamed patient was described as “hailing from a socioeconomically disadvantaged background,” with “a significant medical history of major depressive disorder and substance abuse, including addiction to heroin, opium, and amphetamines.” Doctors at the Isfahan University of Medicine wrote that “after every episode of amphetamine use, the patient consistently maintained a fixed kyphotic neck position for extended periods, leading to a progressive alteration in his cervical alignment.”

Cranial nerve testing yielded normal results, as did muscle strength and autonomic function tests, but a CT scan revealed a severe kyphoscoliosis deformity affecting the patient's C3, C4, and C5 vertebrae. After assessing the severity of his condition, doctors opted for a three-stage surgical solution to remove the deformed bone and realign his neck in a proper position. Luckily, the operation was a success, and the patient was able to walk with a special collar a day later and was discharged after three days.

Doctors reported that the 23-year-old patient had tried various traditional and herbal remedies, but none had alleviated his symptoms, so he eventually sought medical attention. Following the surgery, he had several psychiatric consultations, and he was able to give up drugs. A 1‐year follow‐up revealed satisfactory improvement in alignment and correction in the position of the cervical spine.

“We discovered that drug abuse contributed to the uncommon development of severe complicated cervical kyphosis,” the Iranian doctors wrote in their case report. “The drug does not have a direct effect on musculoskeletal changes. Instead, there is an indirect effect: When the patient uses the drug, they remain in a certain position for a long time, and over months, this results in musculoskeletal changes that lead to kyphoscoliosis.”

The previously undocumented connection between severe substance abuse and dropped head syndrome has been given the name “intoxicated syndrome”.

This escalation of his dangerous assault on public media could shutter hundreds of local stations across the country.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order calling for an end to taxpayer funding for NPR and PBS, an escalation of his dangerous assault on public media that could shutter hundreds of local stations across the country.

The president's order, which he signed behind closed doors, echoes a section of Project 2025, a far-right agenda that called for stripping public funding from NPR, PBS, and other broadcasters on the grounds that they “do not even bother to run programming that would attract conservatives.”

Trump's order instructs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) — a private nonprofit corporation created and funded by Congress — to “cease direct funding to NPR and PBS, consistent with my administration's policy to ensure that federal funding does not support biased and partisan news coverage.”

The executive order, which is expected to face legal challenges, also directs all federal agencies to “identify and terminate, to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law, any direct or indirect funding of NPR and PBS.”

Craig Aaron, co-CEO of the advocacy group Free Press, said in a statement Friday that “Trump's attack on public media shows why our democracy is on life support.”

“After years of attacking journalists and lying about their work, it's no surprise that Trump and his minions are trying to silence and shutter any newsroom that dares to ask him questions or show the devastating impact of his policies on local communities,” said Aaron. “Yet in many of those communities, the local public-media station is the only source of independent reporting. Trump, of course, prefers fawning propaganda — which too many commercial TV and radio broadcasters are willing to provide in exchange for regulatory favors, or to stay off the president's target list.”

“All of us who care about an independent press, an informed populace, a responsive government, and a thriving democracy have a stake in the outcome of this fight,” he added. “If we unite to defend public media — and I believe we can and will prevail — then we might just save our democracy, too.”

It's not just NPR and PBS, they're coming to fuck with your local public radio.

Trump's move was expected, and it came in the wake of reports that the administration intends to ask Congress to rescind previously approved funding for CPB, which is already engaged in a court fight with the president over his attempt to fire several of the organization's board members. The Associated Press reported Thursday that the rescission request “has not yet been sent to Capitol Hill.”

According to the organizations' estimates, federal funding accounts for roughly 1% of NPR's annual budget and 15% of PBS's yearly revenue.

In a letter to congressional leaders earlier this week, a coalition of civil society groups led by Reporters Without Borders (RSF) warned that, if enacted, Trump's proposed funding cuts for public broadcasting “will result in the shutdown of dozens, if not hundreds, of local, independent radio and television stations serving Americans in every corner of the country.”

“As it stands, public media journalists are often the only reporters attending a school board meeting, or a local zoning hearing, or at the scene of a crime,” the groups wrote. “They are the journalists most likely to hold local public officials accountable and expose corruption. Faraway digital media outlets will not replicate this coverage, and the American public will lose out.”

Trump's attack on public broadcasters is part of his administration's broader effort to undermine journalism in the United States and around the world.

RSF said in a report published Friday that Trump's “early moves in his second mandate to politicize the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), ban The Associated Press from the White House, or dismantle the U.S. Agency for Global Media, for example, have jeopardized the country's news outlets and indicate that he intends to follow through on his threats, setting up a potential crisis for American journalism.”

“After a century of gradual expansion of press rights in the United States,” the group said, “the country is experiencing its first significant and prolonged decline in press freedom in modern history, and Donald Trump's return to the presidency is greatly exacerbating the situation.”

We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

President Donald Trump on Friday said he would strip Harvard University of its tax-exempt status, as a battle between his administration and the Ivy League school continues.

The White House has threatened to pull funding from Ivy League schools over alleged anti-Semitism at campuses and for promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, among other measures. Harvard filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over funding that was blocked.

Trump previewed removing the university's tax-exempt status in comments last month.

“Tax-exempt status, I mean, that's a privilege. It's really a privilege. And it's been abused. By a lot more than Harvard, too,” he told reporters in the Oval Office, while also mentioning Princeton University and Columbia University, also Ivy League schools.

“It's something that these schools really have to be very, very careful with.”

In mid-April, the Trump administration froze $2.2 billion in grants to Harvard and $60 million in contracts to Harvard University, after the school said it would defy the Trump administration's demands to limit activism on campus.

Harvard President Alan Garber said at the time that his school would not adhere to the government's demands.

But earlier this week, Harvard pledged reforms in response to a pair of internal reports on anti-Semitism and anti-Arab prejudice at the Ivy League campus following last year's anti-Israel protests amid an ongoing war between Israeli forces and the Hamas terrorist group that started in October 2023.

“We will redouble our efforts to ensure that the University is a place where ideas are welcomed, entertained and contested in the spirit of seeking truth,” Garber wrote.

The president has also suggested that his administration could target other groups' tax-exempt status, not just universities. In last month's Oval Office exchange with reporters, Trump specifically named the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a progressive nonprofit organization.

“It's supposed to be a charitable organization,” Trump said regarding CREW. “The only charity they had is going after Donald Trump. So we're looking at that. We're looking at a lot of things.”","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"
