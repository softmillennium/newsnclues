                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 'Deadpool' mastermind is toying with writing treatments for a film that would feature three or four members of Marvel's mutant team, but has not yet pitched an idea to the studio. In the aftermath of Deadpool & Wolverine, Ryan Reynolds remained firm that he did not see another solo Deadpool movie in his future. Now, nine months after Deadpool & Wolverine became the top-grossing R-rated movie of all time, Reynolds is quietly plotting his return to the character, but true to his word, it won't be as the lead of a solo movie. Blake Lively Reveals Her Mother's Life Was Almost Taken by a Past Colleague, Thanks Ryan Reynolds for Being "Good When No One Is Watching" Reynolds is exploring ideas for a Deadpool movie that would feature X-Men characters, as well as continuing to script the Paramount comedy Boy Band after making writing a priority for much of this year before tackling other obligations, sources tell The Hollywood Reporter. The multi-hyphenate is working on various treatments for an ensemble film featuring three or four X-Men characters. Deadpool would of course appear, but perhaps only as a supporting player. Reynolds is said to believe that keeping his f-bomb wielding anti-hero more on the sidelines could allow for the X-Men characters to be used in unexpected ways. Reynolds has been open about every Deadpool movie needing a strong reason to exist, and it's possible this could provide the avenue he needs. There's no word on which X-Men characters Reynolds is toying with, though Oscar-nominated Wicked star Cynthia Erivo, whom Reynolds honored at the National Board of Review in January alongside her co-star Ariana Grande, has publicly lobbied to play Storm in the MCU. It's extremely early days and far from becoming a reality, and Reynolds — known for tinkering with concepts he hopes to share with Marvel in the future — is working separate from the studio at this stage. It's not unusual for Reynolds to go through many iterations before landing on the right idea; before Deadpool & Wolverine, one idea he pitched for Deadpool 3 was a low-budget road trip movie. Reynolds has played in the X-Men sandbox before, with Deadpool & Wolverine featuring villains Sabertooth (Tyler Mane) and Pyro (Aaron Stanford), while X-Men such as Colossus (Stefan Kapičić) have been in all three Deadpool movies. He lured Hugh Jackman out of retirement as Wolverine, a character who likely will show up in an Avengers movie down the road. And he wrote a Deadpool & Wolverine role for Channing Tatum, who was long attached to a Gambit movie that never happened at Fox. Tatum will now appear in Avengers: Doomsday, along with stars from the original Fox X-Men movies such as Patrick Stewart (Prof. X), Ian McKellen (Magneto), James Marsden (Cyclops), Alan Cuming (Nightcrawler) and Rebecca Romijn (Mystique). It also ended up coinciding with the high-profile legal battle between his wife Blake Lively and her It Ends with Us director/co-star Justin Baldoni (Reynolds has been named alongside Lively as a plaintiff in Baldoni's suit, but Reynold's attorney are requesting that he be dismissed). If the two sides don't settle, a trail is set for next March. While Reynolds will still appear in front of the camera, the project is all part of a shift in recent years to producing and writing. If and when he does become an Avenger or X-Man, we're at the end of his journey.” Reynolds noted something similar last month while suggesting that he might be working on an MCU pic.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eight months after the fourth season of “Bargain Block” premiered on HGTV, there's been no official word on whether a season five is in the works — until now. Keith Bynum, who stars on the popular series with his longtime fiance, Evan Thomas, told TV Insider on May 1, 2025, that they are working on home renovations that will appear in new episodes. Bynum told the outlet that the last season required a “grueling” 42 weeks of production, and they've only just begun finishing up a few renovations for the fifth season. “We just wrapped out – well, technically we're still finishing one of the houses – but we'll have more episodes airing in the fall back in Detroit,” he told the outlet, acknowledging that they've been busy not only with renovations, but with selling the homes they renovated for last season. Season four of “Bargain Block” featured renovations on starter homes in Detroit, where the show has filmed since 2021, and spinoff episodes filmed in New Orleans. “The last house was supposed to list today, but the power meter didn't go in, so now I'm waiting another three days. But those are buttoning up, we just finished another five in Detroit. So we're back in Detroit trying to just kind of make sure that we've got our footing there still. In addition to filming for HGTV, Bynum and Thomas have taken on private clients, showcasing some of their renovations in other cities on Instagram. That may lead the duo to bringing “Bargain Block” to additional cities, he told TV Insider, but couldn't give any details. “We are actively working in a lot of cities,” he said. “I will tell you, we're in Nashville a lot. In February, Bynum told fans in an Instagram Stories Q&A that he and Thomas travel so much that it's a treat to be back in their renovated Detroit home. “I travel so much for work that I really love just being able to come home for a few days.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Donald Trump administration's gutting of the National Weather Services (NWS) has left major metropolitan centers without a top meteorologist ahead of hurricane season. According to a Friday report from CNN, 30 of the nation's 122 weather forecast offices now lack a meteorologist-in-charge — the top position at NWS offices that traditionally has a prominent role in emergency management. The offices currently lacking a head meteorologist include Houston-Galveston — which frequently experiences the effects of hurricane season — New York City; Tampa, Florida; and Cleveland, Ohio. The Tampa office that now lacks a chief administrator oversaw the region of Florida battered by Hurricane Milton in October of last year. The storm killed at least 45 people and caused over $34 billion in damages. Some of the losses can be attributed to regular turnover and retirements, but the Weather Service was one of several agencies roiled by mass layoffs during the so-called Department of Government Efficiency's government-wide layoffs. As previously reported by Rolling Stone, working meteorologists and experts warned that the cuts wouldn't just result in less accurate forecasts, but pose an active risk to public safety. “You're talking about threats to life and property. This is a place where you don't want to make mistakes,” David Stensrud, a professor of meteorology and atmospheric science at Penn State, previously told Rolling Stone. “When staff is at minimum levels, you're putting a lot of stress on those people.” Without someone to oversee the offices, “It's like driving down the road with bald tires,” former meteorologist-in-charge Gary Szatkowski told CNN.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Under its first-look deal with Amazon MGM Studios, Premeditated Productions has launched development on Shield of Sparrows, a feature adaptation of the forthcoming romantasy novel by Devney Perry. Liz Pelletier, Publisher and CEO of Entangled Publishing, and Sherryl Clark, former President of Bad Robot (Cloverfield, The Gorge), are attached to produce under their newly launched Premeditated banner, with DOD Cayla Tyne overseeing development. Slated for release under Entangled Publishing's Red Tower imprint on May 6, Shield of Sparrows is described as a slow-burn, high-stakes romantasy, where enemies become lovers, monsters stalk a cursed realm, and a forgotten princess finds the strength to tear off her crown and become the warrior she was never meant to be. Early momentum around the book has been explosive. It launches with a six-figure initial print run and plentiful five-star reviews from early readers — mirroring the breakout trajectory of Red Tower's global bestsellers Fourth Wing, which is being developed for TV at Amazon, and Iron Flame. Like those titles, Shield of Sparrows is poised to debut on the best-sellers list. The series is a continuing priority for Lionsgate, which releases spin-off Ballerina on June 6, on the heels of films that have grossed over $1B in total. New installments in development include a fifth chapter in the main series, an animated prequel, and a spin-off focused on Donnie Yen's blind assassin, Caine. Bob Odenkirk is back for Nobody 2 — the sequel to the hit pandemic-era action thriller penned by Kolstad and released by Universal — on August 15. Also known for projects like The Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Die Hart, Kolstad is repped by UTA, Circle Management, and Jennifer Levy at Behr Abramson Levy Johnson LLP. A Wall Street Journal, USA Today and #1 Amazon bestselling author, Perry's six-book romance series The Edens, set in her home state of Montana, is in TV development at CBS Studios. She is repped by IAG and The Seymour Agency. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

Meanwhile, Grupo Frontera and Netón Vega team up for “La Buena Eres Tú,” which fuses the group's norteño style with a smooth rap rhythm.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, while even actors from the film series have spoken out against Rowling, HBO and its parent company Warner Bros. “The decision to be in business with J.K. Rowling is not new for us. We've been in business for 25 years,” HBO chief content officer Casey Bloys told The Town podcast (via Variety). In 2024, Bloys said that Rowling was “very, very involved” in the preproduction of the show, including picking showrunner Francesca Gardiner and director Mark Mylod. However, Bloys insisted that Rowling's personal political views would not seep into the series itself. “We already have a show on HBO from her called C.B. It's pretty clear that those are her personal, political views. “Harry Potter is not secretly being infused with anything. HBO has billed its upcoming series as “a faithful adaptation” that “will feature a new cast to lead a new generation of fandom, full of the fantastic detail and much-loved characters ‘Harry Potter' fans have loved for over twenty-five years.” Rowling has a right to express her personal views.

Chloë Sevigny loves to work, of course, but as the mother of a five-year-old, she has other things to consider, too. For some performers, describing themselves as a “working actor” could seem like self-deprecation, but for Sevigny, even though many of her priorities have changed, it's always about the work. And the work that makes up her resume is iconic, having first come up in the indie film pipeline at 19 years old in writer Harmony Korine and director Larry Clark's “Kids,” the controversial '90s coming-of-age film about a group of New York teens left to their own self-destructive devices. Since then, she has been nominated for an Academy Award for her role in Kimberly Peirce's “Boys Don't Cry,” worked with directors like Luca Guadagnino and David Fincher, became a television mainstay in Ryan Murphy's extended TV universe, and written and directed her own short films. Don't forget her considerable muse status in the fashion world and dedication to indie film. Related Stories Pierce Brosnan and Samuel L. Jackson Run a Western Town in Revenge Thriller ‘The Unholy Trinity' — Watch Trailer Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves Set for Romance Thriller with ‘Speed' Producer 30 Years Later Currently, she's starring in two independent films, both out in theaters now: “Magic Farm,” the second feature from “El Planeta” director Amalia Ulman, and “Bonjour Tristesse,” the feature debut from Durga Chew-Bose, based on the novel by Françoise Sagan. (Otto Preminger first adapted the novel for his own 1958 film, starring Deborah Kerr in the role now belonging to Sevigny.) While these new films are wildly different, Sevigny's presence grounds both, and her name gives a certain cultural cache — people will go to see films from a new filmmaker because they are longtime stans of the actress. Chew-Bose's adaptation of the 1954 novel follows Cecile (Lily McInerny), a young woman whose carefree summer with her father on the French seaside is interrupted by an old friend of her late mother, Anne (Sevigny), who shows up to upend everything. Sevigny had initially received the script from her agent and was interested in playing the taut, constantly chignoned Anne because it felt like a new adventure. “They thought it would be a good opportunity to play more of a lady that has a real sense of ownership and elegance, and she's more refined,” Sevigny says, drawling out lady, giggling. But playing Anne, such an elegant force, also had unexpected challenges for Sevigny. I wasn't so happy in my body. “There's this interesting moment in the mirror when I talk about my peasant hands. Anne wants to be something that she isn't in a way, but she's also like, ‘This is who I am. I'm going to make the most of it.' Sevigny described Chew-Bose as “a really bright woman [who is] very tender and very soulful.” And working with McInerny, in a breakout role on her second film after “Palm Trees and Power Lines,” Sevigny wanted to give any support she could on the set. “For me, that's just important as an actor, if I have any weight within the community, if I can support other women, that's very important to me. That guiding principle is what led her to play Edna in Ulman's “Magic Farm,” where she plays a documentary host and producer wrangling a motley video crew. However, Sevigny's only regret about “Magic Farm” was the scale of her part and how little time she spent filming in Argentina. He [Sevigny's son] won't even remember that I was gone. But it's hard to be away as a new mom.” While “Magic Farm” and “Bonjour Tristesse” will tide over Sevigny fans for the time being, she also has another well-acclaimed indie coming soon, the Sundance winner “Atropia,” from writer/director Hailey Gates, about an actress who working in a simulated Iraqi war zone. “I went and did a day on that to support her. And Sevigny also worked again with her frequent collaborator Luca Guadagnino — who directed her in the HBO limited series “We Are Who We Are” and the cannibal romance “Bones and All” — in his upcoming college-set thriller “After the Hunt,” starring Julia Roberts, Andrew Garfield, and Ayo Edebiri. While Sevigny hasn't yet seen the finished product, which is eyeing a fall festival debut before hitting theaters in October from Amazon/MGM, she knows the post-#MeToo-centric film will be “polarizing” and will “ignite some conversations.” And much like anyone would be, she was smitten with Roberts. She was just so excited to be there. I think she also fell in love with Luca. However, beyond working with Roberts for the first time, there's another frontier maybe she hasn't yet charted: replaying a prior role. Guadagnino is set to remake “American Psycho,” based on the controversial novel by Bret Easton Ellis, and which starred Sevigny alongside Christian Bale. In Mary Harron's 2000 adaptation of the novel about the sadistic (and at times uncomfortably funny) serial killer Patrick Bateman (Bale), Sevigny played his secretary Jean, who gets spared from his bloodthirst. But whether she would play Jean again, or appear in the remake, is another question. I thought he was doing a World War II picture,” Sevigny said. (This week, since our interview, DC Studios announced it will delay production on “Sgt. Rock,” Guadagnino's planned next film, until summer 2026, if the movie happens at all.) I thought that would be something that he would be into, conceptually having the same actress play the same part. “Bonjour Tristesse” and “Magic Farm” are now in theaters.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Less than one month after being sent home by the judges on season 23 of “American Idol,” U.K. singer Sonny Tennet is mourning the death of his dad. On May 1, 2025, Tennet shared the sad news on Instagram, posting a photo of his father playing guitar and writing, “Said goodbye to my dad today… a great man and one of my biggest musical influences. Born Stevie Jay Tennet in South Shields, England, the singer has gone by the stage name Sonny Tennet since he was 14, when he started performing live with his dad on the Tyneside pub circuit, according to his talent agency, Wasserman. “My dad was a singer in a band for years when I was growing up,” he told U.K. publication Cultured Northeast in November. “I used to watch him play live and he had a really good following. “So from an early age,” Tennet continued, “I was drawn to the karaoke machine and my mam was always telling me to get up and sing. In March 2024, Tennet shared a touching TikTok video in which he held hands with his parents as they listened for his song “Panorama” to be played on the BBC's Radio One for the first time. Upon seeing Tennet's Instagram update about his dad's death, the “American Idol” team wrote in the comments, “So sorry, Sonny. In a March 2 “American Idol” preview show that aired right after the 2025 Oscars, Tennet's was the very first season 23 audition to air and Carrie Underwood's first to critique as a judge on the show. Richie gave Tennet a standing ovation and told him his rendition was “beautifully done” and that “you made my song your song.” Tennet easily made it through to Hollywood with three yeses from the judges and moved through each round with ease until the Head to Head challenge. Producers showed how much fun they had behind the scenes, laughing and fooling around. “We've probably spent 24 hours a day together, literally,” Chesterman said on the show. However, nerves and fatigue started to get the best of Tennet by the time they were rehearsing their Head to Head duet, Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper's “Shallow,” and he told producers, “I'm just a walking ball of anxiety at all times. Honestly, it's like hearing your competition is ruthless 'cause there's so much talent here.” Tennet struggled through his duet with Chesterman, who advanced and eventually made it to the top 12. He has a large following there, with tour dates scheduled throughout May and June.</p>

On this week's episode of IndieWire's “Screen Talk” podcast, co-hosts Anne Thompson and Ryan Lattanzio dive into the merits and demerits of each. Disney's “Thunderbolts*” co-starring Florence Pugh and Sebastian Stan is about to dethrone “Sinners” at IMAX theaters, though Warner Bros. is prepping to re-release the latter hit film in premium venues. For now, this weekend's best box-office bet looks to be “Thunderbolts*,” which has garnered better-than-usual reviews for a Marvel movie and promises something different and more character-driven than simply movie chess pieces across a board, as so many MCU movies tend to be doing.

Jackson Run a Western Town in Revenge Thriller ‘The Unholy Trinity' — Watch Trailer Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves Set for Romance Thriller with ‘Speed' Producer 30 Years Later There, friends and collaborators like John Waters, John Turturro, Rossy De Palma, Dua Lipa, and more praised the great Spanish auteur, who won a Best Original Screenplay Oscar for his brilliant and boldly colored “Talk to Her” in 2003. It's one of the great films about women, and as Waters reminded on the dais at Alice Tully Hall, actresses are always practically begging to work with Almodóvar due to the juicy, complex roles he crafts for them. This week, Ryan also dives into “The Rehearsal” creator/star Nathan Fielder's war against Paramount+ as shown on the latest episode of his meta HBO series. In last Sunday's edition, he recounts how the Paramount+ streaming service removed an episode of his Comedy Central show “Nathan for You” completely from the platform due to sensitivity issues around perceived antisemitism. We also talk about the first trailer for Zach Cregger's ensemble horror “Weapons,” out August 8 from Warner Bros. “Barbarian” director Cregger has described his new film, starring Julia Garner and Josh Brolin, as a horror-movie ode to Paul Thomas Anderson's “Magnolia.” That's apparent from Alden Ehrenreich's John C. Reilly-esque moustache in the first footage. We couldn't be more excited about this one, which allegedly ignited a bidding war back in February 2023. And apparently so much so that Jordan Peele let go of his representatives for not securing his Monkey Paw the rights to produce the script. Finally, we also remember Bleecker Street founder and former Focus Features executive Andrew Karpen, who died this week at age 59 from brain cancer. He was deeply beloved by the indie film community.

The five-track project includes a new remix of the band's 1981 debut single, “Radio Free Europe,” reworked by producer and longtime R.E.M. Radio Free Europe 2025 was overseen by the band's original producer Mitch Easter, who first recorded R.E.M. That session included recordings of “Radio Free Europe,” “Sitting Still,” and the instrumental “Wh. Tornado,” all of which appear on the new EP.

The organization currently broadcasts news to 23 countries in 27 languages, making critical information available in regions where a free press is either banned or threatened by the presiding government. RFE/RFL is currently under threat amid President Donald J.
