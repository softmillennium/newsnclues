FP1: Piastri leads Leclerc and Verstappen during sole Miami GP practice session

The sole practice session for the Miami Grand Prix came to an early end after Ollie Bearman crashed towards the end of FP1, bringing out the red flags in the process.

The Haas driver lost control of the rear of his VF-25 entering Turn 12 at the Miami International Autodrome, which resulted in the car coming to rest against the barriers at relatively slow speed.

Bearman had been sitting in 16th position before bringing out the red flags with four minutes remaining on the clock.

The British driver quickly extricated himself from the cockpit before taking a look at the rear of his car, with his team needing to carry out repairs ahead of Sprint Qualifying later on Friday.

Given that he has displayed promising pace during certain stints across those events, Hamilton was asked during media day in Miami about what was preventing him from repeating that level of performance. “When I joined Mercedes, the first six months were tough, getting attuned to working with new people. Pushed on whether he felt able to drive the SF-25 instinctively yet or if it was more of a conscious process, Hamilton added: “I would say you're generally always a mixture of the two, but I'm definitely working hard to adjust to this one, for sure.” READ MORE: ‘I'm 2000% behind him' – Vasseur backs Hamilton amid early Ferrari struggles as he insists ‘potential is there' “In a Sprint race obviously there's not a huge amount of changes you can make; I think the one thing to take from it is that we didn't make a lot of changes going from P1 to Quali, as in all the other weekends we've been tinkering with the car and making it worse!” Following the recent break after the triple header concluded, Hamilton revealed that he spent some “good time” at Ferrari's base in Italy, explaining: “We went through a lot, did some good sim running, and there are things that we've made adjustments to.
