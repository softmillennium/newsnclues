                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple and Anthropic are teaming up to build a “vibe-coding” software platform that will use generative AI to write, edit, and test code for programmers, Bloomberg reported on Friday. The iPhone maker is planning to roll out the software internally, according to Bloomberg, but hasn't decided if it will launch it publicly. The system is a new version of Apple's programming software, Xcode, and relies on Anthropic's Claude Sonnet model, according to the report. OpenAI's ChatGPT already helps power the company's Apple Intelligence features, and Google's Gemini may be added as an alternative option in the future, Apple has indicated. Among developers, the latest Claude models from Anthropic are particularly popular for coding tasks, especially on vibe coding platforms such as Cursor and Windsurf.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Uber announced Friday yet another autonomous vehicle partnership as it leverages its dominant ride-hail and delivery position while relying on partners to supply the self-driving tech it isn't building in-house. The tie-up comes a day after Uber added Ann Arbor-based May Mobility to its roster of AV collaborators, which also includes Volkswagen, Waymo, Wayve, WeRide and many others. The plethora of deals on Uber's end — which span into trucking and delivery — come as the company may expect to face potential competition from Tesla, which plans to launch its first robotaxi service in Austin this summer. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has promised that all Tesla vehicles will one day — with a mere software update — turn into fully self-driving vehicles to be used for ride-hail. Uber once had its own self-driving unit, but sold the division to Aurora Innovation in 2020.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A young entrepreneur who was among the earliest known recruiters for Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has a new, related gig—and he's hiring. Jancso, a former Palantir employee, wrote in a Slack with about 2000 Palantir alumni in it that he's hiring for a “DOGE orthogonal project to design benchmarks and deploy AI agents across live workflows in federal agencies,” according to an April 21 post reviewed by WIRED. “We've identified over 300 roles with almost full-process standardization, freeing up at least 70k FTEs for higher-impact work over the next year,” he continued, essentially claiming that tens of thousands of federal employees could see many aspects of their job automated and replaced by these AI agents. “DOGE does not seem interested in finding ‘higher impact work' for federal employees,” one person said in a comment that received 11 heart reactions. “You're complicit in firing 70k federal employees and replacing them with shitty autocorrect.” “Tbf we're all going to be replaced with shitty autocorrect (written by chatgpt),” another person commented, which received one “+1” reaction. “Or do they just use your credentials to log in later?” AccelerateX was originally called AccelerateSF, which VentureBeat reported in 2023 had received support from OpenAI and Anthropic. In its earliest incarnation, AccelerateSF hosted a hackathon for AI developers aimed at using the technology to solve San Francisco's social problems. Anthropic spokesperson Danielle Ghiglieri tells WIRED that the company "never invested in AccelerateX/SF,” but did sponsor a hackathon AccelerateSF hosted in 2023 by providing free access to its API usage at a time when its Claude API “was still in beta.”) Legacy vendors sell broken systems at increasingly steep prices. This hurts every American citizen.” AccelerateX did not respond to a request for comment. According to the LinkedIn of someone described as one of AccelerateX's cofounders, Rachel Yee, the company looks to have received funding from OpenAI's Converge 2 Accelerator. Another of AccelerateSF's cofounders, Kay Sorin, now works for OpenAI, having joined the company several months after that hackathon. Sorin and Yee did not respond to requests for comment. But experts say that deploying AI agents to do the work of 70,000 people would be tricky if not impossible. A federal employee with knowledge of government contracting, who spoke to WIRED on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press, says, “A lot of agencies have procedures that can differ widely based on their own rules and regulations, and so deploying AI agents across agencies at scale would likely be very difficult.” Oren Etzioni, cofounder of the AI startup Vercept, says that while AI agents can be good at doing some things—like using an internet browser to conduct research—their outputs can still vary widely and be highly unreliable. For instance, customer service AI agents have invented nonexistent policies when trying to address user concerns. “We want our government to be something that we can rely on, as opposed to something that is on the absolute bleeding edge,” says Etzioni. “We don't need it to be bureaucratic and slow, but if corporations haven't adopted this yet, is the government really where we want to be experimenting with the cutting edge AI?” Etzioni says that AI agents are also not great 1-1 fits for job replacements. “Unless you're using funny math,” he says, “no way.” Jancso, first identified by WIRED in February, was one of the earliest recruiters for DOGE in the months before Donald Trump was inaugurated. In December, Jancso, who sources told WIRED said he had been recruited by Steve Davis, president of the Musk-founded Boring Company and a current member of DOGE, used the Palantir alumni group to recruit DOGE members. Palantir was cofounded by Peter Thiel, a billionaire and longtime Trump supporter with close ties to Musk.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ara Partners recently raised an $800 million infrastructure fund focused on reducing carbon emissions in industrial sectors, which historically have been hard to decarbonize. Ara had initially targeted $500 million, the firm told TechCrunch, but saw strong support from new and existing investors, including pension funds, insurance companies, endowments, foundations, and sovereign wealth funds from around the world. The new fund has already made three investments, including in an Ireland-based household organic waste recycler and a biofuels terminal developer. The fund's decarbonization strategy focuses on repurposing existing assets for new low-carbon developments. This significant fundraise arrives at a time of political uncertainty over decarbonization in the U.S. but increasing clarity around its economics. Many companies have been able to drive down costs of low- and zero-carbon technologies in recent years, making them cost competitive with existing approaches. Ara, for example, previously invested in Divert through one of its private equity funds.

Asus has announced the new TUF Gaming T500 desktop, a small form factor PC for gamers. Unlike most traditional desktops, this compact PC is built around Intel's mobile-class CPUs. Per the product page, the T500 can be configured with up to an Intel Core i7‑13620H, a 13th‑gen H‑series laptop chip with 6 performance, 4 efficiency cores, 16 threads, and boost clock speeds of 4.9GHz. Asus claims that the T500 delivers “desktop-level gaming performance with much lower temperatures " by using this mobile CPU in a desktop chassis. However, heat should be far less of a concern in a full-sized desktop tower with better airflow and cooling potential. Based on its design, the cooler appears capable of keeping temperatures in check and maintaining high performance without thermal throttling. The T500 is also available with a lower-tiered Core i5-13420H, an octa-core laptop CPU. As for the graphics, Asus quotes up to Nvidia RTX 50‑series graphics with the highest configuration, including a desktop dual-fan RTX 5060 Ti with 16GB of VRAM. The system has 16GB of DDR5 SO-DIMM memory at 5200 MT/s, but it can be upgraded to 64GB. In terms of connectivity, the front I/O includes a USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-C port and two USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A ports plus an audio jack, while the rear panel offers four USB 2.0 Type-A ports, 7.1 analog audio jacks, DisplayPort 1.4 and HDMI 1.4 video outputs, and a Gigabit Ethernet jack. The TUF Gaming T500's use of a laptop CPU in a desktop setup follows the growing trend of smaller, more power-efficient gaming PCs. However, those chasing top-tier CPU performance might find the mobile chip doesn't quite match high-end desktop processors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last weekend, after OpenAI rolled out a tweaked GPT-4o — the default model powering ChatGPT — users on social media noted that ChatGPT began responding in an overly validating and agreeable way. The company published a postmortem on Tuesday, and in a blog post Friday, OpenAI expanded on specific adjustments it plans to make to its model deployment process. The company also says it'll include explanations of “known limitations” for future incremental updates to models in ChatGPT, and adjust its safety review process to formally consider “model behavior issues” like personality, deception, reliability, and hallucination (i.e., when a model makes things up) as “launch-blocking” concerns. “Even if these issues aren't perfectly quantifiable today, we commit to blocking launches based on proxy measurements or qualitative signals, even when metrics like A/B testing look good.” The pledged fixes come as more people turn to ChatGPT for advice. “One of the biggest lessons is fully recognizing how people have started to use ChatGPT for deeply personal advice — something we didn't see as much even a year ago,” continued OpenAI in its blog post. “At the time, this wasn't a primary focus, but as AI and society have co-evolved, it's become clear that we need to treat this use case with great care. It's now going to be a more meaningful part of our safety work.” Get inside access to Europe's top investment minds — with leaders from Monzo, Accel, Paladin Group, and more — plus top-tier networking at StrictlyVC London.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the leaders of World Liberty Financial, a crypto company part-owned by US president Donald Trump and his family, fan out across the globe to try to win new business, critics have raised the alarm over the collection of alleged conflicts of interest trailing in their wake. On Thursday, Eric Trump appeared onstage in Dubai at the crypto conference Token2049. Alongside him sat Zachary Witkoff, cofounder of World Liberty Financial and son of the White House envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff. Together, the pair announced that USD1, a crypto coin unveiled by World Liberty Financial in March, would be used by MGX, an investment firm funded by the United Arab Emirates, to make a $2 billion investment in Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange. The model is simple: World Liberty Financial receives US dollars in exchange for coins that customers can trade freely in the crypto market. The profits of stablecoin issuers depend partly on the going interest rate—right now, short-term Treasuries yield a little over 4 percent—but otherwise scale in a linear fashion with supply. Therefore, the deal between MGX and Binance, which will increase the USD1 supply by up to 2 billion units, stands to be immensely lucrative for World Liberty Financial—and by extension, Trump and his family. If the company were to invest the entire $2 billion in short-term US Treasuries, it would earn approximately $85 million in interest each year at current market rates. However, the deal has inflamed concerns about the prospect that World Liberty Financial, in which the Trump family holds a 60 percent stake through a separate entity, could become embroiled in a thicket of conflicts and thorny ethical issues. USD1 is the latest in an expanding line of crypto coins issued by Trump-related entities that critics fear could theoretically be used in this way, including a separate World Liberty Financial coin that promises a say in the company's business decisions, and a memecoin launched by the president in January. World Liberty Financial did not respond immediately to a request for comment. In a statement, White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said, “President Trump's assets are in a trust managed by his children. The incoming stablecoin legislation “will make it easier for the president and his family to line their own pockets,” claimed Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren in a statement. The conflict of interest allegations have not prevented representatives of World Liberty Financial from setting out on a global business tour. “The stablecoin wars are in full swing, and new entrants are lining up with dotcom-era exuberance,” says Christian Catalini, founder at MIT Cryptoeconomics Lab. On April 27, the World Liberty Financial team was pictured alongside Changpeng Zhao, founder of Binance, who recently served a short prison sentence in the US after pleading guilty to failing to maintain an effective anti-money-laundering program. The USD1 stablecoin floats on top of Binance's crypto network. “We keep building,” Zhao tweeted, responding to the picture. On Thursday at Token2049, Eric Trump and Witkoff shared the stage with Justin Sun, creator of crypto network TRON, who recently announced he had invested a total of $75 million in World Liberty Financial's first crypto coin. In 2023, the US Securities and Exchange Commission charged Sun with market manipulation, among other violations. “Never before in American history have foreign governments, as well as people and corporations under investigation, so overtly and directly funneled vast sums to the president of the United States and his family,” claims Weissman.

Microsoft apparently has no plans to fix a security flaw that leaves machines vulnerable using Windows Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). In a recent report submitted to the Microsoft Security Response Center by Daniel Wade, the current configuration of Windows RDP will allow users to access machines to using old, cached passwords even if they have been updated or changed. Despite the glaring open backdoor, Microsoft has insisted that this is intentional and the company has no plans to change the way this function operates as it provides a method for users to never be completely locked out of their machine. Microsoft has their own definition of what qualifies as a "security vulnerability" and claims that this does not count as a vulnerability. The feature was intentionally designed to make sure users could access a given machine through RDP even after it's been offline for a long period of time. Wade described the security concern has a breakdown of trust. In this case, you can't prevent access using old passwords and receive no warning that the old passwords are still valid when using RDP. This is especially concerning in situations where passwords have been publicly compromised. Although the issue was investigated back then, the decision was ultimately made to not to change the way it functions out of concern for compatibility issues it could face with existing applications.

Nvidia has yet to officially reveal Blackwell-based graphics boards for professional visualization (ProViz) applications, but such cards are already undergoing testing in the wild by interested parties in Geekbench. An OpenCL benchmark result of Nvidia's upcoming RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell Workstation Edition graphics card has emerged, confirming rumored specifications of the GPU and memory while raising questions about performance. Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell Workstation Edition add-in-board is based on the GB202 graphics processing unit (GPU) with 24,064 CUDA cores (188 streaming multiprocessors, 128 CUDA cores) allegedly operating at up to 2,617 MHz and carries 96 GB of memory with ECC, according to the Geekbench listing. By contrast, Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5090 — the best graphics card for gaming money can buy these days — features the GB202 GPU with 21,760 CUDA cores operating at up to 2,410 MHz and carries 32 GB of GDDR7 memory. First up, we are dealing with a pre-release product with pre-release drivers, so the performance of the RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell Workstation Edition can improve when it is launched with final drivers. This proves that the driver is not final. Also, it should be noted that based on a previous report, this the RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell is not Nvidia's flagship ProViz offering, as the range-topping model is expected to be called the RTX Pro 6000 X Blackwell.

However, Intel has not yet fully committed to using the new tool in production, but it has an alternative production flow of its 14A node that uses standard Low-NA EUV as a backup plan. Intel has already received a second high-NA EUV tool, installed in its Oregon fab, and the company says the technology is progressing well. However, due to continuing development, the ~$400 million ASML Twinscan NXE:5000 High-NA EUV machines haven't been used in a production environment yet, so Intel isn't taking any risks. Second, High-NA EUV is performing to the expectations, and we will introduce it at the right time," said Dr. Naga Chandrasekaran, EVP, CTOO & GM of Intel Foundry Technology and Manufacturing. Intel will only use High-NA EUV on a small number of layers of the 14A node (the exact number isn't known), while other machines of varying resolutions will be used for the other layers. Because both techniques are design-rule compatible, Intel's customers won't have to change their designs regardless of the company's decision on the final manufacturing flow, either with or without High-NA EUV, which helps defray concerns that customers might have with Intel embracing an as-yet unproven production technology. Additionally, Intel's claim that both production flows offer the same yields signals that there won't be severe time-to-market repercussions if High-NA EUV development hits a snag, or if Intel chooses not to deploy it due to economics. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Most of the public-facing conversations about High-NA EUV have centered around cost, there's plenty of industry speculation that High-NA isn't as cost-effective as multi-patterning with Low-NA EUV, but there are still numerous technological hurdles to bringing the machines into production. However, Intel adopted ASML's machine first to get a leg up on the competition, and it has already produced 30,000 wafers using High-NA lithography during the development phase. As a representative explained later in the event, Intel still sees significant cost savings due to eliminating around 40 process steps. The right-hand side shows a very similar pattern generated with a traditional approach, where we use three EUV exposures [triple patterning], and overall about 40 process steps to generate this pattern." Intel didn't specify whether or not its comparisons are based on a full-reticle-sized print. In contrast, die that are equal to or smaller than a half-reticle size will only require one print with High-NA EUV. Intel has plenty of scar tissue from its 10nm node failures that ultimately ended in the company losing its chipmaking lead over TSMC, and it chalks the 10nm issues up to making too many big bets on new manufacturing techniques and technologies at once. The decision to develop an alternative Low-NA production flow is designed to prevent repeating those past mistakes, and Intel has also de-risked other types of advances by developing alternative solutions in the past. For instance, the company developed its new backside power delivery system with the 18A node, an industry first, while simultaneously developing gate-all-around (GAA) transistors, a first for Intel. To ensure a backup plan, the company employed a more robust de-risking strategy with its 18A process that included developing an internal-only trial process node without backside power. However, development went well with both GAA and backside power delivery, so Intel pushed forward with the full version of the 18A node. Intel had originally planned to use High-NA with its 18A process, which arrives before the 14A node. Intel later changed those plans, saying that the process node's unexpectedly fast development meant the machines wouldn't be ready in time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They will backtrack on us when it's beneficial to them.” WARC could not have arrived at a more urgent moment. He first signed an executive order to end “radical and wasteful” diverse hiring practices in federal agencies, then followed that with another aimed squarely at DEI programs in the private sector. As many agencies, public and private, have quickly fallen in line with Trump's orders, Foster says she's not going to rely on legacy institutions to do that important work. Their efforts come as scholars are sounding the alarm over Trump's latest war on museums—and history itself. In March, a biography about baseball hall-of-famer Jackie Robinson was removed from the Nimitz Library in the US Naval Academy, along with 400 books tied to DEI. The following month, the National Park Service removed references to Harriet Tubman's role in fighting against enslavement on a webpage; that information has since been restored. In the executive order targeting the Smithsonian network of museums, Trump calls out, “The Shape of Power: Stories of Race and American Sculpture,” an exhibit at the American Art Museum, as part of a so-called coordinated effort to “portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.” Meredith D. Clark, a professor of race and political communication at UNC-Chapel Hill, tells WIRED that museums are akin to “public trusts,” and the Trump administration's assault on them is an attempt to dictate who does and doesn't belong. And a tool for doing that is to destroy heritage,” says Clark, who wrote We Tried to Tell Y'all: Black Twitter and the Rise of Digital Counternarratives. Even though they can be a cesspool of racism and bigotry, social media platforms, from X to TikTok, are now de facto outlets for resistance as digital media has become the primary mode of communication. One way online activists and educators have traditionally fought back is through the creation of crowdsourced syllabi recommending resources around issues of police abuse, white supremacy, and race for educators. Foster says the country underwent a “pedagogical shift” during this time. “Black people were saying that ignorance is no longer a defense. All of a sudden you could educate yourself on these issues, and I wanted to document that,” Foster says. “When it comes to preserving an official record, they typically don't care what we think,” she says of large, often federally backed institutions, which is why social media has become crucial. But “only a small set of people were involved in that community,” Jules says, “and Black folks studying to be archivists were not invited to those networks.” A nonprofit that launched in 1996, the Internet Archive operates as a library of sorts: It includes 835 billion web pages, 44 million books and texts, and 15 million audio recordings, in addition to other artifacts. Many people today think of it as the web's collective memory. In spite of the administration's purge, Rudy Fraser, the creator of Blacksky, says he is “heartened by preservation efforts” he's seen so far, including from Harvard Law Library's Innovation Lab—which is rescuing federal datasets—and companies such as Joy Media, which leverage AI and VR/AR to scan and annotate African artifacts, making them accessible to people on the continent who otherwise can't view them. In 2023, Fraser launched Blacksky, the custom feed and moderation service that quickly turned into the central meeting ground for many Black users on Bluesky. Currently its database holds 17 million posts from Black users over the last two years (excluding deletions and moderation removals). “Open source, decentralized tooling ensures that, if any single company becomes a nation-state target, the communities that rely on its infrastructure can keep operating.” Preservation efforts have also taken the form of rogue civil rights courses across college campuses. When Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah's course on race, media and global history was discontinued by Columbia University in April, Attiah decided to “liberate my teaching work” by hosting it as an online course, aptly rebranding it “Resistance Summer School.” “This is not the time for media literacy or historical knowledge to be held hostage by institutions bending the knee to authoritarianism and fear,” she wrote on her Substack. According to Attiah, within 48 hours, all 500 seats were filled; the waiting list currently has over 3,000 people on it. It is still too soon to say just how much of a long-term impact Trump's attack on Black history is going to have on our population's historical literacy, but Foster and Jules say they are not deterred by the work ahead of them. “What does it mean for the federal government, at this moment, to be stewards of Black people's history? It only takes the stroke of a pen to start dismantling things. Ultimately, road maps to a better future are impossible without grassroots preservation efforts, Clark says. “The destruction of those histories and records makes it harder for people to remember what that progress looked like.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When clothing designers place an order at Katty Fashion's factory in Iași, Romania, they expect a bespoke service. If necessary, the factory will even rejig its production lines to make whichever garment a designer commissions. “We cannot create one production line or shop floor that fits everyone.” This adaptability is useful given the many diverse clients and orders Katty Fashion juggles, but it could also help future-proof the company against climate shocks. Katty Fashion is part of an EU-funded project called R3GROUP, which aims to help firms boost the resilience of their supply chains against disruptions caused by climate change and other factors. “Let's say there's going to be flooding in Germany, and we get our materials from Spain,” says Modreanu. As part of the R3GROUP project, Katty Fashion has worked with researchers to build a forensic understanding of where their textiles and accessories such as buttons and zips come from. It has revealed certain potential weak points, such as Spain and Portugal—countries that may increasingly be prone to heat waves or drought in the coming years. Using this data, along with information gleaned from news and weather reports, the company is developing a digital twin of its supply chain and factory processes that will analyze the vulnerability of its supplier network in real time. Companies were so hammered by logistics issues between 2020 and 2022 that many took up a strategy of “reshoring”—opting for suppliers closer to home so as to reduce delays. Some firms even decided to make completely different products, such as the gin and whiskey distilleries that began churning out hand sanitizer. US president Donald Trump's recent tariffs provided another shock to the supply chain system. But while the pandemic crunch was solved relatively quickly, and Trump's tariffs remain unpredictable, the next big shock is likely to last longer. Tracking such details requires long-term commitment and investment, says Beatriz Royo, associate professor at the MIT-Zaragoza Program in Spain. Mindful of this, professional services firm Marsh McLennan launched a system called Sentrisk last year that it claims can automatically analyze a company's shipping manifests and customs clearance records to build up a picture of its supply chain. Sentrisk relies on large language models to read potentially billions of PDF documents, depending on the client in question, and automatically trace where individual materials and parts come from. “It could misread something, of course,” says John Davies, Sentrisk commercial director—though he emphasises that the system relies on artificial intelligence only to read documents, not extrapolate beyond them. Sentrisk combines this supply chain analysis with data on climate risks in specific locations. “If you're to invest in the construction of a new fabrication plant, maybe you can choose a location that is less likely to be impacted by water shortage,” says Davies. Another challenge is that digital twins require constant updating, says Dmitry Ivanov, professor of supply chain and operations management at the Berlin School of Economics and Law. This is where new tools for climate-risk modeling and extreme weather prediction come in. Semiconductor and AI giant Nvidia has a platform called Earth-2, which it hopes will address this challenge, with the help of other organizations including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Some parts of the world only have relatively high-level information about current weather patterns; Earth-2 uses the same type of AI that sharpens pictures in your smartphone camera app to simulate higher-resolution data. “This is really useful, especially for small regions,” says Dion Harris, senior director of high-performance computing and AI factory solutions at Nvidia. Companies can feed their own data into Earth-2 to improve predictions even further.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The world of Twisted Wonderland is finally set to arrive stateside as an anime this October just in time for spooky season in this halfway to Halloween trailer announcement. We'd like to join the Hades house, please because that's definitely a premise we can get behind. The trailer from Disney+ showcases studios Yumeta Company and Graphinica's anime, showrun by chief director Takahiro Natori (Tokyo Mew Mew New) and directed by Shin Katagai (The Ossan Newbie Adventurer, Became Invincible) as reported by Crunchyroll. The previously announced news also named Yoichi Kato (City Hunters: Shinjuku Private Eyes) as the series writer with animation art by Haruka Nakano and Akane Sato, based on the franchise's original aesthetic and animation by Yana Toboso. It has been greenlit for three seasons on the platform. After some quick research into the Cheshire-smiling demon cat named Grim, there's no need to say more: I am so in. I'd seen some pieces of the manga art and game materials before, but now with the official series premiering with such a darkly fun concept surrounding villainous teens and iconic Disney baddies, I'm very excited to see more.
