https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news,Israel-Gaza war: More than 100 reported killed in crowd near Gaza aid convoy,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68434443,"Fri, 01 Mar 2024 00:51:21 GMT","

At least 112 Palestinians are said to have been killed and 760 injured trying to get desperately needed aid in Gaza.

Crowds descended on a convoy of lorries on the coastal road south-west of Gaza City, in the presence of Israeli tanks.

Israel's military say tanks fired warning shots but did not strike the convoy. Some Palestinians say troops fired directly at them. 

A Palestinian witness told the BBC most of those who died had been run over as lorry drivers tried to move forward.

Israeli aerial footage shows hundreds of people on and around lorries, while graphic videos posted online show bodies loaded on to emptied aid lorries and a donkey cart.

Giving the figures of 112 dead and 760 injured, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry accused Israel of a ""massacre"".

The UN Security Council has scheduled a closed-door emergency meeting to discuss the incident.

France said ""fire by Israeli soldiers against civilians trying to access food"" was ""unjustifiable"" and US President Joe Biden expressed concern the incident would complicate efforts by mediators to broker a temporary ceasefire in the war between Israel and Hamas.

The medical charity MSF said it was ""horrified"" and called for an ""immediate and sustained ceasefire"". 

The incident came hours before Gaza's health ministry announced that more than 30,000 people, including 21,000 children and women, had been killed in Gaza since the start of the current conflict on 7 October. Some 7,000 were missing and 70,450 were injured, it said.

The UN is warning of a looming famine in the north of the territory, where an estimated 300,000 people are living with little food or clean water.

The Israeli military launched a large-scale air and ground campaign to destroy Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK and others - after its gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 253 hostages.

Thursday's incident took place shortly after 04:45 (02:45 GMT) at the Nabulsi roundabout, on the south-western edge of Gaza City.

A convoy of 30 lorries carrying Egyptian aid was making its way north along what the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) described as a ""humanitarian corridor"" when it was surrounded by civilians, with people climbing on to the trucks.

""Some began violently pushing and even trampling other Gazans to death, looting the humanitarian supplies,"" said the IDF's chief spokesman, Rear Adm Daniel Hagari. ""The unfortunate incident resulted in dozens of Gazans killed and injured."" 

Israeli tanks, he said, ""cautiously tried to disperse the mob with a few warning shots"" but pulled back ""when the hundreds became thousands and things got out of hand"".

""No IDF strike was conducted towards the aid convoy,"" he said, insisting the Israeli military had been trying to help the aid convoy reach its destination.

Another IDF spokesman said some civilians had approached Israeli soldiers at a nearby checkpoint, ignoring warning shots. Fearing a threat, the soldiers fired at them in a ""limited response"", he said.

A Palestinian witness, speaking to the BBC, described panic in the crowd and among the drivers, who tried to move forward. Most of those who died were run over, the witness added.

Hamas rejected the IDF's account, citing ""undeniable"" evidence of ""direct firing at citizens, including headshots aimed at immediate killing"".

Dozens of casualties in a critical or severe condition were brought to the nearby al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, where medics were unable to cope with the sheer volume and severity of cases.

One man at the hospital who was cradling the body of this dead friend, Tamer Shinbari, told the BBC he had gone to the Nabulsi roundabout hoping to get a bag of flour for his family. He said Israeli soldiers had opened fire ""and the aid lorry ran over the bodies"".

All or most of the casualties being treated at two other hospitals, Kamal Adwan and al-Awda, were said by officials there to have bullet or shrapnel wounds.  

Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, a rival of Hamas based in the occupied West Bank, accused Israeli forces of a ""heinous massacre"".

A spokesman for UN Secretary General António Guterres said he condemned the incident and called again for an ""immediate humanitarian ceasefire and the unconditional release of all hostages"".

The north of Gaza suffered widespread devastation after being the focus of the first phase of the Israeli ground offensive and has been largely cut off from humanitarian assistance for several months.

Last week, the World Food Programme said it had been forced to suspend aid deliveries to the area after its first convoy in three weeks had been surrounded by crowds of hungry people close to an Israeli checkpoint and had then faced gunfire in Gaza City. 

On Tuesday, a senior UN aid official warned that at least 576,000 people across the Gaza Strip - one quarter of the population - faced catastrophic levels of food insecurity and one in six children under the age of two in the north were suffering from acute malnutrition and wasting.

Ten children died from dehydration and malnutrition at hospitals in northern Gaza in recent days, the health ministry said.

More than 110 Palestinians are reported to have died while trying to get desperately needed aid in north Gaza.

Another 70,000 Palestinians have been injured during the war, according to the Hamas-run authority.

BBC Verify examines the evidence on combatant deaths, as concern grows about the scale of civilian killing.

Brigg and Goole MP Andrew Percy says abuse since the war in Gaza is on a scale never seen before.

Officers must use their powers against people who undermine democracy by targeting MPs, Rishi Sunak says.

The Palestinian foreign ministry issued a statement asking the International Court of Justice to ""issue subpoenas and arrest warrants"" following the deaths of civilians who were awaiting aid in northern Gaza today. 

Israel's military said it was bringing in a convoy with aid when a group surrounded the trucks and troops ""fired"" at crowds. IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari later denied that civilians were attacked from the air or the ground, saying tanks issued ""warning shots"" and attempted to retreat. 

Gaza's Health Ministry said more than 100 people were killed and hundreds of others were injured. NBC News has not independently verified the reported death toll, and it’s not clear how many were killed from gunfire or the ensuing panic. 

The Palestinian foreign ministry accused Israel of violating the International Court of Justice provisional order, which said it must take effective measures to enable the provision of basic services and humanitarian aid. 

Qatar's foreign ministry also issued a statement condemning the incident as a ""heinous massacre committed by the Israeli occupation."" The statement called it a continuation of the ""occupation's brutal crimes."" 

""The Ministry stresses the need for the international community to shoulder its moral and legal responsibilities to oblige the Israeli occupation to comply with international law ... to provide protection to the brotherly Palestinian people from the systemic Israeli policies of killing, besieging, staving and forcibly displacing them,"" it said.

A group of Israeli citizens ""broke through""  Erez crossing at Israel's border with Gaza today and ""harmed the activities of the IDF,"" military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said. 

No additional details were provided about why the citizens were at the crossing, which has been closed to the public since Oct. 7. Hagari said the citizens violated the law, and he condemned the criminal behavior.  

""The fact that soldiers are attacked by those they protect is extremely serious,"" Hagari said. ""Soldiers are busy with this instead of fighting in Gaza."" 

Doha Madani

Dr. Isabelle Defourny, the president of Médecins Sans Frontières France, laid blame for today's deadly aid convoy incident on Israel and described it as a consequence of the ""extreme deprivation"" in northern Gaza. 

“A few days ago, when we spoke to our staff there, they said they did not have enough food to eat and that some were resorting to pet food to survive,” Defourny said. “They also reported a lack of clean water, which is leading to diseases.”

In a statement today, Defourny said the situation is the ""direct result of the string of unconscionable decisions taken by Israeli authorities while waging this war."" 

She reiterated the group's call for a cease-fire in Gaza. 

""We call on Israeli authorities to allow unimpeded and streamlined humanitarian and essential aid like food to be delivered into and throughout the Gaza Strip, and for attacks on civilians to stop immediately,"" she said.

NBC News

The chaotic aid distribution that turned deadly today is an example of why a cease-fire is needed to get food and supplies to Gaza, former Defense Secretary and ex-CIA Director Leon Panetta told MSNBC. 

""We've seen these trucks besieged by crowds,"" Panetta said. ""Why there can't be better order in the distribution of that humanitarian aid — with the amount of military that's there — I don't understand.""

Israeli forces fired on a crowd of Palestinians waiting for aid in Gaza City, and at least 100 people were killed, with hundreds more injured. NBC News has not independently verified the reported death toll, and it’s not clear how many people were killed from gunfire or the ensuing panic. 

The Israeli military said that an aid truck was surrounded by civilians, causing pushing and trampling, and that it was reviewing the incident.

Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, a leader of the Yemen rebel militia, threatened continued attacks against enemies in the Red Sea, the Arabian Sea, the Gulf of Aden and the Bab al-Mandab Strait. 

""Our surprises, God willing, will come effective and impactful,"" he said in a speech today. 

Al-Houthi said American and British attacks on the group have only strengthened the Houthis' resolve in their support of Palestinians. An international coalition has criticized the militia's attacks, particularly in the Red Sea, which have disrupted commerce and led to retaliatory strikes from the U.S. and the U.K. 

The group is one of the three Iran-backed groups in the region — along with Hamas and Hezbollah — that has maintained it is acting against Israel's ""crimes"" against Palestinian people. 

""When a person is given the opportunity to be in a great position and then does not act, it is a serious situation for him,"" al-Houthi said. ""We will not tire, we will not slack, we will not weaken, and we will not retreat."" 

NBC News

Referring to the hundreds of casualties in a huge crowd of desperate civilians waiting for aid in Gaza City overnight, United Nations spokesperson Stephane Dujarric insisted that whether it was Israeli gunfire or a crush or the trucks that caused it, the war in Gaza was to blame. “These are all acts of violence, in a sense, due to this conflict,” he said.

Four more children have died of malnutrition and dehydration in northern Gaza, Gaza's Health Ministry reported today.

Kamal Adwan Hospital reported the deaths today, bringing the malnutrition death toll to 10 children this week. Four were previously reported at the hospital, as well as two others at Al-Shifa Hospital.

The Florida Senate unanimously passed a bill yesterday to define the term “antisemitism.”

“Outbreaks of antisemitism can be a harbinger of deep societal trouble and reflect that extremism and violence are eminent. It is dangerous and unacceptable,” Democratic Sen. Lori Berman, the sponsor of the bill, told The Associated Press. “When there is hateful behavior against anyone, it can quickly become a societal endemic.”

The definition in the bill was taken from the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance. “Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities,” IHRA said.

Florida is the latest to pass a bill to define the term as the war in Gaza continues. Last month, Georgia passed a similar bill. A coalition of organizations, including Jewish Voice for Peace and the Council on American–Islamic Relations, issued a joint statement at the time, saying that the Georgia bill “falsely equates critiques of Israel and Zionism with discrimination against Jewish people.”

Israel's military has been securing aid convoys for the last few nights, but today's incident that resulted in deaths was the first to have issues, IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said.

Hagari said the military's tanks and drones were accompanying the convoy of aid trucks to help secure the humanitarian corridor, but at 4:45 a.m. local time, hundreds of people began to surround the convoy. Tanks fired ""warning shots"" to disperse the mob.

The IDF spokesperson denied shooting at civilians ""either from the air or from the ground.""

""When the hundreds became thousands and things got out of hand, the tank commander decided to retreat to avoid harm to the thousands of Gazans that were there,"" Hagari said. 

He added that in his opinion, based on footage from the drones, the tanks backed up cautiously and securely. 

The convoy was coordinated by Israel, Hagari said, as part of the country's commitment to distributing aid to civilians. He acknowledged that distributing the aid has been a problem.

Israel is working to return all of the remaining hostages still captive in Gaza but will not fold to ""delusional demands of Hamas,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a press conference today. 

""It is too early to say, despite our desire, if we will achieve another release plan in the coming days,"" he said. ""We make great efforts to succeed.""

The prime minister said that he has yet to receive a response to a demand he made to know the names of all the abducted citizens who will be released as part of the deal. He added that it is a ""sacred goal"" to return the hostages. 

""We are determined to bring them all back,"" Netanyahu said. ""With a plan or without a plan, we will fight until complete victory."" 

When asked whether Israel's military has completed a plan for operations in Rafah, Netanyahu told reporters, ""We do not give notice when we will continue the operation."" 

""Have we prepared the continuation of the action? Yes,"" Netanyahu said. ""The IDF presented it to the war Cabinet and to me. It will also be presented later to the general Cabinet.""

One in five pregnant women at a health clinic in Deir al Balah in central Gaza are malnourished, Project HOPE, a nongovernmental organization, warned in a statement today.

The statement said that women and children were suffering from acute malnutrition and there had been an increase in anemia cases among pregnant women, a problem of not having healthy red blood cells to provide oxygen to the whole body.

It added that 1 in 10 children in the clinic also showed signs of malnutrition.

“Anything short of an urgent and lasting cease-fire will exacerbate the inhumane conditions for more than two million people in Gaza,” the organization added.

As the death toll in Gaza tops 30,000 and international criticism mounts, Israeli forces believe they are on the path to victory in their offensive against Hamas. But the Palestinian militants are still fighting and could yet draw Israel into a long quagmire like past conflicts in Lebanon, former U.S. military officers and analysts say.

After four months of hammering, Israel says it has severely damaged the capacity of Hamas to fight, killing about 12,000 of its roughly 30,000-strong army and destroying much of its arsenal.

Israeli commanders and officials say Hamas is under growing pressure, with no way to replenish its weapons or ammunition and increasingly restricted in its movements.

Brig. Gen. Dan Goldfuss, commander of the Israel Defense Forces 98th Paratroopers Division, told NBC News that top Hamas leaders are now unable to direct their troops in real-time combat because they have no way to communicate securely.

“They’ve lost command and control,” said Goldfuss.

Egypt and Jordan issued separate statements earlier today, condemning Israel for committing a “shameful crime” and “brutally targeting” Palestinians seeking humanitarian aid after the shooting in northern Gaza killed at least 104.

“Egypt considers targeting peaceful citizens running to collect their share of humanitarian aid a shameful crime, a blatant violation of the provisions of international law and international humanitarian law, and a disregard for the value of the human being and the sanctity of his soul,” Egypt’s foreign ministry said on X.

Jordan’s Ministry of Foreign and Expatriates Affairs also said it “condemned the brutal targeting by the Israeli occupation forces of a gathering of Gazan citizens who were waiting to receive humanitarian aid at the Nabulsi roundabout near Al-Rashid Street in the Gaza Strip.”

BEIRUT — A halt to fighting in the Gaza Strip as early as next week would trigger indirect talks to end hostilities along Lebanon’s southern border with Israel, Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Pinister Najib Mikati said on Thursday.

In an interview with Reuters, Mikati said he was confident that the Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah would cease fire if Israel did the same, ending nearly five months of cross-border shelling and airstrikes. Hezbollah, an ally of Hamas, has said its campaign aims to support the Palestinians under Israeli bombardment.

Mikati said a deal to halt military action in Gaza was “on the horizon” and could begin as early as next week.

“If we are able to reach a cessation of military operations in Gaza, then I believe that we will have ahead of us weeks packed with negotiations, so that we can reach what I have always called long-term stability in the south,” he said.

Mikati said he had met U.S. special envoy Amos Hochstein in February in Munich, who was “preparing for visits to Lebanon soon.” Hochstein, who was last in Beirut in mid-January, mediated a rare deal in 2022 between Lebanon and Israel, with a nod of approval from Hezbollah, that ended their long-standing maritime border dispute. He has said he hopes to do the same for their land border.

When asked whether Hezbollah had signaled a willingness to move forward with talks, Mikati suggested that the “cooperation” shown by “all sides” to facilitate the maritime deal could be replicated for a land border deal.

“I am certain that the moment that Israel stops its violations against Lebanon, I am convinced that Hezbollah will not violate — or will not respond to something that did not happen,” he said.

Hezbollah itself indicated it was ready to halt its cross-border attacks if a Gaza cease-fire comes into force.

“The war in the south is linked to the aggression on Gaza on the one hand, and to securing means of protection for our country on the other,” senior Hezbollah politician Hassan Fadlallah said.

The United Nations' Palestinian refugee agency was not involved in the aid distribution in northern Gaza today that turned deadly as Israeli forces reportedly opened fire on civilians.

Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA commissioner-general, said neither his agency nor any of the United Nations' teams were involved with the aid convoy.

""Another day from hell,"" he wrote in a post on X.

Aid organizations have warned for weeks that the humanitarian situation has created a desperation among starving civilians, particularly in northern Gaza, where convoys have inconsistent access. The World Food Programme made the decision earlier this month to temporarily suspend its work in the north after its convoys were stalled and faced dangerous situations just trying to make their way to the area.

LONDON — Prince William condemned antisemitism during a visit to a London synagogue on Thursday, the first time he appeared in public after he unexpectedly pulled out of a royal event earlier in the week.

William, the heir to the throne, heard about how Jewish students across the U.K. have been affected by the rise of hatred against the Jewish community during his visit to the Western Marble Arch Synagogue. He also spent time with Renee Salt, a 94-year-old Holocaust survivor.

The royal said he and his wife, Kate, the Princess of Wales, are extremely concerned about the rise in antisemitism. “I’m here today to reassure you all that people do care, people do listen and we can’t let that keep going,” he said. 

William spoke out last week against the fighting in Gaza and called for the Israel-Hamas conflict to end “as soon as possible.” While his statement stopped short of calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza, he spoke of the “terrible human cost of the conflict in the Middle East since the Hamas terrorist attack” and urged for more humanitarian support to Gaza.

Airdropping aid into Gaza is mostly a move to ""relieve the guilty consciences"" of U.S. officials who have contributed to the ""atrocities"" in the Palestinian enclave, Oxfam America's Scott Paul, associate director of peace and security, said in a statement today.

Oxfam does not support the move, Paul said, amid reports that U.S. officials were considering airdrops as challenges continue to stall ground distribution of basic goods.

He noted that dropping in supplies with no plan for disseminating would not only be a paltry stopgap but also ""degrading"" to Palestinians.

""Instead of indiscriminate airdrops in Gaza, the U.S. should cut the flow of weapons to Israel that are used in indiscriminate attacks, push for an immediate ceasefire and the release of hostages, and insist that Israel uphold its duty to provide humanitarian aid, access, and other basic services,"" Paul said.

Two men were killed in a shooting at gas station in Eli, a settlement in the occupied West Bank, Israeli emergency services group Magen David Adom said today.

Neither man was identified, but one was in his 20s and the other in his 40s, according to a spokesperson for Magen David Adom. Paramedics responded to the scene and found a vehicle with an unconscious man as well as another nearby. They both had gunshot wounds and were pronounced dead ""a short time"" after first responders arrived.

Israel's military said its soldiers were scanning the area and described the shooting as a ""terror attack.""

News coming out of Gaza still has the ability to shock even after months of warfare, said Martin Griffiths, the United Nations' undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs, in a post on X today.

Griffiths wrote in a statement that he was appalled at the news that civilians were killed and injured during a transfer of aid in Gaza City earlier today.

""Life is draining out of Gaza at a terrifying speed,"" he said.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, yesterday to discuss the “urgent” need to create new humanitarian routes that could facilitate aid to reach civilians in northern Gaza, according to a readout from the Defense Ministry.

The pair also talked about the negotiations for the release of hostages held by Hamas, the readout said.

Gallant said that military operations in Gaza would not stop until Hamas is removed from the enclave and all hostages are returned, his office said in a statement.

Gallant said U.S. leadership and international pressure would be crucial if Israel wants to reach a framework that would facilitate the return of the hostages, the statement added.

President Joe Biden held calls this morning with the emir of Qatar and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, according to a U.S. official.

The president told NBC News moments ago that he “was on the telephone with the people in the region” when asked about a possible temporary cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in the coming days.

The U.S. official confirmed that Biden discussed the current hostage talks and the overall situation in Gaza in both calls.

In the dead of night, thousands of hungry Gazans are seen huddling around fires scattered across Al-Rashid Street in Gaza City, awaiting aid.

In a video shot by an NBC News crew on the ground, piles of waste and battered buildings line the street before several aid trucks arrive. Chaos unfolds as hundreds of people rush the vehicle, with individuals climbing on top of it, grabbing boxes of aid, and throwing them down to the crowds below. 

""Is there sugar?"" a man can be heard shouting.

In interviews with NBC News, desperate Gazans lamented the lack of aid and food supplies reaching the northern parts of the enclave, where the United Nations has warned of ""imminent"" famine.

Abou Adil Felfel, 60, told NBC News he came to the street looking for a piece of bread.

""I'm looking for things for my children,"" he said in front of a crackling fire. ""Nothing is allowed to enter here for us to survive. We are dying slow deaths,"" he said, listing basic supplies, like medicines, that he can't find.

Abjed El Gazzer, a doctor from Al-Shifa Hospital who has lost his home and his parents in the war, said he went to Al-Rashid Street in the cold at 3 a.m. searching for food like the rest of the crowd.

""A bag of flour that used to be 10 dollars is now 1000 dollars,"" he said frustrated at wartime prices. ""No one can buy anything in Gaza. The only reason for us risking our lives is to get scraps of food for our kids. That's the stage we've reached.""

As dusk fell, several bloodied, dead bodies were filmed laid out on the flatbed of a truck, and others were wrapped in makeshift shrouds along the road's rubble.

Palestinian officials said dozens were killed in this overnight attack by Israeli forces near the humanitarian aid convoy. In a statement on Telegram, Gaza's government media office said 104 civilians had been killed in a ""horrific massacre"" while searching for food.

Israel confirmed that its troops had opened fire, with a government source saying the crowd “posed a threat” to Israeli soldiers, without clarifying what the threat was. They added that some casualties may have been caused by trampling in the crowd.

Doha Madani

President Joe Biden took questions on the White House South Lawn today, telling reporters he has received conflicting reports about the deadly incident in north Gaza today, in which dozens were killed and more injured as a crowd rushed an aid truck.

Asked whether it would complicate negotiations for a cease-fire, Biden responded, “I know it will.” He said his administration was still working on getting the details of what happened.

But the president also remained publicly optimistic that a cease-fire deal could happen.

“Hope springs eternal,” Biden said. “I was on the telephone with people in the region. Probably not by Monday but I’m hopeful.”

A statement on Telegram from Izzat Al-Risheq, of Hamas’ political bureau, suggested that the chaotic and deadly incident in which the Israeli military attacked Palestinians seeking humanitarian aid could threaten ongoing negotiations over the release of hostages held by Hamas.

The statement, which was addressed to mediators at the negotiations, particularly Americans, said that the “negotiations are not an open process, and we will not allow the path of negotiations, through which we seek to end the human suffering of our people created by the occupation; to be a cover for the enemy’s continued crimes against our people in the Gaza Strip.”

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’ office accused Israel of committing an “ugly massacre” after Israeli soldiers opened fire on people waiting for humanitarian aid in northern Gaza, killing at least 100.

“The killing of this large number of innocent civilian victims who risked their livelihood is considered an integral part of the genocidal war,” the office told WAFA, the Palestinian news agency, adding that Israel should be held accountable before international courts.

The International Court of Justice has heard two cases involving Israel this year, including a case led by South Africa accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza and another on the legality of Israel’s occupation of Palestinian land. Israel disputed both accusations.

All parties involved in the Israel-Hamas war may have committed war crimes, with a clear violation of international humanitarian law, U.N. human rights chief Volker Turk said today.

“It is time, well past time, for peace, investigation and accountability,” he told the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, as he called for those responsible to be held accountable.

In a separate statement yesterday, Turk said Israeli operations had caused “unprecedented destruction and suffering,” leading to the humanitarian crisis in the enclave, as thousands of civilians face famine.

He also called on Israel to stop “collective punishment” immediately against all Gazans, allowing more humanitarian aid and commercial goods to enter and ending the “complete siege.”

Kids in Gaza are dying of malnutrition and lack of food, Jason Lee of Save the Children said yesterday in a statement.

""What we are witnessing in Gaza is a mass killing of children in slow motion because there is no food left and nothing getting to them,"" said Lee, the charity's country director in the occupied Palestinian territory.

Monica Alba

The White House has said it is “looking into the reports” of Israeli soldiers firing on a crowd of Gazans waiting for aid, calling it a “serious incident.”

“We mourn the loss of innocent life and recognize the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, where innocent Palestinians are just trying to feed their families,” a White House National Security Council spokesperson said.

“This underscores the importance of expanding and sustaining the flow of humanitarian assistance into Gaza, including through a potential temporary cease-fire. We continue to work day and night to achieve that outcome,” the spokesperson said.

SYDNEY — New Zealand on Thursday listed Palestinian Islamist group Hamas in its entirety as a terrorist entity and imposed travel bans on “extremist” Israeli settlers whom it said had committed violent attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank.

Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said in a statement that the attacks by Hamas on Israel in October “were brutal and we have unequivocally condemned them.”

But he added that “New Zealand wants to be clear that the designation of Hamas is about the actions of an offshore terrorist entity and is not a reflection on the Palestinian people in Gaza and around the world.”

New Zealand has designated the military wing of Hamas as a terrorist entity since 2010.

Foreign Minister Winston Peters said the whole of Hamas bears responsibility for the October attacks, making it difficult for the New Zealand government to distinguish between the group’s military and political wings.

The Oct. 7 attacks killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, Israel’s air and ground campaign in Hamas-governed Gaza has killed about 30,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza health ministry.

New Zealand’s decision makes it a criminal offense to carry out property or financial transactions with Hamas or provide material support. It also freezes any Hamas assets in New Zealand.

It does not prevent New Zealand from providing humanitarian and future development assistance for civilians in Gaza or from giving consular support to New Zealand citizens or permanent residents in the conflict zone.

Luxon also said he was “seriously concerned by the significant increase in extremist violence perpetrated by Israeli settlers” against Palestinians in recent months.

“This is particularly destabilizing in what is already a major crisis,” Luxon said.

New Zealand’s consistent position has been that Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories are a violation of international law.

The government said it would continue to support a future Palestinian state as part of a negotiated two-state solution, urging an end to the current conflict and an urgent restart of the Middle East peace process.

The Israeli army opened fire at Palestinians waiting for humanitarian aid on a coastal road in northern Gaza earlier today, killing at least 100 people and injuring hundreds more, Gaza health officials have said.

Videos on social media show injured people lying in trucks, some of them bloodied. 

Israel confirmed that its troops had opened fire, with a government source saying the crowd “posed a threat” to Israeli soldiers, without clarifying what the threat was. They added that some casualties may have been caused by trampling in the crowd.

56% of respondents who identified themselves as Democrats said they were less likely to support a candidate who backs military assistance for Israel, a new Reuters/Ipsos poll found.

The three-day poll, which closed yesterday, showed that a minority — 40% of Democrats — said they are more likely to support such a candidate. 

As the death toll in the enclave climbs and tensions escalate in the Middle East, President Joe Biden’s support for Israel’s war with Hamas — including arms shipments to Israel — has angered some members of his party, whose support will be crucial ahead of the November presidential election.

The poll results also showed that Biden and former President Donald Trump, the likley Republican candidate, would be tied in a hypothetical election. 36% of respondents each favored Biden and Trump, with the rest saying they are unsure who to vote for, or if they would vote at all.

Medical staff at the neonatal department at Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahiya told an NBC News crew that there were seeing unprecedented numbers of Palestinian children suffering from malnutrition, hunger and dehydration. For every child discharged, two will take its place, they said. 

Hakim Ahmed Elkahlout, the department's head nurse, showed the crew a frail baby girl who was admitted two days ago, lying limply in a hospital bed. ""She needs specialized care and specialized nutrition,"" he said. 

Some days ago, four malnourished children died at the hospital, staff said.

The Biden administration is considering airdropping aid into Gaza, a U.S. official has told NBC News, given the dire need for humanitarian assistance and the slower pace of land deliveries into the Palestinian enclave. 

This comes as the White House is growing increasingly concerned about a possible famine for a sizeable portion of Gaza’s population. 

Axios was first to report the news.

Reports that at least six more children in northern Gaza have died of dehydration and malnutrition are “horrendous,” the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees said on X today.

The United Nations Relief and Works Agency also called for “unimpeded access” across the enclave and an immediate cease-fire.

Israel said that its troops opened fire on a crowd of people waiting for humanitarian aid this morning in Gaza City in the north of the enclave, responding to reports from officials in Gaza that dozens of people were killed in an Israeli attack.

""Early this morning, during the entry of humanitarian aid trucks into the northern Gaza Strip, Gazan residents surrounded the trucks, and looted the supplies being delivered. During the incident, dozens of Gazans were injured as a result of pushing and trampling,"" an IDF spokesperson said in a statement. ""The incident is under review.""

An Israeli government source said that ""several people who surrounded the humanitarian aid trucks approached IDF troops securing the passage of trucks as part of a humanitarian operation to transfer aid.""

""The crowd approached the forces in a manner that posed a threat to the troops, who responded to the threat with live fire. The incident is under review,"" the source added.

The Israel-Hamas war in Gaza has now killed at least 30,000 people, the Palestinian Health Ministry announced today, a swelling death toll that has already drawn condemnation internationally, isolated Israel and prompted dismay from its traditional friends and allies.

Though the United States says a cease-fire may be near, the military campaign looks far from over. Some 70% of the dead are women and children, according to figures published by the Palestinian Health Ministry. 

American and U.N. officials say the death toll given by Palestinian officials is at least accurate and perhaps an undercount. Aid workers on the ground say that thousands more people could still be trapped under the rubble. In addition, some 70,000 people have been wounded, and 1.7 million — or 80% of the population — has been displaced, according to Gazan health officials and U.N. estimates.

An attack on a crowd of Palestinians waiting for aid in Gaza City has killed and wounded dozens of people, according to local officials. 

At least 70 people were killed by an Israeli strike while waiting for humanitarian aid, Dr. Ashraf Al-Qudra, a spokesperson for the enclave’s Health Ministry, said in a statement this morning. 

More than 280 people were injured, Al-Qudra said, adding that the injuries, ranged from critical to serious. He added that many had been taken to Al-Shifa, Gaza's largest medical facility which was raided by Israeli forces earlier this year.  

The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports. 

The incident comes after food aid entered northern Gaza yesterday for the first time in weeks, as the U.N. and aid agencies warn of mass starvation.

OTTAWA, Ontario — Canada is working to airdrop humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip as soon as possible, a Cabinet minister said yesterday.

The confirmation that an active effort is underway comes after Canadian International Development Minister Ahmed Hussen said Ottawa was exploring new options to deliver aid.

He said the provision of airdrops in partnership with like-minded countries in the region, such as Jordan, was on the table.

Hussen said last week that the provision of aid is nowhere near what’s needed and a tedious inspection process was slowing down the movement of supplies brought in by truck.

He made the comments following a trip to the Rafah border crossing, the only way in or out of the Gaza Strip since the Israel-Hamas war began in October.

Canada has put 100 million Canadian dollars ($74 million) toward aid for the besieged territory since the start of the conflict, including 40 million Canadian dollars ($30 million) committed in January.

Thousands of Palestinians flocked to an aid distribution point early Thursday, desperate for food amid Gaza's looming famine, only to be met with lethal chaos including live fire by Israeli troops.

By mid-afternoon the Hamas-run health ministry said more than 100 people were reported dead in the grisly incident which underscored worsening shortages in the besieged Palestinian territory.

""There were crowds of people, but the occupation (forces) kept firing towards us,"" one young man told AFP while lying on the dirty, crowded floor at Kamal Adwan Hospital waiting for treatment.

He was among those wounded in the chaos. But there were conflicting reports on what exactly unfolded in the hours before dawn.

Ali Awad Ashqir, who had gone to get some flour for his starving family, had been waiting for two hours when violence erupted.

""At approximately 4:00 am the trucks began to arrive. The moment they arrived, the occupation army fired artillery shells and guns,"" he told AFP.

“I was hit by a bullet in the left foot and taken to Al-Shifa hospital. I was later discharged because my injuries were moderate.”

Hossam Abu Safiya, director at Kamal Adwan hospital, said all those killed and injured were hit by ""bullets and shrapnel from occupation forces"".

Ashraf al-Qudra, spokesman for Gaza's health ministry, denounced what he called a ""massacre"" at Gaza City's Nabulsi roundabout, saying 104 people were killed and 760 wounded.

He blamed Israeli troops, and Israeli sources confirmed to AFP that the Israeli forces at the scene did open fire, having perceived the crowds near the trucks as a ""threat"".

But a spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said many of the dead were crushed by the trucks themselves.

""Aid trucks were overwhelmed by people trying to loot and drivers ploughed into the crowd of people, ultimately killing tens of people,"" said the spokesman, Avi Hyman.

And an Israeli army spokesman told AFP that as the aid convoy headed ""north thousands of people surrounded the trucks"".

""This led to a stampede in which dozens of Gazans were injured and killed, some of them run over by the trucks.""

Outside Kamal Adwan Hospital, four women in headscarves wailed while clutching at the lifeless body of a bearded man wrapped in white cloth.

At Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, doctors were ""unable to deal"" with the flood of casualties ""as a result of weak medical and human capacities"", Qudra said.

Israel has vowed to eliminate Hamas after it carried out an unprecedented attack on October 7 on southern Israel.

The Hamas attack resulted in the deaths of around 1,160 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures.

Umm Hamdan Abu Sultan, a displaced woman waiting for aid near the scene, said: ""They are the terrorists, not us.""

""Our children are dying of hunger, we go to get a bag of flour to feed our children and they fire at them.""

Israel's withering military response to the October 7 attack has now killed at least 30,035 people, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry, which does not specify how many fighters are included in the toll.

The offensive has caused widespread devastation in Gaza and severe shortages of food, water and medicine.

For months, aid workers have warned of an increasingly desperate situation for Gazan civilians, and on Monday an official from the UN humanitarian office OCHA said widespread starvation was ""almost inevitable"".

UN estimates show that 2.2 million people -- the vast majority of Gaza's population -- are threatened with famine, particularly in the north where destruction, fighting and looting make the delivery of food almost impossible.

According to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, just over 2,300 aid trucks entered the Gaza Strip in February, a drop of about 50 percent compared with January.

That is an average of well below 100 trucks per day, down from around 500 that were entering daily before the war.

It was precisely that scarcity that drove crowds to rush the trucks at Nabulsi roundabout on Thursday, a witness told AFP.

Aerial footage distributed by the Israeli military showed large groups swarming a line of moving trucks on foot.

""Trucks full of aid came too close to some army tanks that were in the area and the crowd, thousands of people, just stormed the trucks,"" the witness said, declining to be named for safety reasons.

""The soldiers fired at the crowd as people came too close to the tanks.""

Thursday's incident spurred a heated exchange at the Human Rights Council in Geneva, where Palestinian ambassador Ibrahim Mohammad Khraishi confronted his Israeli counterpart about the reported casualties.

""Are these human shields? Are these Hamas combatants?"" Khraishi asked.

At Kamal Adwan hospital, a Palestinian woman said: “We are under siege. Take pity on us. Ramadan is coming soon. People should look at us. Pity us.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed Thursday to fulfill Moscow’s goals in Ukraine and sternly warned the West against deeper involvement in the fighting, saying that such a move is fraught with the risk of a global nuclear conflict. (Feb. 29)





















































MOSCOW (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed Thursday to fulfill Moscow’s goals in Ukraine and sternly warned the West against deeper involvement in the fighting, saying that such a move is fraught with the risk of a global nuclear conflict.

Putin’s blunt warning came in a state-of-the-nation address ahead of next month’s election he’s all but certain to win, underlining his readiness to raise the stakes in the tug-of-war with the West to protect the Russian gains in Ukraine.

In an apparent reference to French President Emmanuel Macron’s statement earlier this week that the future deployment of Western ground troops to Ukraine should not be “ruled out”, Putin warned that it would lead to “tragic” consequences for the countries who decide to do that.

Putin noted that while accusing Russia of plans to attack NATO allies in Europe, Western allies were “selecting targets for striking our territory” and “talking about the possibility of sending a NATO contingent to Ukraine.”

“We remember the fate of those who sent their troop contingents to the territory of our country,” the Russian leader said in an apparent allusion to the failed invasions by Napoleon and Hitler. “Now the consequences for the potential invaders will be far more tragic.”




In a two-hour speech before an audience of lawmakers and top officials, Putin cast Western leaders as reckless and irresponsible and declared that the West should keep in mind that “we also have the weapons that can strike targets on their territory, and what they are now suggesting and scaring the world with, all that raises the real threat of a nuclear conflict that will mean the destruction of our civilization.” 

The strong statement followed earlier warnings from Putin, who has issued frequent reminders of Russia’s nuclear might since he sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022 as he sought to discourage the West from expanding its military support for Kyiv. 

Putin emphasized that Russia’s nuclear forces are in “full readiness,” saying that the military has deployed potent new weapons, some of them tested on the battlefield in Ukraine.

The Kremlin leader said they include the new Sarmat heavy intercontinental ballistic missile that has entered service with Russian nuclear forces, along with the Burevestnik atomic-powered cruise missile and the Poseidon atomic-powered, nuclear-armed drone, which are completing their tests.

At the same time, he rejected Western leaders’ statements about the threat of a Russian attack on NATO allies in Europe as “ravings” and again dismissed Washington’s claim that Moscow was pondering the deployment of space-based nuclear weapons.

Putin charged that the U.S. allegations were part of a ploy to draw Russia into talks on nuclear arms control on American terms even as Washington continues its efforts to deliver a “strategic defeat” to Moscow in Ukraine. 

“Ahead of the U.S. election, they just want to show their citizens, as well as others, that they continue to rule the world,” he said. “It won’t work.”

In his speech that focused heavily on economic and social issues ahead of the March 15-17 presidential vote, Putin argued that Russia was “defending its sovereignty and security and protecting our compatriots” in Ukraine, charging that the Russian forces have the upper hand in the fighting.

He reaffirmed his claim that the West was bent on destroying Russia, saying “they need a dependent, waning, dying space in the place of Russia so that they can do whatever they want.” 

The Russian leader honored the troops fallen in Ukraine with a moment of silence, and said that military veterans should form the core of the country’s new elite, inviting them to join a new training program for senior civil servants. 

Putin has repeatedly said that he sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022 to protect Russian interests and prevent Ukraine from posing a major security threat to Russia by joining NATO. Kyiv and its allies have denounced it as an unprovoked act of aggression.

The Russian leader has repeatedly signaled a desire to negotiate an end to the fighting but warned that Russia will hold onto its gains.

Putin, 71, who is running as an independent candidate in the March 15-17 presidential election, relies on the tight control over Russia’s political system that he has established during 24 years in power.

Prominent critics who could challenge him have either been imprisoned or are living abroad, while most independent media have been banned, meaning that Putin’s reelection is all but assured. He faces token opposition from three other candidates nominated by Kremlin-friendly parties represented in parliament.

Russia’s best-known opposition leader Alexei Navalny, whose attempt to run against Putin in 2018 was rejected, died suddenly in an Arctic prison colony earlier this month, while serving a 19-year sentence on extremism charges. Navalny’s funeral is set for Friday.

Russian President Vladimir Putin stepped up his threats against Western countries Thursday, warning that if they send their own troops into Ukraine they risk global nuclear war.

Putin issued the threat at the top of his annual state of the nation address, ahead of a presidential election next month that he is certain to win. He spoke for more than two hours to Russia's Federal Assembly at Moscow's vast and grand Gostiny Dvor conference center, a stone's throw from the Kremlin, surrounded by typically tight security with the surrounding streets cordoned off.

Putin covered an array of topics, from Russia's low birthrate to its need for better broadband coverage. But top of the agenda was his warning against deepening Western involvement in Ukraine.

His comments came after French President Emmanuel Macron suggested this week that NATO allies could send troops to Ukraine in the future, rather than just funding and arming the country indirectly. Macron’s suggestion was swiftly rejected by the United States and others, but Putin said that such a development would risk a wider war with potentially apocalyptic consequences.

“This is very dangerous because it could actually trigger the use of nuclear weapons,” he said. “Do they not understand that?”

He said his strategic nuclear forces were at ""full readiness"" and suggested that a hypersonic nuclear weapon he first mentioned in 2018 was approaching a full state of readiness — a claim that cannot be verified. 

A spokesperson for the National Security Council told NBC News that “Russia’s nuclear rhetoric is reckless and irresponsible. We will continue to support Ukraine as they defend themselves from Russian aggression.” 

“We have not seen any reason to adjust our own nuclear posture, nor any indications that Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon,” the spokesperson added. 

The NSC reiterated Tuesday that the U.S. will not send troops to fight in Ukraine.

Putin also denied U.S. intelligence that said Russia was developing a space-based nuclear weapon designed to target American satellites.

The idea that Russia is ""preparing to launch a nuclear attack in space"" was ""just a lie to make us look bad,"" he said.

Putin has often made such threats over the past two years since his full-scale invasion of Ukraine. But this week’s warning was, in the eyes of some observers, his most pointed to date.

Putin’s annual address comes at a crucial moment for the Kremlin, with its forces advancing in Ukraine ahead of an election that will reinforce his rule. The death of opposition leader Alexei Navalny and a slew of domestic issues have fueled criticism at home and abroad, but Putin will be boosted by growing signs of wavering Western support for Kyiv.

On Monday, Macron caused a stir by suggesting that the West “should not exclude” the possibility of sending troops to Ukraine. This would be a huge practical and symbolic step for allied support of Kyiv, which has so far extended to providing billions of dollars for its defense but has deliberately stopped short of sending forces for fear of starting a direct war with nuclear-armed Russia.

The U.S. and others quickly poured cold water on the idea, with the White House saying that it had “been clear that the U.S. will not send troops to fight in Ukraine.” 

Mark Galeotti, head of the consultancy Mayak Intelligence and an honorary professor at University College London, said Macron had handed Putin a “propaganda gift” because it boosted his narrative that Moscow is fighting the West at large, rather than just Ukraine.

During Putin’s speech, “his reference to potential NATO deployments to Ukraine was less, in my opinion, about warning off the West so much as using it to reinforce his message that this is a struggle against the whole collective West,” Galeotti told NBC News. “Macron gave him something of a propaganda gift.”

Five days ago, it was the second anniversary of Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, a war that started badly for Russia with heavy troop losses but has recently seen battlefield gains for the Kremlin’s war machine — and fears that if Western support wavers, Ukraine may struggle to reverse them.

Key to both Putin and Ukraine’s future is who wins the American election.

President Joe Biden recently called Putin a “crazy SOB” for making nuclear threats against the West. Putin called the comments “rude” but nonetheless said he would prefer the incumbent in the White House to former President Donald Trump. That's despite Trump suggesting he would allow Russia to attack NATO allies, and saying he would halt military aid to Ukraine, which would cripple Kyiv's resistance and hand a huge boost to Russia.

A day after the address is the funeral of arch Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, who died in an Arctic penal colony Feb. 16 in what his family and team say was a Putin-directed killing, something the Kremlin denies.

Navalny was a rare voice of dissent in Russia, where Putin has stamped out most forms of political opposition, independent media and free speech. In March, Putin is running for a fifth term in office but the election will, in reality, be a de facto coronation. With all his real adversaries in prison, exiled or dead, his landslide victory is all but certain.

Many also injured after flames tore through seven-storey building in affluent district but so far 75 people have been saved

At least 43 people have been killed and dozens injured after a fire blazed through a seven-storey building in an upmarket neighbourhood in the Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka.

“So far 43 people have died from the fire,” Bangladesh’s health minister Samanta Lal Sen said late on Thursday after visiting the Dhaka medical college hospital and an adjoining burns hospital.

Sen said another 22 people were being treated for severe burns and were in critical condition.

Fire department official Mohammad Shihab said the blaze originated in a popular biriyani restaurant in Dhaka’s Bailey Road at 9.50pm Thursday (15.50GMT), and quickly spread to the upper floors, trapping scores of people. It was not immediately clear what caused the blaze.

Firefighters brought the blaze under control in two hours, he said. They rescued 75 people alive, a statement from the fire service said.

Survivor Mohammad Altaf, speaking to reporters, recounted narrowly escaping the blaze through a broken window. Two of his coworkers perished, he said.

“When the fire started in the front and broke the glass, our cashier and servicemen made get everyone out. But both of them died later. I went to the kitchen, broke a window and jumped to save myself,” Altaf said.

Relatives of the fire victims gathered at the hospital in the early hours of Friday to receive the bodies of their loved ones, while some were seen grieving outside the emergency department.

Many people were dining with family members including children in the building that houses mostly restaurants along with several clothing and mobile phone shops. Most of the people who perished died from suffocation and some died as they jumped off the building, doctors said.

“We were at the sixth floor when we first saw smoke racing through the staircase. A lot of people rushed upstairs. We used a water pipe to climb down the building. Some of us were injured as they jumped from upstairs,” said a restaurant manager called Sohel.

Others were trapped on the rooftop and called out for help.

“Alhamdulillah. We are sending down all women and children including my wife and children. We all men are in rooftop. Fire service stands beside us. Fifty yet to be down,” wrote Kamruzzaman Majumdar, a professor of environmental science, in a Facebook post.

He was later rescued safely.

Bangladesh fire service and civil defence director Brigadier General Main Uddin said the fire could have originated from a gas leak or stove. “It was a dangerous building with gas cylinders on every floor, even on the staircases,” he told reporters.

A five-member committee has been formed to investigate the incident.

Fires in apartment buildings and factory complexes are common in Bangladesh due to lax enforcement of safety rules.

In July 2021, at least 52 people including many children were killed when a fire swept through a food processing factory.

In February 2019, 70 people died when an inferno ripped through several Dhaka apartment blocks.

As the devastating war in Gaza continues, UN investigators examining Israeli accusations against a dozen employees of the beleaguered UN relief agency for Palestine refugees, UNRWA, have arrived in Jordan and are planning to visit Israel, UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said on Thursday.

The UN Secretary-General received an update on Wednesday from the Office of Internal Oversight (OIOS), which launched an investigation last month following allegations that a handful of UNRWA employees were complicit in Hamas’s October attacks that left almost 1,200 dead in Israel and 240 taken hostage.

So far, investigators have reviewed initial information from a variety of sources, including that released through the media and other public outlets, and reached out to Member States concerned, for additional input, according to the update.

In the Jordanian capital, Amman, investigators visited UNRWA headquarters and reviewed initial information received by the agency from Israeli authorities. The investigators also reviewed information and communications technology data, including email records and information on agency vehicles.

Cooperation with the investigation by Member States has thus far been adequate, the UN Spokesperson added.

“OIOS will [continue to] seek and to corroborate additional information and to compare the information obtained with materials held by Israeli authorities, which OIOS expects to receive shortly,” he said.

The UN’s primary internal investigative office, OIOS began its work on 29 January, the day the Secretary-General tasked the unit with this effort, Mr. Dujarric said.

Since Israel made these allegations, UNRWA has fired the accused staff and launched its own independent review, which is expected to be published in late April.

Pending the investigations, many major donors have suspended funding for UNRWA, which operates on voluntary donations, and agency chief Philippe Lazzarini said a lack of funds has already impacted lifesaving relief efforts, particularly for the two million Palestinians trapped in war-torn Gaza, which is on the verge of famine.

Turning to the situation in gang-ravaged Haiti, the UN Spokesperson said Benin is the latest nation to officially confirm its intention to contribute personnel to the new Security Council-mandated multinational support mission in the crisis-stricken Caribbean country.

To date, $10.8 million in contributions have been deposited into the Multinational Security Support Trust Fund to operate the mission, he said.

“We are also encouraged by the pledges of some $78 million in recent days that will go directly to the fund, and we encourage Member States to continue contributing to ensure the successful deployment of the mission,” he said.

The mission will provide security assistance to the Government of Haiti in its efforts to protect civilians and address the multiple crises which have left armed gangs holding sway in large parts of the country.

In addition to Benin’s contribution of personnel, Mr. Dujarric said the UN has received, as of Wednesday, notifications to provide officers from the following governments: the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados and Chad.

And turning to Chad, concerns are growing amid reports of violence and gun battles in N’Djamena, the capital.

Abdou Abarry, the Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Central Africa, said in a statement that he is following with great concern the events taking place.

He called on all actors to show calm and restraint, particularly at a time when Chad is entering the final stages of its political transition.

With presidential elections planned for 6 May, Mr. Abarry reiterated that he and the entire UN system continues to be available to continue to support the efforts of the government and the people of Chad to ensure a peaceful, inclusive and credible electoral process.

Media reports on Thursday suggested that opposition leader Yaya Dillo had been killed in a shootout in N’Djamena.

He is cousin of Chad’s military ruler Mahamat Idriss Déby Into, whose father, Idriss Déby, he replaced in 2021 after spending three decades ruling the landlocked nation which borders North and Central Africa. 

According to news reports, Mr. Dillo was blamed for a deadly attack on Chad’s main security agency, although he denied any involvement. 

It was widely believed that he would be the main political opponent of the president in the upcoming vote, according to reports.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has been addressing both houses of the country's parliament this morning, two weeks ahead of an election he is guaranteed to win.

Thursday 29 February 2024 22:22, UK

But we'll be back tomorrow morning to bring you the latest updates on the war in Ukraine.

You can scroll back through the blog to read what happened today.

A Russian man has today pleaded guilty in a US court to charges that he smuggled large quantities of American-made, military-grade microelectronics to Russia.

Maxim Marchenko, 51, who had been based in Hong Kong, was taken into US custody in September, after he and two unnamed Russian co-conspirators were accused of using shell companies to conceal the fraudulent procurement of so-called OLED micro-displays.

US justice officials said that Marchenko admitted in a New York court to one count of money laundering, which carries a maximum jail sentence of 20 years, and one count of smuggling goods from the US, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years.

He is due to be sentenced on 6 June.

""The justice department is holding accountable those who would enable the Kremlin and its unjust war of aggression against Ukraine,"" said Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen, of the department's national security division.

Federal prosecutors said OLED micro-displays could be used in rifle scopes, night-vision goggles, thermal optics and other weapons systems.

Marchenko and his co-conspirators falsely claimed that the dual-use technology - meaning it had civilian and military applications - was being sent to China, Hong Kong and elsewhere for use in electron microscopes for medical research.

A little earlier (see post at 8.30pm), we reported on a British minister's response to Vladimir Putin's threat in a speech today to use nuclear weapons.

Washington has now offered a response to the Russian president's comments, with state department spokesperson Matthew Miller saying the US does not have any sign that Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon - but will continue to monitor the situation carefully.

""It is not the first time we have seen irresponsible rhetoric from Vladimir Putin,"" he said.

""It is no way for the leader of a nuclear armed state to speak.""

Mr Putin earlier today told Western countries they risked provoking a nuclear war if they sent troops to fight in Ukraine. 

Supporters of prominent Putin critic Alexei Navalny have been urging his supporters to attend his funeral in Moscow tomorrow - and burial at a nearby cemetery.

However, a pastor at the church where the service is due to take place has indicated that it will not be open to all.

“Most likely, only relatives and friends will be allowed to attend the funeral service,"" the woman was quoted by the Kholod online newspaper as saying.

""There will be no farewell in the church.""

Responding to the comments, one of Mr Navalny's closest aides before his death, Ivan Zhdanov, said: ""There was some rumour in the media that only relatives would be allowed to attend the funeral service.

""We don't have any such information. All we know is that the temple will be open to everyone.""

It comes after the European Parliament today adopted a resolution against oppression in Russia following the death of Mr Navalny.

The resolution condemned Mr Navalny's death in a remote Arctic penal colony earlier this month, and said the Russian government and Vladimir Putin were responsible.

Vladimir Putin's threat that he could order the use of nuclear weapons has been a focus of significant reaction since his comments during a speech earlier.

Joining those who responded to the remarks is UK foreign minister Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon, who labelled them ""irresponsible"".

He levelled his criticism in Parliament after the Russian president sought to warn the West against deeper involvement in the conflict, saying that such a move risked triggering a global war that would see ""the destruction of our civilisation"".

Mr Putin made the comments in a state-of-the-nation address following the second anniversary of the invasion by Kremlin forces and ahead of next month's election that he seems certain to win.

Responding in Westminster, Lord Ahmad told peers: ""Nothing surprises us or shocks us in terms of what Mr Putin articulates.

""It is not the first time he has articulated such comments.

""It is irresponsible, it is wrong and the use or the threatened use of such weapons is frankly quite deplorable.

""Whether he is using it with intent or as shock tactic I can't speculate on that.

""But what I can say, and I am sure I speak for everyone in the House, is that the last thing anyone wants to hear right now is the use of threatening to use such weapons.""

He added: ""Mr Putin himself could reflect on his own history and that of Russia to see that the only way forward on this is to ensure that he pulls back now, he brings about peace on the continent and stops the war on Ukraine.""

Earlier, in the House of Lords, a peer called on the UK to ""push for a negotiated settlement"" with Moscow over Ukraine.

Economist and independent crossbencher Lord Skidelsky - who has previously had links to Russian companies and spoke out against Finland joining NATO - said: ""I am trying to understand the logic of the government's position.

""Is it still the government's expectation that Ukraine will win a complete victory in the sense of recovering the territories it has lost since 2014?

""If so, can the minister confirm that this remains the government's position?

""If not, most experts now do not think that is a feasible endgame, should the government not couple support for Ukraine with a public push for a negotiated settlement, such as has been advocated by many countries in the world, while they still have leverage on the table, not least to avoid the unnecessary slaughter of thousands of Ukrainians and Russians?""

Responding, Lord Ahmad said: ""We want to stop the slaughter of innocent Ukrainian citizens.

""The best way to stop that slaughter is for Mr Putin and Russia to stop the war now.

""There are no two ways about it, we cannot allow it.

""We back Ukraine, Ukraine's leadership is important, and the United Kingdom stands firmly behind it.""

Lord Skidelsky was suspended from the upper chamber for a month last year after failing to properly declare his links to a think tank funded by two Russian businessmen who were subsequently sanctioned.

The peer, who has been critical of the government's approach to Ukraine, has previously served as a director of the Russian oil firm Russneft.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy has appointed Volodymyr Karpenko as new commander of Ukraine's Logistics Forces today, it has been announced.

General Karpenko, previously logistics commander of Ukraine's ground forces, replaced Oleh Huliaka, who had held the position since 2021.

His appointment is the president's latest in a series of personnel changes in the military, including the naming of Oleksandr Syrskyi as commander in chief of the armed forces in place of Valerii Zaluzhnyi.

Poland plans to launch a series of military observation satellites next year, a deputy defence minister announced today.

""Next year, as the Ministry of Defence and the Polish Army, we want to put our first Polish satellites into orbit,"" Cezary Tomczyk told a news briefing.

Poland intends to acquire a satellite system equipped with radar and optical technology that would enable Earth observation regardless of atmospheric conditions and would employ both foreign and domestic technology, he said.

Defence minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz told the same briefing the country would this year develop a space force among other units, based on lessons learned from Ukraine's experiences since Russia's invasion.

""All the actions we are taking this year, creating drone forces, creating space component forces or medical forces, these are actions that strengthen the Polish army and also result from the Ukrainian experience,"" Mr Kosiniak-Kamysz said.

In December 2022 the Polish defence ministry signed a deal with Airbus for the delivery of two reconnaissance satellites, the launch of which is planned by 2027.

A Russian-American woman detained in Russia on a treason charge carrying up to 20 years in prison told her boyfriend ""it's safe there"" before she travelled to see relatives in Yekaterinburg, the woman's former mother-in-law said today.

A Russian court today rejected an appeal by Ksenia Karelina, a 32-year-old former ballerina who lives in Los Angeles, after she was detained by the FSB security service on suspicion of raising funds for Ukraine's armed forces.

Her lawyer had asked the court to lift her detention and replace it with house arrest, state news agency RIA reported.

The US embassy in Moscow was aware of the reports but could not comment further due to privacy restrictions, a spokesperson told news agency Reuters.

A Russian lawyers' group, Pervy Otdel, said it had information that Ms Karelina had donated just over $50 (£40) from her US bank account on 24 February 2022 - the day that Russia launched its invasion - to a charity that sends aid to Ukraine.

Her former mother-in-law, Eleonora Srebroski, told news agency Reuters by phone from Maryland that Ms Karelina had made a small donation to Razom for Ukraine, a New York-based nonprofit  organisation that sends assistance to the country.

Razom said in a statement earlier this month that it was ""appalled"" by Ms Karelina's arrest and that its activities focused on ""humanitarian aid, disaster relief, education and advocacy.""

Ms Srebroski said Ms Karelina, who has been a US citizen since 2021, had decided to go to Yekaterinburg in January for a family visit after her boyfriend surprised her with a plane ticket while they were on holiday in Turkey.

""I am Russian, I love Russia, there is nothing wrong in Yekaterinburg, it's safe there,"" Ms Srebroski said was how Ms Karelina assured her boyfriend.

Ms Srebroski, who described Karelina as caring, sweet and ""even more beautiful on the inside,"" said her former daughter-in-law arrived in the US in 2012 via a work-study program in Maryland, where she met her son and the two got married in 2013.

Ukraine has significantly increased its use of domestic-made weapons and military equipment, a senior defence official has said.

It comes as Kyiv aims to become more self-sufficient amid faltering Western military aid.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called for Ukraine to strengthen its domestic defence industry as it struggles to fend off Russia's invasion and faces potential cuts in military aid from its biggest backer, the US.

Deputy defence minister Ivan Havryliuk said 46 types of domestically produced equipment had been sent to the armed forces during the first two months of 2024, an amount he said was ""significantly more"" than in the same period last year.

""We are doing every we can so that Ukraine over time becomes as self-sufficient as possible in providing the defence forces with the necessary weapons,"" he said.

Mr Havryliuk also called for Kyiv's foreign partners to boost investment and participation in joint production with Ukrainian companies.

Ukraine has signed dozens of contracts for joint production or technology exchanges with Western allies.

German defence company Rheinmetall, one of the world's biggest producers of artillery and tank shells, said this month it would open an ammunition factory in Ukraine.

Ukrainian defence minister Rustem Umerov said on Sunday that around 50% of arms deliveries from Kyiv's partners arrive late.

In the latest example of a systematic campaign to restrict media freedom in Russia, the editor of an independent newspaper has reportedly been fined.

Sergei Sokolov, of the Novaya Gazeta publication, had previously been detained by authorities for discrediting the army.

Mr Sokolov said he did not agree with the charge against him.

The official Telegram channel for Moscow's court system said the case stemmed from an article published in the newspaper in December 2023, entitled ""Nobody's boys"", about Russians orphans who signed army contracts to fight in Ukraine.

Novaya Gazeta said in an online report that Mr Sokolov's detention was over coverage of the Russian army in an article, but did not provide more details.

A district court in Moscow subsequently fined Sokolov 30,000 roubles (£259.86) today after finding him guilty of discrediting the Russian armed forces, an administrative offence.

Russian news agency TASS reported that Sokolov had ""posted material on the Novaya Gazeta Telegram channel"" which showed ""signs of verbally discrediting the actions"" of the army.

Novaya Gazeta is known for its investigations, which have sometimes taken aim at the Kremlin, government policy and top officials.

Its former editor-in-chief, Dmitry Muratov, a Nobel prize winning journalist, stepped down in September to challenge his designation by authorities as a ""foreign agent"", a label Moscow uses for people it deems to be working against Russian state interests.

          / CBS/Bay City News Service
        

The San Francisco City Attorney's Office is defending its consumer protection investigation into U.S. News and World Report after the publication filed suit one day before it was supposed to hand over subpoenaed information.

City Attorney David Chiu opened an investigation into the publication's prominent hospital rankings, which it releases every year and are accessed by millions. 

Citing the state's unfair competition law, Chiu wants to determine whether the rankings favor wealthy patients through a ""flawed methodology"" that ""leads to adverse outcomes for poorer, sicker, and more diverse health care patients,"" his office said Thursday.   	   San Francisco is also questioning the role, if any, that money plays in the rankings.

""U.S. News accepts payments from the entities it endorses without disclosing those financial links,"" said Chiu.

Chiu also said that U.S. News receives revenue from hospitals through licensing fees for its ""Best Hospitals"" badges, advertising in the Best Hospitals guidebook, and payments for ""Featured Hospital"" placement.

The city first sent a letter to U.S. News last summer requesting that the publication support its basis for touting itself as the ""global authority"" on hospital rankings and to get ""specific information about the basis for the hospital rankings methodology and apparent deficiencies in the rankings.""

The city attorney's office also asked the publication to ""prominently disclose"" the hospitals from which it receives payments.   	   U.S. News responded to Chiu's letter, but, citing journalistic freedom, refused to discuss its methodology, and ""refused to address payments it receives from hospitals the company ranks,"" Chiu alleges.

Chiu then stepped things up and subpoenaed the publication for the information, and now U.S. News is suing.

In a complaint filed on Jan. 23, U.S. News asked to enjoin San Francisco from enforcing the ""burdensome"" subpoenas, citing the First Amendment and California's own law protecting journalists from government intrusion.

""It is flatly unconstitutional for the City Attorney to harass U.S. News due to his differing views on these rankings; his mounting harassment must be put to a stop,"" reads the complaint.

U.S. News said the city attorney's actions ""pose a fundamental threat"" and ""set a dangerous precedent for all media platforms and news organizations."" 

California's protections for journalists ""shield"" them from handing over newsgathering information, especially by subpoena, and individuals or entities that work in news cannot be held in contempt for refusing to respond to subpoenas.

It is on this principle that U.S. News is arguing against responding to the city's subpoena, but it also argues that the city attorney is making assumptions that advertising and revenue plays a role in its hospital rankings, which it vociferously denies.

Put simply, U.S. News asserts that there is a very distinct ""wall"" between its editorial and advertising departments, as is the case with all respected news organizations. The publication denies any influence of money or other factors in how it determines its rankings. It said its editorial team is not involved in the sales of any products or services, nor do revenue concerns creep into their rankings ""in any way.""

""Higher rankings cannot be bought at any sum,"" reads the complaint.

The publication admits to offering ""badges"" and getting revenue from hospitals that may be ranked, though they argue that this is the same at any television network or newspaper that may accept advertising from businesses that are also subjects of news stories. 

U.S. News likens it to the ""Best Of"" issues that editorial departments put out every year. Though the ""Best Of"" rankings are compiled by the news side, a publication's advertising side may be approached by or approach businesses that have been given the designation of ""Best Of,"" and U.S. News says it's ""badges"" and other promotions are no different.

Ultimately, U.S. News argues that no news company should be investigated for publishing analyses or opinions.

""If the City Attorney's actions are allowed to stand, any journalistic enterprise that provides an analysis or opinions to the public -- analysis or opinions that elected officials may wish to fault -- may for that reason be subject to subpoena and investigation.""

But the San Francisco City Attorney's Office isn't the only entity to question the publication's methodology. U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, last summer called on U.S. News to stop taking money from hospitals that they claim to rank impartially.  	   ""If it's taking payments, are those rankings really objective and impartial?"" Blumenthal asked.

Some entities have also withdrawn from participation in U.S. News' rankings, including the medical schools at Stanford, Columbia and Harvard universities, along with the University of Pennsylvania and Mount Sinai, all of which stopped furnishing data for the rankings, citing issues with the publication's methodologies.

On Wednesday, Chiu's office filed a brief requesting that the preliminary injunction be denied and the lawsuit be dismissed entirely. An amicus brief was also filed the same day in support of Chiu's motion to dismiss from 18 attorneys, elected officials and others, including the city attorneys for San Diego, Alameda, Chicago, Baltimore, and New York City.

Hakeem Jeffries tells NYT ‘a reasonable number’ of Democrats would vote to save speaker if vote resulted in Republican mutiny

The Democratic leadership in Congress has suggested it would protect the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, if he bucks his far-right colleagues and brings a stalled $60bn Ukraine military aid package to a vote, as a new poll shows public support for Ukraine is now fractured down party-political lines.

Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, floated the offer in an interview with the New York Times, saying “a reasonable number” of Democrats would vote to save the Republican speaker if the Ukraine vote resulted in a Republican mutiny.

Far-right members of Congress including Marjorie Taylor Greene have said they would seek to depose Johnson if he brings the foreign aid bill forward, threatening to send Republicans toward yet another protracted leadership crisis like the one that paralyzed the House under former speaker Kevin McCarthy.

Jeffries said that if Johnson were “to do the right thing”, there would be a “reasonable number of people” on the Democratic side “who will take the position that he should not fall as a result”. But Jeffries said he had not discussed the matter with Johnson, who has said Congress “must take care of America’s needs first”.

The political carrot was extended a day after Joe Biden and congressional leaders pushed Republicans to move the aid bill forward. Johnson later told reporters that they had been working in “good faith, around the clock every single day” on a spending deal.

Johnson also said the legislative body was “actively pursuing and investigating all the various options” for passing Ukraine aid, but “the first priority of the country is our border”.

A new poll showed that US adults have become politically split down party lines over giving more military aid to Ukraine, which the country says it desperately needs to fend off Russian advances.

A majority of Republican voters (55%) said the US was spending too much on Ukraine, according to the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs research, while support for Ukraine has grown among Democrats.

Democrats, meanwhile, registered increasing support for aid to Ukraine, with about 40% saying the US was spending “too little” on it – a sharp rise from 17% in November.

The survey shows that Russia’s Vladimir Putin remains unpopular with Americans, but that the depth of his unpopularity is similarly shaded – with roughly nine in 10 Democrats compared with three-quarters of Republicans holding the view.

Only about four in 10 adults polled had a favorable opinion of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

A majority – including 52% of Republicans – said they supported the spirit of Article 5 of the Nato military alliance that an attack on one Nato country is an attack on all, while about 60% said they would support US forces becoming involved if a Russia attacked a Nato member.

In a state of the union speech on Thursday, Vladimir Putin described claims that Russia intended to attack Europe as “nonsense”.

But the Russian president added that any increase in western support for Ukraine “risks a conflict using nuclear weapons, which means the destruction of all civilisation”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

President implores Republicans to ‘show a little spine’ and support bipartisan border and security bill as Trump speaks at Eagle Pass

Joe Biden and his all-but certain Republican challenger, Donald Trump, made dueling visits to Texas border towns on Thursday, a rare overlap that sets the stage for an election-season clash over immigration.

In Brownsville, along the Rio Grande on the border with Mexico, Biden implored Congressional Republicans to “show a little spine” and support a bipartisan border security deal. Earlier this month Republican lawmakers blocked legislation they had previously clamored for, after Trump expressed his opposition to the measure.

“It’s long past time to act,” Biden said in his remarks, challenging Trump to “join me” in calling on Congress to pass the “toughest, most efficient, most effective border security in this country has ever seen”.

There had been some speculation that the US president could announce executive action during his visit, but instead he revisited complaints that lack of progress is the fault of hard-right Republicans in Congress.

Hundreds of miles north-west of Brownsville, Trump, whom Republicans appear poised to choose as their nominee for president for a third consecutive time, once again sought to stoke fears of a “migrant crime” wave fueled by Biden’s border policies.

“He’s destroying our country,” Trump said, speaking moments before Biden from a park in Eagle Pass which has become the center of a showdown between the Biden administration and the Republican governor of Texas, Greg Abbott.

While there, Trump promised an immigration crackdown far beyond what he attempted in his first term, vowing to revive immigration policies that would allow for rapid removal of people entering the US without authorization, while promoting his signature border barrier.

“Walls work,” Trump said. Last year, the Biden administration cleared the way for construction of the border barriers to continue, breaking a campaign promise not to allow “another foot” of work on the wall.

Immigration has become one of Biden’s most acute political vulnerabilities ahead of the 2024 election. Ahead of his remarks in Brownsville, which is among the border cities with the lowest level of unlawful crossings, Biden met with US border patrol agents, law enforcement and local leaders, praising their work and appealing to Congress for more resources to support them.

Since Biden took office, a record number of migrants have crossed the southern border, driven by war, political upheaval, gang violence and the climate crisis among other factors. Though the number of crossings dropped dramatically in January, according to border patrol data, there were record highs in December.

Voters across the political spectrum have expressed growing concern over the situation at the border, and few, as little as 18% according to a survey by the Pew Research center, are pleased with the administration’s handling of it.

In the survey, respondents most frequently cited “economic costs and burdens associated with the migration surge or concerns about security” as their top concerns related to migration.

At the same time, a rise in immigration last year powered population growth and boosted the US economy.

Trump’s immigration plans include a pledge to carry out the “largest deportation operation” in US history, suggesting he would call up the National Guard to remove undocumented migrants already in the country, a proposal that raises a thicket of legal questions about the use of the US military to enforce domestic laws.

As president, Biden has sought to clamp down on unlawful migration by toughening enforcement and making limited expansion of legal pathways into the US.

The White House threw its support behind a Senate effort to strike a compromise deal on the border, even endorsing an overhaul of the nation’s asylum system that immigration advocates and progressives denounced as Trump-like. But the deal fell apart amid Trump’s desire not to hand a political win to Biden on a key issue for his campaign. In the Senate, Republicans turned against the bill while Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, declared it dead on arrival in his chamber.

Biden has vowed to remind voters of Trump’s interference.

Republicans, led by Trump, have blamed Biden. In Congress, they have sought to punish his administration by impeaching the secretary of homeland security, Alejandro Mayorkas, over alleged offenses that even conservative legal scholars said were related to matters of policy, not malfeasance. The Democratic-controlled Senate has signaled its intent to quickly dispatch the charges.

Hours before the president and former president arrived on the 2,000-mile stretch of border, a federal judge sided with the Biden administration and blocked a sweeping new Texas law that would give state and local police power to arrest migrants suspected of crossing the US-Mexico border unlawfully. In a statement, Abbott said Texas would “immediately” appeal the ruling, and asserted that the state had a “right to defend itself” from what he has previously described as an invasion – a term which elicited skepticism and ultimately rejection from the judge in the case.

In January, the Texas national guard seized control of Eagle Pass’s Shelby Park, in effect blocking federal border patrol agents from the 47-acre area. As part of Abbott’s border crackdown, they erected razor wire and closed access to the park. Amid the standoff, a mother and her two young children drowned in a nearby part of the Rio Grande. Texas authorities and the border patrol blamed each other for the tragedy.

The supreme court temporarily allowed border patrol agents to remove the wire erected by Texas authorities, but state law enforcement simply adds more.

Abbott, who joined Trump in Eagle Pass, reiterated that Biden “does not care about Texas or the border”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

The US supreme court announced Wednesday evening that it will consider Trump’s claim of presidential immunity

You’re reading the Guardian US’s free Trump on Trial newsletter. To get the latest court developments delivered to your inbox, sign up here.

The US supreme court announced on Wednesday evening that it will consider Trump’s claim of presidential immunity after an appeals court ruled against him, creating a delay that will either push the DC criminal trial over Trump’s attempts to overturn his 2020 election loss late into the 2024 presidential election – or derail the case entirely.

The court had the option of rejecting Trump’s appeal without hearing the arguments. Instead, it set oral arguments for the week of 22 April. That means even if the justices come to a speedy decision – say, in early May – the trial would be pushed off until mid-summer at the earliest. That might not be enough time to actually hold the trial before the election, and plays right into Trump’s explicit legal strategy of trying to delay his criminal trials.

The court will consider whether, and to what extent, “a former president enjoys presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office”.

Lower-court judges have unanimously ruled against Trump, writing withering opinions of his arguments; legal observers widely expect that the US supreme court, which has a six to three conservative majority, will agree. The issue is the timeline.

The DC trial is on hold until the justices issue a ruling – and as the Guardian’s Hugo Lowell wrote on Wednesday, the best estimate of the trial date will come “by adding 87 days to the date of the supreme court’s final decision”.

By those calculations, even if the court issues a rapid decision in early May, the case may not be ready for trial until August.

But that assumes they move that fast. The supreme court’s term doesn’t end until early July, and if they don’t issue a decision until then it would probably prevent the trial from happening at all before the election since that would set things up for early October, right before the November vote. The trial is expected to last at least a month, and it’s unclear whether the US Department of Justice will decide its unofficial “60-day rule” against bringing politically charged cases too close to an election applies in this case.

If Trump wins the election, he’ll have enough executive authority to make the case go away.

The Republican national convention, where Trump will probably be nominated by the GOP as their presidential candidate, is set for 15-18 July. The election itself will be on 5 November. If the trial happens, it’ll land between those dates – but it just might not happen at all.

A judge shot down a request from Trump’s attorneys to let him put up a bond for just $100m of the more than $450m he owes from the verdict in his New York business fraud trial on Wednesday – but lifted the verdict’s penalty that would prevent him from applying for loans from New York banks in order to cover that bond.

Trump’s attorneys had earlier told the court that, essentially, he doesn’t have the cash to cover the entire sum and suggested he might be forced to sell some of his real estate properties to raise the money.

Trump has until late March to try to secure a stay that would pause interest from accruing at nearly $115,000 a day while he appeals.

Trump would receive an automatic stay if he were to put up money, assets (like some of his New York real estate), or an appeal bond covering what he owes. The appeals court could also grant a stay with a bond for a lower amount – which his team is now requesting.

A pair of key hearings scheduled for Friday could go a long way in determining the future of two of Trump’s main criminal cases.

In Trump’s Florida classified documents case, Trump-appointed Judge Aileen Cannon has scheduled a 10am EST hearing to consider deadlines that could delay her proposed 20 May trial date.

Cannon ruled on Wednesday that Trump couldn’t get his hands on a filing submitted by special counsel prosecutors that detailed their reasons for wanting to redact some of the classified documents – though much of her ruling indicated that she was sympathetic to Trump’s lawyers’ arguments.

And, in Trump’s Georgia criminal election interference case, Judge Scott McAfee has scheduled an afternoon hearing to continue the considerations of whether Fani Willis and Nathan Wade should be allowed to remain on the case. At issue: whether their romantic relationship marks a conflict of interest (and whether a lower standard, of appearance of impropriety, should be applied). If he rules that they must be removed, that could completely derail this criminal prosecution, putting it on ice indefinitely.

During a Tuesday hearing, attorneys for Trump and his co-defendants failed to get their star witness, Wade’s former divorce lawyer Terrence Bradley, to repeat under oath what he had previously alleged in private conversations, that Willis began her romantic relationship with Wade before she hired him as special prosecutor.

Friday’s hearing will probably include the final arguments on the issue from Willis’s team as well as Trump’s and his co-defendants’, before McAfee makes his decision.

 On Wednesday, an Illinois state judge ruled that Trump should not appear on Illinois’s Republican presidential primary ballot because he violated the anti-insurrection clause of the US constitution’s 14th amendment, but delayed her ruling from taking effect. The US supreme court is expected to rule soon on whether states can disqualify Trump from the ballot.

 In Trump’s pending New York hush-money criminal trial, prosecutors filed a request for a gag order to bar former president Donald Trump from attacking potential witnesses and others involved in the case. The gag order request from Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg’s office to Judge Juan Merchan seeks to bar Trump from attacking potential trial witnesses, jurors, and his and Merchan’s staff while excluding the prosecutor and the judge themselves from the order.

 Judge Arthur Engoron, who presided over Trump’s New York business fraud civil trial, was sent an envelope containing white powder that arrived at the courthouse on Wednesday, prompting an emergency response from fire and police officials. Donald Trump Jr, one of the defendants in the trial, also received an envelope containing a death threat and white powder earlier this week.

 Wisconsin’s bipartisan state ethics commission has recommended felony charges against Trump’s Save America Joint Fundraising Committee for allegedly attempting to skirt campaign finance limits in a case where local Trump allies tried to defeat the Wisconsin assembly speaker, Robin Vos, who has been critical of Trump, in a primary. The commission alleges Adam Steen, Vos’s Trump-endorsed primary challenger, coordinated with state Republican party chapters to evade Wisconsin’s $1,000 limit on individual campaign donations by having individuals funnel earmarked donations through the county parties, which face no limits on campaign spending.

The US supreme court still hasn’t released an opinion on whether Colorado courts were within their rights in determining that Trump should be barred from appearing as a candidate under section three of the US constitution’s 14th amendment. It appears that there won’t be a ruling before Colorado holds its Republican presidential primary next Tuesday. The court’s justices indicated strongly during oral arguments in early February that they were likely to rule that they would overturn the Colorado court’s decision, which has been put on pause until they rule, leaving Trump on the ballot.

Former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows’s attempts to get his criminal charges moved from Georgia to federal court hit another wall on Wednesday, as judges on the 11th circuit of appeals denied his request for the entire court to rehear his appeal of an earlier decision against him. The US supreme court is his last chance in his long-shot effort.

Former Trump White House adviser Peter Navarro filed an emergency motion to try to keep from having to begin his prison sentence almost immediately after being convicted of contempt of Congress for flouting a subpoena from the House January 6 select committee and sentenced to four months behind bars. Navarro is expected to have to begin serving his sentence imminently.

Former justice department lawyer Jeff Clark, who is facing disbarment from the DC bar for his role in Trump’s attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, lost his bid to keep other Trump administration officials, including former acting attorney general Jeffrey Rosen, deputy attorney general Richard Donoghue, and former White House deputy counsel Patrick Philbin, from testifying in the proceedings. The bar association disciplinary panel found that “executive privilege” did not apply in the case.

Stephen Moore, who withdrew from Fed consideration after sexist remarks were uncovered, co-author of radical Project 2025 effort

Stephen Moore, a conservative economist whose controversial remarks about women cost him a seat on the Federal Reserve board in 2019, is now co-author of a plan to radically reform the US treasury as part of Project 2025, a vast rightwing effort to advance radical policy proposals for Donald Trump’s possible White House return.

“Project 2025 is all about forcing a far-right agenda on to everyday Americans,” said Tony Carrk, the executive director of the progressive watchdog Accountable.US, which produced an extensive report on Moore’s views and positions.

“So it’s no wonder they tapped a notorious social security opponent like Stephen Moore to help write their policy schemes.”

Moore, Carrk said, had “dedicated his career to slashing social security benefits and taxes for billionaires”.

Like other welfare programmes such as Medicare, social security is a longstanding target of the US right but also something of a third rail for politicians of either party, given public support. Recognising such support, Trump has pledged to “always protect social security” should he return to power. His last opponent for the Republican presidential nomination, the former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, says she wants to reform it.

Joe Biden has said he “will not cut a single social security or Medicare benefit”.

Moore remains loyal to Trump but in the past has advocated for privatising social security, which he has called a “Ponzi scheme”, and told students they should march on the Capitol and burn their social security cards.

Responding to Carrk, Moore said by email: “Actually I favor higher social security benefits with personal accounts. That would give seniors benefits that would net three to five times higher.”

Moore advocates mandatory 401k accounts, in place of social security.

He added: “Yes, I am strongly in favor of cutting tax rates to make [the] American economy No 1.”

By its own description, Project 2025 is the work of “a broad coalition of over 70 conservative organisations”, brought together by the Heritage Foundation and aiming to shape the presidential transition should a Republican win election this year.

In the words of Paul Dans, its director, Project 2025 aims to prepare “a new army, aligned, trained, and essentially weaponised conservatives ready to do battle against the deep state”.

According to a conspiracy theory championed by Trump’s ally and adviser Steve Bannon – though Bannon reportedly said the “deep-state conspiracy theory is for nutcases” – the deep state consists of bureaucrats, government functionaries and intelligence operatives, all working to thwart Trump’s agenda.

Legal sources and sources close to the presidential transition have said extreme actions proposed under Project 2025 are unlikely to happen swiftly, should Trump or another Republican take office, given existing guardrails in and around the federal bureaucracy.

Nonetheless, as other chapters recommend rolling back LGBTQ+ rights or dismantling climate policy, so the chapter co-authored by Moore says a Trump treasury should eliminate policies attributed to Biden including the “racist ‘equity’ agenda” and the “economically destructive and ineffective climate-related financial-risk agenda”.

Moore’s co-authors are William L Walton, a private equity investor, and David R Burton, an economic policy expert. The three authors identify social security as a program relevant to treasury reform, including it in “issues of concern” that “cut across multiple parts of treasury or other governmental agencies”.

Elsewhere, Jonathan Berry, who was chief counsel to the Trump transition in 2016-17 and led the regulatory section of the Department of Labor in the Trump administration, notes the potential for privatisation of social security, writing: “Existing statutory language in the Social Security Act does not prohibit non-public organisations from administering the programme.”

In his statement, Carrk also accused Moore of “belittling women and people of color”.

In May 2019, Moore withdrew from consideration for a seat at the Fed. Amid intense media scrutiny, the Guardian reported tax and legal issues affecting Moore including underpaying alimony to his ex-wife. Columns written by Moore also came under scrutiny, unearthed sexist remarks including complaints about women in sports and asking whether there was anywhere in life “men can take a vacation from women”. Moore also wrote that Black families were replacing men with “a welfare check” and that increased earnings for Black women would make Black men “financially expendable”.

Withdrawing from consideration for the Fed, Moore said that the “unrelenting attacks on my character have become untenable for me and my family” but told Trump he would “continue to be a loud economic voice advocating your policies” and would “always [be] at your disposal”.

Moore went on to advise Trump during the Covid pandemic. Now, as well as writing books and providing analysis for Fox News, he is attached to a range of rightwing groups – he is a Heritage Foundation fellow; the senior economist at FreedomWorks; and chair of the Committee to Unleash Prosperity (CUP).

Moore co-founded CUP in 2015 with the billionaire Steve Forbes, the economist Larry Kudlow (later Trump’s chief economic adviser) and Arthur Laffer, an economist and pundit who advised Ronald Reagan and Trump and to whom Trump gave the presidential medal of freedom.

The Accountable.US report details donations of at least $1.77m to CUP from DonorsTrust, a rightwing group not required to reveal the names of its donors.

“A principled philanthropic partner for conservative and libertarian donors” in its own words, but “the right’s dark-money ATM” in the words of Mother Jones magazine, DonorsTrust has links to the Koch network and Leonard Leo, two dominant figures in rightwing political funding.

Carrk said: “With extremists like Moore calling the shots, Project 2025 may not have any credibility, but unfortunately they have limitless resources from the dark-money Leonard Leo network to undermine the health and retirement security of millions of Americans.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Shares of Dell Technologies popped more than 15% during extended trading Thursday after the company released fourth-quarter results that beat analysts' estimates and showed strong demand for its artificial intelligence servers.

Here's how the company did:

Dell's revenue for the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter fell 11% from $25.04 billion in the year-ago quarter. The company reported net income $1.16 billion, up 89% from the $614 million it posted in the same period last year.

Chief Financial Officer Yvonne McGill said in a release that the company is increasing its annual dividend by 20% to $1.78 per share, which she called a ""testament to our confidence in the business.""

Dell's Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) reported $9.3 billion in revenue for the quarter, down 6% year over year but up 10% from the third quarter. Servers and networking revenue made up the bulk of that, with $4.9 billion in revenue driven by ""AI-optimized servers."" Storage revenue came in at $4.5 billion.

The company's Client Solutions Group (CSG) reported $11.7 billion for the quarter, down 12% year over year. That includes $9.6 billion in commercial client revenue, which fell 11% since the fourth quarter of last year, and $2.2 billion in consumer revenue, down 19% year over year.

""Our strong AI-optimized server momentum continues, with orders increasing nearly 40% sequentially and backlog nearly doubling, exiting our fiscal year at $2.9 billion,"" Chief Operating Officer Jeff Clarke said in the release.

For its first quarter, Dell said during its quarterly call with investors that it expects to report revenue between $21 billion and $22 billion.

The company said it is encouraged by momentum around AI, and that it expects to return to growth for fiscal 2025. However, the company noted that the macroeconomic environment is causing some customers to be cautious about infrastructure costs.Don't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:

The journalist, Catherine Herridge, had reported on an F.B.I. investigation of a scientist’s Chinese ties. She was held in contempt of court.

By Katie Robertson

A federal judge held a veteran investigative reporter in contempt of court on Thursday for not revealing her sources for articles she wrote about a scientist who was investigated by the F.B.I.

The journalist, Catherine Herridge, formerly of CBS News and Fox News, was ordered to pay $800 a day until she divulged the information. The judge, Christopher Cooper of U.S. District Court in Washington, stayed the fine for 30 days to give Ms. Herridge time to appeal.

The case, which has alarmed First Amendment advocates, relates to a series of articles that were written by Ms. Herridge and her colleagues in 2017, while she worked at Fox News. The articles revealed that the F.B.I. had investigated the scientist, Dr. Yanping Chen, a Chinese American who is the president of the University of Management and Technology in Arlington, Va., over suspicions of Chinese military ties and whether she had lied on U.S. immigration forms.

The F.B.I. ended its investigation without bringing charges against Dr. Chen, a year before Ms. Herridge and her colleagues published and aired their reporting.

In 2018, Dr. Chen sued the F.B.I. and other government agencies, accusing them of violating the Privacy Act by leaking information to Ms. Herridge. The Privacy Act has protections for personal information collected by federal agencies.

Judge Cooper ruled last year that Ms. Herridge must reveal her confidential sources. On Thursday, he held her in civil contempt for disobeying that order. He said he had not issued the order lightly, deciding that Dr. Chen’s need for the information overcame Ms. Herridge’s First Amendment protections.

Chef Robbie Felice joins Fox News' Stuart Varney with the latest on how he is expanding his businesses as profits thrive despite record high inflation on 'Varney & Co.'

Atlanta-based Chick-fil-A announced the recall of its popular Polynesian sauce dipping cups because of concerns they were contaminated with wheat and soy allergens.

""Please discard any Polynesian Sauce dipping cups that you may have taken home between February 14-27, 2024,"" the fast-food chain said on its website. ""The Polynesian Sauce dipping cups may contain a different sauce that includes wheat and soy allergens.""

A spokesperson for Chick-fil-A told Fox News Digital the manufacturer of the Polynesian dipping sauce packed some of the cups with Sriracha sauce, which contains wheat and soy.

While the exact number of cups was not known, Chick-fil-A costumers were alerted about the recall on the company’s website and application, as well as through signage at the restaurants.

Restaurants in 27 states have removed the potentially contaminated cups from restaurants, though other states will continue to serve the sauce.

Microsoft (MSFT) continues to roll out more generative AI capabilities across its software offerings with the debut of its Copilot for Finance. The company says the AI service, which is launching as a public preview, will make it easier for workers to sort data and find errors in financial reports.

Microsoft has been adding its generative AI-powered Copilots to a slew of its business offerings ranging from Copilot for Microsoft 365 and Copilot for Sales to Copilot for Service. That’s in addition to the company’s Copilot in Windows 11, which is built into all Windows 11 PCs running the latest software updates.

Microsoft’s Copilot for Finance, the company says, can provide real-time insights into corporate finance data, cutting down on the rigamarole of having to enter and search through seemingly endless rows and columns in Excel.

The tech giant says its latest Copilot can also streamline audits, detect data variances, and help users generate PowerPoint presentations and emails based on available financial information using natural language prompts.

The Windows maker isn’t revealing pricing for Copilot for Finance, but the service includes the company’s Copilot for Microsoft 365, which adds generative AI capabilities to the Microsoft 365 productivity suite. That platform traditionally costs $30 per user per month.

Microsoft is putting an enormous amount of effort into ensuring it has a Copilot for each of its productivity platforms as it races to out-innovate rivals, including Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Salesforce (CRM). Both of those companies, as well as a slew of other smaller firms, are also building generative AI services for their enterprise products to prove to customers that they’re on the bleeding edge of today’s hottest tech trend.

Last week, Google debuted its Gemini Business, a $20-per-month add-on for its Gemini for Workspace productivity suite. The company also offers Gemini Enterprise, a $30-per-month add-on for Gemini for Workspace with enhanced features for meeting summaries and transcriptions.

The push to bring generative AI tools to more enterprise-friendly services comes as Microsoft and its rivals seek to further monetize their enormous investments in generative AI technologies in recent years.

Microsoft has already invested billions of dollars in ChatGPT developer OpenAI and is lined up to invest billions more throughout the next decade. On Tuesday, the company also disclosed it is working with OpenAI rival Mistral and will begin offering that firm’s AI models via its Azure cloud platform.

In its most recent earnings report, Microsoft revealed that AI services contributed 6 percentage points of growth to Azure revenue, up from 3% in the prior quarter. Shares of the tech juggernaut are up 63% over the last 12 months.

Fox News and CNN aired both men’s remarks in full; MSNBC carried neither one live.

By Michael M. Grynbaum

Election Day is eight months away. But television viewers on Thursday afternoon were treated to their first glimpse of a political split screen that is likely to dominate cable news coverage for the rest of the campaign.

The occasion was dueling visits by President Biden and former President Donald J. Trump to the U.S.-Mexican border. Although the men were several hundred miles apart, on TV their back-to-back speeches left the impression of a head-to-head matchup.

The major cable news channels — CNN, MSNBC and Fox News — played up the prizefight angle, with CNN deeming the occasion the “Border Battle Up Close.” But each network’s programming choices spoke to the different lenses through which voters may experience news coverage of the campaign.

Here is how it played out on Thursday:

Hosts on Fox News have been warning viewers about the dangers of a porous southern border for years. On Thursday, the network dedicated almost the entirety of its afternoon to the topic. Martha MacCallum, the 3 p.m. host, welcomed several guests who dismissed Mr. Biden’s visit as a cynical photo op. Fox News aired several minutes of blurry footage of Mr. Trump meeting with a Border Patrol agent in Eagle Pass, Texas, though the audio was often indecipherable.

Ms. McCallum offered her own take to viewers about undocumented migrants: “If they break one law, they should be deported from the country, at the bare minimum. I think that’s just a basic common sense that I think most Americans would agree with.”

PARSIPPANY, NJ. — While bottom-line financials for fiscal 2023 may not have been as strong as executives hoped due to several divestitures during the year, B&G Foods made headway on several milestones as part of its effort to reshape and strengthen operations, said Kenneth Keller, president and chief executive officer.

“Overall, we are pleased with the performance in the fourth quarter and the recovery of the B&G Foods business in fiscal year ’23,” Keller said during a Feb. 27 conference call with analysts. “There’s clearly more work to do, but our team has made significant progress toward creating a stronger, more valuable B&G Foods.”

Keller mentioned four milestones in fiscal 2023, led by margin recovery after historic inflation pressure in fiscal 2022. He said the company’s pricing actions and productivity efforts helped spur a 280-basis points increase in adjusted gross profit percentage, to 22.2% in 2023 from 19.4% in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales also improved, rising 150 basis points to 15.4% in fiscal 2023, he said.

“Going forward, input cost inflation has moderated to low single digits and in some cases, such as soybean oil, has come down from historic highs,” he said.

A second milestone, and one that had an impact on financial results for the year, was portfolio shaping.

“We divested the low margin working capital intensive businesses of Back to Nature cookie crackers and Green Giant US canned vegetables,” Keller said. “Both did not fit with our future portfolio focus and were strained to deliver adequate cash flow against the leverage model. As previously disclosed, we expect to divest additional business and brands over the next year to focus the portfolio for future success and intend to use the proceeds to pay down debt.”

B&G Foods’ third milestone in 2023 was an increase in cash flow, working capital and net cash from operations, which jumped to $248 million in fiscal 2023 from $6 million in fiscal 2022, Keller said. He said the results were driven by better operating performance and margin recovery and by improvement in working capital.

A fourth milestone involved the company’s spices and seasonings business, which now represents approximately 18% of B&G Foods’ portfolio.

“The core high margin spices and seasoning business increased net sales by 2.2%,” Keller said. “Trends were particularly strong on the foodservice and Member’s Mark Sam label business, which largely serve out of home and small business customers. The core retail branded trends, Dash, Weber, Spice Islands, etc., are improving and have recovered from temporary service and production issues in our Ankeny (Iowa) factory. We have also strengthened our innovation and new product pipeline launching new license seasoning and grilling blends under the Buffalo Trace, Fireball and Southern Comfort brands, which are performing very well in initial distribution.”

Overall, B&G Foods sustained a loss of $66.2 million in the year ended Dec. 30, 2023, which compared with a loss of $11.4 million in fiscal 2022. Fiscal 2023 results included nearly $138 million in losses associated with the sale of certain assets, including the divestiture of the Back to Nature business and Green Giant US shelf stable line. The company also recorded $20.5 million in charges related to intangible trademark assets for the Baker’s Joy, Molly McButter, Sugar Twin and New York Flatbreads brands.

Sales fell 4.7% to $2.06 billion from $2.16 billion the year prior.

CHICAGO — Texture is something one does not think about when eating, unless it’s off. It’s an attribute that is more than mouthfeel and incorporates how food dissolves in the mouth and how it’s tasted. It’s the third dimension and is mostly about nothing. But nothing is something.  

Ice cream manufacturers have long understood the role air plays in texture development. They refer to the amount of air incorporated into mix prior to freezing as overrun. The less overrun, the more dense the ice cream; and often the more expensive. After all, air is free.

“Texture is the next thing,” said Morgaine Gaye, a global food futurologist based in the UK. “It’s not just the surface anymore.”

Consumers often think they taste texture but in reality texture is a flavorless attribute. It is, however, the backbone of food product development because it has an impact on the other attributes.

“We believe texture plays an underappreciated but critical role in how consumers like or don’t like the food they eat,” said James P. Zallie, president and chief executive officer, Ingredion Inc., Westchester, Ill., during a Feb. 21 presentation at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference.

So why texture now? As a food futurologist, Gaye is in tune with general pop culture, everything from fashion to geopolitics.

“And right now, with everything going on in the world, consumers do not want to be tied down,” she said. “People are off-loading. They want less. They crave a feeling of lightness, and that’s what you get with air.”

Think lattice cookies, marshmallows and cream cheese. With the latter, note how the texture varies between a block and whipped tub. Crevices and pockets create unique textures and thus, eating experiences. Manufacturing processes may assist with incorporating air and water.

Ingredients also play a role. Think how gluten entraps air in a leavened baked food and how gelatin turns water into a slick, melt-in-your-mouth encounter.

Gaye believes 3D-printing will play an important role in developing new textures in foods.

“Air creates interest,” she said. “Air is the ingredient of the future.”

Texture is something ingredient companies have been trying to emphasize as a way of creating a point of differentiation in the marketplace. Texturants are a category of ingredients that assist with incorporating air or binding water in a food matrix.

Usually carbohydrate or protein based, texturants vary in function and by application. For example, maltodextrins and polydextrose add body and build total solids, while starches add viscosity and body. Gums tend to build viscosity and prevent phase separation, while emulsifiers bind fat and aqueous phases.

Zallie said the market for texturizing ingredients is “a large addressable market that is growing steadily.”

He said the Ingredion’s market insights group found superior texture for taste is foundational for consumer preference. In fact, 70% of consumers agreed texture gave foods and beverages a more interesting eating experience, according to consumer research conducted by the company.  

“Think for a moment about boba tea, which has gained popularity and contains tapioca pearls, which is basically tapioca starch and some hydrocolloids to keep the product to have its integrity in a beverage,” Zallie said. “And 84% of consumers associated a lighter texture with healthier options. Think rice cakes or rice crisps, for example.”

MUMBAI, INDIA — Funds advised by Convergent Finance LLP and private equity firm Samara Capital have reached agreement to acquire a 51.8% stake in Agro Tech Foods Ltd. (ATFL) from Chicago-based Conagra Brands, Inc. Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.

ATFL, which is listed on both the National Stock Exchange and the Bombay Stock Exchange, is engaged in the business of manufacturing, marketing and selling a wide range of food products and edible oils.

NEW YORK — Plant-based variety, the citrus flavor yuzu and upcycled were among the key trends identified by a panel of “trendspotters” assembled by the Specialty Food Association to review innovation exhibited at the Winter Fancy Food Show, held Jan. 21-23 in Las Vegas.

“The Winter Fancy Food Show gave participants an advance look at the year ahead in specialty foods,” said Bill Lynch, president of the Specialty Food Association, the organizer of the show. “Thanks to our trendspotters, as well as many other experts and influencers who joined us in Las Vegas, our show provides crucial insights and forecasting at the start of the food industry’s annual cycle.”

A wide variety of plant-based prepared foods featuring international flavors were on display at the show. Specific products called out by the trendspotter panel included Aki Foods’ plant-based pork tonkotsu, Jayone Foods’ plant-based spicy bulgogi and a black truffle koji pate from Prime Roots and Three Little Pigs.

The panel also said the Japanese citrus fruit flavor yuzu was “everywhere” at the show.

“Everyone loves lemon and citrus,” said Clara Park, a chef who participated in the trendspotter panel. “But how you make it new again is with the Japanese citrus, yuzu.”

Yuzu was used to flavor beverages, frozen novelties and condiments, notably kosho, a Japanese seasoning.

The upcycling trend also appeared to accelerate at the show as more companies showcased products featuring ingredients sourced from byproducts and side streams. Products called out by the trendspotter panel included the Pressed Juicery’s cold pressed juices, Rancho Meladuco’s date products and Wheyward Spirit’s whisky.

Jonathan Deutsch, a professor with and director of the Drexel Food Lab at Drexel University and a member of the panel, said the focus on upcycled products is only the beginning.

“For upcycled brands, the packaging will ideally match the sustainability-focus of the product,” he said. “As sustainable packaging gets more sophisticated and affordable, brands can align their better-for-the planet mission beyond the product to include the packaging.”

Two additional trends highlighted by the panel included fruits as snacks and new takes on classics. As more people learn about ultraprocessed foods, there is interest in innovative less processed products. Applications at the Winter Fancy Food show that caught the panel’s attention included candied citrus peels, guava butter and frozen grapes.

AVENTURA, FLA. — Despite the bullish fundamentals of global sugar consumption outpacing production and the consistent tightening of trade flows, speakers at the International Sweetener Colloquium in Aventura on Feb. 26 said global sugar markets have calmed following recent price surges and appear to have found a balance between supply and demand — for now.

“Let’s keep things in perspective,” said Jeff Dobrydney, senior vice president and head of futures and options, JSG Commodities. “Sugar prices in November were trending toward 28¢ (a lb) and now we’re around 22.50¢.” For [several weeks/since the start of 2024] sugar has settled in a trading range between 20¢ and 24¢, but Dobrydney said that range is still pretty high compared to more historical ranges which hovered around 15¢.

“But I think 20 is the new 15,” he said. 

  Dobrydney and other analysts participating in a panel discussing the international sugar market dynamics at the Colloquium said much of the current reprieve and global balance is largely due to the massive production in Brazil. 

“We still have about 5% of Brazilian mills still harvesting in the fields, and considering that the crop year ends in December and begins in November, that gives you an idea of just how monstrous this crop is,” said Vincent O’Rourke, trader and market analyst, C. Czarnikow Sugar, Inc.

O’Rourke said Central South Brazil had record sugar production in 2023-24 at 42.35 million tonnes, and 2024-25 should also be significant with a forecast at 41.74 million tonnes. “These monster crops are absolutely necessary for the world market, but we’re putting all our eggs into one basket, and that puts a lot of pressure on getting that sugar out of the country,” he said. 

“If there is any sort of disruption in Brazil this year, sugar prices won’t necessarily go the way of cocoa prices, but they certainly won’t stay at 22¢,” Dobrydney affirmed.

The world’s other major supplier, India, which has historically followed Brazil in sugar production, is more of a “swing voter” this year, said James Liddiard, senior vice president for Agrilion Commodity Advisers. 

“Global markets in the past few years have needed Indian exports, but now the markets are more concerned about Indian imports,” Liddiard said. 

With adverse weather leading to low yields in the current crop year and with expectation for even lower sugar output in 2024-25, analysts anticipate India may be forced to import sugar for the first time since 2017 to meet its domestic demand. 

Liddiard said Thailand, another major supplier, is at risk of reducing its position in the global market due to competition from other crops, poor yields and diminished exports. 

All the while, global sugar consumption continues to rise, but the panelists said the weakening reliability of supply being able to satisfy the growing demand promises to keep a thread of volatility running through the sugar markets, despite the current calm. But O’Rourke reminded Colloquium attendees there are opportunities for all participants within the wild market swings.   

“We’ve been as high as 28¢ and as low as 19¢ within the last year,” O’Rourke said. “Everyone looking ahead, whether buyers or sellers, is going to have opportunities on both ends of the spectrum.”

WILKES-BARRE, LUZERNE COUNTY (WBRE/WYOU) — After an Edwardsville business was destroyed by a fire, the community rallied to help the owner of NEPA Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) business relocate.

After a fire destroyed a local mixed martial arts studio on February 15, owner Kyle Reed was devastated.

“Probably one of the most horrific experiences I’ve ever had to experience my life from getting the phone call to pulling up on the scene and just seeing everything that I built I dreamed and everything like that just gone with hours,” said NEPA MMA owner Kyle Reed.

Now, he is focused on rebuilding and says the community support means the world to him.

“That really meant a lot for us cause I didn’t really know how to kind of analyze everything that was going on a process everything that was going on, but just to know that so many people were standing behind me,” Reed explained.

He says although this was a horrible experience, it has given him a push to expand.

“People have told me that I’ve mentioned that this might be a blessing in disguise, or a push,” Reed added.

That blessing comes in the form of a new bigger space that will allow him to offer more opportunities to the community.

“I’ll be over on Eli Street we’re gonna have over 10,000 square feet of training facility there with MMA karate kickboxing jujitsu, some weight training, and summer camp programs,” Reed continued.

Right now, he is working out of NEPA CrossFit which he says was all set up for him to use a day after the fire. Reed says they plan to open the new location in the weeks to come.

“Theoretically fingers crossed no hiccups, six weeks NEPA Mixed Martial Arts will be open as one of the largest training, MMA training facilities in the northeast and probably the coast East Coast,” said Reed.

Reed also wants to thank everyone who helped him through this and donated equipment and space to continue doing what he loves.

One letter calls activist investor Peltz one of the “wolves in sheep’s clothing"" and also one of the “villains” in a Disney story. 


							By 

	Caitlin Huston


Business Writer


	The grandchildren of Walt Disney and Roy O. Disney are voicing their support for Bob Iger in his board seat battle against Nelson Peltz.


	Two separate letters were sent to shareholders Thursday from each set of grandchildren, including Abigail Disney, who has been outspoken against recent Disney practices. 




	In the letter from grandchildren of Roy O. Disney, which is signed by Abigail and three others, the grandchildren outline the “magic” they experienced at the company throughout their childhoods, and say that Iger can continue that spirit at the company. Meanwhile, they call Peltz one of the “wolves in sheep’s clothing” and also one of the “villains” in a Disney story.

	“Bob Iger, his management team, and the Board of Directors are faithful to this magic. They understand that the longevity of The Walt Disney Company isn’t only the result of smart business decisions; it is rooted in the strong emotional connection Disney continues to forge with generations of people from around the globe,” the letter reads.




	The statement adds, “We may not agree about everything, but we know that our grandfather would be especially proud of what Disney means to the world today. We also know that, like us, he would be very concerned by the threat posed by self-anointed ‘activist investors’ who are really wolves in sheep’s clothing, just waiting to tear Disney apart if they can trick shareholders into opening the door for them.”


	The Roy O. Disney grandchildren go on to mention the hostile takeover attempt of Disney by Saul Steinberg — who they say was friends with Peltz — and “was defeated, much as these activists must be defeated today.”


	The grandchildren of Walt were more succinct, but also threw their support behind Iger, saying he can help continue the “brand of integrity and storytelling” created by their grandfather. 


	“Bob Iger has grown this company in a modern world, and he continues to maintain a balance of creativity and profit. It is still a company based on the desire to entertain and explore. There have been challenging times, but this current management has adjusted and grown through those challenges,” the letter reads. 


	Peltz, an activist investor, is staging a proxy fight against Disney due to what he says is Disney’s lagging stock performance, as well as a lack of ownership of Disney shares from the company’s board. Blackwells Capital has also nominated its own board slate of Craig Hatkoff, Jessica Schell and Leah Solivan. All parties have been campaigning, including Disney, which launched an animated video featuring Prof. Ludwig Von Drake, in the lead up to the April 3 shareholder meeting. Voting for most shareholders must be submitted before 11:59 p.m. on April 2.

	











	In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Peltz’s Trian Partners pushed back on the claims in the letter. 


	“We love Disney and recognize building on its rich history of delighting loyal fans is essential to its future success. Trian invests in great companies like Disney and helps them grow and thrive for the long term – and we have the track record to prove it at companies like P&G, Heinz and Mondelez,” the statement reads.

In Risky Space Business, Intuitive Machines Sets Sights on Second Moon Landing

By Joey Roulette

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Intuitive Machines and its space-cargo customers expect the company to emerge stronger from its problem-plagued moon landing this week, with improvements set for the company's second lander after its first went where no private firm has gone before.

The company's Odysseus moon lander on Thursday ended its week-long mission near the lunar south pole after a mix of successes and failures that illustrated the type of risks the company and NASA, the mission's biggest backer, have come to embrace.

NASA is counting on a series of low-budget, private excursions to the moon to serve as pathfinders for missions carrying astronauts this decade. The plan allows financial room for failure and offers companies big incentives to succeed on a shoestring.

""It's a new way of going to the moon, eventually to Mars, and it's a new moon that we go to,"" NASA chief Bill Nelson said in an interview, calling Intuitive Machines' mission a successful example. ""We don't go to a permanently lit, smoother area on the equator like Apollo, we go to a very hazardous, dark area with a bunch of pits.""

Intuitive's shares - which had nearly tripled, then plummeted in wild swings over the course of the Odysseus mission - closed on Thursday up about 20% from before the launch, giving the company a market value of about $600 million.

In its final descent, Odysseus stumbled to an off-kilter landing that left it leaning sharply to one side after a series of technical problems, including the need for a last-minute workaround for a laser instrument designed to tell the spacecraft where the surface was.

The rough touchdown impeded the vehicle's functions once it arrived. NASA and the lander's commercial participants could communicate with their instruments but failed to get all the data they wanted.

Studies on galactic observations, for instance, ""will not be conducted, nor will an image of the galaxy be obtained,” said Steve Durst, who led a team at the Hawaii-based International Lunar Observatory Association that put a dual-camera system on board Odysseus to capture images of the Milky Way Galaxy from the lunar surface.

Still, Durst said: ""We're delighted that our country has finally touched the moon again - even though a little bit stumbling - but we're back. And that's significant.""

And although other experiments were disappointing - a camera developed by students at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University never deployed in space as intended - some worked fine.

Lonestar Data Holdings, a Houston-based startup developing space-based data centers, had a small server aboard the lander to test data transmission between Earth and the moon.

""We got everything we needed out of the mission, and we're incredibly happy,"" Lonestar chief executive Chris Stott said. Lonestar has already booked space on the next Intuitive Machines flight this year.

That mission, called IM-2, is sold out, and a third is planned. Intuitive chief executive Steve Altemus said Wednesday that since the landing, the European Space Agency had expressed interest in flying on one of his company's missions.

Altemus said that non-lethal mistakes had illustrated an array of improvements to make on IM-2. The most egregious mistake on the mission was forgetting to turn off a safety switch that prevented the landing laser from working; Altemus said the IM-1 team had gotten better at anticipating potential problems and workarounds.

""As we went through the mission, we got further and further ahead thinking about the possible failures, and what could get us, and what we had to fix in that certain time frame,"" he said.

As for the equipment, ""When I think of major redesigns, I'm thinking about adding cameras, and adding antennas, things like that,"" he added.

Part of the mission's success was that, by past standards of space budgets, it was a bargain.

NASA put $118 million into the Intuitive Machines mission, and the company spent roughly $100 million itself.

""This was not an Apollo-era, multibillion-dollar program where a failure's not an option. These are the low-cost bets, an order of magnitude cheaper,"" said Chad Anderson, head of venture capital firm Space Capital. ""So you get to try again.""

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=business+news,Beyond NYU: Switching medicine for music business,https://nyunews.com/news/2024/02/29/beyond-nyu-mir-hwang-gig-finesse-music/,"Thu, 29 Feb 2024 13:03:43 GMT","

CAS alum Mir Hwang struggled to balance his love for music and creativity while majoring in psychology and minoring in chemistry on the pre-medical track. During his senior year, Hwang turned his interests into an entrepreneurial venture by co-founding GigFinesse — a concierge booking platform that helps connect small artists and venues for live performances. 

Hwang, whose business partner is his cousin Ryan Kim, earned a spot on the 2024 edition of Forbes’ “30 Under 30” list under the consumer technology category. He created the company concept before graduating in 2019, which has helped thousands of artists find opportunities to perform their music and booked $2.4 million worth of revenue in 2022. The GigFinesse team started with just Hwang and Kim in New York, but has grown to over 30 employees, offices nationwide and an office in Seoul, where Hwang was born.

In an interview with WSN, Hwang spoke about how NYU helped him create GigFinesse, the impact the COVID-19 pandemic had on his work and the process of turning his love for music into a business.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

WSN: What led you to create GigFinesse?  

Hwang: I started applying to every single outlet that NYU had, whether it be the Leslie eLab, the $300K Entrepreneurs Challenge or the InnoVention competition. Fortunately, we were able to win all the competitions and we got our start through a lot of the NYU ecosystem. Our first initial mentors and our first initial investors came through that core of people. The community has been extremely supportive. We wouldn’t have been able to get the company up and running without NYU support and resources.

While Hwang said he pursued pre-med at NYU in 2015 due to pressure from his mother to follow a “traditional conservative career path,” he said he was never passionate about that trajectory. While Hwang was born in South Korea, he grew up in Vancouver, where he was a drummer in various bands that backed artists performing in both small shows and nationwide tours. 

WSN: Where did your love for music start? 

Hwang: I really fell in love with music by playing in bands and putting on shows with my friends when I was a teenager. Eventually, because of that, I became a touring session drummer, and I became really intimately familiar with the intricacies and frustrations of booking live entertainment — and shows in general. It wasn’t too long before I really immersed myself into a community of artists who were equally as frustrated and desperate to find better ways to source gigs and perform. 

Hwang eventually moved to the Washington, D.C. area for high school before transitioning to NYU. He said that he was excited to attend a university in New York City so he could nurture his passion for art while pursuing pre-med. While at NYU, he continued his love for music by playing at local clubs.  

WSN: What issues existed in the live music industry that inspired your company?


Hwang: Right around the time when the iPhone came out, all these apps were coming out, and I was thinking to myself, ‘Wow, this is so inefficient, how we’re going about contacting these venues and booking shows. I’m hoping that someone eventually will figure out a way so that it’s as easy as calling an Uber.’ Fast forward when I was a senior at NYU, nothing had really changed, and there was little to no innovation to be found in this space. In the summer of 2019 my cousin and I decided to go work on GigFinesse full time to really help reshape the live-music landscape.

In the first few months of starting GigFinesse, Hwang and his cousin gradually found ways to increase finances beyond support from NYU. However, just as the business was taking shape in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic “instantaneously wiped out all of the progress” they made, sending them “pretty much back to square one.”  

WSN: What did you do when the COVID-19 pandemic hit? 

Hwang: Instead of pulling the plug, we just decided to deploy the little remaining capital that we had in our last ditch effort. We wanted to see this through, even if it meant it was just for an extra few months. So in 2021, I moved down to Austin with just a suitcase and a backpack. I sublet a University of Texas at Austin dorm room basically for $250 a month and that’s all I could afford. I was going on foot, going door to door and trying to talk to more customers. I was tutoring chemistry during the day to pay the bills because the company was not making any money and this was really a do-or-die test for us.

Once pandemic restrictions eased, Hwang moved back to New York and resumed work on GigFinesse in 2022, which is when he says the business truly launched. Last year, over 50 people maintained jobs as full-time musicians on GigFinesse and there are currently tens of thousands of users on the platform, according to Hwang.  

Hwang aspires to grow GigFinesse into an international platform so that it becomes a platform for anyone in the live entertainment industry, either as an artist or a venue. Hwang also said he tries to continue supporting NYU as much as he can. He is currently a founder in residence at the university’s Entrepreneurial Institute, where he mentors students as they create their own startups. 

WSN: What have been the biggest takeaways for you from running GigFinesse? 

Hwang: We are very lucky to be in this position. How many people really get an opportunity to work on something that they’re genuinely passionate about and pursue that on a full-time basis? We make it easier and cheaper for venues to hire and have quality entertainment and vice versa, for a lot of these great musicians to find more consistent opportunities. I remember last Christmas, we received over 50 handwritten letters saying, thanks to GigFinesse, I was able to quit my day job and get to pursue music full time. Things like that ultimately are what keep us really grounded and what keep us going.

ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Minnesota’s budget outlook has improved thanks to higher corporate profits, officials said Thursday as they projected a slightly bigger surplus that will give the Legislature a little bit more breathing room this session.Minnesota Management and Budget said the current two-year budget period, which runs through June 2025, is now expected to end with a surplus of just over $3.7 billion. That’s up more than $1.3 billion from the last forecast, which was released in December. That compares with an overall budget of $72 billion, which was set last year.“Our forecast is good news. Our economy is humming along,” Democratic Gov. Tim Walz said at a briefing for reporters. “We made critical investments in our budget last year to grow our economy, lower costs for middle class families, from tax cuts to free school meals, to investments in our workforce and career and technical education.”The budget office is also forecasting a smaller “structural imbalance” for the next two-year budget, which begins in July 2025. If lawmakers spend the entire $3.7 billion surplus, the next budget would start out with a $1.5 billion deficit instead of dipping $2.3 billion into the red as previously forecast. Republican leaders said they still consider that a deficit. But if the entire surplus is left in the bank, the next budget would start out $2.2 billion in the black.“In order to protect the investments that were made in programs that serve Minnesotans, it will be important that policymakers exercise caution in enacting additional ongoing spending this legislative session,” Budget Commissioner Erin Campbell told reporters.Minnesota Democratic Gov.

Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman, of Brooklyn Park, said she had already received “a few texts from people asking for things.” But she and other leaders made clear that they don’t plan on much extra spending. “Today’s improved budget forecast shows that Democratic leadership continues to have Minnesota on the right path,” Hortman said at the press conference. She went on to say, “I do not foresee making any commitments to spending that we can’t pay for.”But there’s one place for growth. The improved forecast means that the state can borrow more money for a public infrastructure package known as a bonding bill. State debt guidelines now allow the state to borrow $980 million for the bill, up from $830 million in the previous forecast, because interest rates are slightly lower, Campbell said.Walz said that means there will probably be enough money to add more local projects to the bill, as some lawmakers have urged, but that he’ll leave those decisions to the Legislature. The governor proposed a combination of $982 million in borrowing and cash in January. The final package is still expected to have an unglamorous focus on maintaining the state’s existing infrastructure, like roads, bridges and water treatment facilities. It will require at least some Republican votes to reach the 60% majorities in both chambers that are needed when the state takes on more debt. The budget office said the main reason for the improved outlook is higher tax collections due to higher-than-expected corporate profits, while spending projections have barely changed. The state’s labor shortage isn’t quite as tight as it was. Unemployment remains low but is expected to rise slightly.Republican leaders said the state would be in much better shape if the Democratic majority had not spent the entire $17 billion surplus that the state had going into the 2023 legislative session.“It’s time to cut spending and budget responsibly instead of trying to maintain the reckless spending from last session,” said House Minority Leader Lisa Demuth, a Republican of Cold Spring, at the press conference. “Family budgets and small businesses need meaningful tax relief now. And that’s what Republicans are asking for.”

The global prevalence of obesity has soared over the last 30 years. A new analysis suggests that more than 1 billion people worldwide now live with the chronic disease.

It’s no secret that global obesity rates have been rising over the past few decades. But a new analysis quantifies the upsurge.

More than 1 billion people worldwide were living with obesity as of 2022, researchers report February 29 in the Lancet. That’s about one-eighth of the global population (SN: 11/15/22). For comparison, nearly 800 million people had obesity in 2016, according to the World Health Organization, or WHO.

Obesity is “defined by the presence of excess body fat that impairs health,” says obesity expert Arya Sharma of the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, who was not involved in the study. The chronic disease can raise the risk for conditions like heart disease and type 2 diabetes, vulnerability to diseases like COVID-19, and can also limit mobility and negatively affect mental health (SN: 4/22/20).

Global health researcher Majid Ezzati and colleagues examined more than 3,600 population-based studies published over the last several decades encompassing 222 million participants across nearly 200 countries and territories. The researchers divided each participant’s reported weight by their height squared to find their body mass index, or BMI.

Analyzing the trends suggested that in 2022, almost 900 million adults worldwide had a BMI of 30 or above, classifying them as having obesity. In children and adolescents ages 5 to 19, nearly 160 million were estimated to have the chronic disease, defined as BMI above a certain point on the WHO’s growth reference curves, which account for age and sex.

From 1990 to 2022, the prevalence of obesity roughly doubled in women, tripled in men and quadrupled in children and adolescents. At the same time, global rates of those who were underweight fell. “We shouldn’t be thinking about [underweight and obesity] as two separate things, because the transition from one to the other has been very rapid,” says Ezzati, of Imperial College London.

The estimated obesity rates should raise alarms, he says. “Governments and societies need to deal with this” through prevention and medical care. Despite new anti-obesity medications like Wegovy showing incredible results, Ezzati adds, their high costs and lack of incorporation in worldwide medical guidance will make them inaccessible to most people for the near future (SN: 12/13/23).

Ezzati notes that one of the biggest driving factors of obesity’s increased prevalence is limited access to and the unaffordability of healthy foods. Sharma adds that societal-level lifestyle changes — such as getting less sleep, increased stress levels and spending less time at home — can also lead to eating more processed foods and overconsumption (SN: 12/21/18; SN: 5/16/19).

“When you look at appetite, there’s a complex biology behind it,” Sharma says. “And that biology is affected by environmental changes.”

The surprise pregnancy of Charlotte, a stingray living in a tank without any male rays, has captivated people across the world and stirred a sudden interest in parthenogenesis, a scientific term that essentially means virgin birth. 

Speculation about the stingray has racked up more than 12 million views for a TikToker. The talk show host Jimmy Kimmel weighed in on Charlotte’s apparent immaculate conception with a segment about the ray, which resides at the Aquarium & Shark Lab, in Hendersonville, North Carolina. 

While a virgin birth sounds like a rare event, experts on parthenogenesis said Charlotte has performed a miracle of life far more common than most people understand. Dozens of species — zebra sharks, California condors and Komodo dragons — can reproduce asexually through parthenogenesis. Scientists have only started to unravel the mysteries of this phenomenon, and a better understanding of the process could help them harness its power for conservation. 

“There’s nothing unnatural about asexual reproduction,” said Mercedes Burns, a biologist at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, who studies sexual conflict in animals. “Invertebrates or fishes are doing amazing things in their lifetimes in order to reproduce successfully.” 

The frenzy over Charlotte’s baby bump began earlier this month, when the Aquarium & Shark Lab announced that the stingray was expecting, suggesting on social media that she’d been either impregnated by a shark that shares her cage or that she had developed pups through parthenogenesis. 

Kevin Feldheim, a researcher at Chicago’s Field Museum who is a parthenogenesis expert, said the shark impregnation theory might have helped make Charlotte a media darling, but it has no basis in reality because they are such distant genetic relatives. 

“The divergence between sharks and stingrays is 350 million years. And as comparison, the divergence between humans and platypus is 180 millions years,” he said. “The shark scientists were not really happy with that press release. No one would even think of that as an option.” 

Once the ray gives birth to pups, researchers will have to evaluate the offspring and do genetic testing to confirm they’re the results of parthenogenesis, which is the only likely cause, Feldheim said. He added that confirmation will be important because elasmobranchs — a subclass of fish that includes rays, sharks and skates — can store viable sperm for several years in a special gland. 

Scientists are only just beginning to understand how many species can perform parthenogenesis. He said the first convincing evidence of the phenomenon in sharks was published in 2007. 

Feldheim said he’s counted 15 species of elasmobranchs where parthenogenesis has been observed by scientists since then. 

The phenomenon has been observed in every class of animals, except for mammals, which have a mechanism that prevents parthenogenesis.  

“Genes responsible for early stage development of zygotes have to come from both sperm and egg. If they’re only present in the egg, that zygote will arrest its development,” Burns explained, adding that mammals are “all in” on sexual reproduction. 

The common form of parthenogenesis happens during meiosis, when gametes (the cells that create new organisms in sexual reproduction) are created. When eggs are produced, byproducts are created called polar bodies, which contain genetic information. 

During spontaneous parthenogenesis, eggs fuse with polar bodies to create a new offspring without the genetic contribution of another parent. 

The extent to which parthenogenesis exists in the wild remains unclear. It’s often observed in zoos, where it’s easier to spot because animals are separated from one another and often solitary. 

“Females are held in aquariums around the world, oftentimes without a male, and if they started laying eggs, I‘m assuming aquariums would toss them, because they weren’t fertile,” Feldheim said. “It’s now being studied in a little more depth in a couple species around the world because we’ve started to know how it’s relatively common in a captive setting.”

The process could be playing out in wild animals with similar rates, but it’s much harder to detect. 

Why vertebrates have developed the ability to reproduce asexually is a bit of mystery. 

Researchers found a population of small tooth sawfish in Florida that’s just barely hanging on, Feldheim said. The researchers found several of the creatures were reproducing through parthenogenesis. 

“This species is at much lower numbers than it has been in the past. It’s very possible those females couldn’t find a mate,” he said, which would make parthenogenesis a “backup way” to reproduce when pickings are slim. 

But, the phenomenon has also been demonstrated in zebra sharks when mates were available. 

Burns said it’s possible parthenogenesis is a response to environment feedback. It’s also possible it’s just a happy fluke of cell division and a reminder of how life can bring gifts of random chance and little explanation.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=science+news,Smart wearable device monitors high-risk postpartum women,https://www.advancedsciencenews.com/smart-wearable-device-monitors-high-risk-postpartum-women/,"Thu, 29 Feb 2024 08:10:48 GMT","

 by Becki Robins | Feb 29, 2024

In the United States, around 40% of pregnancy-related deaths occur in the first 42 days after a person has given birth. Underserved populations are especially at risk. Black women, for example, are three times more likely to die during childbirth and in the postpartum period than their white counterparts.

Still, keeping women in the hospital for more than a few days after delivery is not standard practice; hospitals need space for new patients, and most women are eager to return home with their babies. Once they’ve been discharged, women who are at high risk for postpartum complications can no longer be monitored by their doctors.

“With the current standard of postpartum care in the United States being a follow-up four to six weeks after childbirth, many of these potentially lethal postpartum complications occurring in the 1st month are missed,” wrote the authors of research recently published in Advanced Science.

In their paper, the researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology and the College of Nursing at the University of Illinois introduced a cloud-integrated wearable device that could help catch problems during those critical first weeks after delivery to potentially save lives.



The device attaches to the skin with adhesive and is worn over the sternum. “This wearable device is like a miniaturized band-aid,” said Woon-Hong Yeo, who co-authored the study. “But on this device, there are multiple miniaturized nanotechnology-based sensors and electronics.” These sensors, Yeo explained, measure important health parameters like heart rate, blood oxygen levels, respiration, temperature, and blood pressure.

The main advantage of the device is that it monitors multiple critical health parameters, processes those signals simultaneously, and uses the data to make inferences about the patient’s health. “We demonstrated that this device can remotely monitor if there’s any existing disease progression, and any other possible risks based on the measured sickness.” If the device detects a problem, it will alert the patient’s doctor who can decide what actions to take next.

The researchers’ study group consisted of 20 postpartum Black women divided into high- and low-risk groups. The women were considered at high risk if they had a history of heart problems, diabetes, blood clots, high blood pressure, or c-section. The participants were instructed to wear the device for at least 10 minutes per day for the duration of the 28-day study period.

In clinical practice, Yeo said the device would be used to monitor women similar to those in the high-risk study group: postpartum women from underserved populations who already have known health problems such as diabetes or obesity, or who experienced problems during pregnancy.

Masudul Imtiaz, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at Clarkson University who was not involved in the study, said the device could have multiple advantages for these kinds of patients. “This might overcome accessibility barriers, enhance patient awareness, and allow for early intervention, making it particularly beneficial for underserved populations,” he said.



Yeo said the device seemed well-tolerated by the study group. “We didn’t get any complaints,” he said. “Because compared to — if you just think of devices that they have to use at hospitals — this device is a lot more comfortable.”

Leanne West, who is also a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology but was not involved in the study, said she thinks the research could be expanded to groups with other health concerns besides high-risk postpartum women.

“I would love to see it used in people with high blood pressure to continuously track their blood pressure,” she said. She also said that longer monitoring periods might yield more useful information. “I think 10 minutes a day can give you a decent snapshot,” she said, but she added that short periods of monitoring at multiple points during the day might provide a more accurate overall picture.

Imtiaz also noted that the device could have broader applications. “It provides a more comprehensive and accessible solution for monitoring a range of health indicators beyond addressing postpartum care practices,” he said.

“I want to emphasize that at the moment, there’s no available device like this,” said Yeo, adding that it could provide peace of mind not just for new mothers and their families, but for doctors as well. “They feel a lot better about their patients because they will know immediately if something happens to them, so that they can ask them to come to the hospital.”

					Understanding the effect could help forecasters determine whether a hurricane may strengthen after landfall				

Hurricane Florence roared across the Carolinas in September 2018, gaining new intensity as it swept over already waterlogged soils. The resulting rainfall broke records, and floodwaters continued to inundate towns such as Conway, S.C., (shown) two weeks after the storm had passed.

Once a hurricane makes landfall, it’s usually the beginning of the end for the storm. But a tropical cyclone passing over warm, waterlogged ground can get a jolt of energy that refuels its fury, researchers reported in January at the American Meteorological Society’s meeting in Baltimore.

This phenomenon, called the brown ocean effect, mimics how the ocean fuels tropical cyclones by giving the storms a ready supply of water and heat. Understanding this effect, researchers say, could help forecasters warn residents that an inland hurricane might counterintuitively strengthen.

Using satellite measurements of wind speeds, rainfall and soil moisture, geologist Dev Niyogi and colleagues examined how this effect was at play for Hurricane Florence, a relatively weak storm when it made landfall in the Carolinas in September 2018 (SN: 9/13/18). The data revealed a powerful feedback mechanism: As Florence passed over already-soaking soil, its rains intensified, ultimately leading to record-breaking rainfall and flooding.

It’s one of the first observational confirmations of this long-hypothesized phenomenon, says Niyogi, of the University of Texas at Austin. The brown ocean effect can also help some storms stay strong longer as they travel over land, he says, allowing them to penetrate deeper inland before dissipating (SN: 11/11/2020).

The idea of the brown ocean effect was described in 2013 by atmospheric scientist Marshall Shepherd and geographer Theresa Andersen, prompted in part by the very strange evolution of Tropical Storm Erin in 2007. The storm was weak and disorganized when it made landfall, but as it drifted northwest toward Oklahoma, it encountered flooded ground due to heavy rains that year. The storm suddenly strengthened, puzzling scientists as it even formed an eye for the first time.

Computer simulations have long suggested that wetter soils can intensify monsoon rains as well as cyclones. “Water evaporates from the ocean as water vapor, but when it gets into hurricanes, it condenses,” says Shepherd, of the University of Georgia in Athens. As the water changes from gas to liquid, it also releases heat — a jolt of storm-strengthening energy.

In Anderson’s dissertation work at the University of Georgia, she identified at least a dozen storms between 1997 and 2008, including Tropical Storm Erin, that were probably strengthened by this effect post-landfall.

And now, Shepherd says, there’s a growing body of scientific studies hunting for — and finding — the fingerprints of this effect in specific storms. “Tropical storms are not intelligent,” he says. “They don’t know the difference between wet soils, oceans and wetlands” as sources of energy.

The new study is among that body of work. Niyogi and colleagues used high-resolution satellite data on soil moisture, temperature and changes in rainfall before, during and after Hurricane Florence’s arrival on land. “As the storm system was moving, you could trace the source of moisture, see rainfall maxima,” Niyogi says.

The data revealed a powerful positive feedback between bursts of intense rain and soil moisture, the team found. How long the soils were wet before the storm passed over them also made a difference, they calculated: The heaviest rains occurred over soil that had already been saturated for about three days. That’s about how long evaporation from the soaked soil helped keep the atmosphere just above the ground nice and humid — ideal for feeding energy to a storm.

Saturated soil isn’t the only criterion — soil temperature was also key, the team determined. When the soil reaches a certain threshold temperature — one that’s yet to be determined, Niyogi says — the conditions are especially right to spin up a storm. The team’s findings were also reported in 2023 in Geophysical Research Letters.

Shepherd coauthored a separate study, also presented at the American Meteorological Society’s January meeting, that detailed how the effect contributed to flash floods inundating Texas during 2015’s Tropical Storm Bill.

And perhaps the most striking recent case of this effect came in 2021, when Hurricane Ida roared ashore in Louisiana, at almost the same location as 2005’s Hurricane Katrina. However, Ida lingered much longer before dissipating — probably fueled by days of rain soaking the ground and increasing the humidity ahead of its landfall, researchers reported in 2022 in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.

What these data show, Niyogi says, is that “the brown ocean effect exists, if you look for it.”

Shepherd agrees: These studies confirm that the brown ocean effect “is real,” and that computer weather models need to incorporate the influence of land as well as ocean and atmosphere on tropical storms. That’s particularly important when it comes to forecasting the danger these storms might pose to inland residents, he says. “If a storm moves inland, the model needs to capture that there’s wet soil there.”

Two Wall Street wealth management giants, Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo, are adding spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds to their brokerage platforms, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

Ever since the launch of the 10 ETFs in January, industry participants have been wondering when major U.S. brokerages would start offering the funds to their clients, which could potentially bring much more buying power to the market for bitcoin ETFs.

The Bloomberg story follows a CoinDesk scoop Wednesday that Morgan Stanley, another titan in the space, is in the midst of deciding whether to give clients the option to invest in the funds. In January, CoinDesk reported first that UBS and Citigroup were letting some customers buy bitcoin ETFs.

Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo have been offering the bitcoin ETFs to clients who specifically asked to get exposure to it, Bloomberg reported.

Even without the participation of players of this caliber, the ETFs have seen tremendous demand since they began trading on Jan. 11. On Wednesday alone, a record $7.7 billion worth of all the funds traded.

Nevertheless, the entrance of Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and, perhaps, Morgan Stanley could bring a new wave of demand, Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan said earlier on Thursday.

 The price of Bitcoin stumbled amid a big day of Grayscale’s ETF outflows. JPMorgan analysts think more price corrections are coming post-halving. 

 Own this piece of crypto history 

Bitcoin (BTC) fell over 3% from its 24-hour high as investors in Grayscale’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) dumped $598.9 million from the fund on Feb. 29 — its second-largest net outflow on record. 

Bitcoin hit a 24-hour high of $63,585 early on Feb. 29 and has since dropped around 3.3% to just under $61,500, according to Cointelegraph Markets Pro.

It comes as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) — the asset managers recently converted ETF — saw daily net outflows close at $600 million on Feb. 29, per preliminary Farside Investor data.

It’s behind only the record $640.5 million net outflow day the ETF had on Jan. 22.

“That’s a lot,” Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas wrote in a Feb. 29 X post commenting on the day’s outflows.

The near-record outflows come only days after GBTC posted a historic low daily net outflow of $22.4 million on Feb. 26.

“Two steps forward one step back,” Balchunas added.

On Wednesday, Feb. 28, the ten United States spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a combined record-high net inflow of $673.4 million as Bitcoin touched an over two-year high of $64,000.

The latest GBTC outflows could put a dent in the day’s  inflows. Full inflow data across the other nine ETFs is not currently available, though Farside’s Feb. 29 data already shows Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF — one of the top three largest funds by assets — as generating just $44.8 million net inflows, its fourth-lowest day of inflows.

Meanwhile, in a recent note to investors, JPMorgan analysts warn the price of Bitcoin may fall after the “halving euphoria” dissipates. 

Bitcoin’s April-slated halving event — which many believe could push its price higher — could have the opposite effect and see it approach $42,000 instead, the analysts noted in a Feb. 29 note seen by Bloomberg.

The Bitcoin halving event slashes the Bitcoin block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC and is a historic catalyst for Bitcoin price rallies as miner production costs typically rise afterward.

Production costs — the cost to mine one Bitcoin — are seen as the lowest Bitcoin’s price should theoretically go and should “mechanically double” to $53,000 post-halving, the analysts said.

However, mining difficulty could be 20% lower than first estimated — pushing down production costs and Bitcoin’s price, meaning the cryptocurrency could slide to $42,000 after the April halving, the analysts noted.

Analysts calculated the extra 20% mining difficulty drop by assuming some miners with less efficient machines and little money to upgrade will pull their rigs offline as running costs rise.

This would bring down Bitcoin’s hash rate — and its mining difficulty — by an estimated 20%, which aligns with estimates made by Galaxy Digital last month.

The analysts conceded the mining difficulty drop might not happen as inefficient mining rigs could remain profitable in the scenario that Bitcoin’s price remains elevated, especially due to demand from Bitcoin ETFs.

As Bitcoin soars past $57,000, JPMorgan analysts are challenging the narrative surrounding the upcoming Bitcoin halving scheduled for April. Contrary to widespread anticipation, the financial giant suggests that the event, which historically triggered market movements, is already factored into the current cryptocurrency prices. 

JPMorgan points to a resurgence of retail interest as the driving force behind Bitcoin’s recent surge and highlights on-chain data indicating a shift in dynamics between retail and institutional investors.

JPMorgan’s note to clients identifies three main crypto catalysts anticipated in the coming months: the Bitcoin halving, the next major upgrade of the Ethereum network, and the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by the SEC in May. 

While the first two catalysts are deemed largely priced in, the analysts express a cautious outlook, assigning only a 50% chance to the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by the SEC.

JPMorgan analysts emphasize that the Bitcoin halving, an event occurring every four years, is unlikely to be the sole catalyst behind the recent price surge. The analysts contend that retail investors are actively participating in the market, allocating funds to new spot Bitcoin ETFs at a faster rate than institutional investors. This shift in dynamics is challenging the traditional market dynamic in that institutional interest is the primary catalyst behind Bitcoin’s price movements.

JPMorgan’s analysis delves into on-chain data, revealing that retail investors are significantly outpacing institutional flows. The team highlights a notable surge in retail activity on Coinbase, a major U.S. crypto exchange, and points to a broader trend of retail interest extending beyond Bitcoin. 

The inclusion of smaller digital coins and tokens like Dogecoin, in the retail investment landscape is noted as a significant factor contributing to the current market dynamics.

Looking beyond price dynamics, JPMorgan’s analysis extends to the post-halving landscape for Bitcoin miners. The report suggests that miners with below-average electricity costs and efficient equipment are likely to thrive post-halving, while those with high production costs may face challenges. Consequently, concentration of the Bitcoin mining industry is expected, with publicly listed miners gaining a higher share to enhance overall cost efficiency.

As Bitcoin continues its upward trajectory, JPMorgan’s assessment challenges conventional expectations tied to the upcoming halving event.

The price of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is based on supply and demand. However, because supply will never exceed 21 million coins, demand for the cryptocurrency is the only variable of consequence. That means the future price trajectory of Bitcoin depends entirely on whether demand increases or decreases from its current level.

With that in mind, certain Wall Street analysts believe two catalysts will boost demand for Bitcoin in the future, so much so that the cryptocurrency could soar 700% or more from its current price of about $50,000 by the end of the decade. Here's what investors should know.

A Fidelity report recently identified several signs of growing demand for Bitcoin. Monthly active addresses, monthly new addresses, and monthly transactions are all trending higher. The illiquid supply of Bitcoin (i.e., the percentage that has not moved in over a year) is near a record high and trending upward, meaning more investors are holding the cryptocurrency. And the number of accounts with at least 0.1 Bitcoin hit a record high in December 2023.

Beyond those trends, two catalysts could create more demand for Bitcoin in the future. First, the Securities and Exchange Commission recently approved several spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Those investment vehicles provide direct exposure to the cryptocurrency without the hassle of buying and storing Bitcoin. By reducing friction, spot Bitcoin ETFs could draw more retail and institutional investors into the market. Indeed, the collective inflows across spot Bitcoin ETFs during the first month of trading were higher than the inflows of any other ETF launch in history.

Second, Bitcoin mining rewards are reduced by 50% every time 210,000 blocks are added to the blockchain, which happens about once every four years. The next halving event is scheduled to take place in April and it will effectively boost demand by reducing selling pressure. To elaborate, miners sell Bitcoin to monetize their operations, but they will have 50% less Bitcoin to sell after the April halving event.

There is a historical precedent for Bitcoin increasing in value after mining rewards are cut in half, as shown in the table below.

Anthony Scaramucci, founder and managing partner at Skybridge Capital, recently told podcast host Scott Melker that Bitcoin could reach $240,000 within 18 months of the April halving event. Scaramucci also said Bitcoin would eventually achieve half the market capitalization of gold, bringing its per-coin value to roughly $400,000. That implies 700% upside from its current price of $50,000.

Tom Lee, managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, recently told CNBC that Bitcoin could reach $500,000 in the next five years, implying 900% upside from its current price. ""There's a finite supply and now we have a potentially huge increase in demand with spot Bitcoin [ETF] approval, so I think in five years something around half a million would be potentially achievable,"" Lee said in January.

Cathie Wood, founder and chief executive officer of Ark Invest, recently discussed her Bitcoin valuation model with CNBC. Her base-case valuation is roughly $600,000 by 2030, implying 1,100% upside from its current price. But her bull-case valuation is $1.5 million by 2030, implying 2,900% upside from its current price. Wood said spot Bitcoin ETF approval makes the bull case more likely.

Bitcoin could be worth more (perhaps much more) in the future. But investors cannot make informed decisions without understanding the risks.

First, historical data is limited. Bitcoin was created less than two decades ago, whereas stocks and bonds have been around for centuries. That makes speculation difficult where Bitcoin is concerned. For instance, there is no precedent for its performance during a deep recession.

Second, Bitcoin has historically been quite volatile. It has fallen at least 50% from a record high three times in the past five years, and it plunged more than 75% during the most recent cryptocurrency market crash. Investors should expect that volatility to persist in the future.

Third, Bitcoin has been associated with fraud, money laundering, and other criminal activity. Certain countries have banned the cryptocurrency and other countries are still building regulatory frameworks. Future changes in the regulatory landscape could damp demand for Bitcoin.

Patient investors comfortable with those risks should consider buying Bitcoin today.

The cryptocurrency world is filled with speculation following several financial movements made by the founder of Amazon, Jeff Bezos, which have generated rumors that he might invest in Bitcoin. The chatter gained momentum after Apollo co-founder Thomas Fahrer hinted on X about Bezos’s recent activities, suggesting a significant move into the cryptocurrency space.

According to the report, Jeff Bezos has recently sold Amazon shares amounting to $8.5 billion, and this move has, in turn, attracted the attention of financial analysts and crypto followers. Despite the sale, Bezos is still the main shareholder in Amazon, and his wealth is beyond $190 billion. This action occurs when Amazon’s market price grows considerably, jumping over 76% in the previous year.

Further fueling the rumors, Bezos was spotted at a dinner event with his fiancée, Lauren Sanchez, and with Michael Saylor, a Bitcoin supporter and the CEO of MicroStrategy. Saylor’s company has appeared in the news due to its huge Bitcoin portfolio, pointing out that cryptocurrency could have been a subject between the two moguls. Considering Saylor’s influence and success within cryptocurrency, this meeting has only added to the curiosity about Bezos’s potential venture into Bitcoin.

Additionally, InvestAnswers, a crypto analyst, pointed to a new Bitcoin wallet transaction involving 26,200 BTC, valued at $51K each, possibly linked to a high-net-worth individual like Bezos. This speculation is grounded in the timing and scale of Bezos’s stock sales, combined with the enigmatic yet substantial Bitcoin purchase, leading many to wonder about the investor’s identity behind it.

INDIANAPOLIS — A day after news emerged of a proposed new model to an expanded College Football Playoff, many questions linger, perhaps none more important than the seeding and bye structure of the 14-team field.

Champions of the SEC and Big Ten would hold exclusive rights on the two first-round byes, according to one version circulated to several college athletic administrators. The version has not been finalized and is only being socialized before more exploratory work on the format, those with knowledge of the model told Yahoo Sports.

Such a concept — guaranteed byes for the Big Ten and SEC — is an unusual but somewhat expected maneuver from college football’s goliaths. It’s also a move that has garnered pushback from administrators outside of those two conferences.

In a 14-team model that officials are socializing with their leagues, the Big Ten and SEC would each receive three automatic qualifiers, with the ACC and Big 12 getting two each and the Group of Five’s best team qualifying as well. Such a model would feature three at-large spots to the highest-ranked teams outside of the automatic qualifiers.

The model calls for the top two seeds to have byes into the second round. Under the 12-team format that will be used this fall and in 2025, the four highest-ranked conference champions are granted byes. In the 14-team version circulating across the country, the ACC and Big 12, the other two major conferences, would not have access to obtaining a bye — an unprecedented move and perhaps a tipping point for some administrators in those leagues.

The seeding and pairings of a 14-team bracket is expected to operate in a similar way to the current structure, where the CFP Selection Committee’s rankings would equate to seeds Nos. 1-14. Pairings of the six first-round games would be made in the normal method, including the No. 8 seed playing 9 and 7 vs. 10, presumably at the home field of the better seed. Notre Dame, as an independent, would be guaranteed one of the three at-large spots if it finished in the top 14 of the CFP’s rankings.

However, administrators caution that the model could change. Commissioners are expected to meet virtually over the next week to begin further examining the format.

There is much tension and consternation around the situation. There is an urgency, too. CFP leaders are in a race against time to agree to several unresolved issues before extending their new television contract with ESPN. The current contract ends after the 2025 playoff.

Aside from the format, officials need to agree on a new revenue-distribution model and voting structure — two concepts that the SEC and Big Ten are expected to significantly shape. The two leagues are expected to receive more revenue and more power in governance decisions.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

The 2023 season marked the first time in more than two decades Tom Brady was not on an NFL roster. Brady, who turned 46 in August, appears to have remained physically active since his football career came to an end.

Hundreds of prospects are in Indianapolis for this year's NFL Combine. Nearly 25 years ago, Brady was preparing to enter the NFL Draft. 

On Thursday, Brady shared a video on social media showing him running the 40-yard dash. He finished with a time of 5.28 seconds at the 2000 league combine.

The retired quarterback decided to give the 40-yard sprint another shot, and he beat his time from his early 20s.

The 2000 sixth-round draft pick out of Michigan accepted the 40-yard dash challenge and shared a workout video for athletics apparel company NoBull. Brady merged his TB12 wellness company and his apparel venture Brady Brand with NoBull earlier this year.

""Twenty-four years ago, I ran a 5.28 40-yard dash,"" Brady said in a video which he posted to X, formerly Twitter. ""Maybe, just maybe, we give the 40 one more shot.""

TOM BRADY 'SURPRISED' BILL BELICHICK DID NOT GET COACHING JOB: 'THE GREATEST COACH EVER'

Two people clocked Brady's run, with one clocking him at 5.18 seconds. The other clock showed Brady finished his run in 5.12 seconds. ""24 years later, redemption is spelled T O M,"" Brady wrote on X.

Brady was the 199th overall selection in the 2000 draft. He became the Patriots' starting quarterback early in the 2001 season, after Drew Bledsoe was injured. Brady never looked back and led the Patriots to the Super Bowl that season. He won five more Super Bowls in New England.

Brady won the seventh Super Bowl of his storied career during his first season with the Tampa Bay Buccanears. 

Brady is also an avid golfer.

Earlier this month, videos went viral across social media of Brady's less-than-stellar tee shot on the 14th hole during the second round of Pebble Beach Pro-Am. The three-time NFL MVP later offered a relatively simple explanation for the errant tee shot. 

""Driver was off the rack. Turns out they don’t do breakfast balls at Pebble,"" he wrote on X.

Brady's success in the NFL is unrivaled. But being the ultimate competitor that he is, Brady decided to raise the bar for his next performance.

INDIANAPOLIS — Every NFL Draft cycle there are positions that don’t seem to have a consensus top prospect, sparking debate on who has the talent to become transcendent players at their respective positions. This year’s cornerback class is extremely talented, but there isn’t a whole lot of agreement at the top in terms of who is the clear-cut, No. 1 cornerback prospect.

This week at the NFL scouting combine will help teams and analysts start to differentiate between the players as the workouts take place and more data points are added for each prospect.

Anyone trying to make sense of the cornerbacks this year is in the same boat as many other people trying to sort through the group. A handful of guys are projected to go in the first round or the top 50 picks of the draft.

The good news: It's a good year to need a cornerback. Yahoo Sports' NFL offseason primers list 17 teams, over half the league, as having a pressing need at the position. They are: the Atlanta Falcons, Cincinnati Bengals, Denver Broncos, Detroit Lions, Green Bay Packers, Houston Texans, Indianapolis Colts, Jacksonville Jaguars, Las Vegas Raiders, Los Angeles Chargers, Los Angeles Rams, Miami Dolphins, Minnesota Vikings, Philadelphia Eagles, Pittsburgh Steelers, San Francisco 49ers and Tennessee Titans.

Here’s a quick overview of who to pay attention for once the weekend kicks off. Those DBs will take center stage in the combine workouts on Friday afternoon.

Beyond the excellent nickname, McKinstry has the tools to be a starting caliber cornerback with his ability to play in press and play with physicality in the passing game. Some scouts have questions about his long speed, which he can answer with a strong workout in Indianapolis.

Arnold is the other cornerback for Alabama, an explosive, fast guy who isn’t afraid to get physical in the run game and against bigger wide receivers. He could end up as a fringe top-10 prospect with a good workout this week.

Mitchell didn’t play at a big Power 5 program, but he’s just as good as the other top players in this class. He has incredible ball skills, defending 36 passes over his past two years of college football, including six interceptions. He has a chance to increase his profile and become a common name for more casual fans of the draft.

Iowa’s star defender can play a little bit of everything in the secondary, but he has the skills to hang on the outside if that’s where his NFL future holds. DeJean won’t be working out in Indianapolis as he continues to rehab a broken leg, but does plan to work out for teams at some point.

If Wiggins is right about his athleticism, then he should be one of the stars of the weekend. He claimed he’s been able to hit a 4.27 40-yard dash, which would instantly make him one of the fastest players in the NFL if that's true.

Rakestraw didn’t compile a whole bunch of interceptions during his career at Missouri, but he’s got the frame and athleticism to grow into a starting-caliber cornerback in the NFL. Being able to show off that skill would make a coveted prospect that teams can talk themselves into.

Lassiter is a silky smooth man coverage cornerback who was asked to carry some tough assignments for the Georgia Bulldogs over the past few years. He might not be as touted as the rest of the group, but he’s as battle-tested as they come.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

The family of the late David and Mary Harrison, two of the University of Virginia’s most generous benefactors, has made a pair of commitments totaling $55 million to the Olympic Sports Center in the Department of Athletics and to create a leading-edge translational research program dedicated to the next generation of therapies for Alzheimer’s and related diseases. 

The Harrison Family Translational Research Center in Alzheimer’s and Neurodegenerative Diseases will be housed in the new Paul and Diane Manning Institute of Biotechnology. The Harrison Family Olympic Sports Center, scheduled to open in the summer of 2025, will be centrally located in the athletics precinct and will feature a performance training center, strength and conditioning facilities, tutoring and academic support spaces, and a hall of champions.

The $25 million for the sports center comes from the Harrison Foundation, while $30 million for the research center is provided by the Harrison Foundation and the Mary Anderson Harrison Foundation. Naming for the centers is pending approval by the Board of Visitors.

UVA President Jim Ryan announced the gift during the Thursday meeting of the Board of Visitors.

“The Harrison family’s incredibly generous commitments will provide robust support for UVA students and faculty and will help foster and coordinate important work on neurodegenerative disease,” Ryan said. “I’m deeply grateful to the Harrisons for their decades of giving to UVA and for their investments in key areas of the strategic plan. The impact of their giving will be felt on Grounds for generations to come.”

Speaking on behalf of the family, Marjorie Harrison Webb, president of the Harrison Foundation, said: “We are pleased to lend our support to two areas of the University that will increase opportunities for students and faculty to thrive. Student-athletes embody the full promise of a UVA education, while a research center devoted to the understanding and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases will allow UVA researchers to lead the way in the fight against these devastating illnesses.” 

The gift creating the research center will allow UVA to develop a national research program in Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases. Within the University’s research ecosystem, the center will create a nexus between the UVA Brain Institute, which encompasses all neurological research at the University, and the Manning Institute of Biotechnology, which will translate fundamental discoveries in health science into therapies for a broad range of illnesses.

The center’s aim is to enable physicians and scientists in the fields of Alzheimer’s, other dementias and neurodegenerative disorders to make their translational discoveries at UVA for the benefit of patients and families. The Harrison family’s gift will create the building blocks for this new research program by supplying support for faculty and other researchers and building out a collaborative research environment.

The three-fold plan includes $5 million to create the Harrison Family University Professorship in Neuroscience, which will enable the president, provost and CEO of UVA Health to recruit a preeminent scholar to lead the center. This portion of the funding is eligible for a dollar-for-dollar match from the University’s Bicentennial Professorships Fund for a total potential impact of $10 million.

An additional $5 million will go toward support for an additional endowed chair – the Harrison Family Professorship in Neurodegenerative Diseases – and postdoctoral fellows, staff and research support. Naming for the endowed chairs is pending approval by the Board.

Finally, $20 million of the gift will create a dedicated space for the research center within the Manning Institute building. Construction for this 350,000-square-foot research facility began in December 2023. By concentrating expertise across several disciplines, connecting UVA’s current investigators with new recruits to broaden research capacity and channeling discoveries into new translational therapies, the new space within the Manning Institute will enable UVA to expand the size and breadth of its program in the field of neurodegenerative diseases and raise its national profile.

“The Harrison family’s generous contribution underscores the importance of the neurosciences as an area of focus within the Paul and Diane Manning Institute of Biotechnology,” said Dr. K. Craig Kent, CEO of UVA Health and executive vice president for health affairs at UVA. “This funding enables UVA to continue to assemble a world-class team of researchers primed to deliver transformative breakthroughs in the neuroscience fields with advancements that will offer hope to millions of families impacted by Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases.”

The Virginia Athletics Master Plan encompasses a new complex that includes a Football Operations Center, the McCue Center renovation and an Olympic Sports Center that will provide support to more than 750 student-athletes, including UVA’s field hockey, cross country, track and field, lacrosse, rowing and soccer programs. It also includes the Center for Citizen Leaders and Sports Ethics, an initiative launched by Carla Williams, UVA’s athletics director and vice president for intercollegiate athletics, after she arrived at UVA in 2017.

“For decades, the generosity of the Harrison family has helped to shape the foundation and development of Virginia athletics,” Williams said. “Beginning with David A. Harrison III’s connection to and great affinity for Virginia football and carrying forward to this transformative gift that will benefit the entire sports program, we are extremely grateful for the Harrison family’s profound commitment to the University of Virginia. This gift ensures their legacy will continue to impact the University and Virginia Athletics for many generations.”

The Harrison family has a longstanding legacy of giving to the University. David Harrison was a lawyer, investment banker and farmer who earned his bachelor’s degree from the University in 1939 and his law degree in 1941. Harrison and his wife, Mary Anderson, directed their giving to many areas across the University – including the schools of Law and Medicine, the College and Graduate School of Arts & Sciences, and the University Library – during their lifetimes.

The couple’s giving has supported a wide range of professorships, scholarships and buildings at the University, including a gift to the library to create the Mary and David Harrison Institute of American History, Literature, and Culture. In addition, the Harrison Foundation provided most of the funding for the Harrison-Wood Professorship in Neurology at the Jefferson Scholars Foundation, created the Harrison Undergraduate Research Awards in the College, and created the David and Mary Harrison Distinguished Professorships of Law in the School of Law. Harrison Field at Scott Stadium and the Law School grounds are also named for David Harrison.

Through their family foundations, the Harrison children and grandchildren continue to direct a portion of David Harrison’s estate funds to support the University and other areas of interest within education, health and human services nationwide.

In 1935, the first woman athlete graced the box of the Breakfast of Champions. Pictured on a box of General Mills’ Wheaties, Olympian Babe Didrikson Zaharias smiles and holds a basketball ready to shoot.

She’d go on to even greater fame as a multisport athlete and co-founder of the Ladies Professional Golf Association. Yet the business of sport remained heavily skewed toward men. 

Nearly 90 years later, though, the economic landscape has changed significantly. Women's sports are on the rise, gaining more visibility, fans and TV money. That growing demand takes an interesting new step on Friday, when the first sports bar in the Midwest exclusively for women’s sports — and only the fourth in the nation —  opens in Minneapolis.

A Bar of Their Own timed its opening to next week’s Big Ten women’s basketball tournament in Minneapolis, which — thanks to University of Iowa phenom Caitlin Clark — will shatter attendance records. The conference says it expects a five-day total of more than 109,000 at Target Center, more than double the prior record, which was set last year.

MPR News is supported by Members. Gifts from individuals power everything you find here. Make a gift of any amount today to become a Member!

Clark’s presence packed Williams Arena Wednesday night at the University of Minnesota when the Hawkeyes took on the Gophers.

Observers see the bar launch as a natural response to  the growing economic muscle of women’s sports. The bar’s owner — who spent years walking into Twin Cities bars and pleading with the bartender to change the TV to women’s sports — hopes tapping into that momentum will sustain it.

“I jokingly say that every sports bar you walk into in the Twin Cities area is probably a men’s sports bar. We just don’t call it that,” owner Jillian Hiscock told MPR News.

Inside, photos of local and national athletic icons line the bar's walls, along with 12 televisions. There’s a signed poster from the Rockford Peaches — the Illinois women’s baseball team that inspired the movie “A League of Their Own” along with the bar name — signed jerseys and an LGBTQ+ pride flag.

“As a young kid, I didn’t even know that it was missing because I didn’t know what was available,” Hiscock said of the lack of visibility around women’s sports. “We have to make it easier for kids, and young women in particular, to be able to see themselves on television.” 

While it’s never easy to start a business, and there are a lot of sports in the Twin Cities, Hiscock believes there’s enough momentum for women’s sports now to sustain A Bar of Their Own.

Women’s sports are at a tipping point in a good way, says Cheryl Cooky, a Purdue University professor and sports sociologist who’s co-authored two books about society and women’s sports.

“The changes in the women’s sports landscape that we have witnessed in a very short period of time is exponential,” she said. “There are more opportunities for people to demonstrate their fandom and act on their interest in ways they haven’t had in the past.”

When spaces are created for women to be centered, she added, it can challenge the ways we think about gender in the game and how we see women in society. 

That became clear in St. Paul in January when more than 13,000 people came to watch Minnesota’s new Professional Women’s Hockey League team. It was a record for the most people ever to attend professional women’s hockey.

Last year the Minnesota Aurora soccer team quickly built a big fan base, averaging 5,000 fans per game and breaking attendance records at their home field, the Vikings' TCO stadium in Eagan. A sellout crowd of some 6,500 fans attended the final match. The success accelerated the team’s timeline to join a professional league and find investors.

The Minnesota Lynx have won multiple championships and maintain one of the strongest fan bases in the WNBA, a league that last year broke its prior records for viewership, attendance and digital engagement. 

Yet, the financial question still lingers around women’s sports in a way that it mostly doesn’t with men’s sports. Cooky said she often gets questions about the long-term financial health of women’s sports, but the money is there and growing.

For 2024, women’s sports are predicted to bring in $1.28 billion in revenue according to the Deloitte Sports Business Group, 300 percent higher than the last three years.

She would say she’s hopeful, but she doesn’t think A Bar of Their Own needs it. She is confident they will succeed.

“As a woman, it’s so rare to be in a social space and see yourself overtly centered in a way that is not misogynistic,” Cooky said. “That’s what these bars are doing. They are saying we see you. We recognize you. We value you and this is going to be a safe space”

Hiscock’s friends say that if anyone can pull off a women’s sports bar in the Twin Cities, it’s her. She went from announcing her plan on social media on Sept. 15 to opening the doors.

“When she said she was going to do this, my first reaction was ‘Oh, she’s gonna knock it out of the park.’ It was never an idea I thought would fall to the wayside. I knew she would see it through it from the beginning,” Jade Denson said.

Friday’s opening will be with the help of 30 staff members. Hiscock says she had the application live for about 36 hours when she had to close it because she got nearly 200 applications. 

“If you put us on TV, we’re going to show up and we’re going to consume,” said Kate Voss, a friend of Hiscock and loyal Lynx fan. 

“There is not anything I have seen a woman put her mind to that she is not going to accomplish,” she added. “If you’re not investing in women, what are you doing? Turn the channel to the women. We’ve been dominating for years.”

Nicole Lukic, head coach and sporting director for the Minnesota Aurora, feels the same way. Over the last three years she has learned how to sustain interest in women’s sports. And according to her, this is only the beginning. 

“When I was an athlete, opportunities to play beyond college were limited,” Lukic said. “Watching women on TV was very sparse — it’s taken off tremendously. I think it is only going to continue to get better for all women’s sports.”","{'href': 'https://www.mprnews.org', 'title': 'MPR News'}"

The Dallas Stars acquired defenseman Chris Tanev from the Calgary Flames on Wednesday night, the latest addition by a Stanley Cup contender in the Western Conference ahead of the March 8 NHL trade deadline.

Tanev, 34, gives the Stars some much-needed depth not only on the penalty kill but defensively 5-on-5 to try to get through the gauntlet that is the playoffs in the West.

Here are 5 things to know about the Stars’ newest acquisition:

Birthday: Dec. 20, 1989

Home: Toronto, Canada

Position: Defenseman

Ht./Wt.: 6-2, 193 pounds

Dallas sent a 2024 second-round pick, 20-year-old defense prospect Artem Grushnikov and a 2026 conditional third-rounder to Calgary for Tanev, who was considered one of the top trade candidates available.

The Flames are retaining half and New Jersey another quarter of Tanev’s $4.5 million salary as part of the deal, which also includes the Stars flipping a ‘26 fourth-round pick to the Devils for unsigned goaltending prospect Cole Brady.

Tanev spent a decade with the Vancouver Canucks before heading to Calgary. With Vancouver, he amassed over 500 games played, scoring 22 goals and 96 assists.

As a free agent, he signed 4-year, $18 million contract with the Flames in 2020.

Tanev is in the final season of that deal, and he’s averaging nearly 20 minutes of ice time this season and has a goal and 13 assists in 56 games.

Tanev has played in 121 regular season games in the past two season. He has scored two goals.

Both of those goals came against Dallas.

The Stars will hope that fun fact continues in games involving Victory Green now that Tanev will don the colors himself.

Tanev has two younger brothers. The middle child, Brandon, is a left-winger for the Seattle Kraken. His youngest brother, Kyle, has played in the Ontario Junior Hockey League and the Greater Ontario Junior Hockey League.

In a radio interview, Brandon commented on the siblings’ rivalry.

“It’s how we are with everything in life. We compete to beat each other, whether at the gym or at the golf course,” he said.

Chris and Brandon will next face each other when Dallas heads to Seattle on on March 30.

CAITLIN CLARK 

Sorry, record book writers: Caitlin Clark isn't slowing down. Under two weeks after breaking Kelsey Plum's NCAA women's scoring record, the Iowa superstar passed Lynette Woodard for most points in major-program women's college basketball history. 

It requires a bit of explanation: Woodard starred for Kansas from 1977-81, racking up 3,649 career points. However, the NCAA did not begin sponsoring women's basketball until 1982, so Woodard is nowhere to be found in NCAA record books; she played when the sport was under the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women. 

This has caused Woodard to go unfairly unrecognized for years, but Clark's excellence has helped shine some light on just how good Woodard was. When asked what she would say when Clark broke her record, Woodard responded, ""Hey, congratulations. Welcome to the party."" 

Now, it's happened. 

Clark passed Woodard's mark on a 3-pointer in the fourth quarter of the No. 6 Hawkeyes' 108-60 win over Minnesota. She finished with 33 points (on eight 3-pointers), 12 assists and 10 rebounds, meaning Woodard's scoring mark wasn't the only history she made: 

Clark is 18 points from passing Pete Maravich for most points in major-program college history, men's or women's. 

THE GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS 

Just as the Warriors were seemingly rounding into form and the healthiest they've been following Chris Paul's return, they've been dealt a tough blow. Andrew Wiggins is out indefinitely due to a personal matter. 

As always, any absence leads to a chain reaction. Here's who will need to step up, per Jack Maloney. 

Much like his predecessor Sam Darnold, Zach Wilson struggled in three seasons with the Jets after being a top-five pick ... now will likely be suiting up elsewhere. The Jets gave Wilson permission to seek a trade. Where he ends up and what the Jets receive in return are anyone's best guess. 

Since 2021, Wilson, 24, ranks last in passer rating, touchdown-to-interception ratio and completion percentage. But this isn't a ""bash Zach Wilson"" session -- he's had enough of that -- and his circumstances were far from perfect in the Big Apple. He has legit talent. There's a reason he was the No. 2 pick. Maybe a new home can bring that out. Cody Benjamin has five potential landing spots for Wilson, including ... 

Kansas is opening its checkbook, hoping to keep the coach leading the Jayhawks' football resurgence in Lawrence for the long term. Lance Leipold received a salary bump to over $7 million annually, putting him in the same neighborhood as Oklahoma State's Mike Gundy and Oklahoma's Brent Venables. Leipold's contract still runs through 2029. 

It continues the Jayhawks' recent investment in football, Will Backus writes. 

Listen, I love March Madness as much as anyone, but if we're going to have to wait one extra day for the best sports month (don't even try to argue), we might as well make the most of it. Here's a trip down Leap Day memory lane, courtesy of Austin Nivison, including ...

Four National Rugby League teams open their season Saturday night when the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles play the South Sydney Rabbitohs and the Sydney Roosters meet the Brisbane Broncos

Australia's National Rugby League Following NFL Model in Trying to Expand Its Footprint to the US

When deciding whether to try to expand its impact to the United States, Australia's National Rugby League used a distinctly American sport as a model.

LAS VEGAS (AP) — When Australia’s National Rugby League decided to try to expand its reach to the United States, it used a distinctly American sport as a model.

The NFL annually plays regular-season games in London, is in the midst of a four-year commitment to Germany and in September will make its mark in Brazil for the first time. The London games often sell out, and tickets were gone for last year's foray into Germany within 15 minutes.

Now it's the NRL taking its game abroad to the U.S., following through on a plan that first was discussed in 2020 as Australia and the rest of the world coped with the onset of COVID-19.

Four NRL teams will open their season Saturday night at Las Vegas’ Allegiant Stadium, which hosted the Super Bowl on Feb. 11. The games — the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles against the South Sydney Rabbitohs and then the Sydney Roosters versus the Brisbane Broncos — will be televised nationally in the U.S.

“A lot of us buy into the NFL back home and enjoy it and we want the same in America, to fall in love with our game,"" said Damien Cook, who plays for South Sydney. “We spoke to a couple of (club rugby) teams down in San Diego who started with four teams and now they've got 14, so it's definitely building over here. Hopefully, this game this weekend will give it a real good boost and America can love the game that we do so much.” 

The games Saturday are the first in a five-year deal to bring NRL teams to Las Vegas, with new clubs rotating in over the coming years.

“We see other big sports leagues around the world like the NFL looking at international growth and international expansion,” NRL CEO Andrew Abdo said. “For us, it's also multidimensional.”

Which, Abdo said, means the NRL is doing more than just playing the two games and going home. It's also was about organizing a series of events to help promote the league, including a two-day national club tournament and a Thursday night fan fest at the Fremont Street Experience in downtown Las Vegas.

The ultimate goal is to create a U.S. fan base and grow it similar to how the English Premier League has attracted a strong core of American supporters who follow teams such as Liverpool, Manchester United or Tottenham. 

To help achieve that aim, the NRL is first working on making inroads on the West Coast, largely because Saturday's game times come when Australians are awake Sunday. The four teams were sent to train and promote the league in three locations — Las Vegas, Los Angeles and San Diego — before they all gathered together this week in Nevada.

Oscar winner Russell Crowe, who grew up in Australia and is a co-owner of the Rabbitohs, narrated a five-minute YouTube video explaining the rules to American fans. The video has received 1.2 million views on X, formerly known as Twitter. It also is being used on TV broadcasts and on on-demand platforms.

""We think our sport, once Americans are exposed to it, they'll see our sport is something that they will follow in addition to all the American sports that they love,” Abdo said.

The NRL is wildly popular Down Under, and it risks alienating such rabid fans by playing regular-season games so far away in a country that until now hasn't shown wide interest in the sport. But Abdo said the feedback has been positive, and about 14,000 tickets were sold to Australian fans.

Three TV stations and two newspapers from Sydney also sent reporters to cover this event.

All four teams traveled last week to acclimate to the time difference, but it's not purely a business trip.

The teams have made this like a bowl trip for college football teams, taking in the sights in Las Vegas and Southern California. For Manly players, that included attending an NHL game between the Vegas Golden Knights and Toronto Maple Leafs, and Brisbane players watched an NBA game between the Los Angeles Lakers and San Antonio Spurs.

“It's really exciting for us,” said Reuben Garrick, who plays for Manly. “I think the U.S. loves their sport and we feel like we've got a really good brand to bring here. We want to show how exciting rugby league is and the NRL is, and we're really excited to play at Allegiant Stadium.”

He called his initial impression of Las Vegas as “larger than life. It's way bigger than anyone described it to us.""

Texas has long claimed everything is bigger there, and Brooks' teammate, Ethan Bullemor, came to understand that when he traveled to Dallas last year and attended a Red River Rivalry game between college football powers Texas and Oklahoma. He came away an unabashed Longhorns fan who cheers the team on from nearly 8,500 miles away.

“I think the way Americans do sport is just phenomenal,” Bullemor said. “They've got a huge population as well, which helps, and it's very state-based. I think it's a great opportunity for the game if we could begin to penetrate into the U.S. market and show them what our game's about. It's only going to grow our game even more and put it on a global stage and then strengthen it back in Australia.”

The 2024 NFL scouting combine is well underway in Indianapolis as workouts began on Thursday and continue through the weekend.

Defensive linemen and linebackers kicked the action off with some impressive performances from Penn State edge Chop Robinson (4.48-second 40-yard dash), Alabama edge Dallas Turner (4.46 40-yard dash, 40.5-inch vertical) and NC State linebacker Payton Wilson (4.43 40-yard dash).

Here's the schedule for the rest of the weekend (all times ET and broadcast on NFL Network):

Friday: Defensive backs/tight ends, 3 p.m.

Saturday: Quarterbacks/wide receivers/running backs, 1 p.m.

Sunday: Offensive line, 1 p.m.

Who will boost their stock? Who will run the fastest 40-yard dash? What will the storyline of this week at Lucas Oil Stadium be? Yahoo Sports is on the ground and bringing you live updates.

Florida State d-lineman Jared Verse lived up to his early first-round billing, according to the personnel buzz I heard in Indy. Yes, he struggled in the 3-cone, but Verse left a nice overall impression with his other drills. His skills and measurables are too hard to ignore.

There are different ways to fix an NFL offense. And while it’s too soon to say whether the Steelers, Falcons, both or neither turn around their attacks in 2024, it’s not too soon to acknowledge how different their offseason quarterback rhetoric is.

The Falcons’ Desmond Ridder ranked 27th in passer rating (83.4) last season while the Steelers’ Kenny Pickett ranked 28th (81.4). Atlanta has continued to hammer the need to bolster their quarterbacks room, general manager Terry Fontenot saying they it’s “critical to get that position right… we haven’t shied away from that.” New head coach Raheem Morris agreed in no uncertain terms: “If we had better quarterback play last year in Atlanta, I might not be standing here.”

Steelers general manager Omar Khan, meanwhile, pledged “full faith” in Pickett after a season which he said showed “obviously there were some issues with the offense.” Khan suggested the remedy would arrive via his new offensive coordinator, who is none other than … last year’s Falcons head coach Arthur Smith, the very man who oversaw Ridder’s shaky season.

The biggest question remaining: Who will quarterback Atlanta in 2024? Count Justin Fields among those eager for the answer.

Defensive backs and tight ends work out Friday beginning at 3 p.m. ET

Here's my look at which prospects to keep an eye out for in a loaded CB class

Standout performers of the day:

NC State LB Payton Wilson:

Dallas Turner's hot 4.47 run in the 40 got Arizona Cardinals GM Monti Ossenfort's attention. His excitement was briefly captured by the NFL Network camera. I can see Turner being in play at draft pick No. 4, where the Cardinals currently sit in Round 1, or an Arizona trade back.

(Sidenote: Coaches/GMs are rarely thrilled when caught expressing workout emotion.)

Well this was prescient on NC State LB Payton Wilson:

The QBs will take center stage at the combine later this week. But the chatter is already out there on a supposed ""slide"" for Carolina QB Drake Maye, a frontrunner for the No. 1 pick. Here's what I told Jason Fitz on the ""Inside Coverage"" podcast on the Zero Blitz Network:

""I just had lunch with a guy who has been one of [Maye's] biggest backers forever, who said he's going to be a top-two pick and he's been telling me this going on a year, and now he's saying, 'I don't know ... he might actually slide a bit.""

The Broncos appear to be exploring all options at quarterback, if those they're unlikely to attain:

— Zac Stevens (@ZacStevensDNVR) February 29, 2024

Yahoo Sports' Charles Robinson earlier this week had this assessment of Sean Payton and the Broncos:

The sense I get is the jury is still out on “second tier” quarterbacks like Michigan’s J.J. McCarthy and Oregon’s Bo Nix; they could both solidify their draft stock as first-round picks (albeit with varying ranges in Round 1) in the coming days and weeks. There’s also the lingering possibility that one player could slide in the process, possibly North Carolina’s Drake Maye, offering the Broncos an opportunity to make a move up from the No. 12 spot to get their next quarterback. And then there’s the outlying chance that Denver could make a staggering move from 12 into the top two or three picks, which would require a package of high draft picks and potentially a star player to get done.

Chop Robinson's 40-time officially upgraded to 4.48.

Penn State's Chop Robinson doesn't need to run again in Indy after his first attempt in the 40-yard dash.

Here's what our Nate Tice had to say about his 39th ranked overall prospect:

Robinson projects as more of a designated pass rusher-type who makes his living in passing situations, while treating run plays as intermissions until the next time he can get after the quarterback. Robinson is twitchy and explosive, he bursts at the snap of the ball and can quickly drive blockers back, with some auxiliary pass moves to help balance out his pass-rush arsenal. Robinson is neutral-at-best against the run, which limits how high I can put him, but he provides wildly different skills than other edge defenders in the same range. His “pass rush-first, second and third” style reminds me a bit of Yannick Ngakoue.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

The Daytona Beach News-Journal sports staff earned five awards in the 2023 APSE Sports contest with judging taking place in Orlando this past week.

News-Journal entries were judged as part of the C Division, made up of outlets with circulations between 10,000-24,000 and are around 250,000-750,000 monthly website visitors. Judging was performed by editors from around the country.

Prep sports writer Chris Boyle led the staff with two individual awards, one for his story on Mainland football's state championship game win in the Game Story category and another in the Explanatory category for his work on Bartram Trail's appeal to the FHSAA on a girls lacrosse NIL case.

Columnist Ken Willis picked up an award for Columns, a category in which four individual stories are submitted. Ken's chosen pieces included one on NASCAR being accused of racism toward white males, one on Taylor Swift/Kansas City Chiefs blowback, one on the dichotomy between a LIV Golf event and the Masters and finally, a column on NASCAR's foray into the streets of Chicago.

Sports editor Ryan Pritt earned a nod as well in the Long Feature category for his story on Shannon Jones, a two-time Daytona State cross country All-American who, at age 38, overcame major obstacles and hurdles to become one of the most unlikely distance-running success stories in the junior college ranks.

Finally, the entire sports staff, with the help of digital producer Dan Rorabaugh, was recognized for its work in covering the 2023 Daytona 500 with a nod in the Events Coverage category.

In each of those categories, 10 entries were designated as winners with a final order being decided in the coming weeks.

KILGORE — Ronnie Harrison broke open for a layup with 14 seconds left to put Navarro on top to stay as the Bulldogs escaped with a 67-65 win over the Kilgore College Rangers in Region XIV Conference action on Wednesday at Masters Gymnasium.

Kilgore led by nine early in the first half, but fell behind late in the half and trailed for most of the second half until taking a 59-58 lead with 3:56 left on a pair of Peter McKey free throws.

The final three minutes featured three lead changes and a tie.

McKey’s free throws gave Kilgore the lead for the first time since the 8:28 mark of the first half, but Navarro moved back on top a minute later with a layup from Harrison and extend the lead to 62-59 on two free throws from Jourdyn Grandberry.

Kilgore stormed back with two free throws from Cahmai Crosby to pull to within one, and then Cosby came up with a loose ball in the paint and converted a layup with 57 seconds left for a 63-63 Ranger lead.

Navarro answered with an old-fashioned 3-point play by Evan Smith, who scored, drew a foul and hit his bonus free throw, but two freebies from Crosby with 28 seconds left tied things at 65 apiece and set up Harrison’s late game-winner off an inbounds pass after a Ranger turnover.

A half-court prayer by McKey at the buzzer wasn’t answered, and the Rangers fell by a bucket.

Jamir Turner scored 15, and Crosby and McKey added 12 points apiece in the loss for Kilgore. Willie Williams added eight points, 11 rebounds, four assists and two blocks. KC Udolisa finished with six points, Jamil Muttilib five points, five rebounds and three assists, Ike Nwaobi five points and Kaleb Pouncy two points.

Harrison had 18 points and seven rebounds, Smith 14 points and Trae Clayton 10 points and 14 rebounds for Navarro.

The Rangers raced out to an 11-2 lead early, with five of the points coming from Turner. Two free throws by Nwaobi with 12:47 to play kept KC on top by nine (13-4, but Navarro stormed back and tied things at 15 apiece on a three-point play by Harrison with 8:49 left in the half.

The score was knotted at 18 with 8:05 to play, but a a dunk by Harrison and triple from Grandberry sparked a big run by the Bulldogs, who built a 33-26 cushion at the break.

The Rangers drop to 21-8 overall and 11-7 in the Region XIV Conference North Zone with one regular season game to play next Wednesday at Bossier Parish.

Navarro moves to 16-11 and 9-8 with the win.

Panola currently leads the North Zone at 14-3. Trinity Valley is second at 13-4, and KC is third.

Brainerd High School graduate Cole Smith scored his 8th goal of the season Thursday night to give the Nashville Predators a 2-1 lead over the Minnesota Wild at 10:48 of the first period in NHL action Thursday, Feb. 29.

Smith grabbed the puck after a turnover deep in the Minnesota end, battled between two Wild defenders and forced the puck past netminder Filip Gustavsson for an unassisted goal. It turned out to be the winning goal as Nashville won 6-1.

The 28-year-old Smith now has eight goals and 21 points this season for the Predators, who entered the game tied for the Wild Card playoff spot in the Western Conference with 68 points. Minnesota started the night trailing Nashville by six points for the final playoff position.

In Smith’s first full season in the NHL last year, the 2014 Brainerd graduate finished with four goals and 16 points in 69 games for the Predators.

King is described as 5′8″ and 200 pounds with brown eyes and grey hair. He was wearing a burgundy hoodie sweatshirt, khaki pants, black and white sneakers and was carrying a black winter jacket.

King has been a longtime fixture of Tucker High School sports and was at the school’s basketball game earlier in the night.

TRENDING STORIES:

“Bud has mental disabilities, does not own or operate a vehicle, no credit cards to check for any purchases to identify any normal activity, rides Marta buses to go to Tucker each day and back to his family home in Decatur,” his family wrote in a GoFundMe set up to help fund the search.

The community is gathering for a search for King at the Applebee’s on Memorial Drive near his family’s home on Thursday at 4 p.m.

[SIGN UP: WSB-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter]

“We’ve searched in person for him by driving through the streets, alleys, looking in the woods, under bridges, stopping in on local businesses asking for any leads, and checked with the hospitals, jail, and county coroner office,” his family wrote on GoFundMe.

Community members filled social media with posts about “Coach Bud.”

“He is from Tucker and has been Tucker High School’s biggest fan forever. I went to Tucker High and he was at every sporting event. He’s known and loved by all,” one Facebook user wrote.

DeKalb police is asking anyone who sees King to call 911 or SVU at 770-724-7710.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Jessica Gelman sharpened her basketball skills in pickup games at YMCAs growing up in suburban Chicago, rocking her black sneakers just like Michael Jordan and the rest of the Bulls. Sure, the future co-founder of the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference wanted to play like Jordan — and Gelman developed into the kind of Ivy League standout that saw her burst into a 1,000-point scorer and co-captain at Harvard — but her appreciation of his greatness stretched beyond the court.

Like Jordan, Gelman wanted to separate herself from the field.

“So I did a behind-the back dribble,” she said, laughing, “which was not a thing that girls did in the ’80s and ’90s.”

She tried to break barriers ever since, Gelman’s love of numbers and sports leading her to not only rub shoulders with some of the more notable thinkers, entrepreneurs, innovators and front office deal makers in the industry, but rise to become a prominent executive herself in the analytics movement. She teamed with Philadelphia 76ers President Daryl Morey to not only found Sloan, but guide it into the preeminent forum for number-crunchers — yes, the term “stat nerds” gets tossed around — all while fostering diversity and inclusion at all levels of sports, entertainment and beyond.

In some fashion, Sloan is Gelman’s professional behind-the-back dribble.




“Once I got into the business world, it was analytics,” she said. “It’s not necessarily what people were into. But there was a different way of engaging and being differentiated.”

The Sloan conference runs Friday and Saturday in Boston, having exploded from a one-day, on-campus affair in 2007 that attracted barely 200 people to the Super Bowl of Stats that will host a sold-out crowd of 2,500 people (plus a wait list) at a downtown convention center. 

“The rise of the conference in many ways has risen with the increasing adoption of analytics,” Gelman said. “While people are investing in analytics and want to be doing it, there’s so much more to go. We’re still in the very early days.”

Actor Rob McElhenney, Sue Bird and Megan Rapinoe are among the scores of celebrity heavyweights speaking on the main panel forums that will be livestreamed, in large part to drive education and offer a free alternative to a ticket price that tops $1,100.

Michael Rubin, the CEO of Fanatics, is a speaker this weekend on multiple Sloan panels, including one on sports disruptors — much like he believed has been Gelman’s role as she drives the discussion around sports and analytics

“I’ve just always been beyond impressed with her in both her strategic thinking and her ability to make an impact in so many parts of the business,” Rubin said. “It’s hard to start these things. I go there out of a respect for her because she puts such a special group of people together.”

MIT Sloan students help plan and run the conference — Rubin was among the business leaders who used Sloan as a networking and recruiting event.

“We didn’t conceive it would become this,” Gelman said.

A sampling of topics at Sloan include The Future of AI in Sports, David vs. Goliath: The Underdog Mindset, Investing in the Future of Women’s Sports Media and the Evolution of Basketball Analytics: 20 Years of Nerds, Data, & Efficiency.

“AI is obviously huge,” Gelman said. “I think most organizations at this point in time do not have the foundational data sets to truly use it in the right way. I don’t think organizations are using it for anything mission critical at this point in time because of needing better safeguards and guardrails.”

Gelman and Morey — who met when they taught a course at MIT Sloan on sports analytics — grew Sloan it into such a behemoth in the sports world that it hosted former President Barack Obama as the keynote speaker in 2018, all while trying to stay true to its roots as a leader in the role of sports analytics.

“There’s been an acceptance of analytics,” Gelman said, “but there’s still fear of it. I think people who want to understand it, they’re coming to the place where many analytics folks have kind of built their careers.”

Yes, analytics, a term that still draws derision from critics that haven’t fully grasped the statistical deep dive that has propelled numerous teams to championships — and changing sports from the field to the front office in ways not necessarily seen on the “Moneyball” big screen, such as through ticket purchases and fan engagement.

“Being mad about analytics is like being mad about gravity,” Morey said. “It’s the thing that pushes you toward winning, essentially. If the thing that pushes you toward winning, because of the rules, makes it more boring, that’s really nobody’s fault.”

Gelman, a minority partner in the Utah Royals of the National Women’s Soccer League, has played hardball with numbers since she earned an MBA from Harvard Business School and — after an overseas basketball career — worked for the Kraft family and the New England Patriots. She is the CEO of KAGR (Kraft Analytics Group) that uses data management and analytic approaches to engage customers and boost business operations for such companies as Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment and the NCAA.

“I think that data analytics, from my view of the world, is mostly powerful and provides more information than not,” Gelman said. “I would say, selfishly, as a woman in the industry has really enabled me to have a different voice, a different perspective that’s maybe not just, this is what I think because I’ve been doing this a very long time.”

Her rise as a power broker in strategic consulting and data management has been recognized across the sports landscape.

“If she didn’t work for the Krafts, I’d have her work for Fanatics,” Rubin said. “She’s super smart, super strategic, asks all the right questions and she has great relationship skills.”

Gelman said understanding analytics helps increase access for the often underrepresented populations in the industry. She said about 50% of the speakers last year at Sloan were women or minorities, a raised priority for the conference after it took some knocks in the past for its exorbitant ticket prices and male-dominated list of guests.

“I think it’s a passion for everyone who works on the conference,” Morey said. “It’s traditionally been very male. Actually, our minority is more gender than racial. Providing more opportunities for young women to break into sports analytics has been a big focus. We also look at racial diversity, as well, as a big focus. It used to be very, very, very — many very’s — percent men. Now, we’ve made a lot of progress there.”

Gelman, who lives with her wife and their two sons in the Boston area, hopes all kinds of young professionals that pass through Sloan this weekend can one day help level the playing field in all platforms of sports — from the business side to the front office to educational services to customer service.

Just like her playground dribble that took her to the pros, Gelman aims to use Sloan to shake up the sports industry.

“How do you get advantages? If everyone is doing something one way,” she said, “maybe you’ve got to go the opposite way.”

Top 3 Tight Ends at NFL Scouting Combine Bring Defensive Mentality to Draft

Darron Cummings

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Cade Stover plays tight end with a linebacker's ferociousness.

He's aggressive, relentless and willing to do whatever it takes to succeed. When other NFL draft prospects opted out of bowl games rather than risk injury, Stover defied his agents and bucked the trend by playing in the Cotton Bowl. And he'd prefer being paid in tractors rather than NIL cash.

This is how Stover views football — hard and tough with no place for those who'd rather turn down a challenge. See, he's still a defensive player at heart.

“They've asked if I'm capable of helping defensively and there's no doubt about it, I can help wherever you want me to help,” Stover said Thursday at the NFL's annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. ""I love playing tight end, but then again I'm there to do whatever we need to win a ballgame."" 

The truth is Ohio State wanted the 6-foot-4, 255-pounder to play linebacker. But once he arrived on campus, the Buckeyes started experimenting with other positions.

First, they tried him at defensive end. For spring football in 2020, he moved to tight end. In January 2022, with the Buckeyes depleted by injuries and opt-outs, they asked him to play linebacker and he had six tackles in a 48-45 Rose Bowl victory over Utah before finally finding his calling at tight end.

Over those final two seasons, Stover emerged as one of the most athletic and productive tight ends in school history and now he's one of the position's top three draft prospects.

Not everyone is as versatile as Stover. But Brock Bowers of Georgia, Ja'Tavion Sanders of Texas and Stover do have one thing in common — each was once considered a future defensive star.

Playing for winless Napa High School as a sophomore, Bowers was lightly recruited. He had only one FBS scholarship offer, Nevada, before one of his coaches fought hard for him to be included at a Nike camp. There, he was so good, the offers started pouring in, including one from Notre Dame to play linebacker.

Eventually, the Fighting Irish changed course and asked Bowers to play tight end. The problem for Notre Dame was that Bowers dreamed of playing football in the South and took advantage of his opportunity in 2021 when Darnell Washington was injured.

A year later, Bowers beat out Notre Dame star Michael Mayer for the John Mackey Award as the nation's best tight end and last season, despite his own battle with an ankle injury, he repeated as the Mackey Award winner.

Yes, he patterns his style after four-time Super Bowl champ Rob Gronkowski and, yes, the guy likely to be the first tight end selected in April's draft has drawn comparisons to George Kittle and Travis Kelce. Each of the three thrived after contact, and Bowers thinks he has a similar style.

“I feel like I’m yards after the catch and just being able to make people miss. Just turn good plays into great plays,” Bowers said. “You have to have a good relationship with the quarterback, build trust. That kind of comes through reps at practice, and I’ll try to work on that the first place I go.”

Sanders took a different path to the draft.

A two-sport athlete at Billy Runyan High School in Denton, Texas, he also was a prep star as a receiver and defensive end. How good was he? Sanders was a finalist for the 2020 Texas Mr. Football Award.

The Longhorns thought he could play both sides, too, so when he arrived on campus that's how he practiced. Things changed quick when Steve Sarkisian took the Texas job in 2021. 

He got his first big break in 2022 when Jahleel Billingsley, the Longhorns’ projected starter, was suspended for the first six games, and once Sanders had the job, he never let it go. Instead, he started breaking school records as he found a perfect fit at tight end.

“Coming off that big national championship win (for Alabama where Sarkisian was the offensive coordinator before going to Texas), I knew I was too big to be a wide receiver in his offense,"" Sanders said. “But I was just big enough to be a tight end, so I knew I was going to be a tight end.”

And does that defensive moniker still fit? Well, Sanders said he's aware defenders are wary of the spin move he once used to bother quarterbacks.

Stover, who spent his teenage years bailing hay and raising cattle on his parents' Ohio farm, is far from a finished product, too. And with his mentality, Stover could make one team a big winner come draft weekend.

“I don't think you can measure what's inside of me, I don't think you can measure the kind of person I am, and I don't think you can measure how good of a football player I can be because I'm just scratching the surface,” said Stover, who intends to work out this weekend. “I'm going to do everything you want me to do, exactly how it should be done, every single time with everything I've got.”

KILGORE — Kayla Hampton led the way with 22 points, and the Kilgore College Lady Rangers kept pace in the Region XIV Conference race with an 86-45 win over Jacksonville College on Wednesday at Masters Gymnasium.

The win moved Kilgore to 17-10 overall and 10-3 in conference play heading into Saturday’s home skirmish (2 p.m.) against Trinity Valley. Angelina leads the league race at 11-3, and Kilgore and TVCC are both 10-3 followed closely by Blinn at 10-4.

Jacksonville drops to 2-23 and 0-13 with the loss.

Hampton also collected nine rebounds for Kilgore on Wednesday. Nyla Inmon just missed recording a triple-double, finishing with 17 points, 10 assists, nine steals and five rebounds. Perina Lieme added 12 points, four rebounds and three assists, Jazmyn Sostand nine points and four rebounds, Lucy Henderson eight points, Erin Love seven points and two blocks, Jordan Wright four points, Jarahle Daniels three points and Nakiyah Allen and Mercy Wamet two points apiece.

Chidera Exeilo had 17 points and 11 rebounds and Grace Okih 11 points and 10 rebounds in the loss for Jacksonvville.

Kilgore trailed only briefly in the contest, but had trouble putting the Lady Jaguars away until after halftime.

Three straight buckets from Hampton and a layup from Sostand in the span of two minutes in the first quarter turned a 5-2 deficit into a 12-5 lead, and the Lady Rangers led 18-13 after one quarter when Henderson closed out the period with a layup.

The lead hit 11 with 6:04 left in the half after Love scored off a dish from Inmon and Pieme followed wit ha layup, and a Hampton steal and coast-to-coast layup by Hampton extended KC’s lead to 31-23 at the break.

Lieme drilled a 3-pointer to open the second half, and the rout was on.

Hampton scored back-to-back hoops on a short jumper and another steal an layup, and the Love did the same with a couple of layups that pushed the Lady Ranger lead to 20 (51-31) with 3:06 left in the third quarter.

Henderson’s layup with 25 seconds left gave Kilgore a 55-38 lead heading to the final stanza, and KC scored the first six points of the fourth quarter during a 15-2 run that ended the competitive portion of the contest.

Kilgore outscored Jacksonville 36-14 in points off turnovers and 48-24 in the paint.

The Rio Rico Hawks and Nogales Apaches put so many runners on base and scored so many runs on Tuesday, they weren’t able to finish their game before it got dark.

As a result, their softball matchup at NHS was initially suspended after four innings, with the idea it would be completed at a later date. The next day, however, the schools agreed to award the victory to Rio Rico, who led 23-13 in a game that saw the Hawks draw 22 walks and the Apaches bang out 17 hits.

Ayleen Lira of Nogales snares a fly ball in center field.

The scoring barrage began in the top of the first, when Rio Rico tallied eight runs on eight walks, a hit batter, an error and an infield single by Kenia Navarro. Nogales responded in the bottom half with two runs on RBI singles by Eliana Acevedo and Natalia Rosas.

After the Hawks went down without scoring in the top of the second, the Apaches erupted for nine hits and seven runs in the bottom of the frame to take a 9-8 lead. Big hits in the inning included a two-run triple by Acevedo and a double by Ximena Barnett.

Annika Padilla pitches for Rio Rico.

Nogales once again kept Rio Rico off the board in the top of the third. NHS shortstop Kayla Martinez started the inning by snaring a hard ground ball and throwing to first for the out. Then, after a walk, Martinez caught a pop-up and threw to Stacey Barnett at first to double off the runner.

The Apaches tacked on three more runs in the bottom of the third. Nevali Mendoza led off with a single, Ayleen Lira followed with a double and Acevedo drove them both home with another double. Emma Vejar then singled Acevedo home, making the score 12-8 in favor of Nogales.

Eliana Acevedo of Nogales turns to throw to first after fielding a bunt by Rio Rico’s Vanessa Martinez.

The Hawks escaped further damage when pitcher Annika Padilla got the third out of the inning on a bases-loaded strikeout.

Then came the top of the fourth, when Rio Rico sent 20 batters to the plate and scored 15 runs. Micheel Mada had a bunt single and a double in the inning, and Kiana Garcilazo reached base three times in the frame – twice on walks and once on a two-run double. Samantha Alcantar had a single, a walk and three RBIs, and Padilla added a run-scoring hit in an inning that also saw the Hawks draw 11 bases on balls.

Kiana Garzilazo drops her bat and heads to first after drawing one of the Hawks’ 20-plus walks.

The Apaches scored once more in the bottom of the fourth on a sacrifice fly by Vejar.

By the time the fourth inning was over, it was too dark to continue. Since the teams hadn’t completed five innings, the umpires couldn’t immediately award Rio Rico a win by the 10-run rule. As a result, the game was suspended until the schools agreed Wednesday to give the win to the Hawks.

For Nogales, it was their second loss of the regular season after falling at Sahuarita on Monday. The Apaches previously went 1-2 in the Owl Softball Kickoff Classic, a preseason tournament held Feb. 23-24 at Agua Fria High School in Avondale.

Nogales shortstop Kayla Martinez catches a pop-up as Rio Rico baserunner Jess Tapia turns and tries to get back to first base.

The Hawks improved to 1-2 after dropping their regular season opener on Feb. 21 at Tanque Verde, then losing at Sunnyside on Monday. They’re scheduled to play their home opener on Friday, March 1, against AZ College Prep starting at 3:45 p.m.

Spain’s women’s soccer team is finally getting attention for its play on the field, rather than the behavior of its officials

Spain Women Celebrate Another Soccer Title. This Time Without the Distractions

MADRID (AP) — Spain’s women’s soccer team is finally getting attention for its play on the field, rather than the behavior of its officials.

Spain followed up its Women’s World Cup title in August with victory in the inaugural Women’s Nations League on Wednesday, and this time the talk in Spain is about the great performances of the team and not about an unwanted kiss that ruined the team’s World Cup celebrations.

The kiss by former soccer federation president Luis Rubiales on the lips of player Jenni Hermoso during the World Cup awards ceremony sparked widespread outrage in Spain and ignited one of the sport’s worst crises. Rubiales eventually resigned, and prosecutors later accused him of sexual assault.

The scandal overshadowed the team’s performances and its historic achievement in what was only its third World Cup appearance.

There was no controversy this time after another big victory, only praise for the women who triumphed again and were finally being recognized for their talent, not their fight against sexism or lack of equality.

“Invincible,” said the sports daily Marca in one of the many front-page headlines featuring the women’s national team on Thursday, both on the sports and general news dailies.

The team was officially welcomed by Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez in Madrid, where captain Irene Paredes reiterated calls for more support for women’s sports.

“I take this opportunity to talk about the need to support women’s sports with more than just words,” she said. “We need laws that protect us and help us.”

On the field, Paredes and her teammates were drawing comparisons to some of the great players who helped Spain thrive in men's soccer for many years, including some of those who led “La Roja” to consecutive titles in the 2008 European Championship, the 2010 World Cup and the 2012 Euro.

Many local sports pundits were quick to make the link between the women’s team’s success to those achieved by Xavi Hernández, Andrés Iniesta and Sergio Busquets.

France coach Hervé Renard made the same connection after his squad was overwhelmed by the Spaniards on Wednesday.

“I played against Spain while coaching Morocco in 2018, against a midfield with Iniesta and Busquets, and it was the same feeling,” he said.

The 2-0 win over France came in front of a record crowd of 32,657 at La Cartuja Stadium in Seville, the largest ever to watch Spain's women's national team in the country.

“For us it’s a pleasure to be able to win trophies here in front of our fans, to feel their support and I think it goes further than that — this is proving that women’s football is the future,” Hermoso said.

By reaching the Nations League final, the Spanish women also secured their sport at the Paris Games for what will be its first-ever participation in the Olympics, when it will try to build on its momentum.

“It will be an honor to welcome you here again with a medal after the Games,” Sánchez said.

FARGO, N.D. (Valley News Live) - Dakota Fusion FC is a known quantity in the soccer arena. Their men’s teams compete in the National Premier Soccer League, and the women’s compete in the Women’s Premier Soccer League. Both are amateur squads that generally only go as far as to pay for a player’s room and board.

That could be changing in a few short years.

Last week, Dakota Fusion announced they’ve submitted a Letter of Intent to the fledgling WPSL Pro. If all goes to plan, Fargo-Moorhead will have a women’s professional sports team by 2026.

“By bringing this to the Fargo-Moorhead area, we’re putting Fargo on the map,” said Director of Operations Beth Garten. “We’re bringing a higher level of play for women in the area.”

There are still hurdles to clear before this dream becomes a reality, but the Dakota Fusion brass isn’t afraid to dream big.

Owner and General Manager Sajid Ghauri founded the organization with the original goal of providing quality instruction to the area’s soccer-playing youth. He feels that raising the level of play -- alongside a true professional squad for children to look up to -- could pay off on the grandest stage.

“A kid from Fargo, North Dakota playing for the national team,” he declared. “That’s what the goal is.”

Sting vs. The Undertaker. It ranks among the greatest unfulfilled dream matches in pro wrestling, joining legendary what-ifs like ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin vs. Hulk Hogan and Shawn Michaels vs. The Rock.

Sting and Undertaker were tailor-made for each other. A meeting of fabled characters steeped in mystique. A once-in-a-lifetime battle between two of professional wrestling's most enduring gimmicks. A celebration of the industry's most respected performers.

""I think if it was done right, it could have been a night, for sure, everyone would remember and never forget,"" Sting told CBS  Sports ahead of his retirement match at AEW Revolution on March 3. ""They would be talking about it to this day. But it just was not  going to happen.""  

Sting is a poster child for the alternative: from NWA and WCW to TNA and AEW. The iconic wrestler had previously received feelers from WWE but turned them down to protect his character. It took nearly 30 years for Sting to debut in WWE. A desire to book the match he and fans yearned for finally swayed Sting.

""I thought, 'Well, maybe if I get my foot in the door, we'll see what happens.' So I got my foot in the door,"" Sting said. ""We did a WrestleMania with Triple H and then Vince called and said, 'Hey, I want you to have a world title match with Seth. Would you be willing to do that?' 'Yeah, I'd be willing to do that.' Still, in hopes that somehow I could get in there with Taker.""

But the match never came to be. Sting was signed with WWE from 2014 to 2020. The Undertaker retired after defeating AJ Styles in a Boneyard match at WrestleMania 36 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sting's swan song will take place alongside Darby Allin in an AEW tag team title match against The Young Bucks. Wrestling retirements rarely stick, but Sting and Undertaker are up in age with Sting at 64 and Undertaker at 58.

""I had so many ideas over the years,"" Sting said. ""A lot of times, smoke and mirrors aren't good things. But in our situation, I think with his gimmick and the mystiques of his character and mine, we couldn't have enough smoke and mirrors. I think it definitely would have been a night that people remembered. Man, I would have loved to have seen that. 

""If I could have had that match alone, I would have been great. I wouldn't have had to do anything else.""

ATLANTA – February 29, 2024 – Monumental Sports & Entertainment (MSE), one of America’s leading sports and entertainment families, has chosen Synamedia’s Video Network solutions to distribute high-value sports content, along with other programming, to its newly launched Monumental Sports Network (recently acquired from Comcast/NBC Universal). MSE, which owns the broadcast rights in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area for the NHL’s Washington Capitals, NBA’s Washington Wizards, and WNBA’s Washington Mystics, launched Monumental Sports Network to give their loyal viewers a revamped way to watch their favorite games, athletes and other related content. 

Recently awarded for its network’s transformation into a state-of-the-art digitally focused media platform, MSE was steadfast in its search for a smart and forward-looking partner with a proven portfolio to future-proof its broadcasting ecosystem. They needed technology that could be integrated quickly and accurately into their media distribution platform, supporting their ambitious network launch plans. They ultimately selected Synamedia’s PowerVu technology for their primary distribution needs, based on Synamedia’s proven track record.  

Synamedia’s portfolio helps broadcasters, content owners and streamers push sports technology to its limits, anticipating future demands for flexibility, scalability, and quality of experience. The Synamedia PowerVu endpoint is designed to support high-efficiency video coding (HEVC) and ultra high-definition delivery over satellite and IP terrestrial content distribution networks, thereby preparing Synamedia’s customers for the transition to IP delivery. This technology is ideal for network expansions – like the one Monumental Sports Network is undergoing – due to its flexibility and compatibility. It can be configured either as a single-stream receiver for decoding to baseband analog/digital video, or as a multi-stream variant for bulk decryption and high-density transcoding applications. 

“We initially chose Synamedia for its proven solutions and established leadership in the market,” said Charlie Myers, Chief Technology Officer at Monumental Sports. “But not only are they helping solve our challenges today, they are preparing us for future growth. As technology evolves, we’ll still be able to leverage Synamedia’s solution, as it’s fully compatible for IP distribution and its ease-of-use was incredibly important for our fast-paced growth plans. We are looking forward to exploring how both our new network and relationship with Synamedia will continue to evolve.” 

“We’re thrilled to partner with MSE, a visionary sports organization, on their journey to expand the many ways they deliver exceptional viewing experiences to fans of the NHL’s Washington Capitals, NBA’s Washington Wizards and WNBA’s Washington Mystics games,” said Julien Signes, General Manager, Video Network, Synamedia. “The PowerVu technology is a no-brainer for regional sports broadcasting, as it prepares industry conglomerates for a smooth transition to the cloud and provides them with a trusted tool for expansion.” 

Monumental Sports Network’s linear channel is available today at the same channel number where NBC Sports Washington was formerly found via Comcast/Xfinity, Cox, DirecTV, FuboTV, Hulu, Mediacom, Optimum, RCN or Spectrum, Verizon, YouTube TV, or other distributors’ websites.

Sports betting will become legal in North Carolina beginning March 11. TV and radio are already flooded with advertisements for companies vying for gamblers' business.

Thursday, the North Carolina State Lottery Commission issued seven licenses to companies allowed to operate online sportsbooks. The names are already familiar to anyone who's heard or seen the ads: FanDuel, BETMGM, DraftKings, Fanatics, ESPN BET and Underdog Sports.

“Issuing the first interactive sports wagering operator licenses today represents a major milestone in establishing legal sports betting in North Carolina,” said Ripley Rand, chair of the North Carolina State Lottery Commission.

People 21 and older can start registering for the betting accounts at noon on Friday.

“We’re just 11 days away from the start of sports betting in North Carolina and we will be working every day between now and then to see that our launch is a successful one,” Rand said.

The newly legalized sports betting companies will start taking bets through mobile phones and other devices on March 11. The law passed last year will also allow for brick-and-mortar sportsbooks to be established near professional sports venues, like the PNC Arena in Raleigh and the Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte.

The companies issued sports wagering licenses are:

The lottery commission said it received nine applications for interactive sports wagering licenses. Commissioners expect to approve licenses for more companies, the commission said.","{'href': 'https://spectrumlocalnews.com', 'title': 'Spectrum News'}"

Bournemouth can help ensure its safety stock by sending Burnley closer to the brink in a Sunday morning scrap at Turf Moor.

The Cherries are mired in a second long slump of the season but have largely steered clear of the relegation scrap by accumulating 19 of its 28 points during a seven-game unbeaten streak late in 2023.

Bournemouth enter the weekend eight points clear of 18th-place Luton Town and have a match-in-hand on Everton, Brentford, Nottingham Forest, Burnley, and Sheffield United.

Burnley sit 19th with 13 points and matches like this will have been circled in red. The Clarets have three home matches left with clubs who are or can be dragged in the relegation fight, starting with this one. Brentford and Nottingham Forest visit, while Burnley go to Everton and Sheffield United.

Who will finish the Cherries' chances if Dominic Solanke and Enes Unal miss out on the game? Antoine Semenyo, Luis Sinisterra, Dango Ouattara, and Justin Kluivert will be in focus.

Apple Sports is everything you expect from a first-party iOS app in terms of design and usability. It’s rapid, intuitive, and aesthetically pleasing, but it’s also threadbare in terms of functionality and does little to stand out in a crowded marketplace.

Live score applications were some of the first apps available when the App Store first launched in 2008 – and most broadcasters and rights holders offer live scores as part of their wider offerings.

But this is Apple. While superior and competing apps exist on the App Store for everything from email and messaging to music and podcasts, many iOS users continue to use the company’s first-party applications by default.

With an active user base in the hundreds of millions, Apple Sports becomes an important channel for the industry by default and should the company decide to bid for more live broadcast rights, it can promise prospective partners greater exposure. Indeed, MLS receives top billing at launch.

It’s hard to interpret the launch of Apple Sports as anything but a placeholder and it is probable more functionality will be added over the coming months and years. Apple wants its devices and services to become the hub for our digital lives, whether it’s news, audio, video, fitness or gaming.

Sport is the next frontier in that ambition. By making the native experience as optimal as possible, the company hopes to retain and attract as many consumers in its digital ecosystem, driving hardware and software sales for years to come.

If rights holders and broadcasters optimise their experiences for Apple’s ecosystem, then sports fans are more likely to buy Apple hardware and subscribe to its digital services.

The likes of the NBA and MLB, both of which have been enthusiastic supporters of Apple in the past, might double down on their commitment – even if they don’t enter formal rights agreements. There has been plenty of speculation that ESPN wants to serve as an aggregator for the sporting world, potentially by partnering with a tech or telecoms company, but what’s to stop Apple performing that same role?

Behind the almighty iPhone, services is now by far the technology giant’s second biggest revenue category and the segment has almost doubled in size since 2019. It is unlikely that Apple Sports will add greatly to that income from the consumer end unless the company starts taking a cut from subscriptions made via the app. But, as an aggregator, there could certainly be some B2B revenue benefits if leagues or teams wanted to plug their digital broadcast via a sports platform that will be in the pockets of billions of people worldwide.

A Daily SportsLine Betting Podcast



NFL Draft is coming up!


 Only two more quarters stand between the Nuggets and the  win they were favored to collect coming into this  evening. Sitting on a score of  56-51, they have looked like the better team, but there's still two more quarters to play.

 The Nuggets entered the  matchup having won four straight and they're just two quarters away from another. Will they make it five, or will the Heat step up and spoil it? We'll know soon.



Miami Heat @ Denver Nuggets

Current Records: Miami 33-25, Denver 40-19

 The Nuggets are 9-1 against the Heat since April of 2021, and they'll have a chance to extend that success  on Thursday. Having just played yesterday, the Denver Nuggets will get right back to it and host the Miami Heat at 10:00  p.m.  ET on February 29th at Ball Arena. Each of these teams will be fighting to keep a win streak alive as the Nuggets come in on four and the Heat on five.

 Winning is just a little bit easier when  your shooting is a whole 13.5% better than the opposition, a fact the Nuggets proved  on Wednesday. Everything went their way against Sacramento as Denver made off with a  117-96 win. The Nuggets were down  47-32 with 8:00 left in the second  quarter but they still came back for the handy 21-point  win.

 The Nuggets got their  victory on the backs of several key players, but it was  Jamal Murray out in front who  scored 32 points along with six  assists. Murray continues to roll, besting his previous point total in each of the last three games he's  played. Another player making a difference was  Nikola Jokic, who  dropped  a triple-double on 14 points, 14  rebounds, and 11  assists.

 Meanwhile,  the defenses reigned supreme when the Heat and the Trail Blazers played on Tuesday, rewarding bettors who took the risk on the low 212.5-point over/under. Miami walked away with  a   106-96  victory over the Trail Blazers. The Heat were down  22-7 with 3:56 left in the first  quarter but they still came back for the handy ten-point  win.

 The Heat can attribute much of their success to  Jimmy Butler, who  almost  dropped  a double-double on 22 points and nine  assists. Butler has been hot recently, having posted three or more  steals the last four times he's  played.

 Denver's victory bumped their record up to 40-19. As for Miami, they pushed their record up to 33-25 with that  victory, which was their sixth straight  on the road.

This contest  is one where the number of possessions is likely to be a big factor:  The Nuggets  haven't given up the ball easily this season,  having  only  averaged 11.8  turnovers per game (they're ranked fourth in  turnovers per game overall). However, it's not like the Heat struggle in that department as   they've been averaging  only 12.3  turnovers per game. Given these competing strengths, it'll be interesting to see how their clash plays out.

 The Nuggets and the Heat pleased both fans and bettors in their last  games by winning and covering the spread. Looking ahead, the Nuggets are the favorite in this one, as the experts expect to see them win by 4.5  points. Miami might be worth a quick bet  since they've covered the spread the last eight times they've played.



Denver is a 4.5-point favorite against Miami, according to the latest NBA odds.

The oddsmakers had a good feel for the line for this one, as the game opened with the Nuggets as a 5.5-point favorite.

The over/under is 214  points.

Denver has won 9 out of their last 10 games against Miami.

Bears insider gives insight into potential Justin Fields trade asking price originally appeared on NBC Sports Boston

The best option for the New England Patriots in their search for a franchise quarterback is selecting one with the No. 3 pick in the 2024 NFL Draft.

They are guaranteed to get one of the top-tier quarterback prospects in this year's class -- USC's Caleb Williams, UNC's Drake Maye or LSU's Jayden Daniels.

But there are other paths to finding a franchise QB. One of them is through the trade market, where Chicago Bears quarterback Justin Fields might be available.

What would the asking price be for Fields?

ESPN's Bears reporter Courtney Cronin joined Phil Perry on a new episode of NBC Sports Boston's Next Pats Podcast to discuss that topic and much more.

""It sounds like a second- to third-round pick is the absolute starting point for Justin Fields,"" Cronin said. ""I know the idea has been floated out there that maybe they could get a first-round pick for Justin. They're not getting New England's first-round pick for Justin Fields, but that second-round pick, (the Bears) have a void right there because they sent theirs, which was the 40th overall pick, to the Washington Commanders in exchange for Montez Sweat.

""They need to bridge that gap because they go from No. 1, to No. 9 to No. 78. There's a lot of good players that would be off the board by the time that they get there in the third round. So recouping that draft capital is where all the conversations have to start when it comes to (Bears GM) Ryan Poles and potential teams that are looking for Justin Fields.""

The Patriots, at least from a draft pick standpoint, are the type of team the Bears should want to make a trade with because their second- and third-round picks are near the top of those rounds. New England owns the second overall pick in Round 2 (No. 34) and the fourth overall selection in Round 3 (No. 68).

The real question is whether Fields is worth giving up a high second- or third-round pick. Does he have the potential to be a franchise quarterback?

""I think he has the tools,"" Cronin said. ""You can win with Justin Fields, and every team will have a different viewpoint of, 'Can we be the people who get the most out of him?' And sometimes there's a level of arrogance about that in the NFL that because it didn't work here, it's going to work here.

""There are things he needs to do in his game that he has to clean up. The situational football that (Bears head coach) Matt Eberflus talked about yesterday when he was asked, 'Now that you've done this for a few years, what do you look for when you evaluate a quarterback?' And a lot of it actually kind of spoke to things that Justin struggled with, the third downs, the end-of-half situations, a two-minute drive, turnovers in the fourth quarter.

""Those are things that have been with Justin over the last couple of years. Now, did he get better in those areas? Yes, but there still is that giant question mark. And I remember I had one general manager tell me this as I was writing a piece on the conundrum the Bears face, is that if there's indecision, that's a decision. You already know if you don't have clarity, then you do have clarity on the quarterback situation if you are the Bears sitting on the No. 1 overall pick.""

The Patriots saw plenty of end-of-half struggles, third-down issues and fourth-quarter turnovers from their quarterbacks last season. It's one of the reasons why they sunk to last place in the AFC with a 4-13 record.

Fields has tremendous talent, but the top-tier quarterbacks who will be available to the Patriots with the No. 3 overall pick in the first round are all better talents than the Bears QB. Fields also would be due for an extension after the 2024 season, which would be expensive. Drafting a quarterback and paying him on a rookie contract for five years would allow the Patriots to spend valuable salary cap space on other roster weaknesses.

If the price drops on Fields, maybe the Patriots should consider it. But if the ask from the Bears is a high second- or third-round pick, the Patriots would be wise to walk away.

INDIANAPOLIS — A poll of 1,706 NFL players again produced some eyebrow-raising highlights and lowlights for franchises across the league this week, as the NFL Players Association released their second annual club report cards on workplace conditions.

Grading across a band of 11 categories — including a new look into head-coach job performance and willingness of club owners to invest in facilities — the report cards again focused an internal light on how players view the workplace inside their franchises. The union repeatedly stressed that the report cards are not perceived to have a correlation to wins and losses on the field. Instead, the aim was to judge the experience of what it’s like to work inside each player’s respective team.

Per @NFLPA report cards, where players graded owners, coaches, teams on working conditions:#1 Team: @Dolphins#32 Team: @Commanders#1 Coach: Andy Reid#32 Coach: Josh McDaniels#1 Owner: Stephen Ross#32 Owner: Clark Hunt(Facilities investment was massive in owner grades.)

— Charles Robinson (@CharlesRobinson) February 28, 2024

That said, the report provided predictable grades and continuing anomalies when compared to the NFL's most and least successful franchises. Among them:

The Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs were ranked 31st overall (after 29th last year) in a compilation of the weighted categories. The Chiefs scored a D+ or lower in a stunning seven aspects, including treatment of families (D+); training room and team travel (both Ds); nutritionist/dietician, locker room and training staff (all Fs); and a league-worst score in ownership (F-). The ownership score was based on a commitment to invest in facilities. According to the NFLPA, players criticized team owner Clark Hunt for a failure to renovate the team’s locker room following the 2022 Super Bowl-winning season.

Carolina owner David Tepper, the league's most-scrutinized owner by a wide margin, is unsurprisingly unpopular in his own building. Tepper received a D grade and scored 6.6/10, which was 28th in the league. The main issue, the report sites, was his choice to change the playing surface at Bank of America Stadium to an artificial surface despite the players unanimously wanting to play on natural grass.

The top five group of overall scores went to (in order of score) the Miami Dolphins, Minnesota Vikings, Green Bay Packers, Philadelphia Eagles and Jacksonville Jaguars. The bottom five ranked from 28th to 32nd overall, were the Pittsburgh Steelers, New England Patriots, Los Angeles Chargers, Chiefs and Washington Commanders.

Andy Reid was ranked the top coach in his job performance category with an A+. Former Las Vegas Raiders head coach Josh McDaniels finished at the bottom of the league, ranked 32nd and with a score of D. Philadelphia Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni received an A and was lauded for his willingness to listen to the locker room. That's interesting given how their 10-1 start quickly cratered, resulting in coaching shakeups. A possible explanation is that the survey closed in mid-November when the team was 8-1, coming off of a win over the Cowboys and their bye week.

In Bill Belichick's final season with New England, the Patriots ranked 29th, falling four spots from last year's report. The union's report noted that the Patriots are one of 12 teams that don't provide a family room during gamedays and one of seven clubs that don't provide daycare support on gamedays. ""The Patriots are the only team in the NFL with a majority of players feeling that their team’s facility is worse than places they could train offsite,"" the NFLPA's report stated. The club's weight room got the worst marks in the league. Belichick got a B- grade, ranking 27th among head coaches.

The biggest jump in the rankings went to the Jaguars, who were infamously outed in last year’s survey as having a rat infestation in their previous practice facility. That rodent problem played a part to tanking the Jaguars' overall grade to 28th during the 2022 season. With a new practice facility opened and multiple other categories improving, the Jaguars soared up the overall rankings to fifth in the 2023 season.

The Washington Commanders didn't see any overall improvement despite new ownership in 2023. The Commanders finished 32nd overall in the rankings for the second straight year and had a league-worst F- in three different categories, including locker room, training room and treatment of families.

The Arizona Cardinals saw a small bump in the rankings in what appeared to be a direct response to the NFPLA’s report card one year ago. During this year’s survey, players noted that the team began offering daycare and a small family room, and halted its practice of charging players for dinner during the week. That earned Arizona a modest bump from 31st overall in the rankings to 27th.

Two financial nuggets that stood out, given that they are tied to billion-dollar franchises: The Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who finished 24th overall, charged non-starting players with less than four years of experience a fee of $1,750 if they wanted to opt out of having a roommate in their hotel room prior to games. And the Chargers offered a discount on gameday daycare services: $75 for the first child and $50 for each additional child.

Overall, the NFLPA’s leadership of president J.C. Tretter and executive director Lloyd Howell said there was some overall improvement across the league in a range of categories. That indicated to the union that teams were responding to last year’s report card, which was the first of its kind in polling players on their perception of workplace conditions.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

NFL Draft is coming up!


Golden State Warriors guard Klay Thompson – four-time champion, five-time All-Star, gold medalist at both the Olympics and the FIBA World Cup, and future Hall of Famer – seems to be adjusting to his sixth-man role just fine. He exploded for 35 points in his first game off the bench since his rookie season, and over his past two games, he scored a total of 48 points in 58 minutes on 16-for-31 shooting (and 11-for-24 shooting from deep).  

""Just being able to still be out there playing with these guys, that in itself is amazing,"" Thompson told ESPN's Kendra Andrews. ""It's been a season of evolution."" 

This is as healthy an attitude as the Warriors' coaching staff could have hoped for when they made the change two weeks ago. That doesn't mean, however, that Thompson welcomed it.

From ESPN: 

Thompson initially didn't take the news well. Kerr told ESPN that Thompson yelled at him and some of the assistants. Later, he came back to apologize to the coaches. 	

""It was not an easy conversation,"" Kerr said. ""This is maybe the hardest part about getting further away from our prime. It's just, after 12 years [of Thompson starting], it wasn't easy.

""And still moving forward, it's not going to be easy. But I told him, 'If you really embrace it, you can help your team win.'"" 	

Kerr said the timing of the discussion ahead of the All-Star break would help Thompson process the news -- a decision that he agreed with. 	

Thompson told ESPN that the All-Star break allowed him to have ""a complete reset, a huge mental reset."" Kerr told ESPN that moving Thompson to the bench was ""about finding the best version of our team."" All season, Kerr has been tweaking the rotation based on injuries, suspensions, and simply needing to find lineups that work together. Chris Paul, for the first time in his 19-year career, is coming off the bench. Kevon Looney lost his starting spot and has seen his minutes diminish. Andrew Wiggins was the sixth man for the better part of a month. Kerr said it has been ""this big experimental phase,"" which can be challenging for any team, let alone one full of battle-tested vets.

""Trying to mix and match the groups to find the right groups is hard,"" Kerr told ESPN. ""It's not always clear for me or our staff who we should play because we've got a lot of guys who are at similar levels and they all deserve to play.""

It is totally normal that Thompson didn't love to hear that Kerr wanted to bring him off the bench. Back in 2014, Andre Iguodala didn't love to hear it, either. On Tuesday against the Washington Wizards, though, with Paul back in the lineup, it was easy to see what the coaching staff was thinking. About halfway through the first quarter, Thompson and Gary Payton II checked in for 21-year-old starters Jonathan Kuminga and Brandin Podziemski. A few possessions later, Paul and Looney checked in for Draymond Green and Moses Moody, the latter of whom was starting in place of Wiggins (personal issue). That's a lot of smarts and experience in the second unit, and Thompson told reporters postgame that Paul, in particular, is ""a joy"" to play with.

""You got two Hall of Famers in the backcourt coming off the bench, that's such a rare feat, so we take pride in that,"" Thompson said. ""And I think it just makes our team that much [more] dangerous.""

Thompson said that Paul ""makes my life much easier"" by hitting him in stride with ""on-time, on-target"" passes. As he explained that he's still getting plenty of playing time and there are ""benefits to coming off the bench,"" Payton interrupted him: ""Tell 'em it don't matter, Klay! Start or not!""

""Yeah, literally,"" Thompson said. ""Like I said, Gary said, 25 minutes a night, I mean, that's starter minutes. So, not that hard a transition.""

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=sports+news,NY leaders knock Nassau County restrictions on transgender girls in sports,https://www.lohud.com/story/news/health/2024/02/29/transgender-girls-sports-restrictions-in-nassau-county-rare-in-new-york-state/72772023007/,"Thu, 29 Feb 2024 18:19:16 GMT","

The recent restriction on school teams with transgender girl athletes using Nassau County-owned facilities drew criticism from around New York, with some officials saying it was a discriminatory dive into a political maelstrom. 

Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman ""wants to step into the middle of the LGBTQ wars,"" said Westchester County Executive George Latimer, a Democrat whose county of nearly a million sits just north of New York City. Latimer and fellow Democrat Rep. Jamaal Bowman are locked in a primary battle to run for the 16th Congressional District in November.

Blakeman, a Republican who leads a county east of NYC with a population of near 1.4 million, issued a Feb. 22 executive order that mandates any sports team hoping to use county facilities expressly designate that a team is male, female or co-ed. Nassau would decline to issue a permit for the use of facilities by a team designated for girls and women but that has participants deemed “biological males,” or people who had been identified as male at birth.

The Nassau order, however, explicitly says it's OK for a boys team to have members who were identified female at birth.

Blakeman's order said the designation ""is necessary to maintain fairness for women's athletic opportunities.""

Latimer said schools and local sports associations already determine who's fit to compete. He called Nassau's order ""ridiculous.""

""They're prepared to be prejudicial to satisfy their political beliefs,"" Latimer said of government leaders, like Blakeman, who weigh in on an issue Latimer believes is beyond a municipal leader's purview.

""I'm not running a government to fight culture wars,"" Latimer said. ""I'm running a government to provide services.""

The Nassau move echoes a wave of restrictions on transgender youth in other states. Half of states now restrict transgender student athlete participation in some way.

A Pew Research survey found that 1.6% of U.S. adults identify as transgender or nonbinary — that is, their gender differs from the sex they were assigned at birth or they do not exclusively identify as one gender. That includes about 300,000 youth nationwide ages 13-17, according to the UCLA Williams Institute.

USA Today:Why the largest transgender survey ever could be a powerful rebuke to myths, misinformation

The benefit of sport among youth has been touted as boosting physical and emotional health, as well as academic performance, according to President's Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition.

Meanwhile, 60% of trans teens said they faced mistreatment at school, according to the 2022 Trans Survey. Some 73% of LGBTQ youth experience anxiety and 58% report symptoms of depression, according to a recent study by the Trevor Project.

New York State Attorney General Leticia James said the Nassau County order contradicts state law. She said in a statement on Feb. 22 that her office was reviewing legal options.

New York State's Human Rights Law in 2019 added an act known as GENDA, or Gender Expression Non-Discrimination Act, which extends discrimination laws to include gender identity and gender expression as protected classes. Discrimination in New York is prohibited in all areas covered by the Human Rights Law, including employment, housing, non-religious schools and places of public accommodation, which would include municipally owned properties.

The New York State Public High School Athletic Association outlines guidance that ensures all student-athletes have the right to participate in sports.

The New York Civil Liberties Union called the Nassau order illegal. “Requiring girls who are trans to compete on boys’ teams effectively bars them from sports altogether,"" said Bobby Hodgson, NYCLU director of LGBTQ rights litigation. ""Participating would mean being outed and being denied the same opportunities other girls enjoy: to challenge themselves, improve fitness, and be part of a team of their peers.""

Well before GENDA, New York courts had settled the issue of trans athletes’ right to compete in their identified gender. In 1977, the state Supreme Court found the U.S. Open’s attempt to ban tennis player Renee Richards from competing to be “grossly unfair, discriminatory and inequitable.”

Richards won the right to compete in the women’s singles but lost in both the singles and doubles competition.

The likelihood that a girl will participate in high school sports in the United States is driven not so much by individual choice, new research suggests. Instead, decisions made by parents, the wealth of one's family and community, and racial dynamics matter.

By combining interviews with elite college athletes and analysis of data on over 4,000 high school girls, researchers found that socioeconomic status—of families and the school districts in which they live—consistently underlies other factors that foster or obstruct opportunities for girls to play one or more sports and stick with it.

Fifty years after the enactment of Title IX, opportunity for girls and women in sports continues to grow but it is not equal with the opportunity provided to boys and men. Although the number of girls playing high school sports has risen from 300,000 to over 3 million, there remains about a 10-percentage-point difference between girls' and boys' participation rates.

Yet opportunities also aren't equal among girls, researchers say, meaning especially girls of color, from lower social class families, and attending schools in lower-income neighborhoods are potentially denied some of the social, educational and professional rewards linked to playing sports, such as being seen as a talented person, a team player or a hard worker.

""It's important to recognize that school sports participation isn't created in a vacuum and just linked to merit, hard work, persistence and discipline, but is linked to parenting practices and racial and socioeconomic status dynamics, including segregated settings and assumptions of choice and efforts put forth that can drive different trajectories,"" said senior author Chris Knoester, professor of sociology at The Ohio State University. ""Social factors matter and do so differentially.""

The research was published in the journal Sociological Focus.

For this study, Knoester and colleagues sought to determine which girls get chances to play which types of sports and for how long, and the impact that structural factors like race, class, and gender have on those opportunities.

First author Kirsten Hextrum, assistant professor of language, culture, and society at Oregon State University, conducted extensive interviews with 47 track and field athletes and rowers, 28 of whom were women, to unearth the factors that enabled them to achieve their elite status in college.

Clear themes emerged. Parents of higher socioeconomic status living in wealthy communities took a very active role in making sports a defining part of their children's lives before the kids started kindergarten, and access to many different sports growing up made it easier for these young athletes to continue participating.

The specter of male superiority permeated the athletic environment despite expectations that gender segregation would empower and protect young women. White, suburban areas offered more sports than lower-income and racially diverse communities, and girls of color who grew up in affluent neighborhoods still felt they were pushed toward certain sports, like track and field, or were treated like tokens on their teams.

These combined class, gender, and race factors suggested that simply opting into sports and then freely picking the best fit wasn't available to all girls.

""We're challenging this notion that athletic performance is driven by an individual's choice,"" Hextrum said. ""We've identified mechanisms through which the routing of opportunity occurs.""

The influence of social class, race, and gender on sports opportunities for girls was borne out by statistical analysis of Educational Longitudinal Study data on 4,271 girls from 559 U.S. schools who attended 10th to 12th grade from 2002-2004. The analysis also included data on school size, numbers, and demographic data on students who participated in sports, sports offered, and, as an indicator of the socioeconomic status of the school, the percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunches.

Results showed that at the individual level, white girls in high school were more likely than girls of color to play any school sports. At the school level, attending a school with a greater proportion of white students was positively associated with the likelihood of a girl playing a school sport and playing it consistently.

The social class of schools and families was an underlying factor in many of these dynamics. For example, regardless of the racial makeup of the student body or the school's size, a 25% increase in the percentage of low-income students was associated with a 20% drop in the odds of girls' sports participation.

Higher family socioeconomic status increased the likelihood of girls playing most sports in 10th grade and playing until their senior year, and the odds of a girl from a family with high socioeconomic status participating in any school sport were 50% higher than the odds for a girl from a family of average socioeconomic status getting into a sport.

Further, smaller school size was linked to greater sports participation by girls, and a larger number of sports offered by a school was positively associated with the likelihood of girls playing sports.

Some of these findings are familiar to the team. Co-author James Tompsett, a Ph.D. student in sociology at Ohio State, led a study in 2021 that found high school athletes were much more likely to play sports in college if they came from higher-income families and attended wealthier schools. He noted that this new study showed family wealth enabled kids to start young at playing all kinds of different sports, giving them a leg up on finding where their true strength lies.

""Multisport athletes are so much more likely to continue participating and persisting in sport—it's not just a matter of specializing,"" Tompsett said. ""Folks thrown into everything have the chance to potentially specialize in something that will take them to the next level, give them the benefits they're looking for, like getting into a specific school or program that they want.""

The disparity in girls' access to the health and social advantages associated with participation in sports points to the need for investment in making sports opportunities available to all people throughout the life course, Knoester said.

""There should be careful scrutiny of rewarding school sports participation in educational and work institutions,"" he said. ""The proposed solution to addressing this is not to get rid of sports, but to recognize there are some wonderful things that do come out of sports experiences—but we need to be mindful and careful in providing more positive and more low-cost sports opportunities.""

DETROIT (AP) — The Detroit Red Wings are restoring a roar in the Motor City.

Shayne Gostisbehere scored in each of the first two periods and Detroit routed the Washington Capitals 8-3 on Tuesday night, for its first six-game winning streak in nearly five years with the franchise’s first eight-goal game since 2017.

“Right from the start, you could see the talent through their lineup and through their roster and the plays they make,” Capitals coach Spencer Carbery said. “With the finish they had, it was on full display.”

“They’re as good as any team in the National Hockey League.”

Lucas Raymond also had a goal in the first, giving Detroit a 2-0 lead after one. Joe Veleno scored and J.T. Compher had a short-handed goal in the second period to put the Red Wings ahead 5-2.

Detroit didn’t let up with Robby Fabbri, Alex DeBrincat and Dylan Larkin scoring in the third.

Alex Lyon finished with 18 saves for the Red Wings, whose last six-game run was from March 23, 2019, to April 2 of that year — one of seven straight seasons to end without a playoff game. They hadn’t scored eight goals in a game since Nov. 15, 2017.

“We’ve got some work to do some areas, but it’s very encouraging,” general manager Steve Yzerman said in an interview with The Associated Press after his team’s latest win. “We’re getting stronger as the season goes on.”

Detroit leads the Eastern Conference’s wild-card standings and the franchise’s fans, which included Lions defensive end Aidan Hutchinson, are clearly fired up about the team’s chances to make the playoffs for the first time since 2016.

“All these games matter, but especially against teams that are right behind us,” Veleno said. “That kind of gives us an extra chip on our shoulders when they come in here to play. It definitely feels a lot better to be in these positions”

The Capitals, who trail the top two teams in the wild-card standings, are hoping to close the season strong enough to avoid missing the playoffs in two straight seasons for the first time since a three-postseason drought that began in 2004 — a season before Alex Ovechkin started his spectacular career.

Hendrix Lapierre scored early in the second to pull Washington within one and Michael Sgarbossa made it 4-2 later in the period. Max Pacioretty cut the deficit to three goals midway through the third.

Charlie Lindgren stopped 23 shots for the Capitals, who had won four of their last five games to gain some ground on Philadelphia for the Metropolitan Division’s third guaranteed playoff spot.

Washington was also missing regulars T.J. Oshie, Nic Dowd and Nick Jensen to injury and Sonny Milano to illness.

The Red Wings were in control for much of the night, looking like they were on the power play during even-strength situations and even scoring a goal when they were killing a penalty. They peppered Lindgren with 12 shots in the first period and 11 more in the second while giving up a total of 11 shots, entering the third.

“We’re not going to just flush it,” Carbery said. “There’s a lot of structure things that we need to get cleaned up. We’ve played well. That game was a one-off for our group.”

NFL Draft is coming up!


LeBron James is closing in on becoming the first player in NBA history to score 40,000 career points. The NBA's all-time leading scorer is just 40 points shy of the milestone after an otherworldly fourth quarter in the Lakers' win over the Clippers on Wednesday. He could get there as soon as Thursday versus the Wizards, but Saturday against the Nuggets seems more likely. 

What better time to take a 40,000-foot view of his incredible scoring prowess over the years?

Here are 40 facts on LeBron's quest to 40K, looking through the lens of several aspects, from his unparalleled longevity, to the unique ways he got there and of course, the downright bizarre, quirky and jaw-dropping stats. 

Let's start with longevity. After all, we wouldn't be here if LeBron didn't have one of the longest (if not the longest) primes in sports history. 

1. LeBron has scored at least 10 points in 1,203 straight games, easily the longest streak in NBA history, ahead of Michael Jordan (866). The last time he failed to score in double figures was on Jan. 5, 2007.

2. He's ranked top 20 in the NBA in points per game in every season of his career, by far the longest streak (21 straight seasons) in NBA history (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is next with 17 straight seasons), and the longest ""scoring prime"" in modern sports history, as I discovered last year. 

3. James is the youngest (21) and oldest (37) NBA player to average 30 points per game in a season.

4. He is the only player in NBA history with a 40-point game vs. all 30 teams.

5. He has a 40-point game in all but one season in his career (2015-16).

6. He is averaging as many points per 36 minutes this season (25.7) than in his career (25.7).

7. He has the 13 highest-scoring games in NBA history by a player in his 21st (or later) season. 

8. He is averaging 25.2 points per game this season. Nobody else has had more than 7.4 PPG in their 21st (or later) season. 

9. He scored 2,566 career points vs. the Seattle SuperSonics, New Jersey Nets, New Orleans Hornets and Charlotte Bobcats, franchises that have either moved or changed their name -- or both. 

10. He is the only player in NBA history who ranks in the top 10 in career scoring average and games played. 

11. He is the oldest player in the NBA. The last time the oldest player averaged double figures in scoring was 2002-03 with John Stockton at 10.8 PPG (h/t Tim Reynolds, Associated Press).

12. LeBron's first NBA points were scored more than 20 years ago (Oct. 29, 2003) vs. the Sacramento Kings, who rostered Jabari Smith, the father of current Rockets' forward Jabari Smith Jr. (2022 third overall pick). FYI, LeBron's played vs. at least 10 father-son duos in his career. 

13. Looking ahead, he can be the first player in NBA history to score as a teenager and in his 40s. He turns 40 in December. 

Now that I've whet the appetite, here's a main course of stunning facts. 

14. LeBron has more points in his career than Larry Bird and Magic Johnson combined (39,498).

15. He could go scoreless in 125 straight games and still have a higher career scoring average than Kobe Bryant (25.0).

16. LeBron passed Michael Jordan on the all-time scoring list roughly five years ago (March 6, 2019).

17. If he never made a 3-pointer or free throw in his career, he'd still have more points than Kevin Durant. 

18. He has scored 133 career points with his team eliminated from playoff contention, or 0.3% of his career total (he's missed the playoffs four times in his career). 

19. He's scored more points since he last won an MVP in 2012-13 (18,879) than Tracy McGrady did in his entire career (18,381). 

20. LeBron has scored over 11,000 points since he last fouled out in a game (April 9, 2017).

21. He has the same number of career 50-point games as all players combined in Celtics history (14).

22. He has more career 50-point games (14) than games with single-digit points (8).

23. A full season (82 games) of LeBron's lowest-scoring games would equal 12.6 PPG, the same as the career scoring average of Hall of Famer Jason Kidd. 

24. LeBron has never scored exactly 49 points in a regular-season game (twice in the playoffs).

25. He won his only scoring title in 2007-08 (30.0 PPG) when the Seattle SuperSonics were in their last season of existence (before becoming the Oklahoma City Thunder) with rookie Kevin Durant.

26. LeBron could miss 304 straight shots and still have a career field goal percentage of exactly 50.0%. 

27. He does not have the highest-scoring game vs. any one franchise in NBA history.

28. The first player to score 30,000 points (Wilt Chamberlain), 35,000 points (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) and soon 40,000 points (LeBron James) all did so in a Lakers uniform. 

29. LeBron has 1,803 career points vs the Bulls, his most vs. any team in his career (because of course, it's vs. the Bulls). 

Let's not forget LeBron's many historic scoring feats.

30. LeBron has the most points in a game in Miami Heat history (61 on March 3, 2014 vs. Charlotte Bobcats).

31. He has the most 30-point games on 50% shooting in NBA history (429).

32. He has a 13-game streak with at least 25 points on 50% shooting last season, tied for the longest streak by any player since the 1976-77 merger (Giannis Antetokounmpo, Shaquille O'Neal).

33. He is the youngest player in NBA history to every 1,000-point milestone (1K, 2K, 3K, 4K, 5K, 6K … 38K, 39K).

34. He averages at least 25 points per game vs. every franchise except for the Pistons (24.1).

35. He is the only player to average at least 26 points per game for three different franchises (Heat, Lakers, Cavaliers) in a career (min. 100 games for each team).

Well, he wouldn't be the first to 40,000 points if he was easy to guard. For over two decades, James has proven he can score anytime, anyway, from anywhere.

36. LeBron is the only player in NBA history who ranks in the top 10 in points off twos, threes and free throws.

37. LeBron is the fourth in the NBA in both dunks and 30+ footers made in the shot-tracking era (since 1996-97). He is the only player who ranks top 30 in both in that span. 

38. LeBron leads the NBA in points in clutch time, on fastbreaks and in the paint since those were all first tracked in 1996-97. 

39. He's led the NBA in clutch-time scoring (final five minutes, score within five points) an NBA-high three times since entering the league in 2003-04 (2007-08, 2009-10, 2017-18).

40. With the Lakers, 25% of his points are from 3-point range. He was never over 20% in his other three career stops.

RALEIGH, N.C. (WNCN) – About a week and a half before online sports betting can officially begin in North Carolina, the State Lottery Commission has announced the eight companies who have been awarded interactive sports wagering operator licenses.

On March 1, people can begin registering early in anticipation of the sports betting launch, which is March 11.

The state lottery commission is the regulatory agency—and has now approved 8 mobile sports online betting sites here in the state. Many are eagerly anticipating its arrival. The Sportsbooks have spent weeks heavily promoting their arrival in N.C. and that has some eager to cash in. 

As of Thursday, the state has officially licensed 8 online sports books including:

“Right now, my preferences are FanDuel and DraftKings,” said betting fan Michael Berry. “I’m open to whatever is available to the to the state, but right now, looking at FanDuel and DraftKings.”

That legalized mobile gambling is anticipated to generate an estimated 6.5 BILLION dollars in its first year of operating in N.C. That’s a lot of money, and the state will get its cut. 

“Issuing the first interactive sports wagering operator licenses today represents a major milestone in establishing legal sports betting in North Carolina,” said Ripley Rand, chair of the North Carolina State Lottery Commission. 

Half of the revenue is going to the general fund and the rest will be portioned out University Athletic funds, the state’s major games and attraction funds—and even some going to the NC Problem Gambling Program.

Some worry about the way the mobile betting apps look and feel.

“If it’s mobile coins or whatever It doesn’t seem as real,” said Andrew Parker. “I mean, if you lose in a video game, it’s not as bad as if you lose $200—it’s not very good.”

If you win $5,000 or more—online sports books will withhold your federal taxes –but you are still responsible for state taxes. The state taxes gambling winnings at 5.25 per cent.

North Carolinians can begin signing up for accounts on their mobile devices on Friday, March 1.  While deposits into those accounts can be made starting noon on Friday, no sports better is allowed until March 11. 

In order to place a bet, you must be at least 21 years old and you must establish an account with a licensed operator.

The Commission reports they have received a total of nine applications for interactive sports wagering operator licenses. They expect to approve additional licenses in the near future. 

In addition, the Commission has also issued three full licenses for sports wagering supplier, 18 provisional supplier licenses, and three sports wagering service provider licenses.

The NFL Scouting Combine is set to start this week with the potential for young draft prospects to impress scouts and boost their standings as teams look to build for the future.

Patrick Mahomes, one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL, appears to be set to have a close eye on potential teammates during this year’s Combine. He just has one request for the NFL Network.

""As the combine starts this week! All i ask is that @nflnetwork doesn’t use my 40 overlay anymore,"" he wrote on X on Wednesday.

The Scouting Combine coverage will sometimes compare 40-yard dash times to those of the greatest at their positions. Mahomes came into the NFL in 2017 out of Texas Tech. He ran 4.80 during his sprint. Texas A&M quarterback Trevor Knight was the quickest among quarterbacks with a 4.54. Joshua Dobbs was next with a 4.64, followed by Deshaun Watson (4.66) and Mitchell Trubisky (4.67).

The Kansas City Chiefs appeared to be more concerned with his arm talent than anything else.

Through seven seasons, he has 28,424 passing yards and 219 passing touchdowns – not to mention the three Super Bowl titles he’s won in that span. 

As far as his legs go, Mahomes showed his quickness on the biggest stage earlier this month. His wheels were partly what kept the Chiefs alive against the San Francisco 49ers.

LEXINGTON, Ky. (FOX 56) — Coaching often runs in the family, especially in high school sports.

Ashley Garrard is the girls basketball head coach at Henry Clay and says she learned everything from her dad, Maurice.

“Everybody knows he taught me; I’m his first child to win him a state championship. I don’t know if he told you that,” Ashley said.

Maurice has coached AAU ball for 33 years, so when Ashley’s players get done with the high school season, they switch over and play for Coach Maurice.

“A lot of them went and played for my daddy and they got to see, ‘oh she ain’t as bad as we thought’ because he’s tough; he’s very tough,” Ashley said.

Last year, Maurice got a call from Frankfort High School and, for the first time in his career, at 65 years old, started coaching public school basketball, which took some adjustments.

“They had some real problems, like ‘Hey, I ain’t coming today,’ so when you come back in here, you’re gonna have to run,” Maurice said.

Then the anticipation started building: what if Ashley and Maurice could coach against each other in a game?

“I knew when he took the job, I was like, ‘You realize you’re in my region’ and he’s like, ‘Huh’ and I said, ‘We’re both in the 11th region,’ I said, ‘and we’re gonna play each other’ and I was like, ‘So you better get ready,’” Ashley said.

“She would either bring it up or I would bring it up like, ‘Ashley, I’m gonna knock your head off now’ and she’s got the same mentality,” Maurice said.

The game was set months in advance. But for Ashley, seeing her dad walk through her gym doors was still a shock.

“Family bragging rights, if you will; it’s very important to us both; she wants to win as bad as I want to win,” Maurice said.

Henry Clay vs. Frankfort had to be on the schedule, but not just anywhere. The game landed on the first weekend in February for Black History Month. 

This was done with a purpose because this is the first time in Kentucky history that an African-American father-daughter duo has coached against each other in a basketball game.

“Any time you have the opportunity to be the first to do something that’s always very special and stays in the forefront of your mind,” Maurice said.

“That’s what I’m saying, like we’re making history, like that is awesome,” Ashley said. “You see people like you, younger people, and you’re like, ‘Dang, maybe I should listen to my parents; maybe they do know more’ because the teacher has taught the student well.”

With history like this and bragging rights on the line, they had to add a friendly wager to the stakes.

“Losers buy the seafood tonight, and I’m like, ‘Ok, we’ll take that on, let’s do that.’ So yeah, we have our little side bet here,” Maurice said.

Both Garrards are hoping they don’t have to bring out their credit card after this one.

According to Maurice, Ashley tried to do some extra scouting before the game.

“You know she’s actually came to me and asked me, ‘Daddy, what’s that offense you run where the’ no, I’m not going to fall for it, I’m not falling for it,” Maurice said.

After a close first half, Henry Clay pulled away for a big 71-38 win and a big bill at Jeff Ruby’s for Dad to pick up.

The players might not fully grasp the significance of the milestone Ashley and Maurice accomplished, but there are lessons to take from here, regardless of who won the game.

“It’s one of those things that I try to make kids understand that somebody always has it tougher than you,” Maurice said.

Henry Clay improved to 15-7 with the win, and Frankfort dropped to 8-16 with the loss.

Luton Town hope to rebound from a midweek shellacking in the FA Cup when potent Aston Villa head to Kenilworth Road.

The Hatters allowed a hat trick — and then some — to five-goal Erling Haaland as they bowed out of the FA Cup. This game was always a bigger one anyway, as Luton are four points back of the safe spaces with just 20 points (though Luton do have a match-in-hand on most of their relegation rivals).

WATCH LUTON TOWN vs ASTON VILLA LIVE

Luton have lost three-straight in Premier League play including a costly defeat to Sheffield United and more understandable setbacks to Manchester United and Liverpool, but open a run of fixtures that promise the chance for points after this visit from Villa — Palace away, Bournemouth away, Forest at home.

Villa have won three-of-four following a 4-2 win over Forest and have a five-point lead over fifth-place Tottenham in the race for a top-four spot. Ollie Watkins and Co. have done it via goals — their 56 trail only the three teams above them on the table.

A Daily SportsLine Betting Podcast



NFL Draft is coming up!


One of the biggest questions of the NFL offseason revolves around the Chicago Bears and whether they're going to trade away Justin Fields. 

During the NFL Combine this week, Bears general manager Ryan Poles didn't tip his hand on what's going to happen, but he did say that the team would like to make a decision soon. 

""I would love to know as soon as possible,"" Poles said about the team's plan at quarterback. ""I would love to know, but I know that's not how the process works. Sure, before free agency would be good.""

If the Bears decide to trade Fields, there could end up being a nice market for his services, and that's because multiple teams appear to be interested in the 24-year-old. According to USA Today, the Falcons, Raiders and Steelers have all ""expressed some level of interest"" in possibly making a deal for Fields. 

All three of these teams have a huge question mark at quarterback this offseason, so all three of them would make some sense. 

The Falcons haven't been trying to hide the fact that they're going to add a quarterback this offseason. Making a trade for Fields would make a lot of sense, and that's because it would give him a fresh start and it would also give the team a fresh start at the position. Also, let's not forget that Fields' manager posted a video this week that seemed to hint that the QB may end up with the Falcons (you can see it here). According to NBC Sports Chicago, the Falcons have already checked in with the Bears about Fields, so they've taken one step beyond just showing interest. 

Although the Steelers have Kenny Pickett, Mike Tomlin made it clear in January that the team will be bringing in some competition for the 25-year-old. ""There's always competition in this thing. We don't anoint anyone. I'm appreciative of his efforts and where he is and excited about continuing to work with him, but certainly, he will be challenged from a competition perspective moving forward."" 

Steelers general manager Omar Khan was asked at the combine if the team may trade for Justin Fields, and although he could have shot down the speculation, he instead left the door wide open. 

""I have an obligation to look at every avenue that's out there to try and make us a better football team,"" Khan told the media, via The Athletic.

The Steelers GM also admitted that his team would look at every available option, while also saying he has ""full faith"" in Kenny Pickett. 

 ""There's different avenues for us: The draft, free agency, the trade market. I would say every one of those avenues is an option for us,"" Khan said. One option could be Mason Rudolph, but he's set to be a free agent, so there's no guarantee that he'll be returning to Pittsburgh. 

Adding Fields would give the QB a chance to start over with a new offensive coordinator (Arthur Smith) who will also be heading into his first season in Pittsburgh. 

Antonio Pierce was asked what he wants in a quarterback this week at the combine, and he gave a pretty specific answer, ""You want someone who has been battle-tested, that has been through adversity, had challenges and wasn't just handed the keys. Because that's going to be the process here no matter what we do,"" Pierce said. 

The Raiders have made it pretty clear this week that their QB of the future isn't currently on the roster, which means Aidan O'Connell and Jimmy Garoppolo likely won't be around much longer. The Raiders could certainly draft a quarterback, but with the 13th overall pick, it might not be realistic for that to happen. If they have to go after a veteran, making a trade for Fields would certainly make some sense. 

This is all good news for the Bears because if they do end up trading Fields -- and things definitely seem to be trending that way -- there should be plenty of interested teams. Besides the three teams above, there are also several more teams that will likely be in the market for a quarterback, including the Commanders, Patriots, Broncos and Vikings. 

We came up with several possible landing spots for Fields, and you can check those out here.

SHELBYVILLE — As the final shot of the Unity boys’ basketball season fell behind the basket and the remaining seconds ticked off the clock, Henry Thomas felt all of the emotions at once.

The guard for the Rockets and three-year starter is one of many senior leaders Unity could turn to this season.

A superb season for the Rockets, filled with more highs than lows. But one that ended Wednesday night with a 48-39 loss to Teutopolis in a Class 2A Shelbyville Sectional semifinal game.

It took until the final buzzer sounded for the realization that the season was over hit Thomas, who was immediately embraced by twin brother and fellow senior guard Andrew Thomas.

They were the last ones out of the locker room, per usual, and this time, it was Henry comforting Andrew as the overwhelming emotions made their way to him.

“It’s definitely been something I won’t forget,” Henry Thomas said of his time playing with his brother. “Luckily for us, we have another four years of basketball. We’re going to be announcing it soon. It’s never going to be the same — the team, court or jersey — but we’re fortunate to get four more years to go compete for bigger and better things.”

All the emotion comes from a combination of things. Yes, the seniors just finished their final high school game, but not many outside of Unity’s locker room saw this successful of a season coming.

The Rockets ended the season 26-5 one year after going 16-15. They won a regional title for the first time since 2012. And most importantly, to the players, they did it as a family.

“Out of all my basketball years, I would put this one at the top of the list,” Henry Thomas said. “Normally, you see a younger class and upper class division, but the sophomores were our best friends this year. That’s what everyone will say was the key to why we had so much success. It’s been fun.”

Wednesday night was a physical game, not for the weak by any means. Fans on both sides packed the stands to provide the loudest atmosphere possible, and every possession felt like it was the very last one with the score tied.

It even had Unity coach Matt Franks showing more nervous ticks than usual, constantly leaning back, gritting his teeth and letting his hand touch every part of his face.

His voice was gone after the game, even more so than others this season, which comes with coaching in that kind of game.

“I could not be more proud of our kids’ effort,” Franks said. “They fought and played really hard. I can’t say enough about our kids’ heart and spirit. They did so much for this program. They don’t know how grateful I am for them and everything about them.”

It was exactly what a postseason basketball game was supposed to be like.

“(Wednesday night) was the most physical game I think I’ve played in high school,” Henry Thomas said, “and that’s what we like. That’s what we wanted. That’s what we hoped the game would be. ... We played hard. This team plays super, super hard.”

Henry Thomas led the Rockets Wednesday with eight points, followed by Dalton O’Neill and Coleton Langendorf with seven points apiece. The Rockets trailed the Wooden Shoes 21-17 at halftime and 33-27 to start the fourth quarter.

Joey Niebrugge and Austin Bloemer each had 10 points to lead Teutopolis (23-10), which will face St. Joseph-Ogden (27-6) at 7 p.m. Friday in the sectional title game.

While the Rockets won’t get a second game against rival SJ-O, Unity’s seniors set a new standard this year. The entire starting five was seniors, and they showed just how much a team can improve in a year simply with hard work.

“I hope every future Rocket witnessed this season,” Franks said. “It was fun, it was electric, and our guys deserve all the credit in the world.”

Red Bull principal Christian Horner dismissed ""anonymous speculation"" after files purportedly related to his misconduct investigation were widely distributed on Thursday, two days before his team opens its bid for a fourth consecutive Formula One drivers' championship.

 

His statement was forced by a stunning off-track development: As the second practice was going on for the Bahrain Grand Prix, files were emailed to nearly 200 people in the F1 paddock, including Liberty Media, F1, the FIA, the other nine team principals and multiple media outlets.

 

The authenticity of the files has not been verified by ESPN or The Associated Press; the files came from a generic email account.

 

The files were sent one day after the team's parent company dismissed a complaint of alleged misconduct by Horner toward a team employee. He was at the practice when the files were sent.

 

""I won't comment on anonymous speculation, but to reiterate, I have always denied the allegations,"" Horner said in a statement read to journalists by a team spokesperson; the statement was from Horner, not on behalf of Red Bull.

 

""I respected the integrity of the independent investigation and fully cooperated with it every step of the way,"" Horner said. ""It was a thorough and fair investigation conducted by an independent specialist barrister, and it has concluded, dismissing the complaint made. I remain fully focused on the start of the season.""

 

Details of the allegations involving Horner have not been made public. The Red Bull company said Wednesday that the complainant has a right to appeal the decision.

 

A Red Bull spokesperson reiterated to ESPN that Horner will be in the Bahrain paddock on Friday, when qualifying for Saturday's Bahrain Grand Prix will take place.

 

Horner, 50, has been the team principal since Red Bull entered F1 as a full constructor in 2005. He has guided the team to six constructors' championships and seven drivers' championships. Red Bull won all but one of the 22 races last season, with 19 wins for Max Verstappen, the three-time champion. Its redesigned car is widely considered the fastest on the grid for 2024 going into Saturday's season opener.

 

McLaren team principal Zak Brown said F1 and governing body the FIA should seek to reexamine Red Bull's decision to dismiss the complaint.

 

""From what I've seen, there continues to be a lot of rumors and speculation, questions,"" Brown said shortly before the anonymous email was sent. ""I think the sanctioning body has a responsibility and authority to our sport, to our fans. All of us in Formula One are ambassadors for the sport on and off the track, like you see in other sports. And so I think they need to make sure that things have been fully transparent with them.""

 

Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff called the statement from Red Bull, which did not include any details of the investigation, ""pretty basic"" and said F1 ""needs more transparency"" on the issue.

 

""I just simply think that as a sport, we cannot afford to leave things in the vague and in the opaque on critical topics like this because it's going to catch us out,"" Wolff said, also speaking before the anonymous email.

 

Horner, who remained in his role as Red Bull team principal during the internal investigation, led Red Bull during Thursday practice and said his team was more unified than ever heading into the new season.

 

""I'm just pleased that the process is over,"" Horner told British broadcaster Sky Sports News, speaking before Wolff's and Brown's comments. ""I obviously can't comment about it, but we're here very much to focus now on the Grand Prix and the season ahead and trying to defend both of our titles.""

 

Asked whether the team was unified, he said: ""Within the team, it's never been stronger.""

Vanoss girls basketball coach Jonathon Hurt talks to his players during a break in the action during a game against Stratford earlier this season. Hurt and his sixth-ranked Lady Wolves are scheduled to face No. 18 Latta at 1 p.m. Thursday in the Class 2A Area Tournament in Chickasha.

Sports Editor





Playoff basketball has been a treat for Pontotoc County basketball fans, especially on the girls side of things.

First, we got Ada versus Byng in a Class 4A Regional girls and boys doubleheader last week.

Now, the Latta and Vanoss girls’ basketball teams will battle in a Class 2A Regional Tournament consolation contest Thursday at 1 p.m. at Chickasha High School.

Just like the Ada versus Byng game, the battle between the sixth-ranked Lady Wolves and No. 18 Latta will be a loser-leaves-the-playoffs matchup.

“It’s a special year when you get Ada-Byng and Latta-Vanoss in the playoffs and one of them is going home,” Vanoss girls basketball head coach Jonathon Hurt told The Ada News.

Another local squad, the Stratford Lady Bulldogs, meets a 19-6 Walters team that sent Vanoss into the loser’s bracket. Stratford enters the area fray at 15-12 but has won seven of its past nine outings. The two losses were both to Latta. The Stratford-Walters winner will face the Vanoss-Latta survivor at 1 p.m. Friday back in Chickasha.

“It’s loaded. We knew it was going to be loaded when it came out,” Hurt said of the teams still hanging around in the Area 1 Bracket. “We knew we might be on a collision course with Latta. I believe whoever wins that game will be the favorite to go on to the state tournament. Not that there’s not some other really good teams over there.”

The winner’s bracket game Friday night in Chickasha will pit No. 1 Dale (27-1) against No. 12 Calera for the area championship. The Lady Bulldogs stand at 25-2 on the year and their only losses were to Latta in November and a road setback to Class A No. 2 Caddo.

“Calera is capable of beating anybody and so is Walters and Stratford. But I think the winner of our game has a good shot to get to state,” Hurt reiterated.

Hurt said he has a lot of respect for Latta. The Lady Wolves pinned a 43-33 loss on Latta back in November. But both teams have changed a lot since that early-season matchup.

“Latta has a really good group. It’s going to be a tough game between two good teams,” Hurt said. “They’re well-coached and have a lot of good players and we have a lot of good players too. It will come down to whoever shows up that day.”

Latta head coach Clay Plunk said it should be a fun game for local fans to watch.

“Coach Hurt always has his teams ready, and we know it will be a battle. They’ve been in the state tournament consistently and know what it takes in playoffs. They’ve got so much size and length, they’re a rough matchup,” Plunk said. “But, our quickness can be a problem, too. Saying all that, I think we’re ready for the challenge. We learned some things from our first matchup with them and hope to make the necessary adjustments this time around.”

It is believed that the last time the Latta and Vanoss girls met in the playoff was back in 2018. That game was also played at a Class 2A Area Tournament hosted by Chickasha High School. The Lady Wolves won that contest thanks in part to a big game from then-freshman Emrie Ellis, who finished with eight points, 21 rebounds and 18 blocked shots.

Pontotoc County basketball fans can start their day at the State Fair Arena where the fifth-ranked Allen Lady Mustangs have a chance to pull off the upset of the season when they take on No. 1 Seiling at 9 a.m. Thursday at the Big House in the Class A State Tournament. Should Allen win that game, coach Dottie Slabaugh’s bunch would be back at the Big House at 9 a.m. Friday for a Class A semifinal match.

Iowa basketball star Caitlin Clark announced on Thursday that she's declaring for the WNBA draft.

She made her announcement with one game remaining on the regular-season schedule and weeks after breaking the NCAA women's scoring record.

""While this season is far from over and we have a lot more goals to achieve, it will be my last one at Iowa,"" Clark wrote on social media. ""I am excited to be entering the 2024 WNBA Draft.""

The Indiana Fever hold the No. 1 pick in April's draft for a second consecutive season. Clark will presumably join 2023 No. 1 pick and Rookie of the Year Aliyah Boston to anchor a promising young core in Indiana.

Clark will leave after her fourth NCAA season with one year of eligibility remaining. Players who were active during the COVID-19-shortened 2020 season were granted an extra season of eligibility by the NCAA. She'll forgo that extra season to turn pro at 22 years old. In the meantime, she'll hope to lead Iowa to an NCAA championship, the only hole remaining on her illustrious college résumé.

Clark won consensus National Player of the Year honors as a junior in 2023 while leading the Hawkeyes to the national championship game. There, LSU defeated Iowa to deny the Hawkeyes a title.

Clark is the favorite to sweep national individual honors again in 2024 amid a historic season that saw her pass Kelsey Plum as the NCAA women's all-time scoring leader. She broke Plum's 3,527-point threshold with a career-high 49-point performance in a Feb. 16 win over Michigan.

As of Thursday, Clark was averaging a career-high 32.2 points and 8.7 assists alongside 7.4 rebounds and 1.7 steals per game while shooting 46.9% from the field and 39.5% on 13.6 3-point attempts per game. She's now 18 points from passing Pete Maravich, who owns the NCAA scoring record for men or women with 3,667 points in three seasons at LSU.

Clark's on pace to pass that mark in Sunday's regular-season finale against Ohio State. Her sixth-ranked Hawkeyes will host the No. 2 Buckeyes on Sunday in a game that will have significant implications for NCAA tournament seeding.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

NFL Draft is coming up!


Despite recent reports, the New York Giants haven't ruled out franchise-tagging Saquon Barkley ahead of free agency. And if you assumed that Barkley was on his way out of New York, that doesn't appear to the case at this point in time. 

In fact, the Giants and Barkley's representatives had a ""good (initial) meeting"" on Wednesday at the NFL Combine, according to CBS Sports NFL Insider Josina Anderson. According to Anderson, the team remains open to multiple options with Barkley, pending an agreement on terms.

Giants general manager Joe Schoen had previously said on Tuesday that the team ""would like"" to retain Barkley, a two-time Pro Bowler who when healthy has proven to be one of the league's premier running backs. While a long-term deal is probably what both sides want, Schoen is willing to go to other means to keep Barkley. 

""I wouldn't say the franchise tag is off the table (for Barkley),"" he said, via NFL Media. 

Schoen alluded to the NFL's increased salary cap when discussing his optimism when it comes to possibly keeping Barkley. He has estimated that the cap would be between $241 and $243 million. Instead, the cap for the upcoming season has been set at $255.4 million, a $30.6 million increase from 2023. 

It's clear that Barkley is still highly valued within the Giants organization. While his position has taken a hit, Barkley has proven that game-changing running backs don't grow on trees. 

Take the 2022 season for example. With Barkley healthy, the Giants enjoyed their best season since winning Super Bowl XLVI. Big Blue won a playoff game largely on the shoulders of Barkley, who had 109 all-purpose yards and two touchdowns in New York's playoff upset win over the Vikings. 

As far as monetary value, Schoen said that he wouldn't say that Barkley's value has changed from last year, when the Giants signed him to a one-year, $10,091,000 contract that included $2 million guaranteed. His projected market value is currently set at $29.93 million over three years for an average annual salary of $9.98 million, according to Spotrac. 

""He's a captain. He's a leader. He's a hard worker,"" Schoen said of Barkley. ""I think the world of Saquon, and I still think he can play. My value for Saquon really hasn't changed.""

Pages from the United Healthcare website are displayed on a computer screen in New York on Thursday, Feb. 29, 2024. On Thursday, Change Healthcare, a massive U.S. health care technology company owned by UnitedHealth Group, announced a ransomware group claimed responsibility for a cyberattack and is assessing the impact of the attack, which it first acknowledged on Feb. 21 and says has affected billing and care authorization portals. (AP Photo/Patrick Sison)

Health care providers across the country are reeling from a cyberattack on a massive U.S. health care technology company that has threatened the security of patients’ information and is delaying some prescriptions and paychecks for medical workers. 

The hack could also disrupt discharging people from the hospital, a major hospital association said.

Change Healthcare announced Thursday that a ransomware group that had claimed responsibility for the attack was at fault. Change Healthcare also said it is assessing the impact of the attack, which it first acknowledged on Feb. 21 and has affected billing and care-authorization portals across the country.

“Patient care is our top priority and we have multiple workarounds to ensure people have access to the medications and the care they need,” Change Healthcare said in a statement.

Owned by UnitedHealth Group, Change Healthcare manages health care technology pipelines, processing 14 billion transactions a year. The company said its investigation determined that Change Healthcare, Optum, UnitedHealthcare and UnitedHealth Group systems have been affected. Change also confirmed Thursday that ransomware group ALPHV, or Blackcat, made the breach. The company didn’t respond to a question about whether it paid or negotiated a ransom. 




One of the most immediate impacts is that people are seeing delays in getting prescriptions, American Hospital Association spokesperson Ben Teicher said. Change Healthcare said most affected pharmacies are using workarounds like writing things down.

But the severity of the situation may still be unfolding, the American Hospital Association said in an email to The Associated Press. Hospitals are having issues with processing claims, billing patients and checking insurance coverage for care, the AHA said, but the attack also could affect the ability to pay workers and buy medicine and supplies. 

“The impact to hospitals is just now really starting to crystallize and as a result has been underreported,” Teicher said. “As a result we can’t really speak to the longer term aftermath, but it can result in hospitals not being able to make payroll or patients still waiting for services to be approved.”

Health systems told the Healthcare Association of New York State that they’ve had trouble with various things, including “an inability to verify patient eligibility and coverage … communicate pharmacy prescriptions, file claims … and receive normal cash flow to support operations, among other issues,” association president Bea Grause said. 

Several major health care providers that serve multiple states did not respond to requests for comment. 

Cybersecurity experts say ransomware attacks have increased substantially in recent years, especially in the health care sector. This one comes on the heels of an attack last month on a children’s hospital in Chicago, which had to take phone, email and medical records systems offline. 

An FBI spokesperson in Tennessee said he could not confirm or deny whether the FBI is investigating. The FBI also said it’s “aware of this incident” but didn’t have anything else to provide because the incident “is ongoing.” 

“As far as we can tell, the attack is being contained,” said Allan Liska, a threat intelligence analyst at Recorded Future. “We don’t think it’s going to get worse. But when you have a critical system like this that’s down for an extended period … the longer it’s down and the longer that recovery takes, the more impact it’s going to have on patient care.”

CHICAGO (CBS) -- A hack at the company Change Healthcare has crippled pharmacies across the country – in just the latest in a troubling trend in which cyberattacks have affected people's health across the country.

A Naperville man has been left pleading for help from his hospital bed. He said when he went to the pharmacy, he was told he would need to pay out of pocket for medicine on which he depends.

""They said, 'There's nothing we can do for you,'"" said Alan Townsend.

Townsend said he ended up in the hospital after trying to pick up his medications for congestive heart failure and diabetes – only to be told Medicaid would not cover the cost.

""This is medicine that if I don't take it, I'll die,"" Townsend said.

The cyberattack targeted Change Healthcare – which processes transactions for about one in three U.S. patients' records. Hospitals and pharmacies can't get paid – and some patients are unable to get their medication.

In some cases, it has even led to delays in hospital discharges.

""Right now, I'm trapped in the hospital,"" said Townsend. ""I just can't imagine what people are going through that are worse than me.""

Patrick Berryman is with the National Community Pharmacists Association – made up of independently-owned pharmacies.

""In some cases, they might have been asked to pay cash. In other cases, they may have been given a couple of days' supply,"" Berryman said. ""Change Healthcare was one of the two biggest switches in the country that independent pharmacies had to deal with.""

A Russian-speaking ransomware group known as Blackcat has claimed responsibility for stealing more than six terabytes of sensitive medical records.

Toby Gouker is with First Health Advisory – a cybersecurity firm with clients in the health industry.

""It's an attack on the healthcare supply chain,"" Gouker said. ""Some of the larger systems are losing $100 million or so a day of revenue.""

""It's super frustrating to know my life is getting worse because of the system,"" added Townsend. ""It needs to be fixed, and needs to be fixed fast.""

Since the attack, many pharmacies have developed workarounds to get prescriptions processed. Deerfield-based Walgreens say they are continuing to fill prescriptions with minimal delay or interruption.

By  Amrita Khalid, one of the authors of audio industry newsletter Hot Pod. Khalid has covered tech, surveillance policy, consumer gadgets, and online communities for more than a decade. 

Health insurance provider UnitedHealth has identified Blackcat as the group behind a debilitating cyber attack that has disrupted healthcare providers nationwide, Reuters is reporting. The attack has led to more than a week-long outage of the the United-owned Change Healthcare system, disrupting payments at hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies across the nation. 

Since Change Healthcare acts as a middleman between healthcare providers and insurance companies, the breach has hindered everyday transactions like electronic pharmacy refills and new insurance claims. The company first identified suspicious activity on its IT systems on February 21st, according to an SEC filing. 

The breach could last for weeks, UnitedHealth Group Chief Operating Officer Dirk McMahon told STAT. The insurance company is setting up a loan program for healthcare providers in the meantime. 

Blackcat, also known as ALPHV, has claimed credit for numerous hacks over the past year, including the MGM casino breach in Las Vegas, a hack on Reddit’s systems, and many others. 

In a joint cybersecurity advisory, federal agencies including CISA and the FBI warned that Blackcat is now intentionally targeting the healthcare system. “Since mid-December 2023, of the nearly 70 leaked victims, the healthcare sector has been the most commonly victimized,” the agencies wrote.

The US government has even offered a combined $15 million reward for any actionable intelligence on the group’s whereabouts. An attempt by the FBI to seize Blackcat’s servers and sites last year seemingly failed —the group quickly regained control. 

In a darknet message that was later deleted on Wednesday, Blackcat also claimed it stole millions of patient records, including sensitive medical and insurance data in the UnitedHealth breach, Reuters reported. The group also admitted, in the same message, to stealing data from Medicare, the military medical agency Tricare, and even CVS Health. No further details were provided about the timing of these breaches, and the message was reportedly deleted without explanation. Reuters was unable to reach the hackers or verify any of their claims.

Even the theft of sensitive records from UnitedHealth alone could impact millions of people. Change Healthcare handles nearly 1 in 3 patient records in the US, the American Hospital Association told HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra in a letter sent on Monday. “Any prolonged disruption of Change Healthcare’s systems will negatively impact many hospitals’ ability to offer the full set of health care services to their communities,” wrote AHA president Richard J. Pollack. 

UnitedHealth is currently working with Google-owned Mandiant and cybersecurity software vendor Palo Alto Networks, CNBC reports.  The company hasn’t indicated whether it plans to pay the ransom.

Thousands of pharmacies and health systems throughout the country, including in Washington, are scrambling to find different ways to fill prescriptions and bill for medication after a recent cyberattack hit a division of UnitedHealthcare, the nation’s largest health insurer.

The data breach on Change Healthcare, part of UnitedHealth’s Optum, was discovered  Feb. 21 and appeared to be coming from a foreign country, The New York Times reported earlier this week. A spokesperson for UnitedHealth estimated more than 63,000 pharmacies nationwide have been affected by the attack and have been forced to “[modify] electronic claim processing to mitigate impacts,” but said the system has received “no reports of continuity of care issues.”

“They are downplaying it,” said Jenny Arnold, CEO of the Washington State Pharmacy Association, which provides support for the state’s 2,000 community pharmacies and their staffers. “And the pharmacy community is frustrated.”

While the effects of the breach vary widely, Arnold said “nearly every pharmacy and health system is impacted in some way.”

Change, which was acquired by UnitedHealth Group in 2022, mainly helps pharmacies verify a patient’s insurance coverage for their prescriptions, facilitate and send electronic prescriptions and check claims information, but many other types of health systems, including hospitals, physician groups and dental clinics, also use the platform, Arnold said.

“For some pharmacies it is as simple as some of their systems have glitches, and they cannot process manufacturer and other discount cards,” she wrote in a message. “Some are not able to received electronic prescriptions and some have more severe challenges processing prescriptions.”

In the past week, many pharmacies have found other ways to process prescriptions and submit claims, which are “working well,” but UnitedHealth’s lack of transparency around the problem has been difficult, Arnold said. 

“Since identifying the cyber incident, we have worked closely with customers and clients to ensure people have access to the medications and the care they need,” UnitedHealth said in a statement this week. “We also continue to work closely with law enforcement and a number of third parties … on this attack against Change Healthcare’s systems.”

UnitedHealth has not shared an updated timeline for when systems might be back online.

Change also handles a number of prescription drug discount cards, which allows holders with or without insurance to save money on medication. Because they’re distributed and processed electronically, Arnold added that pharmacies are still working to find reliable discount card alternatives.

“As these are for expensive medications, most of these patients are electing to wait until the coupon goes through before picking up their medications,” said Matt Binder, who owns three Seattle-area pharmacies, including Ostroms Drug & Gift, Bob Johnsons Pharmacy and Madison Park Pharmacy and Wellness Center. 

Fortunately, Binder said, impacts to his stores have been limited since they don’t use Change systems for electronic prescriptions or for billing insurance. 

Another big unknown, Arnold said, is what happens when pharmacies can’t see whether an insurance plan is going to cover an entire claim, potentially resulting in reimbursement problems for health systems and higher copay charges for patients after they get their medication. 

“Health systems are providing care hoping the claim will be paid after services are rendered,” Arnold said. “It’s leaving a lot of health care in the lurch. I fear pharmacies and health systems are going to end up disproportionately bearing the burden of this outage.”

While it’s unclear exactly how many pharmacies in Washington use Change software, a spokesperson for Rite Aid, which owns Bartell Drugs, said “only a small percentage” of the store’s claims were  affected by the outage and that it was able to process many claims through another billing system.

Last week’s breach is the largest recent cyberattack on a health care-related system, though these types of attacks have become more common in recent years, prompting federal cybersecurity agencies to prioritize cybersafety among hospitals and other health organizations.

In December, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported that the medical data of more than 88 million people was exposed in the first 10 months of 2023. The department also saw a 93% increase in large, health care-related breaches reported to the agency between 2018 and 2022.

Health systems are generally targeted because of the massive amount of medical data they store, which can be extremely valuable to hackers, but also because of their increasing reliance on technology and Internet-connected devices, according to local cyber experts.

In this case, Arnold encouraged patients to first check in with their regular pharmacy to see which prescriptions it can still fill and what its capabilities are. 

“The pharmacy that knows you best knows which insurance you have, what meds you’ve filled and are in the best place to help you,” she said. “Even if that’s suggesting you go to another pharmacy.”

NEWS ALERT: Senate passes short-term spending bill to prevent government shut down, heads to Biden next 



CNN 

February 29, 2024, 8:12 AM

Washington (CNN) — A week after a cyberattack disrupted insurance processing at pharmacies across the US, health care professionals from Maryland to New York tell CNN that the hack continues to upend their businesses, potentially cutting into revenue.

Raeya Disney, a psychotherapist who treats trauma victims in Maryland, said she worries she is “at risk of having to give up my office space” if the billing outage continues much longer.

“I’ve begun manually billing and I’m praying that I will be paid,” Disney told CNN.

Purvi Parikh, an allergist with a private practice in New York, said the hacking incident “just puts a lot more burden on physician practices, hospitals, pharmacies that now are scrambling to figure out the alternatives of how to get claims submitted or fill prescriptions.”

Parikh hasn’t been able to submit claims to insurance carriers for a week, she said.

It’s all part of the fallout from a cyberattack that a week ago hit Change Healthcare, a unit of health IT giant UnitedHealth that processes prescriptions to insurance for tens of thousands of pharmacies nationwide.

Carter Groome, chief executive of Health First Advisory, a cybersecurity firm whose clients include big health care organizations, estimated that some health care providers are losing more than $100 million per day because of the outage.

“That’s just not sustainable in an industry with not a lot of cash on hand,” Groome told CNN.

“This is our Colonial Pipeline,” he said, referring to a 2021 ransomware on one of America’s biggest pipelines that disrupted fuel shipments for days and cemented ransomware as a national security concern in the minds of senior US officials.

In the wake of the hack, Elevance Health, which owns Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield and insures millions of Americans, has severed network connections to Change Healthcare “out of an abundance of caution,” Elevance spokesperson Leslie Porras told CNN in an email.

“The ability for our members to access medical care, services or fill their prescriptions remains unaffected,” Porras said.

As of Wednesday morning, Change Health Care said the company’s affected network was still offline. Tyler Mason, a company spokesperson, said that insurance claims submissions have returned to “pre-disruption levels” because health care providers are using “alternative clearing houses” to submit claims.

Mason said that doctors and patients can use these workarounds to address the problems described by Parikh and Disney.

“Since identifying the cyber incident, we have worked closely with customers and clients to ensure people have access to the medications and the care they need,” Mason said in an email. “As we remediate, the most impacted partners are those who have disconnected from our systems and/or have not chosen to execute workarounds.”

But confusion among some health care professionals about how to adapt to the situation remains.

Amy Cizik, a health care researcher in Utah, has been trying to get her pharmacy in Salt Lake City to process her insurance for days. Her 16-year-old daughter has a rare genetic syndrome and takes multiple medications to manage the conditions that come with the syndrome, Cizik told CNN.

“She needs the drug to function at school, to function well in our household,” Cizik said.

With medication running out, Cizik said she spent an hour on the phone Tuesday trying to resolve the situation. The pharmacy transferred her to the insurance provider, which transferred her to another firm that handles prescription drug benefits on behalf of insurers.

No one could resolve the issue, she said.

“As somebody who has a child with chronic illness with multiple prescriptions who works a fulltime job, me caring for her is a whole other job that I do,” she said. “And this is just adding to that.”

Cizik said the pharmacy was finally able to process her insurance on Wednesday morning, narrowly avoiding having to pay $1,000 over the counter for the medication.

Senior US cyber officials have been concerned about the cyberattack from the moment that news of the hack broke. Officials from the FBI and departments of Health and Human Service (HHS) and Homeland Security have held regular calls for days to try to get a handle on the problem, CNN previously reported.

Andrea Palm, the deputy HHS secretary, told CNN on Tuesday that the department continues to be in close touch with Change Healthcare as the company tries to restore its network.

Forensic evidence recovered in the investigation indicates that a prolific ransomware gang was responsible for the hack, according to private briefings Change Healthcare executives have given to other health care executives, two people familiar with the conversations told CNN.

The ransomware gang, which includes Russian-speaking cybercriminals, rents out their so-called malicious software, known as ALPHV or BlackCat. Hackers using the malware have claimed a slew of attacks on US universities, health care providers and hotels in the last 18 months. On Wednesday, the ransomware gang claimed responsibility for hacking Change Healthcare, listing the company as a victim on its dark-web site.

Reuters first reported on the connection between ALPHV ransomware and the Change Healthcare hack.

The Justice Department in December announced an operation targeting the ALPHV gang, including the seizure of some of its computer infrastructure. But well-oiled cybercriminal groups often bounce back from US law enforcement crackdowns.

As of Tuesday afternoon, the American Hospital Association (AHA), an industry group that represents thousands of hospitals and health care clinics across the US, was still receiving reports from members that the cyberattack was interfering with the processing of insurance claims, John Riggi, AHA’s national advisor for cybersecurity and risk, told CNN.

“This was a systemic attack,” Riggi said. “This was an attack not only on Change Healthcare. This was an attack on the entire health care sector.”

The COVID-19 pandemic was a breaking point for 43-year-old Tamalyn Paredes, an addiction counselor at a methadone clinic in Portland, Oregon. Living in California at the time, she worked at a group home for children with serious emotional disturbances – a job she described as taxing, especially when kids would lash out. 

Helping those with mental health conditions hit close to home for Paredes. She lived with depression and suicidal thoughts for years, but the hormonal side effects of ovary removal surgery in 2019 made things worse.  

“I felt like my life was falling apart,” she said. 

After moving to Oregon for a new job in October 2021, she decided to prioritize her mental health and see a doctor for treatment. She was diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed medications, which she said have been life-changing. 

Today, Paredes takes three medications to manage her mental health. Her sleep quality has improved. She has more control over her emotions. Focusing her attention at work has become easier, especially after being fired for performance issues in previous jobs. 

“I cannot go back to not being medicated,” she said. 

A USA TODAY analysis of Medicaid data for the 60 most used psychiatric drugs showed a growing number of people sought mental health treatment and medication during the pandemic as it pushed people into isolation and dismantled support systems.  

The analysis also revealed a lingering effect of the pandemic: Mental health-related prescriptions rose further in 2022, up 12% from 2019, outpacing the less than 1% growth in overall prescriptions. That includes prescriptions for generic Zoloft, the most common antidepressant medication, which rose 17% over the same period. 

More than half of these drugs saw an increase in prescriptions since 2019, and the steepest increase was among ADHD drugs: Concerta and generic Adderall.

Even before the pandemic, the use of mental health drugs was on the rise due to more affordable medication options and broadening acceptance of mental health treatment. That increase accelerated as the pandemic deepened the country’s mental health crisis following widespread loss and adversity.  

The upending of normal structures due to COVID-19, alongside the heightened awareness of mental health and the expansion of conditions being diagnosed, are likely contributing to the rise in mental health prescription drugs, Amy Werremeyer, president of the American Association of Psychiatric Pharmacists, told USA TODAY. 

According to the Census Bureau’s January 2024 survey, the percentage of people experiencing anxiety or depression remains double that of pre-pandemic levels. 

Across all ages, over a fifth of adults – and more than a third of those under 30 – reported feeling anxious or depressed. Among transgender and bisexual people, the problem is worse: 57% of transgender people and 44% of bisexuals said they experience anxiety or depression. 

“This is just coming to a point where for many people, it’s been unmanageable,” said Dr. Smita Das, chair of the American Psychiatric Association’s addiction council. 

One silver lining of the pandemic, Das said: “We all started to talk about mental health more and bring it to the forefront.” 

The growing toll that the mental health crisis is exacting on the country is borne out in other data, too. For example, lives lost to suicide and drug overdoses are at record levels. 

Policymakers and government officials have taken note and recommended actions to fortify mental health programs and reinforce social support systems, such as creating mobile crisis teams, establishing a national suicide prevention hotline and implementing paid family leave laws.  

U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, last year, issued an advisory underscoring the urgency to address “the public health crisis of loneliness, isolation, and lack of connection.” 

“There's increasing recognition that we shouldn't be thinking about mental health conditions any differently than we think about physical health conditions,” Werremeyer said.  

“But for some reason in the past,” she said, “we have blamed people for having to take depression medication or substance use disorder medication.” 

Financial barriers, such as limited insurance coverage for mental health treatment or high costs for uninsured patients, also make it difficult for some people to access medications, Werremeyer said.  

Mental health drug use has grown over the past two decades — partly due to the introduction of lower-cost generics, according to Arthur Wong, a managing director focused on healthcare at rating agency S&P Global Ratings. 

It has become a high-demand area, Wong said, with drugmakers developing new alternatives and researching novel approaches to treat depression and anxiety.  

Among the generics that became available this century, Zoloft’s generic version, sertraline, is the most widely used drug for mental health, according to USA TODAY’s analysis of federal drug use data. The lower-cost alternative was released 15 years after its brand name hit the market in 1991.  

As of early February, generic Zoloft is 300 times cheaper than the brand name, based on average prices pharmacies pay per pill. That means, a month’s supply of Zoloft can cost patients without insurance upwards of $400, while the average retail price for the generic alternative hovers around $20, according to GoodRx. 

In the last five years, prices of the 30 most prescribed generic psychiatric drugs dropped faster than the average decrease across all generic drugs, based on USA TODAY’s analysis of National Average Drug Acquisition Cost data that contains information about the amount retail community pharmacies pay for drugs.

While generic prices trend downward, brand-name prices have steadily risen, a phenomenon dubbed the “generic paradox.”  

It's not uncommon for brand manufacturers to raise prices after lower-cost generic equivalents become available, said Andrew Mulcahy, a senior health economist at RAND, a nonprofit research organization. 

Less than 10% of prescriptions are for brand-name medications, but drug companies still turn a profit by selling to a “small slice of patients,” Mulcahy said. 

While some patients prefer to take brand-name drugs because they believe generic alternatives are inferior or less effective, despite meeting the same Food and Drug Administration standards, others stay on costlier medications because no other drug works effectively for them.  

The pandemic spurred telehealth expansion, but also aggravated challenges such as burnout among behavioral health workers, high turnover rates and nationwide staffing shortages. 

This, in turn, jeopardizes the quality of care, especially for underserved communities. 

“The vicarious trauma can be high because we hear some horrific stories,” said Tamalyn Paredes, who counsels people with opioid use disorder. 

Paredes treats 140 patients, triple the number she’s supposed to, simply because there are more people in need than there are providers. 

Rural, remote areas are hit especially hard. On many tribal lands, for instance, mental health care “doesn’t exist at all,” said Lori Jump, CEO of StrongHearts Native Helpline, a nonprofit organization that works with Indigenous communities. 

Most non-profit centers that operate under government authority rely on grants to provide for patients who can’t afford to pay. Some received a temporary reprieve through the 2021 American Rescue Plan, which distributed over $3 billion for mental health and substance use grant programs across the country.  

Central Plains Center in Plainview, Texas, was one of 40 community behavioral health clinics to get a federal grant. It received over $1 million. Despite that, CEO Sherri Bohr said she worries about future funding and what will happen once the grant runs out this August.   

The facility, Bohr said, serves under 4,000 people a year, most of whom are low-income, uninsured or enrolled in Medicaid.  

Another concern weighing on her is the shortage of licensed therapists eager to work in rural clinics, Bohr said. “This isn’t the kind of job you get if you just want a paycheck,” she said.  

Case in point: A job opening for a therapist at Central Plains Center has remained unfilled for three years. 

“They don't keep their roots here,” said Jason Johnson, its associate CEO. “They tend to see our small town as a stepping stone.” 

The uptick in people seeking treatment and medication does not provide a full accounting of the impact of the pandemic on mental health because many are reluctant to seek help, particularly people of color, LGBTQ+ communities and people with disabilities. 

It takes time to overcome that hesitation, said Das, a Stanford University professor, adding that among some communities it gets labeled “a personal failing.” 

A 2022 national drug use survey showed that among adults with serious mental illness who didn’t receive treatment, a majority reported that they should have been able to handle their mental health on their own. 

Tanisha Malcom, who is Black and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 20 years ago, said her family didn’t believe in mental illness or therapy. To them, mental health conditions “were not even considered something real,” Malcom said. “No one believed that this was happening to me because ‘it doesn't happen to us.’”  

The New York City resident said the underlying message was, “You have to be strong, be tough. You don't have time to be depressed."" 

Malcom, who lives alone, also felt anxious and unsupported during the pandemic, she said. Watching COVID-19 cases and deaths rise higher and higher worsened her mental health, so she kept the TV off altogether. As someone with comorbidities, Malcom said leaving the house was nerve-racking. She lost friendships and didn’t have a community.  

To remedy this, she co-founded the Black Minds Matter support group in May 2020 at the National Alliance on Mental Illness of New York City to support Black people like herself who live with mental health conditions. Today, the support group is thriving, Malcom said, adding that participants share wisdom about how to navigate every aspect of their daily lives being Black and managing mental health conditions.  

They feel “seen, empowered and cared for. It’s just like a big group hug,” she said. 

Tamalyn Paredes, who helps people with addictions on the opposite coast in Oregon, said she finds fulfillment in her demanding job by connecting patients with the resources they need. Her goal is to become a licensed clinical social worker, drawing from her experiences at the methadone clinic and children’s group home in California. 

“I found that from working with the kids, it gave me street cred,” Paredes said. “People always say, ‘It gets better, it gets better,’ but I’m proof that it does.”  ","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA TODAY'}"

Eagles co-founder Don Henley testified this week that handwritten lyric drafts for their 1976 ""Hotel California"" album that ended up at auction were always his sole property. 

""I always knew those lyrics were my property. I never gifted them or gave them to anybody to keep or sell,"" Henley said in a New York City courtroom on Wednesday. 

Three rare book experts, Glenn Horowitz, Craig Inciardi and Edward Kosinski, are on trial, charged with scheming to sell around 100 pages of ""developmental lyrics to the Eagles song 'Hotel California,'"" according to the original indictment filed by the New York District Attorney's office in 2022.

The manuscripts are collectively valued at over $1 million, according to the district attorney.

Henley has testified that he allowed the unpublished biography writer Ed Sanders to look at the drafts, but he was required to give them back. 

Sanders, who isn’t charged in the case, sold the drafts to Horowitz, who then sold them to Inciardi and Kosinski. The two men then put them up for auction in 2012.

Originally appeared on E! Online

Stephen Baldwin is leaning on his faith.

The ""Usual Suspects"" actor raised eyebrows when he took to Instagram to reshare a post asking for prayers for daughter Hailey Bieber and son-in-law Justin Bieber.

""Christians, please when you think of Justin & Hailey, take a moment to offer a little prayer for them,"" a Feb. 26 Instagram Reel from Victor Marx read, ""to have wisdom, protection and to draw close to the Lord."" The All Things Possible Ministry founder also noted, ""There are special challenges that folks in high visibility positions face.""

In the since-expired Instagram Story, shared by Page Six, Baldwin reposted the Reel, which features Justin playing the guitar and singing ""I Could Sing of Your Love Forever.""

Baldwin did not give a reason as to why he was asking for prayers, and E! News has reached out to reps for Baldwin, Hailey Bieber and Justin Bieber for comment.



Justin Bieber, 29, has maintained a lower profile since 2022, when he canceled his Justice World Tour following his diagnosis with Ramsay Hunt Syndrome, which he explained ""is from this virus that attacks the nerve in my ear and my facial nerves and has caused my face to have paralysis.""

""As the result of this illness, I was not able to complete the North America leg of the Justice Tour,"" he posted to Instagram Stories at the time. ""I realized that I need to make my health the priority right now. So I'm going to take a break from touring for the time being. I'm going to be ok, but I need time to rest and get better.""

Bieber added, ""Thank you for your prayers and support throughout all of this! I love you all passionately!""

The ""What Do You Mean"" singer gave an update on his diagnosis in March 2023, sharing a video of himself, zooming in until he flashed a full grin with the caption, ""Wait for it…""

He eventually made his return to the stage at the NHL All-Star Player draft in Toronto on Feb. 1, singing a medley of his hits.

And while fans were hoping he'd surprise audiences at the Super Bowl alongside friend and mentor Usher on Feb. 11, the ""U Got it Bad"" singer explained why Bieber opted not to participate.

""I think that it might've been the fact that he's just wanting to tell a different story right now,"" Usher said on The Breakfast Club Feb. 16, ""and I understand that.""

The ""Yeah!"" singer added, ""We're gonna do something else in the future. No love lost or anything like that.""","{'href': 'https://www.nbcmiami.com', 'title': 'NBC 6 South Florida'}"

Longtime friends and colleagues are paying tribute to comedian Richard Lewis, who recently passed away at 76 years old. Larry David, who starred alongside Lews in 'Curb Your Enthusiasm', said his co-star was ""like a brother"" to him. ""He had that rare combination of being the funniest person and also the sweetest. But today he made me sob and for that I’ll never forgive him,"" said David. Longtime friend Jamie Lee Curtis credited Lewis as the reason for her sobriety and reminisced about their time together. ""I thought he was handsome. He made me laugh, which is the one thing that a strong, capable woman, can't really do for herself,"" said Curtis. Ben Stiller also shared memories of the actor, saying he had ""never met a kinder, more empathetic comedy genius.""

Get ready, Superman fans! James Gunn, the head honcho at DC Studios, has just dropped some awesome news on Superman's birthday. The iconic superhero is getting a makeover, with a brand-new movie and a fancy new costume. This marks a fresh start for Superman's adventures on the big screen. The makers have further assured that the highly anticipated superhero franchise is officially underway, so keep an eye out for its release in 2025!

First things first: Superman: Legacy is now just SUPERMAN. In either case, it's a suitable title for the mega cinematic comeback of the Man of Steel. With a massive budget at stake and James Gunn at the helm, fans are confident that the forthcoming Superman film will be a visual spectacle. ""When I finished the first draft of the script, I called the film Superman: Legacy."" He continued, By the time I locked the final draft, it was clear the title was SUPERMAN,"" Gunn revealed in his Instagram post.

A Superman shocker no one saw coming! Taking to his Instagram Gunn said, ""Overjoyed to be announcing the start of principal photography on SUPERMAN today, February 29, which just so happens to be - coincidentally and unplanned - Superman's birthday.” The glimpse of the costume shared on Instagram reveal has fans buzzing about the logo. The new design is strikingly similar to Superman from DC Comics from the iconic Kingdom Come storyline by Mark Waid and Alex Ross, which is set in a future parallel reality.

Don't worry, fans! The story still feels new and exciting. Even though the two versions of Superman from Kingdom Come and the DC Universe (DCU) look similar, they're different. Kingdom Come's Superman is older and more experienced, while the DCU's Clark Kent is younger and just starting out as a superhero.

New details surrounding Heath Ledger's death have emerged as Hollywood director Stephen Gaghan revealed the phone call he received after the fact.

Ledger's body was discovered by a housekeeper on Jan. 22, 2008. The ""10 Things I Hate About You"" star's death was ruled accidental and attributed to a mixture of prescription drugs – OxyContin, Vicodin, Valium, Xanax, Unisom and Restoril.

At the time of Ledger's death, Gaghan had been working with the 28-year-old on an adaption of Malcolm Gladwell's ""Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking.""

Gaghan recalled the phone call he received from Ledger’s father after he arrived at the scene.

""They were there with the body and our script was in bed with him, and your book was on the bedside table,"" he said on Gladwell's ""Revisionist History"" podcast series ""Development Hell."" ""I think my number was on the script, like written. These guys, as you can imagine, they are in shock and they dialed that number and I don’t know why.""

""I’m in an airport with my wife [Minnie Mortimer] just going from one place to another, and I literally just collapse, never happened to me before or since,"" the director added. ""My feet went out from under me. I just literally sat down because I was like, 'What?' The emotion, what they were going through, I should not have been a party to in any way really, and yet as a human or as somebody who just cares, I just was there and I was listening and my wife was looking at me. I remember her face and I was just like, I was speechless. I just listened and listened and listened. It was just really, really sad. And it’s still sad. For me, I just had to put a pin in it.""

Gladwell's podcast series revisits projects that were never made – including the ""Blink"" adaptation. With Leonardo DiCaprio attached to the project, the film originally landed with a studio in 2005. However, it never got off the ground.

""We pick a studio, we huddle with our agents, we pick a winner, checks are cashed,"" Gladwell said. ""Some brilliant producer is assigned to our case, and off we go. Only it never happens. A year passes, then two years, then three years. And this is why we’re doing ‘Development Hell,’ an entire series devoted to scripts that never happen. This is always the most devastating part of the story, the plot twists that happen off the page.""

Eventually, ""Blink"" landed with Universal Studios and Gaghan spent some more time developing the script. After re-working DiCaprio's character, the director realized he had written the part for Ledger.

""I’d gotten to be very, very close with him instantly,"" Gaghan recalled. ""I just had a real connection with him that was kind of unusual and really special to me. I got really excited and I started seeing him as the main character. Once I started seeing that I couldn’t unsee it, and obviously it was very delicate in a way. Leo’s totally cool. I mean, obviously, he has a thousand choices, but in my mind it was a big deal.""

Gaghan abandoned the revived project after Ledger's death.

Justin Timberlake will be out with a new album which will release on March 15.

Did Justin Timberlake just confirm that NSYNC will reunite for singer’s upcoming song? Justin Timberlake will soon be out with a new song titled “Paradise”. The song will be a part of a larger album rollout that is set to release on March 15.

While making the announcement of the new album, Justin seemed to hint that his former band NSYNC might come together and feature in one of the songs. Almost confirming what their fans have been wishing upon for a long time, Justin Timberlake took to TikTok to reply to a fan’s comment on his recent announcement. 

A fan wrote, “Blink twice if *NSYNC is on a song called ‘Paradise’.” Justin Timberlake responded to that comment with a candid video that showed him moving his sunglasses to reveal his eyes, intentionally blinking twice before flashing a sly smile.

Raising eyebrows, NSYNC members too played along. NSYNC member Chris Kirkpatrick responded with eye emoji comments and Lance Bass responded with his own video. Members JC Chasez and Joey Fatone have yet to comment on the same. 

The comment came on Justin Timberlake’s announcement for deluxe vinyl edition of “Everything I Thought It Was”. 

This news comes just months after NSYNC joined forces on a new song for the first time in more than two decades as part of the soundtrack of the film Trolls Band Together. 

In addition, Justin Timberlake also teased new music from NSYNC during an appearance on The Kelly Clarkson Show earlier this January. He told Kelly that the band had been in the studio, “so there may be a little something in the future, too.”","{'href': 'https://www.wionews.com', 'title': 'WION'}"

BUFFALO, N.Y. — Two weeks after a mother and daughter were killed while walking out of a Drake concert in St. Louis, the Canadian rapper mentioned them in a stadium filled with 18,000 fans as a reminder of how fragile life is.

Drake mentioned the Feb. 14 incident during his concert in Buffalo, New York, during a monologue in the middle of his show on Tuesday night. He specifically mentioned watching a viral video showing the moment the car hit 42-year-old Laticha Bracero and 21-year-old Alyssa Cordova, a video that the now-released suspected driver's defense attorney said may cause issues in the prosecution of the case.

""I saw a video today ... we had a show in St. Louis where a mother and her young daughter lost their life leaving the show,"" Drake said at the Buffalo concert. ""I wanted to say to you, as happy as these [concerts] are, I wanted to say to you that you never know what somebody else's reality will be when they walk out of this building.""

Drake immediately followed up the mention with a call to action for all of his fans.

""For this moment that all of us are together, all 18,000 people, what I want to do ... I want you to turn to somebody that you do not know, I want you to look them in the eyes, and I want you to prove that you are grateful for your life,"" he said. ""I want you to take five seconds out of your day to make somebody else's day. Just show them some love, because you never know what comes next.""

Kanye West's wife, Bianca Censori, often finds herself in the spotlight for her bold fashion choices. The 29-year-old model, who works with his Yeezy brand, has a well-established reputation for pushing boundaries with her outfits, sometimes attracting controversy and scrutiny. At the recent Paris Fashion Week, the couple once again drew attention for their daring fashion statements. However, unlike in the United States, Censori's choices could potentially violate French decency laws.

On February 27, against the backdrop of Paris' cobbled streets, the young model made a striking appearance. Dressed in sheer leggings without underwear and a transparent blue cropped top, the young model made heads turn. Adding a touch of glamour, she draped herself in a fur coat and matching boots. While many expected her to don a designer piece or a statement outfit in the fashion capital, she chose to go her own way. Yet, the ensemble worn by Censori in France surpassed typical levels of exposure, potentially breaking the nation's laws on indecent exposure.

Article 222-32 of the French Penal Code, enacted in March 1994, specifies that…""Deliberate sexual display in the sight of others in a place accessible to the public gaze is punishable by one year in prison and a fine of one hundred thousand francs."" Furthermore, the law also says, “The charge has been worded in such a way as to rule out any possibility of proceedings against persons practicing naturism in places specially designated for this purpose.""

The couple was fined £10,000 in 2023 for strolling ""almost naked"" in public in Italy prior to this incident. They were given the choice by the Italian Constitutional Court to pay the fine or go to jail for breaking the law.

Sources close to Kanye West's fashion projects have disclosed that West has a dedicated design team based in Italy who create clothing for him and, in this specific instance, Censori. Furthermore, West has partnered with Mowalola Ogunlesi, a London-based designer of Nigerian descent, to design the Yeezy Gap collection. As per Page Six, Ogunlesi said, ""She (Bianca) has a lot to say in what she wants to wear. Everything Bianca is wearing is really from her and Ye's brains. They want to show people that you can do this yourself. It's stuff that's attainable - tights. With tights, you can cut them and sew it - if it doesn't work out you can put on another pair.""

Triptii Dimri's intimate scene with Ranbir Kapoor in Animal might have earned her a new fan base, but it did leave her parents 'completely rattled'. In an interview with Vogue India, Triptii got candid about the sequence with Ranbir, and having ‘to have a long discussion on why that scene was crucial’ with her parents after they watched Animal. She also defended her decision to do Animal. Also read | CBFC deletes close-up shots of an intimate scene in Ranbir Kapoor's Animal: A list of all censor cuts

Triptii Dimri said, ""I know my reasons for doing the film. Sandeep sir [director Sandeep Reddy Vanga] was clear that it was going to be a small role, but I found the character interesting. If we start making decisions based on what audiences are going to say, then as actors, we won’t ever be able to do what we want to do. I want to choose roles that push me out of my comfort zone. There’s a lot of advice on offer and I listen to it all, but it comes down to instinct. I might make mistakes along the way, but I’m allowed to.”

On her intimate scene with Ranbir Kapoor in Animal, Triptii said, “My parents were completely rattled when they saw it. We had to have a long discussion on why that scene was crucial.""

A few days before Animal's release on December 1, the Central Board of Film Certification had suggested eight cuts to Sandeep Vanga Reddy's Ranbir Kapoor-starrer, including an 'intimate scene' between two characters. Close up shots of the characters – Ranbir's Rannvijay Singh aka Vijay and Triptii Dimri's Zoya – were deleted in an intimate sequence.

In December 2023, during an interview with India Today, Triptii had said Ranbir and others on set kept asking her if she was okay during the shooting of the intimate scene.

She had said, ""They ensured that there were no more than five people, including the director, the DOP, and the actors during the scene. Nobody else was allowed on set, all the monitors were shut, and they were like, ‘this is the scene we are doing. If at any point you feel you're uncomfortable, let us know. We'll go at your pace... Every five minutes, Ranbir Kapoor was checking up on me and asking, ‘Are you okay, are you comfortable?’ I think these things really matter. People are sensitive to these things.”

Anil Kapoor plays Ranbir's father in the film, while Rashmika Mandanna is paired opposite him. Bobby Deol plays the antagonist in the film that was released in five languages – Hindi, Tamil, Malayalam, Telugu and Kannada – and performed very well at the box office.

Imtiaz Ali’s Diljit Dosanjh and Parineeti Chopra-starrer Amar Singh Chamkila will premiere on Netflix on April 12. The film is based on the life of the titular singer, who was assassinated at age 27. Talking about the biopic at a press meet, Diljit stated that he was initially apprehensive about how the film would be made.

A post shared by Netflix India (@netflix_in)

India Today quoted Diljith as saying, “I thought I knew a lot about Chamkila before I met Imtiaz sir. Humein jab pata chala ki Bollywood mein film bann rahi hai Chamkila, toh humein laga ki ye kya banayenge? Hum banayenge, humne Jodi film banayi hai, jiske humein rights nahi mile toh humne fiction bana di. (When I learnt Bollywood is making a film on Chamkila, I wondered what they would make. I made it, I made a film called Jodi, I didn’t get the rights for it, so I turned it fictional.) I thought they wouldn’t be able to make it. When the pandemic hit and Jodi wasn’t released, I got a call from Imtiaz sir. I thought I was getting sued but he wanted to cast me in his film instead.”

Diljith admits that he changed his mind once he heard Imtiaz’s idea for the film. “His perspective was different. It was Chamkila’s story, even I didn’t know that well. Amar Singh Chamkila wrote his own music, played it himself, and performed it on stage. So, the fact that such a big film was going to be made on him was a matter of pride for me and my people. I just surrendered to Imtiaz sir’s vision,” he said.

A post shared by DILJIT DOSANJH (@diljitdosanjh)

Parineeti plays Chamkila’s wife Amarjot in the film. She was also a proficient singer and often collaborated with her husband. Chamkila and Amarjot were both killed in an assassination in the 1980s that remains unsolved. AR Rahman has composed the film's music.

Multiple conspiracy theories have been floating around regarding the Princess of Wales' health in recent days. 

Middleton underwent abdominal surgery last month, but speculations on the 42-year-old's health did not arise until Prince William ""unexpectedly withdrew"" himself from his godfather's memorial service on Tuesday (February 27). According to People, a spokesperson for Kensington Palace caught word of the various health conspiracies circulating the internet and decided to put the rumors to bed. 

""We were very clear from the outset that the Princess of Wales was out until after Easter and Kensington Palace would only be providing updates when something was significant.""

The Princesses' spokesperson assured that Middleton is ""doing well"" and that the recovery process is going smoothly. As previously stated, Kensington Palace released multiple statements regarding the royal mother-of-three's post-surgery recovery that revealed inside information on the timeline. The statement in question directly noted that Middleton would not ""return to public duties until after Easter.""

The Princess of Wales remained in the hospital for 13 days postoperative and was safely escorted back to Kensington Palace to heal. Per People, a ""a source close to the royal household"" urged all citizens to model Middleton's behavior in taking proper time to recover after an ailment. 

Thanks to the latest information from Kensington Palace, the public can now be sure that Middleton is in fact healing properly, and is predicted to make a highly-anticipated return to the public eye towards the end of March. ","{'href': 'https://y100.iheart.com', 'title': 'Y100'}"

While this story itself isn't a thing of the new, the X (formerly Twitter) trend #HYBEDivestFromZionism may likely have caught your eye lately during daily internet scrolling sessions. Fans of several groups under the HYBE label banner (BTS, SEVENTEEN, TOMORROW X TOGETHER, LE SSERAFIM, NewJeans, ENHYPEN and others) have called a boycott campaign to action, urging the Korean entertainment company to dismiss its American unit's CEO, Scooter Braun. While the campaign rages on and continues to spread awareness like wildfire, BTS fans, aka ARMYs, have especially taken the pioneering stand against Braun's alleged support of Israel as the ravaging conflict continues to tear down Palestine's Gaza Strip.

At a rally held in Tel Aviv in December 2023, Braun had urged for the Israeli captives to be returned, who'd been taken hostage during the October 7 attacks when Hamas gunmen stormed into Israel. “I had to come and stand with my people,” said the American producer. In later reports, the Korean label had remarked, “It's a personal statement that is separate from company management” (The Korea Times). However, the music giant that merged with Braun's Ithaca Holdings in 2021 has yet to comment on the ongoing fan protests.

Many HYBE group fans have long been silently boycotting the label's merchandise, demonstrating their rejection of the company's association with Braun. However, the latest development around this arena has taken a bigger step to publicising their moral fight against HYBE America CEO's position. Some fans sent a truck to the company's Seoul headquarters on February 23, again pushing for Braun to be removed from operations.

This campaign hasn't been constrained to the HYBE backyard. Fans have advocated for the removal of ‘Zionists in the industry’ by targeting all ‘big four’ of the K-pop industry - HYBE Entertainment, YG Entertainment, JYP Entertainment and SM Entertainment. Alongside #HYBEDivestFromZionism, #하이브시오니스트를제거하다 and #StrikeAgainstThe4 have also partaken in the race for advocacy. Meanwhile, a ‘Help Divest Scooter Braun from HYBE’ Change.org petition has also been initiated.

To name a few, American record producer Benny Blanco, Israeli songwriter Omer Fedi and others also joined the ranks of similarly invoked criticism.

One of the trucks sent earlier displayed a harrowing view of Palestine in ruins, with the message, “They could've been your friend”. Another slide adds to the message campaign message, seeking out the industry's underlying humanity:

""Korean and international ARMY demand HYBE divests from Zionism and Zionists in the industry.

If our demands are not met ARMY will continue to push for you to meet our demands. Do not look away when the same thing that happened to your Korean ancestors is happening to Palestinians!

We ask that you stand for humanity, for the right side of history, and against violence.""

The deal has been done between the Panorama Studio, who have joined hands with Gulfstream Pictures and JOAT Films to acquire rights of ‘Drishyam’ 1 & 2 in Hollywood.

Dave Myers, one half of TV cooking duo The Hairy Bikers, has died at the age of 66, two years after revealing he had been diagnosed with cancer.

Myers, from Barrow-in-Furness, found fame alongside Si King 20 years ago.

The bearded pair were known for travelling around the UK and the world on their motorbikes, sampling and cooking food from different regions.

King said he ""will miss him every day and the bond and friendship we shared over half a lifetime"".

Others paying tribute included fellow celebrity chef James Martin, who called him ""a very special man"".

The Great British Bake Off judge Paul Hollywood said he was ""gutted"".

The Great British Menu host Andi Oliver wrote that she was ""so so sad to hear"" the news, adding: ""My heart goes out to you all xx.""

Food critic Jay Rayner remembered Myers as ""a brilliant cook, a superb communicator and most of all a seriously lovely man"".

Strictly Come Dancing's Karen Hauer, who partnered Myers on the show in 2013, said she was ""heartbroken"".

Announcing the news on Thursday, King wrote: ""I'm afraid I bear some sad news. Most of you will know Dave has been fighting cancer for the past couple of years.""

He ""passed away peacefully at home"" on Wednesday with wife Lili, family and close friends at his side, King wrote.

""All who knew Dave are devastated at his passing. His beloved wife brought him such happiness as did her children, Iza and Sergiu who Dave loved like his own. 

""Personally, I am not sure I can put into words on how I feel at the moment. My best friend is on a journey that for now, I can't follow.

""I will miss him every day and the bond and friendship we shared over half a lifetime. I wish you God's speed brother; you are and will remain a beacon in this world. See you on the other side. Love ya.""

King continued that Myers would want him to thank everyone who sent messages of support during his illness. ""We are eternally grateful for them.""

He added: ""May I ask you all for one further kindness and allow Lili, his wife, his family, close friends and I some time and some peace to process our huge loss. I am sure I will see you all soon.""

The pair's latest series, The Hairy Bikers Go West, started this month and sees them travel down the UK's west coast.

In the first episode, he told viewers it was ""a dream come true"" to be back on his motorbike because he ""wasn't sure I'd ever get back in the saddle again"".

""There was a time I couldn't balance, I couldn't walk, I didn't think I'd be getting on a bike,"" he said.

Myers and King met in the 1990s and went on to become household names while presenting The Hairy Bikers' Cookbook on BBC TV together from 2006.

That show saw them ride across countries including Portugal, Romania and Namibia.

Future series included The Hairy Bikers Ride Again, The Hairy Bikers' Food Tour of Britain, The Hairy Bikers: Mums Know Best, The Hairy Bikers' Asian Adventure and Hairy Bikers: Best of British.

The Hairy Bikers published more than 30 recipe books, selling more than six million copies, and documented their weight loss in Hairy Dieters: How To Love Food And Lose Weight.

Myers also fronted a show called The Hairy Builder, about historic buildings.

Paying tribute, BBC chief content officer Charlotte Moore said: ""Everyone at the BBC is incredibly sad to hear this news.

""Dave made cooking a truly joyful adventure and he shared that joy with millions. The public loved him and his unique partnership with Si.

""Together they made every viewer feel like a friend. More than that he was simply a lovely man. Our thoughts go out to his family and many friends.""

Viewers also paid tribute, with one writing on X that ""Si and Dave have been a big part of me learning to cook, and their recipes a source of joy among my family"".

Another posted: ""Rest in peace mate, you and Si are directly responsible for so much of my love of cooking.""

Myers gained a love of food at an early age from his mother, a crane driver at the local shipyard as well as an excellent cook. His father, the foreman of a paper mill, would take him on fishing trips the back of his motorbike.

But when his mum developed multiple sclerosis, the responsibility for food shopping and cooking fell to Myers around the age of 12.

Alongside his dad, he was a young carer for his mother. ""In those days there wasn't much support for that,"" he told BBC Radio 4 in 2019. ""It was very hard, really. I've got a lot of sympathy for young carers today.""

Around that time, Myers developed alopecia, which doctors put down to the shock of his mother's illness.

""There's an irony, as a Hairy Biker,"" he said. ""I had no hair, no eyebrows, no eyelashes.""

He remained largely bald until his early 40s, when he had an operation to remove a cyst from his brain - which he suspected may have been the cause of the alopecia all along.

""My hair grew back complete as it is now with male pattern baldness. So that's the story of the unhairy Hairy Biker.""

After leaving home, Myers studied fine art at Goldsmiths in London, before spotting an advert to train as a make-up artist at the BBC.

He had little experience of make-up and was surprised to get the job. ""Much to my amazement I turned up for work and I was the first male make-up artist at Television Centre.""

He stayed for 23 years, working on shows ranging from Doctor Who to period dramas, and was said to have once painted the white stripe on pop star Adam Ant's face.

It was while doing make-up for a TV adaptation of Catherine Cookson's The Gambling Man that Myers met King, who was employed as a second assistant director.

The pair ""got on like a house on fire"", Myers said, and they began going on road trips to sample food in different places. One day, they had an idea - what if they filmed themselves on their foodie excursions.

They pitched a TV show to several producers they had previously worked with. ""And we never looked back.""

Myers met future wife Liliana Orzac while filming The Hairy Bikers in Romania, and she was the manager of the hotel.

""For many years my biggest regret in life was the fact I hadn't had children,"" he once said. ""But when I married Lil I had this ready-made family with two stepchildren and it brought me such joy.""

On Thursday evening, parents-to-be Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh were clicked at Mumbai and Jamnagar airports. The actors had just shared their pregnancy news earlier in the day and were adorably twinning in white as they arrived for Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant’s pre-wedding festivities in Jamnagar. (Also Read: Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh twin in white as they're spotted for the first time since pregnancy announcement)

As Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh arrived at Jamnagar, they were mobbed by fans, who wanted to click pictures and selfies. Ranveer could be seen holding Deepika’s hand and helping her make her way to their car. He even put his arms around her to protect her from the crowd. Ranveer looked happy as he couldn’t stop grinning and waved to fans. The couple was also flanked by security, who kept the crowd from getting too close.

A post shared by Manav Manglani (@manav.manglani)

After Deepika presented an award at the BAFTA Awards recently, there were rumours that she was hiding a baby bump with her shimmery Sabyasachi saree. The pictures she posted on her Instagram also covered her bump and The Week reported recently that the actor was in the second trimester of her pregnancy. The couple confirmed the news on Thursday, by sharing a post that simply read, ‘September, 2024.’ Congratulatory messages poured in for the couple from fans and celebs alike.

A post shared by दीपिका पादुकोण (@deepikapadukone)

Post the announcement, Deepika and Ranveer made their first appearance at the Mumbai airport as they flew out of the city. Deepika looked radiant in a white dress paired with a matching sweater while Ranveer opted for a sweatshirt and pants in white. The couple got married in 2018 and have worked together in films like Goliyon Ka Raasleela Ram-Leela, Bajirao Mastani and Padmaavat.

A post shared by Manav Manglani (@manav.manglani)

Ranveer is currently shooting for Singham Again with Rohit Shetty. He is also rumoured to star in Shaktimaan movie, directed by Basil Joseph of Minnal Murali fame. Deepika also stars in Singham Again, apart from Nag Ashwin’s Kalki 2898 AD with Prabhas, Kamal Haasan and Amitabh Bachchan.

Monfils is celebrated on Leap DayPegula is all business in her return to the court

It is Leap Day 2024.  Since leap year happens only once every four years, it is a good opportunity to celebrate one of the greatest tennis leapers and athletes ever to play the game, 37-year-old French tennis player Gael Monfils.  If you need more proof that Monfils is an expert leaper, you must Google  ""Gael Monfils leaper,"" and many articles, images, and videos will appear.

Tennis TV commemorated the day by creating a video montage of some of Monfils' superhuman leaps in pursuit of a tennis ball.  Prepare to be enchanted and amazed as you watch.

All he does is leap, leap, leap 🦘Happy Leap Year! 📆@Gael_Monfils #LeapYear pic.twitter.com/V1kfc00CQ2

With all of the talk of real-life tennis couples playing together on the court, as Paula Badosa and Stefanos Tsitsipas plan to at next week's Indian Wells Eisenhower Cup exhibition, when will we see Monfils and his wife Ukrainian tennis player Elina Svitolina play mixed doubles together?  I am beckoning the tennis gods to make this happen sometime in 2024.

Fans were anxious to see Jessica Pegula back on the court.  She has been missed. Her schedule has been unusually light in 2024 since she opted out of the Middle Eastern swing while dealing with an injury.  During that time, she also split from longtime coach David Witt.

JESSICA PEGULA WE LOVE YOU! pic.twitter.com/FuK7NElLgQ

Pegula, who turned 30 on February 24, won both her opening matches in singles and doubles so it has been a happy return.  She was pleased to usher in her ""dirty 30s"" with wins. Her coaching arrangement is described as a collaboration between Mark Merklein and Mark Knowles.  Neither of the Marks can travel with her full-time.  In her first tournament without Witt, Merklein is in her box in San Diego.  Hopefully, the new voices on her team allow her to flourish in 2024.

WTA Staff


Four more Top 10 players have joined the star-studded field at the 2024 Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart, Germany.

Over the past week, the tournament announced that Coco Gauff, Marketa Vondrousova, Ons Jabeur and Jelena Ostapenko are set to appear at the WTA 500 indoor clay-court event, which starts on April 15.

""First of all, [Gauff is] a player I love watching,” said Markus Günthardt, the Tournament Director of the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix. ‟And secondly, we’ll be hosting all four reigning Grand Slam champions.”

""Ons is one of the nicest players on the Tour[,] the fans love her,” said Anke Huber, the former World No.4 and the Operating Tournament Director of the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix. ‟Jelena has started the year off well and is always good for a surprise. The fact that Marketa, the Wimbledon champion will be back in Stuttgart is an accolade for our tournament.”

“I am excited to kick off the clay court swing in Stuttgart.”And we are excited to welcoming you back in the Porsche Arena, @CocoGauff! 🧡Read more about Coco's return: https://t.co/NtoLIxAAms pic.twitter.com/GfJLuyG6ri

Reigning US Open champion Gauff will contest the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix for the third straight year. The World No.3 and 2022 Roland Garros finalist is planning to kick off her clay-court season in Stuttgart.

Three-time Grand Slam finalist Jabeur has gone deep in each of her two previous Stuttgart appearances. She reached the quarterfinals in her 2022 tournament debut, then went one better last year, making the semifinals before having to retire against World No.1 Iga Swiatek.

Reigning Wimbledon champion Vondrousova will be making her first Stuttgart appearance since 2022, when she lost to Jabeur in the first round. Vondrousova avenged that loss multiple times since then, including defeating Jabeur for last year's Wimbledon title.

Ostapenko will be in Stuttgart for the sixth time in her career; she lost to Jabeur in the second round last year. Ostapenko's best career result at the event was a quarterfinal run in 2018, the year after she won Roland Garros.

Gauff, Vondrousova and Ostapenko have increased the number of Grand Slam champions already entered into the field from four to seven. They join fellow major champions Iga Swiatek, Aryna Sabalenka, Angelique Kerber and Emma Raducanu as early entrants.

Swiatek is the two-time defending Stuttgart champion, while Kerber also won this title back-to-back on her home soil, in 2015 and 2016. Two-time Australian Open champion Sabalenka has come very close to winning the Stuttgart title as well, having finished runner-up in each of the last three years.

The Porsche Tennis Grand Prix was first played in Filderstadt in 1978, and it has been held at the Porsche Arena in Stuttgart since 2006. Since moving to Stuttgart, other former champions include Justine Henin, Maria Sharapova, Petra Kvitova, Svetlana Kuznetsova and Ashleigh Barty.

Emma Raducanu handed a wild card alongside Venus Williams, Caroline Wozniacki and Kei Nishikori for next month's Miami Open; watch over 80 tournaments a year, including the US Open, exclusively live on Sky Sports Tennis

Thursday 29 February 2024 15:52, UK

Emma Raducanu has been awarded a wild card for the Miami Open which takes place at the iconic Hard Rock Stadium from March 17-31, live on Sky Sports Tennis.

The former US Open champion, who is ranked No 252 in the world, was beaten in the first round by Anhelina Kalinina in her last match at the Qatar Open.

Raducanu has already used wild cards to enter tournaments in Abu Dhabi and Qatar in February and she is expected to play in the main draw at Indian Wells, starting on Wednesday, March 6.

The Brit has a protected ranking of 103, which is not high enough to secure a spot in the main draw at Indian Wells.

There are 96 singles players who get direct entry into the prestigious tournament along with 12 qualifiers and eight wild cards.

Two of those wild cards have been given to Caroline Wozniacki and Venus Williams, and it has been reported that Raducanu has flown to Los Angeles and is expected to play at the Masters 1000 event in the desert.

A three-time champion in Miami, Williams boasts a remarkable seven Grand Slam singles titles over her illustrious career and has played in a record-breaking 93 Grand Slam tournaments.

Australian Open Champion, Wozniacki, a finalist in Miami in 2017, returns for the first time since 2019, having had a three-year break following the birth of her two children. After returning to competition last August, she immediately impressed, reaching the fourth round at the 2023 US Open.

Also making a return from injury is Kei Nishikori, which will be his first competitive start since July 2023.

A player who is out of competition for more than six months but less than one year may use her special ranking for up to eight tournaments in a one-year period.
A player who is out of competition for one year or more may use her special ranking for up to 12 tournaments in a one-year period.
If a player is out of competition due to pregnancy or a medical condition, she is allowed three years to use her special ranking. In the event of pregnancy, the time period is calculated from the birth of the child.
Upon her return, a player is eligible to use her special ranking for seeding purposes at the first eight WTA tournaments she plays.
A player may freeze her ranking up to two times. Under the previous rule, a player was allowed to freeze her ranking just once.

Sky Sports has confirmed a new home for tennis in the UK and Ireland, with Sky Sports Tennis on Sky and NOW, making tennis content available all day, every day for fans.

ORLANDO – A familiar opponent will make the trip east on I-4 to open the UCF men’s tennis team’s three-match homestand. The Knights and South Florida will meet for the first time in non-conference play since 2013 Friday night at the USTA National Campus, beginning a new chapter between the programs. First serve is set for 6 p.m. as the Knights will be honoring multiple alumni before the match.

UCF (8-1) bounced back last Sunday in its second consecutive triumph over the Blazers in Birmingham, 5-2, ahead of the much anticipated matchup with the Bulls (5-6). The squad picked up its third doubles point of the season en route to another strong display in singles. Overall, a quartet of Knights took care of business in straight sets, including Mehdi Benchakroun who clinched the bout on court six with a 6-2, 6-3, win over Juan Pablo Valdez.

Currently 5-0 in front of the Knights faithful, UCF is embarking on its final stretch of non-conference action before starting its inaugural slate in the Big 12 at Texas on March 22. In the latest ITA team rankings, the Knights checked in at No. 44 as they continue to be one of six conference teams to rank among the top 50 in the nation.

Four were placed in the top 25, including No. 2 TCU who UCF will conclude its regular season against in Fort Worth in April. The Longhorns slotted in at No. 10, followed by Baylor, who secured its highest ranking of the season at No. 14 and was capped off with Oklahoma State at No. 24.

KNIGHT NOTABLES

THE OPPONENT

Friday’s matchup between the Bulls and Knights will mark the 50th in more than half-century of history. The programs met for the first time in 1977 and since have tested each other for nearly a decade in the American Athletic Conference.

In 2023, the Knights did the double over South Florida, defeating them in Tampa, 4-3, before doing the same in the quarterfinals of the AAC Championship to conclude another chapter of this historical matchup. Both teams retain similar rosters to last year’s contests, with the major difference coming from head coach Lloyd Bruce-Burgess, who will face his former school for the first time leading a program, as he served as an assistant with USF in the fall of 2019.

Ranked 66th in the latest ITA team rankings, South Florida is led by Alvin Tudorica who has climbed to No. 36 in the nation and holds a 9-2 record on court one throughout the first half of the season. The familiar faces of Eric Grevelius (7-2) and Oliveira Bruno (4-4) remain pillars of the Bulls’ play in singles.

Grevelius and Tudorica sit seven places behind Giamichelle and Cronje in the doubles rankings at No. 40 and hold a 6-3 record thus far. Dlimi and Tudorica faced off on court three in Tampa last season, with the Moroccan coming out on top, 6-4, 6-2, as the two are potentially set for a rematch on court one.

The Bulls enter the contest on a three-match losing streak following wins over two common opponents, Georgia Southern, 4-3, and FGCU, 6-1. The stretch included three 4-3 defeats to Memphis, Santa Clara and Troy.

NORMAL, Ill. – A stretch of three matches in three days awaits the Illinois State men's tennis team this weekend, as the Redbirds open Summit League action at home on Friday before heading to Chicago for matches on Saturday and Sunday.

""This is a huge weekend as we kick off conference play on Friday,"" ISU head coach Mark Klysner said. ""Omaha has had a great start to their season, so I expect it to be a close match. Hopefully we can get a decent crowd to come support the guys. Saturday and Sunday will again be some tough tests for us on the road in Chicago, but we've been playing well lately, and our doubles is getting better each week.""

SCOUTING THE REDBIRDS
•    The Redbirds (7-5) head into the weekend after winning a pair of matches last weekend against Missouri-St. Louis and Illinois Wesleyan.
•    Last weekend, the Redbirds were led by Emiliano Gonzalez who picked up a pair of wins at the No. 1 doubles spot with two different partners on Saturday and picked up a pair of singles wins, one at the No. 2 spot and one at the No. 4 spot.
•    Last season, the Redbirds picked up wins against all three of these teams during the spring slate. 

SCOUTING THE MAVERICKS
•    The Mavericks (10-4) are off to a great start to the spring season and head into Friday's match as winners of eight straight matches. 
•    Omaha is coming off a thrilling win over crosstown rival Creighton last weekend. The Mavericks trailed 3-1 before starting their comeback run. Creighton took the early lead after winning the doubles point, but Omaha got wins in the 1, 2, 3 and 5 spots from Mikhail Korkunov, Ryoma Mishiro, Quintan Van Wijk and Ethan Gaubert to take the victory.
•    Mishiro, who was recently named the Summit League Performer of the Week, won the clincher 6-4, 7-6.

SCOUTING THE COUGARS
•    The Cougars (1-9) head into weekend coming off a close 4-3 loss at home last weekend to St. Louis.
•    Chicago State won the doubles point and Pedro Alvarez won in straight sets at No. 1 singles before the Billikens won the next three to turn a 2-0 deficit into a 3-2 lead. Rodrigo Alves then won in straight sets at No. 2 to knot the match 3-3, leaving the deciding match at No. 5 where Percy Siercke lost 6-4, 6-4.
•    Chicago State will open the weekend with a match on Friday against Southern University, before hosting the Redbirds on Saturday at the Park Forest Health and Fitness Club.

SCOUTING THE FLAMES
•    The Flames (5-3) have won three straight matches and five out of their last six overall but have not competed since Feb. 17.
•    UIC finished a fantastic month of February by defeating Duquesne by a final of 5-2 last time out.
•    Senior Aleksa Bucan was named the MAC Singles Player of the Week on Feb. 20, after he went 2-0 for the Flames at the No. 2 singles position to help UIC to road victories at Cleveland State and at Duquesne.

ITHACA, N.Y. -- After six straight matches away from Ithaca, the No. 57 ranked Cornell men's tennis team will finally return home for a Saturday doubleheader against Southern Methodist University and Hobart College from the Reis Tennis Center.

SMU AT #57 CORNELL
SITE: Reis Tennis Center
DATE and TIME: Saturday, March 2 at Noon
RECORDS: SMU (8-6, 2-0 AAC), Cornell (7-3, 0-0 Ivy)
SERIES RECORD: SMU leads, 3-0

HOBART AT #57 CORNELL
SITE: Reis Tennis Center
DATE and TIME: Saturday, March 2 at 5 p.m.
RECORDS: Hobart (0-1, 0-0 Liberty), Cornell (7-3, 0-0 Ivy)
SERIES RECORD: Cornell leads, 1-0

LAST TIME OUT: BIG RED PULLS UPSET IN VOLUNTEER STATE AGAINST #26 BLUE RAIDERS
After a tough 4-3 loss to Oklahoma last Sunday, Cornell turned up the heat in its final match of February, taking down the No. 26 ranked Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders on Tuesday from the Adams Family Complex. It was the first matchup between both teams since 2014 in Ithaca.

Middle Tennessee took the first point of the afternoon in an excited doubles section of the match, as Leo Raquin and Ondrej Horak took a 7-6 (7-3) victory over Nathan Mao and Adit Sinha, putting the pressure right on the Big Red heading into singles. Cornell immediately countered with the first win in singles, as senior Bradley Paliska grabbed a 6-4, 6-3 victory at No. 4 singles to tie the match at one. The Blue Raiders tipped the battle back into their favor right after, as Shu Matsuoka defeated Samuel Paquette in straight sets to go back up by one. 

The Big Red did not waiver after falling behind, as the focus shifted to one of the entertaining matches of the day between Sinha and No. 107 Marcel Kamrowski. Sinha, who came into the battle on a two-match winning streak, fell behind early but recovered to take the opening set in a tiebreaker, 7-5. With the momentum on his side, Sinha did just enough to pull the upset, securing a 7-5 victory in the second set to tie things back up at one again. Sophomore Petar Teodorovic fed off Sinha's upset by clinching a sweep of Ondrej Horak (6-4, 7-6 (7-4)) to put the Big Red one point away from clinching the victory. 

The focus turned to No. 1 singles, as Papoe, coming off his first singles loss of the spring season at Oklahoma, struggled in the opening set of his match against No. 33 Leo Raquin, falling 6-4. But the junior captain's confidence never waived, as he swept the next two sets to secure the win and the match for the Big Red. 

INSIDE THE OPPONENT: SOUTHERN METHODIST
Cornell and SMU have matched up three times in program history (1994, 1995, 2023), with the Mustangs taking all three matchups. Last season's battle in Dallas favored SMU, 5-2, with Nathan Mao and Radu Papoe securing victories at No. 1 and No. 5 singles to earn the two points for the Big Red. Cornell was also ranked No. 21 at the time. 

The Mustangs roll into Saturday's match at 8-6 and are looking to snap a three-match losing streak, which extended with a 4-2 loss to No. 47 Arkansas on Wednesday afternoon in Dallas. The loss was also the first at home for the Mustangs, as the team came into the match with a 6-0 record at the Styslinger/Altec Tennis Complex. SMU started the battle against the Razorbacks with a victory in doubles, highlighted by a 6-2 win for the No. 46 ranked tandem of Adam Neff and Huntley Allen over No. 45 Jared Horwood/Melvin Manuel. Trevor Svadja kept the Mustangs ahead for the time being with his 6-1, 6-4 sweep of Gerard Planelles Ripoll before the Razorbacks ripped off victories at the No. 6, No. 2, and No. 3 positions to secure the win. 

Graduate student Eric Hadigian has been one of the top performers in singles this season for SMU, sporting a 14-2 record and winning nine out of his last ten matches. Adam Neff and Huntley Allen are the Mustangs' top duo in doubles, going 5-3 when teaming up this year. 

INSIDE THE OPPONENT: HOBART
The New York rivals will face off at the Reis Tennis Center for the second straight season in Saturday's evening match. Cornell was on fire during the team's matchup last February from the Reis Tennis Center, securing the doubles point and three consecutive singles matches to ensure the victory, which ended up being a 6-1 final for the Big Red.

Hobart comes into the weekend at No. 33 overall in the latest ITA Division III men's tennis team rankings. The Statesmen have only competed in one match so far this spring, falling at home to Denison University, 7-2, in Bristol Field House on Saturday, Feb. 17. Hobart secured the first point of the night in doubles, as Sean Pesin and Nick Fischer knocked off the eighth-ranked doubles team in DIII in Ethan (8-6) to go up 1-0. Denison would lay down the hammer after the upset, winning five consecutive matches over doubles and singles to secure a 5-2 lead and the win for the Big Red. Hobart's other point on the day came from freshman Achilleas Kousaridis, who defeated Ryan Patrick, 6-1, 0-6, 6-3 at the No. 5 position in singles.

UP NEXT
The Big Red will hit the road again, heading out to East Lansing to battle the No. 15 ranked Michigan State Spartans on Sunday, March 10. Doubles action will begin at noon from the MSU Tennis Center.
