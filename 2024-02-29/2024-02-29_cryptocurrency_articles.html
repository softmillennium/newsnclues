Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.

As Bitcoin soars past $57,000, JPMorgan analysts are challenging the narrative surrounding the upcoming Bitcoin halving scheduled for April. Contrary to widespread anticipation, the financial giant suggests that the event, which historically triggered market movements, is already factored into the current cryptocurrency prices. 

JPMorgan points to a resurgence of retail interest as the driving force behind Bitcoin’s recent surge and highlights on-chain data indicating a shift in dynamics between retail and institutional investors.

JPMorgan’s note to clients identifies three main crypto catalysts anticipated in the coming months: the Bitcoin halving, the next major upgrade of the Ethereum network, and the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by the SEC in May. 

While the first two catalysts are deemed largely priced in, the analysts express a cautious outlook, assigning only a 50% chance to the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by the SEC.

JPMorgan analysts emphasize that the Bitcoin halving, an event occurring every four years, is unlikely to be the sole catalyst behind the recent price surge. The analysts contend that retail investors are actively participating in the market, allocating funds to new spot Bitcoin ETFs at a faster rate than institutional investors. This shift in dynamics is challenging the traditional market dynamic in that institutional interest is the primary catalyst behind Bitcoin’s price movements.

JPMorgan’s analysis delves into on-chain data, revealing that retail investors are significantly outpacing institutional flows. The team highlights a notable surge in retail activity on Coinbase, a major U.S. crypto exchange, and points to a broader trend of retail interest extending beyond Bitcoin. 

The inclusion of smaller digital coins and tokens like Dogecoin, in the retail investment landscape is noted as a significant factor contributing to the current market dynamics.

Looking beyond price dynamics, JPMorgan’s analysis extends to the post-halving landscape for Bitcoin miners. The report suggests that miners with below-average electricity costs and efficient equipment are likely to thrive post-halving, while those with high production costs may face challenges. Consequently, concentration of the Bitcoin mining industry is expected, with publicly listed miners gaining a higher share to enhance overall cost efficiency.

As Bitcoin continues its upward trajectory, JPMorgan’s assessment challenges conventional expectations tied to the upcoming halving event.

Two Wall Street wealth management giants, Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo, are adding spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds to their brokerage platforms, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

Ever since the launch of the 10 ETFs in January, industry participants have been wondering when major U.S. brokerages would start offering the funds to their clients, which could potentially bring much more buying power to the market for bitcoin ETFs.

The Bloomberg story follows a CoinDesk scoop Wednesday that Morgan Stanley, another titan in the space, is in the midst of deciding whether to give clients the option to invest in the funds. In January, CoinDesk reported first that UBS and Citigroup were letting some customers buy bitcoin ETFs.

Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo have been offering the bitcoin ETFs to clients who specifically asked to get exposure to it, Bloomberg reported.

Even without the participation of players of this caliber, the ETFs have seen tremendous demand since they began trading on Jan. 11. On Wednesday alone, a record $7.7 billion worth of all the funds traded.

Nevertheless, the entrance of Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and, perhaps, Morgan Stanley could bring a new wave of demand, Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan said earlier on Thursday.

The cryptocurrency world is filled with speculation following several financial movements made by the founder of Amazon, Jeff Bezos, which have generated rumors that he might invest in Bitcoin. The chatter gained momentum after Apollo co-founder Thomas Fahrer hinted on X about Bezos’s recent activities, suggesting a significant move into the cryptocurrency space.

According to the report, Jeff Bezos has recently sold Amazon shares amounting to $8.5 billion, and this move has, in turn, attracted the attention of financial analysts and crypto followers. Despite the sale, Bezos is still the main shareholder in Amazon, and his wealth is beyond $190 billion. This action occurs when Amazon’s market price grows considerably, jumping over 76% in the previous year.

Further fueling the rumors, Bezos was spotted at a dinner event with his fiancée, Lauren Sanchez, and with Michael Saylor, a Bitcoin supporter and the CEO of MicroStrategy. Saylor’s company has appeared in the news due to its huge Bitcoin portfolio, pointing out that cryptocurrency could have been a subject between the two moguls. Considering Saylor’s influence and success within cryptocurrency, this meeting has only added to the curiosity about Bezos’s potential venture into Bitcoin.

Additionally, InvestAnswers, a crypto analyst, pointed to a new Bitcoin wallet transaction involving 26,200 BTC, valued at $51K each, possibly linked to a high-net-worth individual like Bezos. This speculation is grounded in the timing and scale of Bezos’s stock sales, combined with the enigmatic yet substantial Bitcoin purchase, leading many to wonder about the investor’s identity behind it.

The price of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is based on supply and demand. However, because supply will never exceed 21 million coins, demand for the cryptocurrency is the only variable of consequence. That means the future price trajectory of Bitcoin depends entirely on whether demand increases or decreases from its current level.

With that in mind, certain Wall Street analysts believe two catalysts will boost demand for Bitcoin in the future, so much so that the cryptocurrency could soar 700% or more from its current price of about $50,000 by the end of the decade. Here's what investors should know.

A Fidelity report recently identified several signs of growing demand for Bitcoin. Monthly active addresses, monthly new addresses, and monthly transactions are all trending higher. The illiquid supply of Bitcoin (i.e., the percentage that has not moved in over a year) is near a record high and trending upward, meaning more investors are holding the cryptocurrency. And the number of accounts with at least 0.1 Bitcoin hit a record high in December 2023.

Beyond those trends, two catalysts could create more demand for Bitcoin in the future. First, the Securities and Exchange Commission recently approved several spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Those investment vehicles provide direct exposure to the cryptocurrency without the hassle of buying and storing Bitcoin. By reducing friction, spot Bitcoin ETFs could draw more retail and institutional investors into the market. Indeed, the collective inflows across spot Bitcoin ETFs during the first month of trading were higher than the inflows of any other ETF launch in history.

Second, Bitcoin mining rewards are reduced by 50% every time 210,000 blocks are added to the blockchain, which happens about once every four years. The next halving event is scheduled to take place in April and it will effectively boost demand by reducing selling pressure. To elaborate, miners sell Bitcoin to monetize their operations, but they will have 50% less Bitcoin to sell after the April halving event.

There is a historical precedent for Bitcoin increasing in value after mining rewards are cut in half, as shown in the table below.

Anthony Scaramucci, founder and managing partner at Skybridge Capital, recently told podcast host Scott Melker that Bitcoin could reach $240,000 within 18 months of the April halving event. Scaramucci also said Bitcoin would eventually achieve half the market capitalization of gold, bringing its per-coin value to roughly $400,000. That implies 700% upside from its current price of $50,000.

Tom Lee, managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, recently told CNBC that Bitcoin could reach $500,000 in the next five years, implying 900% upside from its current price. "There's a finite supply and now we have a potentially huge increase in demand with spot Bitcoin [ETF] approval, so I think in five years something around half a million would be potentially achievable," Lee said in January.

Cathie Wood, founder and chief executive officer of Ark Invest, recently discussed her Bitcoin valuation model with CNBC. Her base-case valuation is roughly $600,000 by 2030, implying 1,100% upside from its current price. But her bull-case valuation is $1.5 million by 2030, implying 2,900% upside from its current price. Wood said spot Bitcoin ETF approval makes the bull case more likely.

Bitcoin could be worth more (perhaps much more) in the future. But investors cannot make informed decisions without understanding the risks.

First, historical data is limited. Bitcoin was created less than two decades ago, whereas stocks and bonds have been around for centuries. That makes speculation difficult where Bitcoin is concerned. For instance, there is no precedent for its performance during a deep recession.

Second, Bitcoin has historically been quite volatile. It has fallen at least 50% from a record high three times in the past five years, and it plunged more than 75% during the most recent cryptocurrency market crash. Investors should expect that volatility to persist in the future.

Third, Bitcoin has been associated with fraud, money laundering, and other criminal activity. Certain countries have banned the cryptocurrency and other countries are still building regulatory frameworks. Future changes in the regulatory landscape could damp demand for Bitcoin.

Patient investors comfortable with those risks should consider buying Bitcoin today.
