Russian President Vladimir Putin has been addressing both houses of the country's parliament this morning, two weeks ahead of an election he is guaranteed to win.

Thursday 29 February 2024 22:22, UK

But we'll be back tomorrow morning to bring you the latest updates on the war in Ukraine.

You can scroll back through the blog to read what happened today.

A Russian man has today pleaded guilty in a US court to charges that he smuggled large quantities of American-made, military-grade microelectronics to Russia.

Maxim Marchenko, 51, who had been based in Hong Kong, was taken into US custody in September, after he and two unnamed Russian co-conspirators were accused of using shell companies to conceal the fraudulent procurement of so-called OLED micro-displays.

US justice officials said that Marchenko admitted in a New York court to one count of money laundering, which carries a maximum jail sentence of 20 years, and one count of smuggling goods from the US, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years.

He is due to be sentenced on 6 June.

"The justice department is holding accountable those who would enable the Kremlin and its unjust war of aggression against Ukraine," said Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen, of the department's national security division.

Federal prosecutors said OLED micro-displays could be used in rifle scopes, night-vision goggles, thermal optics and other weapons systems.

Marchenko and his co-conspirators falsely claimed that the dual-use technology - meaning it had civilian and military applications - was being sent to China, Hong Kong and elsewhere for use in electron microscopes for medical research.

A little earlier (see post at 8.30pm), we reported on a British minister's response to Vladimir Putin's threat in a speech today to use nuclear weapons.

Washington has now offered a response to the Russian president's comments, with state department spokesperson Matthew Miller saying the US does not have any sign that Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon - but will continue to monitor the situation carefully.

"It is not the first time we have seen irresponsible rhetoric from Vladimir Putin," he said.

"It is no way for the leader of a nuclear armed state to speak."

Mr Putin earlier today told Western countries they risked provoking a nuclear war if they sent troops to fight in Ukraine. 

Supporters of prominent Putin critic Alexei Navalny have been urging his supporters to attend his funeral in Moscow tomorrow - and burial at a nearby cemetery.

However, a pastor at the church where the service is due to take place has indicated that it will not be open to all.

“Most likely, only relatives and friends will be allowed to attend the funeral service," the woman was quoted by the Kholod online newspaper as saying.

"There will be no farewell in the church."

Responding to the comments, one of Mr Navalny's closest aides before his death, Ivan Zhdanov, said: "There was some rumour in the media that only relatives would be allowed to attend the funeral service.

"We don't have any such information. All we know is that the temple will be open to everyone."

It comes after the European Parliament today adopted a resolution against oppression in Russia following the death of Mr Navalny.

The resolution condemned Mr Navalny's death in a remote Arctic penal colony earlier this month, and said the Russian government and Vladimir Putin were responsible.

Vladimir Putin's threat that he could order the use of nuclear weapons has been a focus of significant reaction since his comments during a speech earlier.

Joining those who responded to the remarks is UK foreign minister Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon, who labelled them "irresponsible".

He levelled his criticism in Parliament after the Russian president sought to warn the West against deeper involvement in the conflict, saying that such a move risked triggering a global war that would see "the destruction of our civilisation".

Mr Putin made the comments in a state-of-the-nation address following the second anniversary of the invasion by Kremlin forces and ahead of next month's election that he seems certain to win.

Responding in Westminster, Lord Ahmad told peers: "Nothing surprises us or shocks us in terms of what Mr Putin articulates.

"It is not the first time he has articulated such comments.

"It is irresponsible, it is wrong and the use or the threatened use of such weapons is frankly quite deplorable.

"Whether he is using it with intent or as shock tactic I can't speculate on that.

"But what I can say, and I am sure I speak for everyone in the House, is that the last thing anyone wants to hear right now is the use of threatening to use such weapons."

He added: "Mr Putin himself could reflect on his own history and that of Russia to see that the only way forward on this is to ensure that he pulls back now, he brings about peace on the continent and stops the war on Ukraine."

Earlier, in the House of Lords, a peer called on the UK to "push for a negotiated settlement" with Moscow over Ukraine.

Economist and independent crossbencher Lord Skidelsky - who has previously had links to Russian companies and spoke out against Finland joining NATO - said: "I am trying to understand the logic of the government's position.

"Is it still the government's expectation that Ukraine will win a complete victory in the sense of recovering the territories it has lost since 2014?

"If so, can the minister confirm that this remains the government's position?

"If not, most experts now do not think that is a feasible endgame, should the government not couple support for Ukraine with a public push for a negotiated settlement, such as has been advocated by many countries in the world, while they still have leverage on the table, not least to avoid the unnecessary slaughter of thousands of Ukrainians and Russians?"

Responding, Lord Ahmad said: "We want to stop the slaughter of innocent Ukrainian citizens.

"The best way to stop that slaughter is for Mr Putin and Russia to stop the war now.

"There are no two ways about it, we cannot allow it.

"We back Ukraine, Ukraine's leadership is important, and the United Kingdom stands firmly behind it."

Lord Skidelsky was suspended from the upper chamber for a month last year after failing to properly declare his links to a think tank funded by two Russian businessmen who were subsequently sanctioned.

The peer, who has been critical of the government's approach to Ukraine, has previously served as a director of the Russian oil firm Russneft.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy has appointed Volodymyr Karpenko as new commander of Ukraine's Logistics Forces today, it has been announced.

General Karpenko, previously logistics commander of Ukraine's ground forces, replaced Oleh Huliaka, who had held the position since 2021.

His appointment is the president's latest in a series of personnel changes in the military, including the naming of Oleksandr Syrskyi as commander in chief of the armed forces in place of Valerii Zaluzhnyi.

Poland plans to launch a series of military observation satellites next year, a deputy defence minister announced today.

"Next year, as the Ministry of Defence and the Polish Army, we want to put our first Polish satellites into orbit," Cezary Tomczyk told a news briefing.

Poland intends to acquire a satellite system equipped with radar and optical technology that would enable Earth observation regardless of atmospheric conditions and would employ both foreign and domestic technology, he said.

Defence minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz told the same briefing the country would this year develop a space force among other units, based on lessons learned from Ukraine's experiences since Russia's invasion.

"All the actions we are taking this year, creating drone forces, creating space component forces or medical forces, these are actions that strengthen the Polish army and also result from the Ukrainian experience," Mr Kosiniak-Kamysz said.

In December 2022 the Polish defence ministry signed a deal with Airbus for the delivery of two reconnaissance satellites, the launch of which is planned by 2027.

A Russian-American woman detained in Russia on a treason charge carrying up to 20 years in prison told her boyfriend "it's safe there" before she travelled to see relatives in Yekaterinburg, the woman's former mother-in-law said today.

A Russian court today rejected an appeal by Ksenia Karelina, a 32-year-old former ballerina who lives in Los Angeles, after she was detained by the FSB security service on suspicion of raising funds for Ukraine's armed forces.

Her lawyer had asked the court to lift her detention and replace it with house arrest, state news agency RIA reported.

The US embassy in Moscow was aware of the reports but could not comment further due to privacy restrictions, a spokesperson told news agency Reuters.

A Russian lawyers' group, Pervy Otdel, said it had information that Ms Karelina had donated just over $50 (£40) from her US bank account on 24 February 2022 - the day that Russia launched its invasion - to a charity that sends aid to Ukraine.

Her former mother-in-law, Eleonora Srebroski, told news agency Reuters by phone from Maryland that Ms Karelina had made a small donation to Razom for Ukraine, a New York-based nonprofit  organisation that sends assistance to the country.

Razom said in a statement earlier this month that it was "appalled" by Ms Karelina's arrest and that its activities focused on "humanitarian aid, disaster relief, education and advocacy."

Ms Srebroski said Ms Karelina, who has been a US citizen since 2021, had decided to go to Yekaterinburg in January for a family visit after her boyfriend surprised her with a plane ticket while they were on holiday in Turkey.

"I am Russian, I love Russia, there is nothing wrong in Yekaterinburg, it's safe there," Ms Srebroski said was how Ms Karelina assured her boyfriend.

Ms Srebroski, who described Karelina as caring, sweet and "even more beautiful on the inside," said her former daughter-in-law arrived in the US in 2012 via a work-study program in Maryland, where she met her son and the two got married in 2013.

Ukraine has significantly increased its use of domestic-made weapons and military equipment, a senior defence official has said.

It comes as Kyiv aims to become more self-sufficient amid faltering Western military aid.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called for Ukraine to strengthen its domestic defence industry as it struggles to fend off Russia's invasion and faces potential cuts in military aid from its biggest backer, the US.

Deputy defence minister Ivan Havryliuk said 46 types of domestically produced equipment had been sent to the armed forces during the first two months of 2024, an amount he said was "significantly more" than in the same period last year.

"We are doing every we can so that Ukraine over time becomes as self-sufficient as possible in providing the defence forces with the necessary weapons," he said.

Mr Havryliuk also called for Kyiv's foreign partners to boost investment and participation in joint production with Ukrainian companies.

Ukraine has signed dozens of contracts for joint production or technology exchanges with Western allies.

German defence company Rheinmetall, one of the world's biggest producers of artillery and tank shells, said this month it would open an ammunition factory in Ukraine.

Ukrainian defence minister Rustem Umerov said on Sunday that around 50% of arms deliveries from Kyiv's partners arrive late.

In the latest example of a systematic campaign to restrict media freedom in Russia, the editor of an independent newspaper has reportedly been fined.

Sergei Sokolov, of the Novaya Gazeta publication, had previously been detained by authorities for discrediting the army.

Mr Sokolov said he did not agree with the charge against him.

The official Telegram channel for Moscow's court system said the case stemmed from an article published in the newspaper in December 2023, entitled "Nobody's boys", about Russians orphans who signed army contracts to fight in Ukraine.

Novaya Gazeta said in an online report that Mr Sokolov's detention was over coverage of the Russian army in an article, but did not provide more details.

A district court in Moscow subsequently fined Sokolov 30,000 roubles (£259.86) today after finding him guilty of discrediting the Russian armed forces, an administrative offence.

Russian news agency TASS reported that Sokolov had "posted material on the Novaya Gazeta Telegram channel" which showed "signs of verbally discrediting the actions" of the army.

Novaya Gazeta is known for its investigations, which have sometimes taken aim at the Kremlin, government policy and top officials.

Its former editor-in-chief, Dmitry Muratov, a Nobel prize winning journalist, stepped down in September to challenge his designation by authorities as a "foreign agent", a label Moscow uses for people it deems to be working against Russian state interests.

At least 112 Palestinians are said to have been killed and 760 injured trying to get desperately needed aid in Gaza.

Crowds descended on a convoy of lorries on the coastal road south-west of Gaza City, in the presence of Israeli tanks.

Israel's military say tanks fired warning shots but did not strike the convoy. Some Palestinians say troops fired directly at them. 

A Palestinian witness told the BBC most of those who died had been run over as lorry drivers tried to move forward.

Israeli aerial footage shows hundreds of people on and around lorries, while graphic videos posted online show bodies loaded on to emptied aid lorries and a donkey cart.

Giving the figures of 112 dead and 760 injured, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry accused Israel of a "massacre".

The UN Security Council has scheduled a closed-door emergency meeting to discuss the incident.

France said "fire by Israeli soldiers against civilians trying to access food" was "unjustifiable" and US President Joe Biden expressed concern the incident would complicate efforts by mediators to broker a temporary ceasefire in the war between Israel and Hamas.

The medical charity MSF said it was "horrified" and called for an "immediate and sustained ceasefire". 

The incident came hours before Gaza's health ministry announced that more than 30,000 people, including 21,000 children and women, had been killed in Gaza since the start of the current conflict on 7 October. Some 7,000 were missing and 70,450 were injured, it said.

The UN is warning of a looming famine in the north of the territory, where an estimated 300,000 people are living with little food or clean water.

The Israeli military launched a large-scale air and ground campaign to destroy Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK and others - after its gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 253 hostages.

Thursday's incident took place shortly after 04:45 (02:45 GMT) at the Nabulsi roundabout, on the south-western edge of Gaza City.

A convoy of 30 lorries carrying Egyptian aid was making its way north along what the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) described as a "humanitarian corridor" when it was surrounded by civilians, with people climbing on to the trucks.

"Some began violently pushing and even trampling other Gazans to death, looting the humanitarian supplies," said the IDF's chief spokesman, Rear Adm Daniel Hagari. "The unfortunate incident resulted in dozens of Gazans killed and injured." 

Israeli tanks, he said, "cautiously tried to disperse the mob with a few warning shots" but pulled back "when the hundreds became thousands and things got out of hand".

"No IDF strike was conducted towards the aid convoy," he said, insisting the Israeli military had been trying to help the aid convoy reach its destination.

Another IDF spokesman said some civilians had approached Israeli soldiers at a nearby checkpoint, ignoring warning shots. Fearing a threat, the soldiers fired at them in a "limited response", he said.

A Palestinian witness, speaking to the BBC, described panic in the crowd and among the drivers, who tried to move forward. Most of those who died were run over, the witness added.

Hamas rejected the IDF's account, citing "undeniable" evidence of "direct firing at citizens, including headshots aimed at immediate killing".

Dozens of casualties in a critical or severe condition were brought to the nearby al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, where medics were unable to cope with the sheer volume and severity of cases.

One man at the hospital who was cradling the body of this dead friend, Tamer Shinbari, told the BBC he had gone to the Nabulsi roundabout hoping to get a bag of flour for his family. He said Israeli soldiers had opened fire "and the aid lorry ran over the bodies".

All or most of the casualties being treated at two other hospitals, Kamal Adwan and al-Awda, were said by officials there to have bullet or shrapnel wounds.  

Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, a rival of Hamas based in the occupied West Bank, accused Israeli forces of a "heinous massacre".

A spokesman for UN Secretary General António Guterres said he condemned the incident and called again for an "immediate humanitarian ceasefire and the unconditional release of all hostages".

The north of Gaza suffered widespread devastation after being the focus of the first phase of the Israeli ground offensive and has been largely cut off from humanitarian assistance for several months.

Last week, the World Food Programme said it had been forced to suspend aid deliveries to the area after its first convoy in three weeks had been surrounded by crowds of hungry people close to an Israeli checkpoint and had then faced gunfire in Gaza City. 

On Tuesday, a senior UN aid official warned that at least 576,000 people across the Gaza Strip - one quarter of the population - faced catastrophic levels of food insecurity and one in six children under the age of two in the north were suffering from acute malnutrition and wasting.

Ten children died from dehydration and malnutrition at hospitals in northern Gaza in recent days, the health ministry said.

More than 110 Palestinians are reported to have died while trying to get desperately needed aid in north Gaza.

Another 70,000 Palestinians have been injured during the war, according to the Hamas-run authority.

BBC Verify examines the evidence on combatant deaths, as concern grows about the scale of civilian killing.

Brigg and Goole MP Andrew Percy says abuse since the war in Gaza is on a scale never seen before.

Officers must use their powers against people who undermine democracy by targeting MPs, Rishi Sunak says.

The Palestinian foreign ministry issued a statement asking the International Court of Justice to "issue subpoenas and arrest warrants" following the deaths of civilians who were awaiting aid in northern Gaza today. 

Israel's military said it was bringing in a convoy with aid when a group surrounded the trucks and troops "fired" at crowds. IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari later denied that civilians were attacked from the air or the ground, saying tanks issued "warning shots" and attempted to retreat. 

Gaza's Health Ministry said more than 100 people were killed and hundreds of others were injured. NBC News has not independently verified the reported death toll, and it’s not clear how many were killed from gunfire or the ensuing panic. 

The Palestinian foreign ministry accused Israel of violating the International Court of Justice provisional order, which said it must take effective measures to enable the provision of basic services and humanitarian aid. 

Qatar's foreign ministry also issued a statement condemning the incident as a "heinous massacre committed by the Israeli occupation." The statement called it a continuation of the "occupation's brutal crimes." 

"The Ministry stresses the need for the international community to shoulder its moral and legal responsibilities to oblige the Israeli occupation to comply with international law ... to provide protection to the brotherly Palestinian people from the systemic Israeli policies of killing, besieging, staving and forcibly displacing them," it said.

A group of Israeli citizens "broke through"  Erez crossing at Israel's border with Gaza today and "harmed the activities of the IDF," military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said. 

No additional details were provided about why the citizens were at the crossing, which has been closed to the public since Oct. 7. Hagari said the citizens violated the law, and he condemned the criminal behavior.  

"The fact that soldiers are attacked by those they protect is extremely serious," Hagari said. "Soldiers are busy with this instead of fighting in Gaza." 

Doha Madani

Dr. Isabelle Defourny, the president of Médecins Sans Frontières France, laid blame for today's deadly aid convoy incident on Israel and described it as a consequence of the "extreme deprivation" in northern Gaza. 

“A few days ago, when we spoke to our staff there, they said they did not have enough food to eat and that some were resorting to pet food to survive,” Defourny said. “They also reported a lack of clean water, which is leading to diseases.”

In a statement today, Defourny said the situation is the "direct result of the string of unconscionable decisions taken by Israeli authorities while waging this war." 

She reiterated the group's call for a cease-fire in Gaza. 

"We call on Israeli authorities to allow unimpeded and streamlined humanitarian and essential aid like food to be delivered into and throughout the Gaza Strip, and for attacks on civilians to stop immediately," she said.

NBC News

The chaotic aid distribution that turned deadly today is an example of why a cease-fire is needed to get food and supplies to Gaza, former Defense Secretary and ex-CIA Director Leon Panetta told MSNBC. 

"We've seen these trucks besieged by crowds," Panetta said. "Why there can't be better order in the distribution of that humanitarian aid — with the amount of military that's there — I don't understand."

Israeli forces fired on a crowd of Palestinians waiting for aid in Gaza City, and at least 100 people were killed, with hundreds more injured. NBC News has not independently verified the reported death toll, and it’s not clear how many people were killed from gunfire or the ensuing panic. 

The Israeli military said that an aid truck was surrounded by civilians, causing pushing and trampling, and that it was reviewing the incident.

Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, a leader of the Yemen rebel militia, threatened continued attacks against enemies in the Red Sea, the Arabian Sea, the Gulf of Aden and the Bab al-Mandab Strait. 

"Our surprises, God willing, will come effective and impactful," he said in a speech today. 

Al-Houthi said American and British attacks on the group have only strengthened the Houthis' resolve in their support of Palestinians. An international coalition has criticized the militia's attacks, particularly in the Red Sea, which have disrupted commerce and led to retaliatory strikes from the U.S. and the U.K. 

The group is one of the three Iran-backed groups in the region — along with Hamas and Hezbollah — that has maintained it is acting against Israel's "crimes" against Palestinian people. 

"When a person is given the opportunity to be in a great position and then does not act, it is a serious situation for him," al-Houthi said. "We will not tire, we will not slack, we will not weaken, and we will not retreat." 

NBC News

Referring to the hundreds of casualties in a huge crowd of desperate civilians waiting for aid in Gaza City overnight, United Nations spokesperson Stephane Dujarric insisted that whether it was Israeli gunfire or a crush or the trucks that caused it, the war in Gaza was to blame. “These are all acts of violence, in a sense, due to this conflict,” he said.

Four more children have died of malnutrition and dehydration in northern Gaza, Gaza's Health Ministry reported today.

Kamal Adwan Hospital reported the deaths today, bringing the malnutrition death toll to 10 children this week. Four were previously reported at the hospital, as well as two others at Al-Shifa Hospital.

The Florida Senate unanimously passed a bill yesterday to define the term “antisemitism.”

“Outbreaks of antisemitism can be a harbinger of deep societal trouble and reflect that extremism and violence are eminent. It is dangerous and unacceptable,” Democratic Sen. Lori Berman, the sponsor of the bill, told The Associated Press. “When there is hateful behavior against anyone, it can quickly become a societal endemic.”

The definition in the bill was taken from the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance. “Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities,” IHRA said.

Florida is the latest to pass a bill to define the term as the war in Gaza continues. Last month, Georgia passed a similar bill. A coalition of organizations, including Jewish Voice for Peace and the Council on American–Islamic Relations, issued a joint statement at the time, saying that the Georgia bill “falsely equates critiques of Israel and Zionism with discrimination against Jewish people.”

Doha Madani

Israel's military has been securing aid convoys for the last few nights, but today's incident that resulted in deaths was the first to have issues, IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said.

Hagari said the military's tanks and drones were accompanying the convoy of aid trucks to help secure the humanitarian corridor, but at 4:45 a.m. local time, hundreds of people began to surround the convoy. Tanks fired "warning shots" to disperse the mob.

The IDF spokesperson denied shooting at civilians "either from the air or from the ground."

"When the hundreds became thousands and things got out of hand, the tank commander decided to retreat to avoid harm to the thousands of Gazans that were there," Hagari said. 

He added that in his opinion, based on footage from the drones, the tanks backed up cautiously and securely. 

The convoy was coordinated by Israel, Hagari said, as part of the country's commitment to distributing aid to civilians. He acknowledged that distributing the aid has been a problem.

Israel is working to return all of the remaining hostages still captive in Gaza but will not fold to "delusional demands of Hamas," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a press conference today. 

"It is too early to say, despite our desire, if we will achieve another release plan in the coming days," he said. "We make great efforts to succeed."

The prime minister said that he has yet to receive a response to a demand he made to know the names of all the abducted citizens who will be released as part of the deal. He added that it is a "sacred goal" to return the hostages. 

"We are determined to bring them all back," Netanyahu said. "With a plan or without a plan, we will fight until complete victory." 

When asked whether Israel's military has completed a plan for operations in Rafah, Netanyahu told reporters, "We do not give notice when we will continue the operation." 

"Have we prepared the continuation of the action? Yes," Netanyahu said. "The IDF presented it to the war Cabinet and to me. It will also be presented later to the general Cabinet."

One in five pregnant women at a health clinic in Deir al Balah in central Gaza are malnourished, Project HOPE, a nongovernmental organization, warned in a statement today.

The statement said that women and children were suffering from acute malnutrition and there had been an increase in anemia cases among pregnant women, a problem of not having healthy red blood cells to provide oxygen to the whole body.

It added that 1 in 10 children in the clinic also showed signs of malnutrition.

“Anything short of an urgent and lasting cease-fire will exacerbate the inhumane conditions for more than two million people in Gaza,” the organization added.

As the death toll in Gaza tops 30,000 and international criticism mounts, Israeli forces believe they are on the path to victory in their offensive against Hamas. But the Palestinian militants are still fighting and could yet draw Israel into a long quagmire like past conflicts in Lebanon, former U.S. military officers and analysts say.

After four months of hammering, Israel says it has severely damaged the capacity of Hamas to fight, killing about 12,000 of its roughly 30,000-strong army and destroying much of its arsenal.

Israeli commanders and officials say Hamas is under growing pressure, with no way to replenish its weapons or ammunition and increasingly restricted in its movements.

Brig. Gen. Dan Goldfuss, commander of the Israel Defense Forces 98th Paratroopers Division, told NBC News that top Hamas leaders are now unable to direct their troops in real-time combat because they have no way to communicate securely.

“They’ve lost command and control,” said Goldfuss.

Egypt and Jordan issued separate statements earlier today, condemning Israel for committing a “shameful crime” and “brutally targeting” Palestinians seeking humanitarian aid after the shooting in northern Gaza killed at least 104.

“Egypt considers targeting peaceful citizens running to collect their share of humanitarian aid a shameful crime, a blatant violation of the provisions of international law and international humanitarian law, and a disregard for the value of the human being and the sanctity of his soul,” Egypt’s foreign ministry said on X.

Jordan’s Ministry of Foreign and Expatriates Affairs also said it “condemned the brutal targeting by the Israeli occupation forces of a gathering of Gazan citizens who were waiting to receive humanitarian aid at the Nabulsi roundabout near Al-Rashid Street in the Gaza Strip.”

BEIRUT — A halt to fighting in the Gaza Strip as early as next week would trigger indirect talks to end hostilities along Lebanon’s southern border with Israel, Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Pinister Najib Mikati said on Thursday.

In an interview with Reuters, Mikati said he was confident that the Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah would cease fire if Israel did the same, ending nearly five months of cross-border shelling and airstrikes. Hezbollah, an ally of Hamas, has said its campaign aims to support the Palestinians under Israeli bombardment.

Mikati said a deal to halt military action in Gaza was “on the horizon” and could begin as early as next week.

“If we are able to reach a cessation of military operations in Gaza, then I believe that we will have ahead of us weeks packed with negotiations, so that we can reach what I have always called long-term stability in the south,” he said.

Mikati said he had met U.S. special envoy Amos Hochstein in February in Munich, who was “preparing for visits to Lebanon soon.” Hochstein, who was last in Beirut in mid-January, mediated a rare deal in 2022 between Lebanon and Israel, with a nod of approval from Hezbollah, that ended their long-standing maritime border dispute. He has said he hopes to do the same for their land border.

When asked whether Hezbollah had signaled a willingness to move forward with talks, Mikati suggested that the “cooperation” shown by “all sides” to facilitate the maritime deal could be replicated for a land border deal.

“I am certain that the moment that Israel stops its violations against Lebanon, I am convinced that Hezbollah will not violate — or will not respond to something that did not happen,” he said.

Hezbollah itself indicated it was ready to halt its cross-border attacks if a Gaza cease-fire comes into force.

“The war in the south is linked to the aggression on Gaza on the one hand, and to securing means of protection for our country on the other,” senior Hezbollah politician Hassan Fadlallah said.

The United Nations' Palestinian refugee agency was not involved in the aid distribution in northern Gaza today that turned deadly as Israeli forces reportedly opened fire on civilians.

Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA commissioner-general, said neither his agency nor any of the United Nations' teams were involved with the aid convoy.

"Another day from hell," he wrote in a post on X.

Aid organizations have warned for weeks that the humanitarian situation has created a desperation among starving civilians, particularly in northern Gaza, where convoys have inconsistent access. The World Food Programme made the decision earlier this month to temporarily suspend its work in the north after its convoys were stalled and faced dangerous situations just trying to make their way to the area.

LONDON — Prince William condemned antisemitism during a visit to a London synagogue on Thursday, the first time he appeared in public after he unexpectedly pulled out of a royal event earlier in the week.

William, the heir to the throne, heard about how Jewish students across the U.K. have been affected by the rise of hatred against the Jewish community during his visit to the Western Marble Arch Synagogue. He also spent time with Renee Salt, a 94-year-old Holocaust survivor.

The royal said he and his wife, Kate, the Princess of Wales, are extremely concerned about the rise in antisemitism. “I’m here today to reassure you all that people do care, people do listen and we can’t let that keep going,” he said. 

William spoke out last week against the fighting in Gaza and called for the Israel-Hamas conflict to end “as soon as possible.” While his statement stopped short of calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza, he spoke of the “terrible human cost of the conflict in the Middle East since the Hamas terrorist attack” and urged for more humanitarian support to Gaza.

Airdropping aid into Gaza is mostly a move to "relieve the guilty consciences" of U.S. officials who have contributed to the "atrocities" in the Palestinian enclave, Oxfam America's Scott Paul, associate director of peace and security, said in a statement today.

Oxfam does not support the move, Paul said, amid reports that U.S. officials were considering airdrops as challenges continue to stall ground distribution of basic goods.

He noted that dropping in supplies with no plan for disseminating would not only be a paltry stopgap but also "degrading" to Palestinians.

"Instead of indiscriminate airdrops in Gaza, the U.S. should cut the flow of weapons to Israel that are used in indiscriminate attacks, push for an immediate ceasefire and the release of hostages, and insist that Israel uphold its duty to provide humanitarian aid, access, and other basic services," Paul said.

Two men were killed in a shooting at gas station in Eli, a settlement in the occupied West Bank, Israeli emergency services group Magen David Adom said today.

Neither man was identified, but one was in his 20s and the other in his 40s, according to a spokesperson for Magen David Adom. Paramedics responded to the scene and found a vehicle with an unconscious man as well as another nearby. They both had gunshot wounds and were pronounced dead "a short time" after first responders arrived.

Israel's military said its soldiers were scanning the area and described the shooting as a "terror attack."

News coming out of Gaza still has the ability to shock even after months of warfare, said Martin Griffiths, the United Nations' undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs, in a post on X today.

Griffiths wrote in a statement that he was appalled at the news that civilians were killed and injured during a transfer of aid in Gaza City earlier today.

"Life is draining out of Gaza at a terrifying speed," he said.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, yesterday to discuss the “urgent” need to create new humanitarian routes that could facilitate aid to reach civilians in northern Gaza, according to a readout from the Defense Ministry.

The pair also talked about the negotiations for the release of hostages held by Hamas, the readout said.

Gallant said that military operations in Gaza would not stop until Hamas is removed from the enclave and all hostages are returned, his office said in a statement.

Gallant said U.S. leadership and international pressure would be crucial if Israel wants to reach a framework that would facilitate the return of the hostages, the statement added.

President Joe Biden held calls this morning with the emir of Qatar and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, according to a U.S. official.

The president told NBC News moments ago that he “was on the telephone with the people in the region” when asked about a possible temporary cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in the coming days.

The U.S. official confirmed that Biden discussed the current hostage talks and the overall situation in Gaza in both calls.

In the dead of night, thousands of hungry Gazans are seen huddling around fires scattered across Al-Rashid Street in Gaza City, awaiting aid.

In a video shot by an NBC News crew on the ground, piles of waste and battered buildings line the street before several aid trucks arrive. Chaos unfolds as hundreds of people rush the vehicle, with individuals climbing on top of it, grabbing boxes of aid, and throwing them down to the crowds below. 

"Is there sugar?" a man can be heard shouting.

In interviews with NBC News, desperate Gazans lamented the lack of aid and food supplies reaching the northern parts of the enclave, where the United Nations has warned of "imminent" famine.

Abou Adil Felfel, 60, told NBC News he came to the street looking for a piece of bread.

"I'm looking for things for my children," he said in front of a crackling fire. "Nothing is allowed to enter here for us to survive. We are dying slow deaths," he said, listing basic supplies, like medicines, that he can't find.

Abjed El Gazzer, a doctor from Al-Shifa Hospital who has lost his home and his parents in the war, said he went to Al-Rashid Street in the cold at 3 a.m. searching for food like the rest of the crowd.

"A bag of flour that used to be 10 dollars is now 1000 dollars," he said frustrated at wartime prices. "No one can buy anything in Gaza. The only reason for us risking our lives is to get scraps of food for our kids. That's the stage we've reached."

As dusk fell, several bloodied, dead bodies were filmed laid out on the flatbed of a truck, and others were wrapped in makeshift shrouds along the road's rubble.

Palestinian officials said dozens were killed in this overnight attack by Israeli forces near the humanitarian aid convoy. In a statement on Telegram, Gaza's government media office said 104 civilians had been killed in a "horrific massacre" while searching for food.

Israel confirmed that its troops had opened fire, with a government source saying the crowd “posed a threat” to Israeli soldiers, without clarifying what the threat was. They added that some casualties may have been caused by trampling in the crowd.

President Joe Biden took questions on the White House South Lawn today, telling reporters he has received conflicting reports about the deadly incident in north Gaza today, in which dozens were killed and more injured as a crowd rushed an aid truck.

Asked whether it would complicate negotiations for a cease-fire, Biden responded, “I know it will.” He said his administration was still working on getting the details of what happened.

But the president also remained publicly optimistic that a cease-fire deal could happen.

“Hope springs eternal,” Biden said. “I was on the telephone with people in the region. Probably not by Monday but I’m hopeful.”

A statement on Telegram from Izzat Al-Risheq, of Hamas’ political bureau, suggested that the chaotic and deadly incident in which the Israeli military attacked Palestinians seeking humanitarian aid could threaten ongoing negotiations over the release of hostages held by Hamas.

The statement, which was addressed to mediators at the negotiations, particularly Americans, said that the “negotiations are not an open process, and we will not allow the path of negotiations, through which we seek to end the human suffering of our people created by the occupation; to be a cover for the enemy’s continued crimes against our people in the Gaza Strip.”

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’ office accused Israel of committing an “ugly massacre” after Israeli soldiers opened fire on people waiting for humanitarian aid in northern Gaza, killing at least 100.

“The killing of this large number of innocent civilian victims who risked their livelihood is considered an integral part of the genocidal war,” the office told WAFA, the Palestinian news agency, adding that Israel should be held accountable before international courts.

The International Court of Justice has heard two cases involving Israel this year, including a case led by South Africa accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza and another on the legality of Israel’s occupation of Palestinian land. Israel disputed both accusations.

All parties involved in the Israel-Hamas war may have committed war crimes, with a clear violation of international humanitarian law, U.N. human rights chief Volker Turk said today.

“It is time, well past time, for peace, investigation and accountability,” he told the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, as he called for those responsible to be held accountable.

In a separate statement yesterday, Turk said Israeli operations had caused “unprecedented destruction and suffering,” leading to the humanitarian crisis in the enclave, as thousands of civilians face famine.

He also called on Israel to stop “collective punishment” immediately against all Gazans, allowing more humanitarian aid and commercial goods to enter and ending the “complete siege.”

Kids in Gaza are dying of malnutrition and lack of food, Jason Lee of Save the Children said yesterday in a statement.

"What we are witnessing in Gaza is a mass killing of children in slow motion because there is no food left and nothing getting to them," said Lee, the charity's country director in the occupied Palestinian territory.

Monica Alba

The White House has said it is “looking into the reports” of Israeli soldiers firing on a crowd of Gazans waiting for aid, calling it a “serious incident.”

“We mourn the loss of innocent life and recognize the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, where innocent Palestinians are just trying to feed their families,” a White House National Security Council spokesperson said.

“This underscores the importance of expanding and sustaining the flow of humanitarian assistance into Gaza, including through a potential temporary cease-fire. We continue to work day and night to achieve that outcome,” the spokesperson said.

SYDNEY — New Zealand on Thursday listed Palestinian Islamist group Hamas in its entirety as a terrorist entity and imposed travel bans on “extremist” Israeli settlers whom it said had committed violent attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank.

Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said in a statement that the attacks by Hamas on Israel in October “were brutal and we have unequivocally condemned them.”

But he added that “New Zealand wants to be clear that the designation of Hamas is about the actions of an offshore terrorist entity and is not a reflection on the Palestinian people in Gaza and around the world.”

New Zealand has designated the military wing of Hamas as a terrorist entity since 2010.

Foreign Minister Winston Peters said the whole of Hamas bears responsibility for the October attacks, making it difficult for the New Zealand government to distinguish between the group’s military and political wings.

The Oct. 7 attacks killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, Israel’s air and ground campaign in Hamas-governed Gaza has killed about 30,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza health ministry.

New Zealand’s decision makes it a criminal offense to carry out property or financial transactions with Hamas or provide material support. It also freezes any Hamas assets in New Zealand.

It does not prevent New Zealand from providing humanitarian and future development assistance for civilians in Gaza or from giving consular support to New Zealand citizens or permanent residents in the conflict zone.

Luxon also said he was “seriously concerned by the significant increase in extremist violence perpetrated by Israeli settlers” against Palestinians in recent months.

“This is particularly destabilizing in what is already a major crisis,” Luxon said.

New Zealand’s consistent position has been that Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories are a violation of international law.

The government said it would continue to support a future Palestinian state as part of a negotiated two-state solution, urging an end to the current conflict and an urgent restart of the Middle East peace process.

The Israeli army opened fire at Palestinians waiting for humanitarian aid on a coastal road in northern Gaza earlier today, killing at least 100 people and injuring hundreds more, Gaza health officials have said.

Videos on social media show injured people lying in trucks, some of them bloodied. 

Israel confirmed that its troops had opened fire, with a government source saying the crowd “posed a threat” to Israeli soldiers, without clarifying what the threat was. They added that some casualties may have been caused by trampling in the crowd.

56% of respondents who identified themselves as Democrats said they were less likely to support a candidate who backs military assistance for Israel, a new Reuters/Ipsos poll found.

The three-day poll, which closed yesterday, showed that a minority — 40% of Democrats — said they are more likely to support such a candidate. 

As the death toll in the enclave climbs and tensions escalate in the Middle East, President Joe Biden’s support for Israel’s war with Hamas — including arms shipments to Israel — has angered some members of his party, whose support will be crucial ahead of the November presidential election.

The poll results also showed that Biden and former President Donald Trump, the likley Republican candidate, would be tied in a hypothetical election. 36% of respondents each favored Biden and Trump, with the rest saying they are unsure who to vote for, or if they would vote at all.

Medical staff at the neonatal department at Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahiya told an NBC News crew that there were seeing unprecedented numbers of Palestinian children suffering from malnutrition, hunger and dehydration. For every child discharged, two will take its place, they said. 

Hakim Ahmed Elkahlout, the department's head nurse, showed the crew a frail baby girl who was admitted two days ago, lying limply in a hospital bed. "She needs specialized care and specialized nutrition," he said. 

Some days ago, four malnourished children died at the hospital, staff said. 

Monica Alba

The Biden administration is considering airdropping aid into Gaza, a U.S. official has told NBC News, given the dire need for humanitarian assistance and the slower pace of land deliveries into the Palestinian enclave. 

This comes as the White House is growing increasingly concerned about a possible famine for a sizeable portion of Gaza’s population. 

Axios was first to report the news.

Reports that at least six more children in northern Gaza have died of dehydration and malnutrition are “horrendous,” the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees said on X today.

The United Nations Relief and Works Agency also called for “unimpeded access” across the enclave and an immediate cease-fire.

Israel said that its troops opened fire on a crowd of people waiting for humanitarian aid this morning in Gaza City in the north of the enclave, responding to reports from officials in Gaza that dozens of people were killed in an Israeli attack.

"Early this morning, during the entry of humanitarian aid trucks into the northern Gaza Strip, Gazan residents surrounded the trucks, and looted the supplies being delivered. During the incident, dozens of Gazans were injured as a result of pushing and trampling," an IDF spokesperson said in a statement. "The incident is under review."

An Israeli government source said that "several people who surrounded the humanitarian aid trucks approached IDF troops securing the passage of trucks as part of a humanitarian operation to transfer aid."

"The crowd approached the forces in a manner that posed a threat to the troops, who responded to the threat with live fire. The incident is under review," the source added.

The Israel-Hamas war in Gaza has now killed at least 30,000 people, the Palestinian Health Ministry announced today, a swelling death toll that has already drawn condemnation internationally, isolated Israel and prompted dismay from its traditional friends and allies.

Though the United States says a cease-fire may be near, the military campaign looks far from over. Some 70% of the dead are women and children, according to figures published by the Palestinian Health Ministry. 

American and U.N. officials say the death toll given by Palestinian officials is at least accurate and perhaps an undercount. Aid workers on the ground say that thousands more people could still be trapped under the rubble. In addition, some 70,000 people have been wounded, and 1.7 million — or 80% of the population — has been displaced, according to Gazan health officials and U.N. estimates.

An attack on a crowd of Palestinians waiting for aid in Gaza City has killed and wounded dozens of people, according to local officials. 

At least 70 people were killed by an Israeli strike while waiting for humanitarian aid, Dr. Ashraf Al-Qudra, a spokesperson for the enclave’s Health Ministry, said in a statement this morning. 

More than 280 people were injured, Al-Qudra said, adding that the injuries, ranged from critical to serious. He added that many had been taken to Al-Shifa, Gaza's largest medical facility which was raided by Israeli forces earlier this year.  

The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports. 

The incident comes after food aid entered northern Gaza yesterday for the first time in weeks, as the U.N. and aid agencies warn of mass starvation.

OTTAWA, Ontario — Canada is working to airdrop humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip as soon as possible, a Cabinet minister said yesterday.

The confirmation that an active effort is underway comes after Canadian International Development Minister Ahmed Hussen said Ottawa was exploring new options to deliver aid.

He said the provision of airdrops in partnership with like-minded countries in the region, such as Jordan, was on the table.

Hussen said last week that the provision of aid is nowhere near what’s needed and a tedious inspection process was slowing down the movement of supplies brought in by truck.

He made the comments following a trip to the Rafah border crossing, the only way in or out of the Gaza Strip since the Israel-Hamas war began in October.

Canada has put 100 million Canadian dollars ($74 million) toward aid for the besieged territory since the start of the conflict, including 40 million Canadian dollars ($30 million) committed in January.

As the devastating war in Gaza continues, UN investigators examining Israeli accusations against a dozen employees of the beleaguered UN relief agency for Palestine refugees, UNRWA, have arrived in Jordan and are planning to visit Israel, UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said on Thursday.

The UN Secretary-General received an update on Wednesday from the Office of Internal Oversight (OIOS), which launched an investigation last month following allegations that a handful of UNRWA employees were complicit in Hamas’s October attacks that left almost 1,200 dead in Israel and 240 taken hostage.

So far, investigators have reviewed initial information from a variety of sources, including that released through the media and other public outlets, and reached out to Member States concerned, for additional input, according to the update.

In the Jordanian capital, Amman, investigators visited UNRWA headquarters and reviewed initial information received by the agency from Israeli authorities. The investigators also reviewed information and communications technology data, including email records and information on agency vehicles.

Cooperation with the investigation by Member States has thus far been adequate, the UN Spokesperson added.

“OIOS will [continue to] seek and to corroborate additional information and to compare the information obtained with materials held by Israeli authorities, which OIOS expects to receive shortly,” he said.

The UN’s primary internal investigative office, OIOS began its work on 29 January, the day the Secretary-General tasked the unit with this effort, Mr. Dujarric said.

Since Israel made these allegations, UNRWA has fired the accused staff and launched its own independent review, which is expected to be published in late April.

Pending the investigations, many major donors have suspended funding for UNRWA, which operates on voluntary donations, and agency chief Philippe Lazzarini said a lack of funds has already impacted lifesaving relief efforts, particularly for the two million Palestinians trapped in war-torn Gaza, which is on the verge of famine.

Turning to the situation in gang-ravaged Haiti, the UN Spokesperson said Benin is the latest nation to officially confirm its intention to contribute personnel to the new Security Council-mandated multinational support mission in the crisis-stricken Caribbean country.

To date, $10.8 million in contributions have been deposited into the Multinational Security Support Trust Fund to operate the mission, he said.

“We are also encouraged by the pledges of some $78 million in recent days that will go directly to the fund, and we encourage Member States to continue contributing to ensure the successful deployment of the mission,” he said.

The mission will provide security assistance to the Government of Haiti in its efforts to protect civilians and address the multiple crises which have left armed gangs holding sway in large parts of the country.

In addition to Benin’s contribution of personnel, Mr. Dujarric said the UN has received, as of Wednesday, notifications to provide officers from the following governments: the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados and Chad.

And turning to Chad, concerns are growing amid reports of violence and gun battles in N’Djamena, the capital.

Abdou Abarry, the Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Central Africa, said in a statement that he is following with great concern the events taking place.

He called on all actors to show calm and restraint, particularly at a time when Chad is entering the final stages of its political transition.

With presidential elections planned for 6 May, Mr. Abarry reiterated that he and the entire UN system continues to be available to continue to support the efforts of the government and the people of Chad to ensure a peaceful, inclusive and credible electoral process.

Media reports on Thursday suggested that opposition leader Yaya Dillo had been killed in a shootout in N’Djamena.

He is cousin of Chad’s military ruler Mahamat Idriss Déby Into, whose father, Idriss Déby, he replaced in 2021 after spending three decades ruling the landlocked nation which borders North and Central Africa. 

According to news reports, Mr. Dillo was blamed for a deadly attack on Chad’s main security agency, although he denied any involvement. 

It was widely believed that he would be the main political opponent of the president in the upcoming vote, according to reports.

Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed Thursday to fulfill Moscow’s goals in Ukraine and sternly warned the West against deeper involvement in the fighting, saying that such a move is fraught with the risk of a global nuclear conflict. (Feb. 29)





















































MOSCOW (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed Thursday to fulfill Moscow’s goals in Ukraine and sternly warned the West against deeper involvement in the fighting, saying that such a move is fraught with the risk of a global nuclear conflict.

Putin’s blunt warning came in a state-of-the-nation address ahead of next month’s election he’s all but certain to win, underlining his readiness to raise the stakes in the tug-of-war with the West to protect the Russian gains in Ukraine.

In an apparent reference to French President Emmanuel Macron’s statement earlier this week that the future deployment of Western ground troops to Ukraine should not be “ruled out”, Putin warned that it would lead to “tragic” consequences for the countries who decide to do that.

Putin noted that while accusing Russia of plans to attack NATO allies in Europe, Western allies were “selecting targets for striking our territory” and “talking about the possibility of sending a NATO contingent to Ukraine.”

“We remember the fate of those who sent their troop contingents to the territory of our country,” the Russian leader said in an apparent allusion to the failed invasions by Napoleon and Hitler. “Now the consequences for the potential invaders will be far more tragic.”




In a two-hour speech before an audience of lawmakers and top officials, Putin cast Western leaders as reckless and irresponsible and declared that the West should keep in mind that “we also have the weapons that can strike targets on their territory, and what they are now suggesting and scaring the world with, all that raises the real threat of a nuclear conflict that will mean the destruction of our civilization.” 

The strong statement followed earlier warnings from Putin, who has issued frequent reminders of Russia’s nuclear might since he sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022 as he sought to discourage the West from expanding its military support for Kyiv. 

Putin emphasized that Russia’s nuclear forces are in “full readiness,” saying that the military has deployed potent new weapons, some of them tested on the battlefield in Ukraine.

The Kremlin leader said they include the new Sarmat heavy intercontinental ballistic missile that has entered service with Russian nuclear forces, along with the Burevestnik atomic-powered cruise missile and the Poseidon atomic-powered, nuclear-armed drone, which are completing their tests.

At the same time, he rejected Western leaders’ statements about the threat of a Russian attack on NATO allies in Europe as “ravings” and again dismissed Washington’s claim that Moscow was pondering the deployment of space-based nuclear weapons.

Putin charged that the U.S. allegations were part of a ploy to draw Russia into talks on nuclear arms control on American terms even as Washington continues its efforts to deliver a “strategic defeat” to Moscow in Ukraine. 

“Ahead of the U.S. election, they just want to show their citizens, as well as others, that they continue to rule the world,” he said. “It won’t work.”

In his speech that focused heavily on economic and social issues ahead of the March 15-17 presidential vote, Putin argued that Russia was “defending its sovereignty and security and protecting our compatriots” in Ukraine, charging that the Russian forces have the upper hand in the fighting.

He reaffirmed his claim that the West was bent on destroying Russia, saying “they need a dependent, waning, dying space in the place of Russia so that they can do whatever they want.” 

The Russian leader honored the troops fallen in Ukraine with a moment of silence, and said that military veterans should form the core of the country’s new elite, inviting them to join a new training program for senior civil servants. 

Putin has repeatedly said that he sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022 to protect Russian interests and prevent Ukraine from posing a major security threat to Russia by joining NATO. Kyiv and its allies have denounced it as an unprovoked act of aggression.

The Russian leader has repeatedly signaled a desire to negotiate an end to the fighting but warned that Russia will hold onto its gains.

Putin, 71, who is running as an independent candidate in the March 15-17 presidential election, relies on the tight control over Russia’s political system that he has established during 24 years in power.

Prominent critics who could challenge him have either been imprisoned or are living abroad, while most independent media have been banned, meaning that Putin’s reelection is all but assured. He faces token opposition from three other candidates nominated by Kremlin-friendly parties represented in parliament.

Russia’s best-known opposition leader Alexei Navalny, whose attempt to run against Putin in 2018 was rejected, died suddenly in an Arctic prison colony earlier this month, while serving a 19-year sentence on extremism charges. Navalny’s funeral is set for Friday.

Russian President Vladimir Putin stepped up his threats against Western countries Thursday, warning that if they send their own troops into Ukraine they risk global nuclear war.

Putin issued the threat at the top of his annual state of the nation address, ahead of a presidential election next month that he is certain to win. He spoke for more than two hours to Russia's Federal Assembly at Moscow's vast and grand Gostiny Dvor conference center, a stone's throw from the Kremlin, surrounded by typically tight security with the surrounding streets cordoned off.

Putin covered an array of topics, from Russia's low birthrate to its need for better broadband coverage. But top of the agenda was his warning against deepening Western involvement in Ukraine.

His comments came after French President Emmanuel Macron suggested this week that NATO allies could send troops to Ukraine in the future, rather than just funding and arming the country indirectly. Macron’s suggestion was swiftly rejected by the United States and others, but Putin said that such a development would risk a wider war with potentially apocalyptic consequences.

“This is very dangerous because it could actually trigger the use of nuclear weapons,” he said. “Do they not understand that?”

He said his strategic nuclear forces were at "full readiness" and suggested that a hypersonic nuclear weapon he first mentioned in 2018 was approaching a full state of readiness — a claim that cannot be verified. 

A spokesperson for the National Security Council told NBC News that “Russia’s nuclear rhetoric is reckless and irresponsible. We will continue to support Ukraine as they defend themselves from Russian aggression.” 

“We have not seen any reason to adjust our own nuclear posture, nor any indications that Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon,” the spokesperson added. 

The NSC reiterated Tuesday that the U.S. will not send troops to fight in Ukraine.

Putin also denied U.S. intelligence that said Russia was developing a space-based nuclear weapon designed to target American satellites.

The idea that Russia is "preparing to launch a nuclear attack in space" was "just a lie to make us look bad," he said.

Putin has often made such threats over the past two years since his full-scale invasion of Ukraine. But this week’s warning was, in the eyes of some observers, his most pointed to date.

Putin’s annual address comes at a crucial moment for the Kremlin, with its forces advancing in Ukraine ahead of an election that will reinforce his rule. The death of opposition leader Alexei Navalny and a slew of domestic issues have fueled criticism at home and abroad, but Putin will be boosted by growing signs of wavering Western support for Kyiv.

On Monday, Macron caused a stir by suggesting that the West “should not exclude” the possibility of sending troops to Ukraine. This would be a huge practical and symbolic step for allied support of Kyiv, which has so far extended to providing billions of dollars for its defense but has deliberately stopped short of sending forces for fear of starting a direct war with nuclear-armed Russia.

The U.S. and others quickly poured cold water on the idea, with the White House saying that it had “been clear that the U.S. will not send troops to fight in Ukraine.” 

Mark Galeotti, head of the consultancy Mayak Intelligence and an honorary professor at University College London, said Macron had handed Putin a “propaganda gift” because it boosted his narrative that Moscow is fighting the West at large, rather than just Ukraine.

During Putin’s speech, “his reference to potential NATO deployments to Ukraine was less, in my opinion, about warning off the West so much as using it to reinforce his message that this is a struggle against the whole collective West,” Galeotti told NBC News. “Macron gave him something of a propaganda gift.”

Five days ago, it was the second anniversary of Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, a war that started badly for Russia with heavy troop losses but has recently seen battlefield gains for the Kremlin’s war machine — and fears that if Western support wavers, Ukraine may struggle to reverse them.

Key to both Putin and Ukraine’s future is who wins the American election.

President Joe Biden recently called Putin a “crazy SOB” for making nuclear threats against the West. Putin called the comments “rude” but nonetheless said he would prefer the incumbent in the White House to former President Donald Trump. That's despite Trump suggesting he would allow Russia to attack NATO allies, and saying he would halt military aid to Ukraine, which would cripple Kyiv's resistance and hand a huge boost to Russia.

A day after the address is the funeral of arch Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, who died in an Arctic penal colony Feb. 16 in what his family and team say was a Putin-directed killing, something the Kremlin denies.

Navalny was a rare voice of dissent in Russia, where Putin has stamped out most forms of political opposition, independent media and free speech. In March, Putin is running for a fifth term in office but the election will, in reality, be a de facto coronation. With all his real adversaries in prison, exiled or dead, his landslide victory is all but certain.

Chef Robbie Felice joins Fox News' Stuart Varney with the latest on how he is expanding his businesses as profits thrive despite record high inflation on 'Varney & Co.'

Atlanta-based Chick-fil-A announced the recall of its popular Polynesian sauce dipping cups because of concerns they were contaminated with wheat and soy allergens.

"Please discard any Polynesian Sauce dipping cups that you may have taken home between February 14-27, 2024," the fast-food chain said on its website. "The Polynesian Sauce dipping cups may contain a different sauce that includes wheat and soy allergens."

A spokesperson for Chick-fil-A told Fox News Digital the manufacturer of the Polynesian dipping sauce packed some of the cups with Sriracha sauce, which contains wheat and soy.

While the exact number of cups was not known, Chick-fil-A costumers were alerted about the recall on the company’s website and application, as well as through signage at the restaurants.

Restaurants in 27 states have removed the potentially contaminated cups from restaurants, though other states will continue to serve the sauce.

One letter calls activist investor Peltz one of the “wolves in sheep’s clothing" and also one of the “villains” in a Disney story. 


							By 

	Caitlin Huston


Business Writer


	The grandchildren of Walt Disney and Roy O. Disney are voicing their support for Bob Iger in his board seat battle against Nelson Peltz.


	Two separate letters were sent to shareholders Thursday from each set of grandchildren, including Abigail Disney, who has been outspoken against recent Disney practices. 




	In the letter from grandchildren of Roy O. Disney, which is signed by Abigail and three others, the grandchildren outline the “magic” they experienced at the company throughout their childhoods, and say that Iger can continue that spirit at the company. Meanwhile, they call Peltz one of the “wolves in sheep’s clothing” and also one of the “villains” in a Disney story.

	“Bob Iger, his management team, and the Board of Directors are faithful to this magic. They understand that the longevity of The Walt Disney Company isn’t only the result of smart business decisions; it is rooted in the strong emotional connection Disney continues to forge with generations of people from around the globe,” the letter reads.




	The statement adds, “We may not agree about everything, but we know that our grandfather would be especially proud of what Disney means to the world today. We also know that, like us, he would be very concerned by the threat posed by self-anointed ‘activist investors’ who are really wolves in sheep’s clothing, just waiting to tear Disney apart if they can trick shareholders into opening the door for them.”


	The Roy O. Disney grandchildren go on to mention the hostile takeover attempt of Disney by Saul Steinberg — who they say was friends with Peltz — and “was defeated, much as these activists must be defeated today.”


	The grandchildren of Walt were more succinct, but also threw their support behind Iger, saying he can help continue the “brand of integrity and storytelling” created by their grandfather. 


	“Bob Iger has grown this company in a modern world, and he continues to maintain a balance of creativity and profit. It is still a company based on the desire to entertain and explore. There have been challenging times, but this current management has adjusted and grown through those challenges,” the letter reads. 


	Peltz, an activist investor, is staging a proxy fight against Disney due to what he says is Disney’s lagging stock performance, as well as a lack of ownership of Disney shares from the company’s board. Blackwells Capital has also nominated its own board slate of Craig Hatkoff, Jessica Schell and Leah Solivan. All parties have been campaigning, including Disney, which launched an animated video featuring Prof. Ludwig Von Drake, in the lead up to the April 3 shareholder meeting. Voting for most shareholders must be submitted before 11:59 p.m. on April 2.

	











	In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Peltz’s Trian Partners pushed back on the claims in the letter. 


	“We love Disney and recognize building on its rich history of delighting loyal fans is essential to its future success. Trian invests in great companies like Disney and helps them grow and thrive for the long term – and we have the track record to prove it at companies like P&G, Heinz and Mondelez,” the statement reads.

Shares of Dell Technologies popped more than 15% during extended trading Thursday after the company released fourth-quarter results that beat analysts' estimates and showed strong demand for its artificial intelligence servers.

Here's how the company did:

Dell's revenue for the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter fell 11% from $25.04 billion in the year-ago quarter. The company reported net income $1.16 billion, up 89% from the $614 million it posted in the same period last year.

Chief Financial Officer Yvonne McGill said in a release that the company is increasing its annual dividend by 20% to $1.78 per share, which she called a "testament to our confidence in the business."

Dell's Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) reported $9.3 billion in revenue for the quarter, down 6% year over year but up 10% from the third quarter. Servers and networking revenue made up the bulk of that, with $4.9 billion in revenue driven by "AI-optimized servers." Storage revenue came in at $4.5 billion.

The company's Client Solutions Group (CSG) reported $11.7 billion for the quarter, down 12% year over year. That includes $9.6 billion in commercial client revenue, which fell 11% since the fourth quarter of last year, and $2.2 billion in consumer revenue, down 19% year over year.

"Our strong AI-optimized server momentum continues, with orders increasing nearly 40% sequentially and backlog nearly doubling, exiting our fiscal year at $2.9 billion," Chief Operating Officer Jeff Clarke said in the release.

For its first quarter, Dell said during its quarterly call with investors that it expects to report revenue between $21 billion and $22 billion.

The company said it is encouraged by momentum around AI, and that it expects to return to growth for fiscal 2025. However, the company noted that the macroeconomic environment is causing some customers to be cautious about infrastructure costs.Don't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:

ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Minnesota’s budget outlook has improved thanks to higher corporate profits, officials said Thursday as they projected a slightly bigger surplus that will give the Legislature a little bit more breathing room this session.Minnesota Management and Budget said the current two-year budget period, which runs through June 2025, is now expected to end with a surplus of just over $3.7 billion. That’s up more than $1.3 billion from the last forecast, which was released in December. That compares with an overall budget of $72 billion, which was set last year.“Our forecast is good news. Our economy is humming along,” Democratic Gov. Tim Walz said at a briefing for reporters. “We made critical investments in our budget last year to grow our economy, lower costs for middle class families, from tax cuts to free school meals, to investments in our workforce and career and technical education.”The budget office is also forecasting a smaller “structural imbalance” for the next two-year budget, which begins in July 2025. If lawmakers spend the entire $3.7 billion surplus, the next budget would start out with a $1.5 billion deficit instead of dipping $2.3 billion into the red as previously forecast. Republican leaders said they still consider that a deficit. But if the entire surplus is left in the bank, the next budget would start out $2.2 billion in the black.“In order to protect the investments that were made in programs that serve Minnesotans, it will be important that policymakers exercise caution in enacting additional ongoing spending this legislative session,” Budget Commissioner Erin Campbell told reporters.Minnesota Democratic Gov.

(AP Photo/Trisha Ahmed)Photo: ASSOCIATED PRESS/Trisha AhmedThe governor said he plans to issue his supplemental budget proposal in a couple weeks. He said it won’t include tax increases. Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman, of Brooklyn Park, said she had already received “a few texts from people asking for things.” But she and other leaders made clear that they don’t plan on much extra spending. “Today’s improved budget forecast shows that Democratic leadership continues to have Minnesota on the right path,” Hortman said at the press conference. She went on to say, “I do not foresee making any commitments to spending that we can’t pay for.”But there’s one place for growth. The improved forecast means that the state can borrow more money for a public infrastructure package known as a bonding bill. State debt guidelines now allow the state to borrow $980 million for the bill, up from $830 million in the previous forecast, because interest rates are slightly lower, Campbell said.Walz said that means there will probably be enough money to add more local projects to the bill, as some lawmakers have urged, but that he’ll leave those decisions to the Legislature. The governor proposed a combination of $982 million in borrowing and cash in January. The final package is still expected to have an unglamorous focus on maintaining the state’s existing infrastructure, like roads, bridges and water treatment facilities. It will require at least some Republican votes to reach the 60% majorities in both chambers that are needed when the state takes on more debt. The budget office said the main reason for the improved outlook is higher tax collections due to higher-than-expected corporate profits, while spending projections have barely changed. The state’s labor shortage isn’t quite as tight as it was. Unemployment remains low but is expected to rise slightly.Republican leaders said the state would be in much better shape if the Democratic majority had not spent the entire $17 billion surplus that the state had going into the 2023 legislative session.“It’s time to cut spending and budget responsibly instead of trying to maintain the reckless spending from last session,” said House Minority Leader Lisa Demuth, a Republican of Cold Spring, at the press conference. “Family budgets and small businesses need meaningful tax relief now. And that’s what Republicans are asking for.”

Tim Walz said at a briefing for reporters. “We made critical investments in our budget last year to grow our economy, lower costs for middle class families, from tax cuts to free school meals, to investments in our workforce and career and technical education.”

The budget office is also forecasting a smaller “structural imbalance” for the next two-year budget, which begins in July 2025. If lawmakers spend the entire $3.7 billion surplus, the next budget would start out with a $1.5 billion deficit instead of dipping $2.3 billion into the red as previously forecast. Republican leaders said they still consider that a deficit. But if the entire surplus is left in the bank, the next budget would start out $2.2 billion in the black.

“In order to protect the investments that were made in programs that serve Minnesotans, it will be important that policymakers exercise caution in enacting additional ongoing spending this legislative session,” Budget Commissioner Erin Campbell told reporters.

The governor said he plans to issue his supplemental budget proposal in a couple weeks. He said it won’t include tax increases. 

Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman, of Brooklyn Park, said she had already received “a few texts from people asking for things.” But she and other leaders made clear that they don’t plan on much extra spending. 

“Today’s improved budget forecast shows that Democratic leadership continues to have Minnesota on the right path,” Hortman said at the press conference. She went on to say, “I do not foresee making any commitments to spending that we can’t pay for.”

But there’s one place for growth. The improved forecast means that the state can borrow more money for a public infrastructure package known as a bonding bill. State debt guidelines now allow the state to borrow $980 million for the bill, up from $830 million in the previous forecast, because interest rates are slightly lower, Campbell said.

Walz said that means there will probably be enough money to add more local projects to the bill, as some lawmakers have urged, but that he’ll leave those decisions to the Legislature. 

The governor proposed a combination of $982 million in borrowing and cash in January. The final package is still expected to have an unglamorous focus on maintaining the state’s existing infrastructure, like roads, bridges and water treatment facilities. It will require at least some Republican votes to reach the 60% majorities in both chambers that are needed when the state takes on more debt. 

The budget office said the main reason for the improved outlook is higher tax collections due to higher-than-expected corporate profits, while spending projections have barely changed. The state’s labor shortage isn’t quite as tight as it was. Unemployment remains low but is expected to rise slightly.

Republican leaders said the state would be in much better shape if the Democratic majority had not spent the entire $17 billion surplus that the state had going into the 2023 legislative session.

“It’s time to cut spending and budget responsibly instead of trying to maintain the reckless spending from last session,” said House Minority Leader Lisa Demuth, a Republican of Cold Spring, at the press conference. “Family budgets and small businesses need meaningful tax relief now. And that’s what Republicans are asking for.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Intuitive Machines and its space-cargo customers expect the company to emerge stronger from its problem-plagued moon landing this week, with improvements set for the company's second lander after its first went where no private firm has gone before.

The company's Odysseus moon lander on Thursday ended its week-long mission near the lunar south pole after a mix of successes and failures that illustrated the type of risks the company and NASA, the mission's biggest backer, have come to embrace.

NASA is counting on a series of low-budget, private excursions to the moon to serve as pathfinders for missions carrying astronauts this decade. The plan allows financial room for failure and offers companies big incentives to succeed on a shoestring.

"It's a new way of going to the moon, eventually to Mars, and it's a new moon that we go to," NASA chief Bill Nelson said in an interview, calling Intuitive Machines' mission a successful example. "We don't go to a permanently lit, smoother area on the equator like Apollo, we go to a very hazardous, dark area with a bunch of pits."

Intuitive's shares - which had nearly tripled, then plummeted in wild swings over the course of the Odysseus mission - closed on Thursday up about 20% from before the launch, giving the company a market value of about $600 million.

In its final descent, Odysseus stumbled to an off-kilter landing that left it leaning sharply to one side after a series of technical problems, including the need for a last-minute workaround for a laser instrument designed to tell the spacecraft where the surface was.

The rough touchdown impeded the vehicle's functions once it arrived. NASA and the lander's commercial participants could communicate with their instruments but failed to get all the data they wanted.

Studies on galactic observations, for instance, "will not be conducted, nor will an image of the galaxy be obtained,” said Steve Durst, who led a team at the Hawaii-based International Lunar Observatory Association that put a dual-camera system on board Odysseus to capture images of the Milky Way Galaxy from the lunar surface.

Still, Durst said: "We're delighted that our country has finally touched the moon again - even though a little bit stumbling - but we're back. And that's significant."

And although other experiments were disappointing - a camera developed by students at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University never deployed in space as intended - some worked fine.

Lonestar Data Holdings, a Houston-based startup developing space-based data centers, had a small server aboard the lander to test data transmission between Earth and the moon.

"We got everything we needed out of the mission, and we're incredibly happy," Lonestar chief executive Chris Stott said. Lonestar has already booked space on the next Intuitive Machines flight this year.

That mission, called IM-2, is sold out, and a third is planned. Intuitive chief executive Steve Altemus said Wednesday that since the landing, the European Space Agency had expressed interest in flying on one of his company's missions.

Altemus said that non-lethal mistakes had illustrated an array of improvements to make on IM-2. The most egregious mistake on the mission was forgetting to turn off a safety switch that prevented the landing laser from working; Altemus said the IM-1 team had gotten better at anticipating potential problems and workarounds.

"As we went through the mission, we got further and further ahead thinking about the possible failures, and what could get us, and what we had to fix in that certain time frame," he said.

As for the equipment, "When I think of major redesigns, I'm thinking about adding cameras, and adding antennas, things like that," he added.

Part of the mission's success was that, by past standards of space budgets, it was a bargain.

NASA put $118 million into the Intuitive Machines mission, and the company spent roughly $100 million itself.

"This was not an Apollo-era, multibillion-dollar program where a failure's not an option. These are the low-cost bets, an order of magnitude cheaper," said Chad Anderson, head of venture capital firm Space Capital. "So you get to try again."

Microsoft (MSFT) continues to roll out more generative AI capabilities across its software offerings with the debut of its Copilot for Finance. The company says the AI service, which is launching as a public preview, will make it easier for workers to sort data and find errors in financial reports.

Microsoft has been adding its generative AI-powered Copilots to a slew of its business offerings ranging from Copilot for Microsoft 365 and Copilot for Sales to Copilot for Service. That’s in addition to the company’s Copilot in Windows 11, which is built into all Windows 11 PCs running the latest software updates.

Microsoft’s Copilot for Finance, the company says, can provide real-time insights into corporate finance data, cutting down on the rigamarole of having to enter and search through seemingly endless rows and columns in Excel.

The tech giant says its latest Copilot can also streamline audits, detect data variances, and help users generate PowerPoint presentations and emails based on available financial information using natural language prompts.

The Windows maker isn’t revealing pricing for Copilot for Finance, but the service includes the company’s Copilot for Microsoft 365, which adds generative AI capabilities to the Microsoft 365 productivity suite. That platform traditionally costs $30 per user per month.

Microsoft is putting an enormous amount of effort into ensuring it has a Copilot for each of its productivity platforms as it races to out-innovate rivals, including Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Salesforce (CRM). Both of those companies, as well as a slew of other smaller firms, are also building generative AI services for their enterprise products to prove to customers that they’re on the bleeding edge of today’s hottest tech trend.

Last week, Google debuted its Gemini Business, a $20-per-month add-on for its Gemini for Workspace productivity suite. The company also offers Gemini Enterprise, a $30-per-month add-on for Gemini for Workspace with enhanced features for meeting summaries and transcriptions.

The push to bring generative AI tools to more enterprise-friendly services comes as Microsoft and its rivals seek to further monetize their enormous investments in generative AI technologies in recent years.

Microsoft has already invested billions of dollars in ChatGPT developer OpenAI and is lined up to invest billions more throughout the next decade. On Tuesday, the company also disclosed it is working with OpenAI rival Mistral and will begin offering that firm’s AI models via its Azure cloud platform.

In its most recent earnings report, Microsoft revealed that AI services contributed 6 percentage points of growth to Azure revenue, up from 3% in the prior quarter. Shares of the tech juggernaut are up 63% over the last 12 months.

Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.

As Bitcoin soars past $57,000, JPMorgan analysts are challenging the narrative surrounding the upcoming Bitcoin halving scheduled for April. Contrary to widespread anticipation, the financial giant suggests that the event, which historically triggered market movements, is already factored into the current cryptocurrency prices. 

JPMorgan points to a resurgence of retail interest as the driving force behind Bitcoin’s recent surge and highlights on-chain data indicating a shift in dynamics between retail and institutional investors.

JPMorgan’s note to clients identifies three main crypto catalysts anticipated in the coming months: the Bitcoin halving, the next major upgrade of the Ethereum network, and the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by the SEC in May. 

While the first two catalysts are deemed largely priced in, the analysts express a cautious outlook, assigning only a 50% chance to the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by the SEC.

JPMorgan analysts emphasize that the Bitcoin halving, an event occurring every four years, is unlikely to be the sole catalyst behind the recent price surge. The analysts contend that retail investors are actively participating in the market, allocating funds to new spot Bitcoin ETFs at a faster rate than institutional investors. This shift in dynamics is challenging the traditional market dynamic in that institutional interest is the primary catalyst behind Bitcoin’s price movements.

JPMorgan’s analysis delves into on-chain data, revealing that retail investors are significantly outpacing institutional flows. The team highlights a notable surge in retail activity on Coinbase, a major U.S. crypto exchange, and points to a broader trend of retail interest extending beyond Bitcoin. 

The inclusion of smaller digital coins and tokens like Dogecoin, in the retail investment landscape is noted as a significant factor contributing to the current market dynamics.

Looking beyond price dynamics, JPMorgan’s analysis extends to the post-halving landscape for Bitcoin miners. The report suggests that miners with below-average electricity costs and efficient equipment are likely to thrive post-halving, while those with high production costs may face challenges. Consequently, concentration of the Bitcoin mining industry is expected, with publicly listed miners gaining a higher share to enhance overall cost efficiency.

As Bitcoin continues its upward trajectory, JPMorgan’s assessment challenges conventional expectations tied to the upcoming halving event.

Two Wall Street wealth management giants, Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo, are adding spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds to their brokerage platforms, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

Ever since the launch of the 10 ETFs in January, industry participants have been wondering when major U.S. brokerages would start offering the funds to their clients, which could potentially bring much more buying power to the market for bitcoin ETFs.

The Bloomberg story follows a CoinDesk scoop Wednesday that Morgan Stanley, another titan in the space, is in the midst of deciding whether to give clients the option to invest in the funds. In January, CoinDesk reported first that UBS and Citigroup were letting some customers buy bitcoin ETFs.

Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo have been offering the bitcoin ETFs to clients who specifically asked to get exposure to it, Bloomberg reported.

Even without the participation of players of this caliber, the ETFs have seen tremendous demand since they began trading on Jan. 11. On Wednesday alone, a record $7.7 billion worth of all the funds traded.

Nevertheless, the entrance of Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and, perhaps, Morgan Stanley could bring a new wave of demand, Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan said earlier on Thursday.

The cryptocurrency world is filled with speculation following several financial movements made by the founder of Amazon, Jeff Bezos, which have generated rumors that he might invest in Bitcoin. The chatter gained momentum after Apollo co-founder Thomas Fahrer hinted on X about Bezos’s recent activities, suggesting a significant move into the cryptocurrency space.

According to the report, Jeff Bezos has recently sold Amazon shares amounting to $8.5 billion, and this move has, in turn, attracted the attention of financial analysts and crypto followers. Despite the sale, Bezos is still the main shareholder in Amazon, and his wealth is beyond $190 billion. This action occurs when Amazon’s market price grows considerably, jumping over 76% in the previous year.

Further fueling the rumors, Bezos was spotted at a dinner event with his fiancée, Lauren Sanchez, and with Michael Saylor, a Bitcoin supporter and the CEO of MicroStrategy. Saylor’s company has appeared in the news due to its huge Bitcoin portfolio, pointing out that cryptocurrency could have been a subject between the two moguls. Considering Saylor’s influence and success within cryptocurrency, this meeting has only added to the curiosity about Bezos’s potential venture into Bitcoin.

Additionally, InvestAnswers, a crypto analyst, pointed to a new Bitcoin wallet transaction involving 26,200 BTC, valued at $51K each, possibly linked to a high-net-worth individual like Bezos. This speculation is grounded in the timing and scale of Bezos’s stock sales, combined with the enigmatic yet substantial Bitcoin purchase, leading many to wonder about the investor’s identity behind it.

The price of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is based on supply and demand. However, because supply will never exceed 21 million coins, demand for the cryptocurrency is the only variable of consequence. That means the future price trajectory of Bitcoin depends entirely on whether demand increases or decreases from its current level.

With that in mind, certain Wall Street analysts believe two catalysts will boost demand for Bitcoin in the future, so much so that the cryptocurrency could soar 700% or more from its current price of about $50,000 by the end of the decade. Here's what investors should know.

A Fidelity report recently identified several signs of growing demand for Bitcoin. Monthly active addresses, monthly new addresses, and monthly transactions are all trending higher. The illiquid supply of Bitcoin (i.e., the percentage that has not moved in over a year) is near a record high and trending upward, meaning more investors are holding the cryptocurrency. And the number of accounts with at least 0.1 Bitcoin hit a record high in December 2023.

Beyond those trends, two catalysts could create more demand for Bitcoin in the future. First, the Securities and Exchange Commission recently approved several spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Those investment vehicles provide direct exposure to the cryptocurrency without the hassle of buying and storing Bitcoin. By reducing friction, spot Bitcoin ETFs could draw more retail and institutional investors into the market. Indeed, the collective inflows across spot Bitcoin ETFs during the first month of trading were higher than the inflows of any other ETF launch in history.

Second, Bitcoin mining rewards are reduced by 50% every time 210,000 blocks are added to the blockchain, which happens about once every four years. The next halving event is scheduled to take place in April and it will effectively boost demand by reducing selling pressure. To elaborate, miners sell Bitcoin to monetize their operations, but they will have 50% less Bitcoin to sell after the April halving event.

There is a historical precedent for Bitcoin increasing in value after mining rewards are cut in half, as shown in the table below.

Anthony Scaramucci, founder and managing partner at Skybridge Capital, recently told podcast host Scott Melker that Bitcoin could reach $240,000 within 18 months of the April halving event. Scaramucci also said Bitcoin would eventually achieve half the market capitalization of gold, bringing its per-coin value to roughly $400,000. That implies 700% upside from its current price of $50,000.

Tom Lee, managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, recently told CNBC that Bitcoin could reach $500,000 in the next five years, implying 900% upside from its current price. "There's a finite supply and now we have a potentially huge increase in demand with spot Bitcoin [ETF] approval, so I think in five years something around half a million would be potentially achievable," Lee said in January.

Cathie Wood, founder and chief executive officer of Ark Invest, recently discussed her Bitcoin valuation model with CNBC. Her base-case valuation is roughly $600,000 by 2030, implying 1,100% upside from its current price. But her bull-case valuation is $1.5 million by 2030, implying 2,900% upside from its current price. Wood said spot Bitcoin ETF approval makes the bull case more likely.

Bitcoin could be worth more (perhaps much more) in the future. But investors cannot make informed decisions without understanding the risks.

First, historical data is limited. Bitcoin was created less than two decades ago, whereas stocks and bonds have been around for centuries. That makes speculation difficult where Bitcoin is concerned. For instance, there is no precedent for its performance during a deep recession.

Second, Bitcoin has historically been quite volatile. It has fallen at least 50% from a record high three times in the past five years, and it plunged more than 75% during the most recent cryptocurrency market crash. Investors should expect that volatility to persist in the future.

Third, Bitcoin has been associated with fraud, money laundering, and other criminal activity. Certain countries have banned the cryptocurrency and other countries are still building regulatory frameworks. Future changes in the regulatory landscape could damp demand for Bitcoin.

Patient investors comfortable with those risks should consider buying Bitcoin today.

					The chronic disease affects roughly one-eighth of the global population				

The global prevalence of obesity has soared over the last 30 years. A new analysis suggests that more than 1 billion people worldwide now live with the chronic disease.

5 hours ago

It’s no secret that global obesity rates have been rising over the past few decades. But a new analysis quantifies the upsurge.

More than 1 billion people worldwide were living with obesity as of 2022, researchers report February 29 in the Lancet. That’s about one-eighth of the global population (SN: 11/15/22). For comparison, nearly 800 million people had obesity in 2016, according to the World Health Organization, or WHO.

Obesity is “defined by the presence of excess body fat that impairs health,” says obesity expert Arya Sharma of the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, who was not involved in the study. The chronic disease can raise the risk for conditions like heart disease and type 2 diabetes, vulnerability to diseases like COVID-19, and can also limit mobility and negatively affect mental health (SN: 4/22/20).

Global health researcher Majid Ezzati and colleagues examined more than 3,600 population-based studies published over the last several decades encompassing 222 million participants across nearly 200 countries and territories. The researchers divided each participant’s reported weight by their height squared to find their body mass index, or BMI.

Analyzing the trends suggested that in 2022, almost 900 million adults worldwide had a BMI of 30 or above, classifying them as having obesity. In children and adolescents ages 5 to 19, nearly 160 million were estimated to have the chronic disease, defined as BMI above a certain point on the WHO’s growth reference curves, which account for age and sex.

From 1990 to 2022, the prevalence of obesity roughly doubled in women, tripled in men and quadrupled in children and adolescents. At the same time, global rates of those who were underweight fell. “We shouldn’t be thinking about [underweight and obesity] as two separate things, because the transition from one to the other has been very rapid,” says Ezzati, of Imperial College London.

The estimated obesity rates should raise alarms, he says. “Governments and societies need to deal with this” through prevention and medical care. Despite new anti-obesity medications like Wegovy showing incredible results, Ezzati adds, their high costs and lack of incorporation in worldwide medical guidance will make them inaccessible to most people for the near future (SN: 12/13/23).

Ezzati notes that one of the biggest driving factors of obesity’s increased prevalence is limited access to and the unaffordability of healthy foods. Sharma adds that societal-level lifestyle changes — such as getting less sleep, increased stress levels and spending less time at home — can also lead to eating more processed foods and overconsumption (SN: 12/21/18; SN: 5/16/19).

“When you look at appetite, there’s a complex biology behind it,” Sharma says. “And that biology is affected by environmental changes.”

The surprise pregnancy of Charlotte, a stingray living in a tank without any male rays, has captivated people across the world and stirred a sudden interest in parthenogenesis, a scientific term that essentially means virgin birth. 

Speculation about the stingray has racked up more than 12 million views for a TikToker. The talk show host Jimmy Kimmel weighed in on Charlotte’s apparent immaculate conception with a segment about the ray, which resides at the Aquarium & Shark Lab, in Hendersonville, North Carolina. 

While a virgin birth sounds like a rare event, experts on parthenogenesis said Charlotte has performed a miracle of life far more common than most people understand. Dozens of species — zebra sharks, California condors and Komodo dragons — can reproduce asexually through parthenogenesis. Scientists have only started to unravel the mysteries of this phenomenon, and a better understanding of the process could help them harness its power for conservation. 

“There’s nothing unnatural about asexual reproduction,” said Mercedes Burns, a biologist at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, who studies sexual conflict in animals. “Invertebrates or fishes are doing amazing things in their lifetimes in order to reproduce successfully.” 

The frenzy over Charlotte’s baby bump began earlier this month, when the Aquarium & Shark Lab announced that the stingray was expecting, suggesting on social media that she’d been either impregnated by a shark that shares her cage or that she had developed pups through parthenogenesis. 

Kevin Feldheim, a researcher at Chicago’s Field Museum who is a parthenogenesis expert, said the shark impregnation theory might have helped make Charlotte a media darling, but it has no basis in reality because they are such distant genetic relatives. 

“The divergence between sharks and stingrays is 350 million years. And as comparison, the divergence between humans and platypus is 180 millions years,” he said. “The shark scientists were not really happy with that press release. No one would even think of that as an option.” 

Once the ray gives birth to pups, researchers will have to evaluate the offspring and do genetic testing to confirm they’re the results of parthenogenesis, which is the only likely cause, Feldheim said. He added that confirmation will be important because elasmobranchs — a subclass of fish that includes rays, sharks and skates — can store viable sperm for several years in a special gland. 

Scientists are only just beginning to understand how many species can perform parthenogenesis. He said the first convincing evidence of the phenomenon in sharks was published in 2007. 

Feldheim said he’s counted 15 species of elasmobranchs where parthenogenesis has been observed by scientists since then. 

The phenomenon has been observed in every class of animals, except for mammals, which have a mechanism that prevents parthenogenesis.  

“Genes responsible for early stage development of zygotes have to come from both sperm and egg. If they’re only present in the egg, that zygote will arrest its development,” Burns explained, adding that mammals are “all in” on sexual reproduction. 

The common form of parthenogenesis happens during meiosis, when gametes (the cells that create new organisms in sexual reproduction) are created. When eggs are produced, byproducts are created called polar bodies, which contain genetic information. 

During spontaneous parthenogenesis, eggs fuse with polar bodies to create a new offspring without the genetic contribution of another parent. 

The extent to which parthenogenesis exists in the wild remains unclear. It’s often observed in zoos, where it’s easier to spot because animals are separated from one another and often solitary. 

“Females are held in aquariums around the world, oftentimes without a male, and if they started laying eggs, I‘m assuming aquariums would toss them, because they weren’t fertile,” Feldheim said. “It’s now being studied in a little more depth in a couple species around the world because we’ve started to know how it’s relatively common in a captive setting.”

The process could be playing out in wild animals with similar rates, but it’s much harder to detect. 

Why vertebrates have developed the ability to reproduce asexually is a bit of mystery. 

Researchers found a population of small tooth sawfish in Florida that’s just barely hanging on, Feldheim said. The researchers found several of the creatures were reproducing through parthenogenesis. 

“This species is at much lower numbers than it has been in the past. It’s very possible those females couldn’t find a mate,” he said, which would make parthenogenesis a “backup way” to reproduce when pickings are slim. 

But, the phenomenon has also been demonstrated in zebra sharks when mates were available. 

Burns said it’s possible parthenogenesis is a response to environment feedback. It’s also possible it’s just a happy fluke of cell division and a reminder of how life can bring gifts of random chance and little explanation.

					Understanding the effect could help forecasters determine whether a hurricane may strengthen after landfall				

Hurricane Florence roared across the Carolinas in September 2018, gaining new intensity as it swept over already waterlogged soils. The resulting rainfall broke records, and floodwaters continued to inundate towns such as Conway, S.C., (shown) two weeks after the storm had passed.

Once a hurricane makes landfall, it’s usually the beginning of the end for the storm. But a tropical cyclone passing over warm, waterlogged ground can get a jolt of energy that refuels its fury, researchers reported in January at the American Meteorological Society’s meeting in Baltimore.

This phenomenon, called the brown ocean effect, mimics how the ocean fuels tropical cyclones by giving the storms a ready supply of water and heat. Understanding this effect, researchers say, could help forecasters warn residents that an inland hurricane might counterintuitively strengthen.

Using satellite measurements of wind speeds, rainfall and soil moisture, geologist Dev Niyogi and colleagues examined how this effect was at play for Hurricane Florence, a relatively weak storm when it made landfall in the Carolinas in September 2018 (SN: 9/13/18). The data revealed a powerful feedback mechanism: As Florence passed over already-soaking soil, its rains intensified, ultimately leading to record-breaking rainfall and flooding.

It’s one of the first observational confirmations of this long-hypothesized phenomenon, says Niyogi, of the University of Texas at Austin. The brown ocean effect can also help some storms stay strong longer as they travel over land, he says, allowing them to penetrate deeper inland before dissipating (SN: 11/11/2020).

The idea of the brown ocean effect was described in 2013 by atmospheric scientist Marshall Shepherd and geographer Theresa Andersen, prompted in part by the very strange evolution of Tropical Storm Erin in 2007. The storm was weak and disorganized when it made landfall, but as it drifted northwest toward Oklahoma, it encountered flooded ground due to heavy rains that year. The storm suddenly strengthened, puzzling scientists as it even formed an eye for the first time.

Computer simulations have long suggested that wetter soils can intensify monsoon rains as well as cyclones. “Water evaporates from the ocean as water vapor, but when it gets into hurricanes, it condenses,” says Shepherd, of the University of Georgia in Athens. As the water changes from gas to liquid, it also releases heat — a jolt of storm-strengthening energy.

In Anderson’s dissertation work at the University of Georgia, she identified at least a dozen storms between 1997 and 2008, including Tropical Storm Erin, that were probably strengthened by this effect post-landfall.

And now, Shepherd says, there’s a growing body of scientific studies hunting for — and finding — the fingerprints of this effect in specific storms. “Tropical storms are not intelligent,” he says. “They don’t know the difference between wet soils, oceans and wetlands” as sources of energy.

The new study is among that body of work. Niyogi and colleagues used high-resolution satellite data on soil moisture, temperature and changes in rainfall before, during and after Hurricane Florence’s arrival on land. “As the storm system was moving, you could trace the source of moisture, see rainfall maxima,” Niyogi says.

The data revealed a powerful positive feedback between bursts of intense rain and soil moisture, the team found. How long the soils were wet before the storm passed over them also made a difference, they calculated: The heaviest rains occurred over soil that had already been saturated for about three days. That’s about how long evaporation from the soaked soil helped keep the atmosphere just above the ground nice and humid — ideal for feeding energy to a storm.

Saturated soil isn’t the only criterion — soil temperature was also key, the team determined. When the soil reaches a certain threshold temperature — one that’s yet to be determined, Niyogi says — the conditions are especially right to spin up a storm. The team’s findings were also reported in 2023 in Geophysical Research Letters.

Shepherd coauthored a separate study, also presented at the American Meteorological Society’s January meeting, that detailed how the effect contributed to flash floods inundating Texas during 2015’s Tropical Storm Bill.

And perhaps the most striking recent case of this effect came in 2021, when Hurricane Ida roared ashore in Louisiana, at almost the same location as 2005’s Hurricane Katrina. However, Ida lingered much longer before dissipating — probably fueled by days of rain soaking the ground and increasing the humidity ahead of its landfall, researchers reported in 2022 in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.

What these data show, Niyogi says, is that “the brown ocean effect exists, if you look for it.”

Shepherd agrees: These studies confirm that the brown ocean effect “is real,” and that computer weather models need to incorporate the influence of land as well as ocean and atmosphere on tropical storms. That’s particularly important when it comes to forecasting the danger these storms might pose to inland residents, he says. “If a storm moves inland, the model needs to capture that there’s wet soil there.”

          / CBS Chicago
        

CHICAGO (CBS) -- A hack at the company Change Healthcare has crippled pharmacies across the country – in just the latest in a troubling trend in which cyberattacks have affected people's health across the country.

A Naperville man has been left pleading for help from his hospital bed. He said when he went to the pharmacy, he was told he would need to pay out of pocket for medicine on which he depends.

"They said, 'There's nothing we can do for you,'" said Alan Townsend.

Townsend said he ended up in the hospital after trying to pick up his medications for congestive heart failure and diabetes – only to be told Medicaid would not cover the cost.

"This is medicine that if I don't take it, I'll die," Townsend said.

The cyberattack targeted Change Healthcare – which processes transactions for about one in three U.S. patients' records. Hospitals and pharmacies can't get paid – and some patients are unable to get their medication.

In some cases, it has even led to delays in hospital discharges.

"Right now, I'm trapped in the hospital," said Townsend. "I just can't imagine what people are going through that are worse than me."

Patrick Berryman is with the National Community Pharmacists Association – made up of independently-owned pharmacies.

"In some cases, they might have been asked to pay cash. In other cases, they may have been given a couple of days' supply," Berryman said. "Change Healthcare was one of the two biggest switches in the country that independent pharmacies had to deal with."

A Russian-speaking ransomware group known as Blackcat has claimed responsibility for stealing more than six terabytes of sensitive medical records.

Toby Gouker is with First Health Advisory – a cybersecurity firm with clients in the health industry.

"It's an attack on the healthcare supply chain," Gouker said. "Some of the larger systems are losing $100 million or so a day of revenue."

"It's super frustrating to know my life is getting worse because of the system," added Townsend. "It needs to be fixed, and needs to be fixed fast."

Since the attack, many pharmacies have developed workarounds to get prescriptions processed. Deerfield-based Walgreens say they are continuing to fill prescriptions with minimal delay or interruption.

By  Amrita Khalid, one of the authors of audio industry newsletter Hot Pod. Khalid has covered tech, surveillance policy, consumer gadgets, and online communities for more than a decade. 

Health insurance provider UnitedHealth has identified Blackcat as the group behind a debilitating cyber attack that has disrupted healthcare providers nationwide, Reuters is reporting. The attack has led to more than a week-long outage of the the United-owned Change Healthcare system, disrupting payments at hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies across the nation. 

Since Change Healthcare acts as a middleman between healthcare providers and insurance companies, the breach has hindered everyday transactions like electronic pharmacy refills and new insurance claims. The company first identified suspicious activity on its IT systems on February 21st, according to an SEC filing. 

The breach could last for weeks, UnitedHealth Group Chief Operating Officer Dirk McMahon told STAT. The insurance company is setting up a loan program for healthcare providers in the meantime. 

Blackcat, also known as ALPHV, has claimed credit for numerous hacks over the past year, including the MGM casino breach in Las Vegas, a hack on Reddit’s systems, and many others. 

In a joint cybersecurity advisory, federal agencies including CISA and the FBI warned that Blackcat is now intentionally targeting the healthcare system. “Since mid-December 2023, of the nearly 70 leaked victims, the healthcare sector has been the most commonly victimized,” the agencies wrote.

The US government has even offered a combined $15 million reward for any actionable intelligence on the group’s whereabouts. An attempt by the FBI to seize Blackcat’s servers and sites last year seemingly failed —the group quickly regained control. 

In a darknet message that was later deleted on Wednesday, Blackcat also claimed it stole millions of patient records, including sensitive medical and insurance data in the UnitedHealth breach, Reuters reported. The group also admitted, in the same message, to stealing data from Medicare, the military medical agency Tricare, and even CVS Health. No further details were provided about the timing of these breaches, and the message was reportedly deleted without explanation. Reuters was unable to reach the hackers or verify any of their claims.

Even the theft of sensitive records from UnitedHealth alone could impact millions of people. Change Healthcare handles nearly 1 in 3 patient records in the US, the American Hospital Association told HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra in a letter sent on Monday. “Any prolonged disruption of Change Healthcare’s systems will negatively impact many hospitals’ ability to offer the full set of health care services to their communities,” wrote AHA president Richard J. Pollack. 

UnitedHealth is currently working with Google-owned Mandiant and cybersecurity software vendor Palo Alto Networks, CNBC reports.  The company hasn’t indicated whether it plans to pay the ransom.

Health care providers across the country are reeling from a cyberattack on a massive U.S. health care technology company that has threatened the security of patients’ information and is delaying some prescriptions and paychecks for medical workers. 

The hack could also disrupt discharging people from the hospital, a major hospital association said.

Change Healthcare announced Thursday that a ransomware group that had claimed responsibility for the attack was at fault. Change Healthcare also said it is assessing the impact of the attack, which it first acknowledged on Feb. 21 and has affected billing and care-authorization portals across the country.

“Patient care is our top priority and we have multiple workarounds to ensure people have access to the medications and the care they need,” Change Healthcare said in a statement.

Owned by UnitedHealth Group, Change Healthcare manages health care technology pipelines, processing 14 billion transactions a year. The company said its investigation determined that Change Healthcare, Optum, UnitedHealthcare and UnitedHealth Group systems have been affected. Change also confirmed Thursday that ransomware group ALPHV, or Blackcat, made the breach. The company didn’t respond to a question about whether it paid or negotiated a ransom. 




One of the most immediate impacts is that people are seeing delays in getting prescriptions, American Hospital Association spokesperson Ben Teicher said. Change Healthcare said most affected pharmacies are using workarounds like writing things down.

But the severity of the situation may still be unfolding, the American Hospital Association said in an email to The Associated Press. Hospitals are having issues with processing claims, billing patients and checking insurance coverage for care, the AHA said, but the attack also could affect the ability to pay workers and buy medicine and supplies. 

“The impact to hospitals is just now really starting to crystallize and as a result has been underreported,” Teicher said. “As a result we can’t really speak to the longer term aftermath, but it can result in hospitals not being able to make payroll or patients still waiting for services to be approved.”

Health systems told the Healthcare Association of New York State that they’ve had trouble with various things, including “an inability to verify patient eligibility and coverage … communicate pharmacy prescriptions, file claims … and receive normal cash flow to support operations, among other issues,” association president Bea Grause said. 

Several major health care providers that serve multiple states did not respond to requests for comment. 

Cybersecurity experts say ransomware attacks have increased substantially in recent years, especially in the health care sector. This one comes on the heels of an attack last month on a children’s hospital in Chicago, which had to take phone, email and medical records systems offline. 

An FBI spokesperson in Tennessee said he could not confirm or deny whether the FBI is investigating. The FBI also said it’s “aware of this incident” but didn’t have anything else to provide because the incident “is ongoing.” 

“As far as we can tell, the attack is being contained,” said Allan Liska, a threat intelligence analyst at Recorded Future. “We don’t think it’s going to get worse. But when you have a critical system like this that’s down for an extended period … the longer it’s down and the longer that recovery takes, the more impact it’s going to have on patient care.”

Thousands of pharmacies and health systems throughout the country, including in Washington, are scrambling to find different ways to fill prescriptions and bill for medication after a recent cyberattack hit a division of UnitedHealthcare, the nation’s largest health insurer.

The data breach on Change Healthcare, part of UnitedHealth’s Optum, was discovered  Feb. 21 and appeared to be coming from a foreign country, The New York Times reported earlier this week. A spokesperson for UnitedHealth estimated more than 63,000 pharmacies nationwide have been affected by the attack and have been forced to “[modify] electronic claim processing to mitigate impacts,” but said the system has received “no reports of continuity of care issues.”

“They are downplaying it,” said Jenny Arnold, CEO of the Washington State Pharmacy Association, which provides support for the state’s 2,000 community pharmacies and their staffers. “And the pharmacy community is frustrated.”

While the effects of the breach vary widely, Arnold said “nearly every pharmacy and health system is impacted in some way.”

Change, which was acquired by UnitedHealth Group in 2022, mainly helps pharmacies verify a patient’s insurance coverage for their prescriptions, facilitate and send electronic prescriptions and check claims information, but many other types of health systems, including hospitals, physician groups and dental clinics, also use the platform, Arnold said.

“For some pharmacies it is as simple as some of their systems have glitches, and they cannot process manufacturer and other discount cards,” she wrote in a message. “Some are not able to received electronic prescriptions and some have more severe challenges processing prescriptions.”

In the past week, many pharmacies have found other ways to process prescriptions and submit claims, which are “working well,” but UnitedHealth’s lack of transparency around the problem has been difficult, Arnold said. 

“Since identifying the cyber incident, we have worked closely with customers and clients to ensure people have access to the medications and the care they need,” UnitedHealth said in a statement this week. “We also continue to work closely with law enforcement and a number of third parties … on this attack against Change Healthcare’s systems.”

UnitedHealth has not shared an updated timeline for when systems might be back online.

Change also handles a number of prescription drug discount cards, which allows holders with or without insurance to save money on medication. Because they’re distributed and processed electronically, Arnold added that pharmacies are still working to find reliable discount card alternatives.

“As these are for expensive medications, most of these patients are electing to wait until the coupon goes through before picking up their medications,” said Matt Binder, who owns three Seattle-area pharmacies, including Ostroms Drug & Gift, Bob Johnsons Pharmacy and Madison Park Pharmacy and Wellness Center. 

Fortunately, Binder said, impacts to his stores have been limited since they don’t use Change systems for electronic prescriptions or for billing insurance. 

Another big unknown, Arnold said, is what happens when pharmacies can’t see whether an insurance plan is going to cover an entire claim, potentially resulting in reimbursement problems for health systems and higher copay charges for patients after they get their medication. 

“Health systems are providing care hoping the claim will be paid after services are rendered,” Arnold said. “It’s leaving a lot of health care in the lurch. I fear pharmacies and health systems are going to end up disproportionately bearing the burden of this outage.”

While it’s unclear exactly how many pharmacies in Washington use Change software, a spokesperson for Rite Aid, which owns Bartell Drugs, said “only a small percentage” of the store’s claims were  affected by the outage and that it was able to process many claims through another billing system.

Last week’s breach is the largest recent cyberattack on a health care-related system, though these types of attacks have become more common in recent years, prompting federal cybersecurity agencies to prioritize cybersafety among hospitals and other health organizations.

In December, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported that the medical data of more than 88 million people was exposed in the first 10 months of 2023. The department also saw a 93% increase in large, health care-related breaches reported to the agency between 2018 and 2022.

Health systems are generally targeted because of the massive amount of medical data they store, which can be extremely valuable to hackers, but also because of their increasing reliance on technology and Internet-connected devices, according to local cyber experts.

In this case, Arnold encouraged patients to first check in with their regular pharmacy to see which prescriptions it can still fill and what its capabilities are. 

“The pharmacy that knows you best knows which insurance you have, what meds you’ve filled and are in the best place to help you,” she said. “Even if that’s suggesting you go to another pharmacy.”

NEWS ALERT: Senate passes short-term spending bill to prevent government shut down, heads to Biden next 



CNN 

February 29, 2024, 8:12 AM

Washington (CNN) — A week after a cyberattack disrupted insurance processing at pharmacies across the US, health care professionals from Maryland to New York tell CNN that the hack continues to upend their businesses, potentially cutting into revenue.

Raeya Disney, a psychotherapist who treats trauma victims in Maryland, said she worries she is “at risk of having to give up my office space” if the billing outage continues much longer.

“I’ve begun manually billing and I’m praying that I will be paid,” Disney told CNN.

Purvi Parikh, an allergist with a private practice in New York, said the hacking incident “just puts a lot more burden on physician practices, hospitals, pharmacies that now are scrambling to figure out the alternatives of how to get claims submitted or fill prescriptions.”

Parikh hasn’t been able to submit claims to insurance carriers for a week, she said.

It’s all part of the fallout from a cyberattack that a week ago hit Change Healthcare, a unit of health IT giant UnitedHealth that processes prescriptions to insurance for tens of thousands of pharmacies nationwide.

Carter Groome, chief executive of Health First Advisory, a cybersecurity firm whose clients include big health care organizations, estimated that some health care providers are losing more than $100 million per day because of the outage.

“That’s just not sustainable in an industry with not a lot of cash on hand,” Groome told CNN.

“This is our Colonial Pipeline,” he said, referring to a 2021 ransomware on one of America’s biggest pipelines that disrupted fuel shipments for days and cemented ransomware as a national security concern in the minds of senior US officials.

In the wake of the hack, Elevance Health, which owns Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield and insures millions of Americans, has severed network connections to Change Healthcare “out of an abundance of caution,” Elevance spokesperson Leslie Porras told CNN in an email.

“The ability for our members to access medical care, services or fill their prescriptions remains unaffected,” Porras said.

As of Wednesday morning, Change Health Care said the company’s affected network was still offline. Tyler Mason, a company spokesperson, said that insurance claims submissions have returned to “pre-disruption levels” because health care providers are using “alternative clearing houses” to submit claims.

Mason said that doctors and patients can use these workarounds to address the problems described by Parikh and Disney.

“Since identifying the cyber incident, we have worked closely with customers and clients to ensure people have access to the medications and the care they need,” Mason said in an email. “As we remediate, the most impacted partners are those who have disconnected from our systems and/or have not chosen to execute workarounds.”

But confusion among some health care professionals about how to adapt to the situation remains.

Amy Cizik, a health care researcher in Utah, has been trying to get her pharmacy in Salt Lake City to process her insurance for days. Her 16-year-old daughter has a rare genetic syndrome and takes multiple medications to manage the conditions that come with the syndrome, Cizik told CNN.

“She needs the drug to function at school, to function well in our household,” Cizik said.

With medication running out, Cizik said she spent an hour on the phone Tuesday trying to resolve the situation. The pharmacy transferred her to the insurance provider, which transferred her to another firm that handles prescription drug benefits on behalf of insurers.

No one could resolve the issue, she said.

“As somebody who has a child with chronic illness with multiple prescriptions who works a fulltime job, me caring for her is a whole other job that I do,” she said. “And this is just adding to that.”

Cizik said the pharmacy was finally able to process her insurance on Wednesday morning, narrowly avoiding having to pay $1,000 over the counter for the medication.

Senior US cyber officials have been concerned about the cyberattack from the moment that news of the hack broke. Officials from the FBI and departments of Health and Human Service (HHS) and Homeland Security have held regular calls for days to try to get a handle on the problem, CNN previously reported.

Andrea Palm, the deputy HHS secretary, told CNN on Tuesday that the department continues to be in close touch with Change Healthcare as the company tries to restore its network.

Forensic evidence recovered in the investigation indicates that a prolific ransomware gang was responsible for the hack, according to private briefings Change Healthcare executives have given to other health care executives, two people familiar with the conversations told CNN.

The ransomware gang, which includes Russian-speaking cybercriminals, rents out their so-called malicious software, known as ALPHV or BlackCat. Hackers using the malware have claimed a slew of attacks on US universities, health care providers and hotels in the last 18 months. On Wednesday, the ransomware gang claimed responsibility for hacking Change Healthcare, listing the company as a victim on its dark-web site.

Reuters first reported on the connection between ALPHV ransomware and the Change Healthcare hack.

The Justice Department in December announced an operation targeting the ALPHV gang, including the seizure of some of its computer infrastructure. But well-oiled cybercriminal groups often bounce back from US law enforcement crackdowns.

As of Tuesday afternoon, the American Hospital Association (AHA), an industry group that represents thousands of hospitals and health care clinics across the US, was still receiving reports from members that the cyberattack was interfering with the processing of insurance claims, John Riggi, AHA’s national advisor for cybersecurity and risk, told CNN.

“This was a systemic attack,” Riggi said. “This was an attack not only on Change Healthcare. This was an attack on the entire health care sector.”

The COVID-19 pandemic was a breaking point for 43-year-old Tamalyn Paredes, an addiction counselor at a methadone clinic in Portland, Oregon. Living in California at the time, she worked at a group home for children with serious emotional disturbances – a job she described as taxing, especially when kids would lash out. 

Helping those with mental health conditions hit close to home for Paredes. She lived with depression and suicidal thoughts for years, but the hormonal side effects of ovary removal surgery in 2019 made things worse.  

“I felt like my life was falling apart,” she said. 

After moving to Oregon for a new job in October 2021, she decided to prioritize her mental health and see a doctor for treatment. She was diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed medications, which she said have been life-changing. 

Today, Paredes takes three medications to manage her mental health. Her sleep quality has improved. She has more control over her emotions. Focusing her attention at work has become easier, especially after being fired for performance issues in previous jobs. 

“I cannot go back to not being medicated,” she said. 

A USA TODAY analysis of Medicaid data for the 60 most used psychiatric drugs showed a growing number of people sought mental health treatment and medication during the pandemic as it pushed people into isolation and dismantled support systems.  

The analysis also revealed a lingering effect of the pandemic: Mental health-related prescriptions rose further in 2022, up 12% from 2019, outpacing the less than 1% growth in overall prescriptions. That includes prescriptions for generic Zoloft, the most common antidepressant medication, which rose 17% over the same period. 

More than half of these drugs saw an increase in prescriptions since 2019, and the steepest increase was among ADHD drugs: Concerta and generic Adderall.

Even before the pandemic, the use of mental health drugs was on the rise due to more affordable medication options and broadening acceptance of mental health treatment. That increase accelerated as the pandemic deepened the country’s mental health crisis following widespread loss and adversity.  

The upending of normal structures due to COVID-19, alongside the heightened awareness of mental health and the expansion of conditions being diagnosed, are likely contributing to the rise in mental health prescription drugs, Amy Werremeyer, president of the American Association of Psychiatric Pharmacists, told USA TODAY. 

According to the Census Bureau’s January 2024 survey, the percentage of people experiencing anxiety or depression remains double that of pre-pandemic levels. 

Across all ages, over a fifth of adults – and more than a third of those under 30 – reported feeling anxious or depressed. Among transgender and bisexual people, the problem is worse: 57% of transgender people and 44% of bisexuals said they experience anxiety or depression. 

“This is just coming to a point where for many people, it’s been unmanageable,” said Dr. Smita Das, chair of the American Psychiatric Association’s addiction council. 

One silver lining of the pandemic, Das said: “We all started to talk about mental health more and bring it to the forefront.” 

The growing toll that the mental health crisis is exacting on the country is borne out in other data, too. For example, lives lost to suicide and drug overdoses are at record levels. 

Policymakers and government officials have taken note and recommended actions to fortify mental health programs and reinforce social support systems, such as creating mobile crisis teams, establishing a national suicide prevention hotline and implementing paid family leave laws.  

U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, last year, issued an advisory underscoring the urgency to address “the public health crisis of loneliness, isolation, and lack of connection.” 

“There's increasing recognition that we shouldn't be thinking about mental health conditions any differently than we think about physical health conditions,” Werremeyer said.  

“But for some reason in the past,” she said, “we have blamed people for having to take depression medication or substance use disorder medication.” 

Financial barriers, such as limited insurance coverage for mental health treatment or high costs for uninsured patients, also make it difficult for some people to access medications, Werremeyer said.  

Mental health drug use has grown over the past two decades — partly due to the introduction of lower-cost generics, according to Arthur Wong, a managing director focused on healthcare at rating agency S&P Global Ratings. 

It has become a high-demand area, Wong said, with drugmakers developing new alternatives and researching novel approaches to treat depression and anxiety.  

Among the generics that became available this century, Zoloft’s generic version, sertraline, is the most widely used drug for mental health, according to USA TODAY’s analysis of federal drug use data. The lower-cost alternative was released 15 years after its brand name hit the market in 1991.  

As of early February, generic Zoloft is 300 times cheaper than the brand name, based on average prices pharmacies pay per pill. That means, a month’s supply of Zoloft can cost patients without insurance upwards of $400, while the average retail price for the generic alternative hovers around $20, according to GoodRx. 

In the last five years, prices of the 30 most prescribed generic psychiatric drugs dropped faster than the average decrease across all generic drugs, based on USA TODAY’s analysis of National Average Drug Acquisition Cost data that contains information about the amount retail community pharmacies pay for drugs.

While generic prices trend downward, brand-name prices have steadily risen, a phenomenon dubbed the “generic paradox.”  

It's not uncommon for brand manufacturers to raise prices after lower-cost generic equivalents become available, said Andrew Mulcahy, a senior health economist at RAND, a nonprofit research organization. 

Less than 10% of prescriptions are for brand-name medications, but drug companies still turn a profit by selling to a “small slice of patients,” Mulcahy said. 

While some patients prefer to take brand-name drugs because they believe generic alternatives are inferior or less effective, despite meeting the same Food and Drug Administration standards, others stay on costlier medications because no other drug works effectively for them.  

The pandemic spurred telehealth expansion, but also aggravated challenges such as burnout among behavioral health workers, high turnover rates and nationwide staffing shortages. 

This, in turn, jeopardizes the quality of care, especially for underserved communities. 

“The vicarious trauma can be high because we hear some horrific stories,” said Tamalyn Paredes, who counsels people with opioid use disorder. 

Paredes treats 140 patients, triple the number she’s supposed to, simply because there are more people in need than there are providers. 

Rural, remote areas are hit especially hard. On many tribal lands, for instance, mental health care “doesn’t exist at all,” said Lori Jump, CEO of StrongHearts Native Helpline, a nonprofit organization that works with Indigenous communities. 

Most non-profit centers that operate under government authority rely on grants to provide for patients who can’t afford to pay. Some received a temporary reprieve through the 2021 American Rescue Plan, which distributed over $3 billion for mental health and substance use grant programs across the country.  

Central Plains Center in Plainview, Texas, was one of 40 community behavioral health clinics to get a federal grant. It received over $1 million. Despite that, CEO Sherri Bohr said she worries about future funding and what will happen once the grant runs out this August.   

The facility, Bohr said, serves under 4,000 people a year, most of whom are low-income, uninsured or enrolled in Medicaid.  

Another concern weighing on her is the shortage of licensed therapists eager to work in rural clinics, Bohr said. “This isn’t the kind of job you get if you just want a paycheck,” she said.  

Case in point: A job opening for a therapist at Central Plains Center has remained unfilled for three years. 

“They don't keep their roots here,” said Jason Johnson, its associate CEO. “They tend to see our small town as a stepping stone.” 

The uptick in people seeking treatment and medication does not provide a full accounting of the impact of the pandemic on mental health because many are reluctant to seek help, particularly people of color, LGBTQ+ communities and people with disabilities. 

It takes time to overcome that hesitation, said Das, a Stanford University professor, adding that among some communities it gets labeled “a personal failing.” 

A 2022 national drug use survey showed that among adults with serious mental illness who didn’t receive treatment, a majority reported that they should have been able to handle their mental health on their own. 

Tanisha Malcom, who is Black and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 20 years ago, said her family didn’t believe in mental illness or therapy. To them, mental health conditions “were not even considered something real,” Malcom said. “No one believed that this was happening to me because ‘it doesn't happen to us.’”  

The New York City resident said the underlying message was, “You have to be strong, be tough. You don't have time to be depressed." 

Malcom, who lives alone, also felt anxious and unsupported during the pandemic, she said. Watching COVID-19 cases and deaths rise higher and higher worsened her mental health, so she kept the TV off altogether. As someone with comorbidities, Malcom said leaving the house was nerve-racking. She lost friendships and didn’t have a community.  

To remedy this, she co-founded the Black Minds Matter support group in May 2020 at the National Alliance on Mental Illness of New York City to support Black people like herself who live with mental health conditions. Today, the support group is thriving, Malcom said, adding that participants share wisdom about how to navigate every aspect of their daily lives being Black and managing mental health conditions.  

They feel “seen, empowered and cared for. It’s just like a big group hug,” she said. 

Tamalyn Paredes, who helps people with addictions on the opposite coast in Oregon, said she finds fulfillment in her demanding job by connecting patients with the resources they need. Her goal is to become a licensed clinical social worker, drawing from her experiences at the methadone clinic and children’s group home in California. 

“I found that from working with the kids, it gave me street cred,” Paredes said. “People always say, ‘It gets better, it gets better,’ but I’m proof that it does.”

Four more Top 10 players have joined the star-studded field at the 2024 Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart, Germany.

Over the past week, the tournament announced that Coco Gauff, Marketa Vondrousova, Ons Jabeur and Jelena Ostapenko are set to appear at the WTA 500 indoor clay-court event, which starts on April 15.

"First of all, [Gauff is] a player I love watching,” said Markus Günthardt, the Tournament Director of the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix. ‟And secondly, we’ll be hosting all four reigning Grand Slam champions.”

"Ons is one of the nicest players on the Tour[,] the fans love her,” said Anke Huber, the former World No.4 and the Operating Tournament Director of the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix. ‟Jelena has started the year off well and is always good for a surprise. The fact that Marketa, the Wimbledon champion will be back in Stuttgart is an accolade for our tournament.”

Reigning US Open champion Gauff will contest the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix for the third straight year. The World No.3 and 2022 Roland Garros finalist is planning to kick off her clay-court season in Stuttgart.

Three-time Grand Slam finalist Jabeur has gone deep in each of her two previous Stuttgart appearances. She reached the quarterfinals in her 2022 tournament debut, then went one better last year, making the semifinals before having to retire against World No.1 Iga Swiatek.

Reigning Wimbledon champion Vondrousova will be making her first Stuttgart appearance since 2022, when she lost to Jabeur in the first round. Vondrousova avenged that loss multiple times since then, including defeating Jabeur for last year's Wimbledon title.

Ostapenko will be in Stuttgart for the sixth time in her career; she lost to Jabeur in the second round last year. Ostapenko's best career result at the event was a quarterfinal run in 2018, the year after she won Roland Garros.

Gauff, Vondrousova and Ostapenko have increased the number of Grand Slam champions already entered into the field from four to seven. They join fellow major champions Iga Swiatek, Aryna Sabalenka, Angelique Kerber and Emma Raducanu as early entrants.

Swiatek is the two-time defending Stuttgart champion, while Kerber also won this title back-to-back on her home soil, in 2015 and 2016. Two-time Australian Open champion Sabalenka has come very close to winning the Stuttgart title as well, having finished runner-up in each of the last three years.

The Porsche Tennis Grand Prix was first played in Filderstadt in 1978, and it has been held at the Porsche Arena in Stuttgart since 2006. Since moving to Stuttgart, other former champions include Justine Henin, Maria Sharapova, Petra Kvitova, Svetlana Kuznetsova and Ashleigh Barty.

Emma Raducanu handed a wild card alongside Venus Williams, Caroline Wozniacki and Kei Nishikori for next month's Miami Open; watch over 80 tournaments a year, including the US Open, exclusively live on Sky Sports Tennis

Thursday 29 February 2024 15:52, UK

Emma Raducanu has been awarded a wild card for the Miami Open which takes place at the iconic Hard Rock Stadium from March 17-31, live on Sky Sports Tennis.

The former US Open champion, who is ranked No 252 in the world, was beaten in the first round by Anhelina Kalinina in her last match at the Qatar Open.

Raducanu has already used wild cards to enter tournaments in Abu Dhabi and Qatar in February and she is expected to play in the main draw at Indian Wells, starting on Wednesday, March 6.

The Brit has a protected ranking of 103, which is not high enough to secure a spot in the main draw at Indian Wells.

There are 96 singles players who get direct entry into the prestigious tournament along with 12 qualifiers and eight wild cards.

Two of those wild cards have been given to Caroline Wozniacki and Venus Williams, and it has been reported that Raducanu has flown to Los Angeles and is expected to play at the Masters 1000 event in the desert.

A three-time champion in Miami, Williams boasts a remarkable seven Grand Slam singles titles over her illustrious career and has played in a record-breaking 93 Grand Slam tournaments.

Australian Open Champion, Wozniacki, a finalist in Miami in 2017, returns for the first time since 2019, having had a three-year break following the birth of her two children. After returning to competition last August, she immediately impressed, reaching the fourth round at the 2023 US Open.

Also making a return from injury is Kei Nishikori, which will be his first competitive start since July 2023.

A player who is out of competition for more than six months but less than one year may use her special ranking for up to eight tournaments in a one-year period.
A player who is out of competition for one year or more may use her special ranking for up to 12 tournaments in a one-year period.
If a player is out of competition due to pregnancy or a medical condition, she is allowed three years to use her special ranking. In the event of pregnancy, the time period is calculated from the birth of the child.
Upon her return, a player is eligible to use her special ranking for seeding purposes at the first eight WTA tournaments she plays.
A player may freeze her ranking up to two times. Under the previous rule, a player was allowed to freeze her ranking just once.

Sky Sports has confirmed a new home for tennis in the UK and Ireland, with Sky Sports Tennis on Sky and NOW, making tennis content available all day, every day for fans.

Kanye West's wife, Bianca Censori, often finds herself in the spotlight for her bold fashion choices. The 29-year-old model, who works with his Yeezy brand, has a well-established reputation for pushing boundaries with her outfits, sometimes attracting controversy and scrutiny. At the recent Paris Fashion Week, the couple once again drew attention for their daring fashion statements. However, unlike in the United States, Censori's choices could potentially violate French decency laws.

On February 27, against the backdrop of Paris' cobbled streets, the young model made a striking appearance. Dressed in sheer leggings without underwear and a transparent blue cropped top, the young model made heads turn. Adding a touch of glamour, she draped herself in a fur coat and matching boots. While many expected her to don a designer piece or a statement outfit in the fashion capital, she chose to go her own way. Yet, the ensemble worn by Censori in France surpassed typical levels of exposure, potentially breaking the nation's laws on indecent exposure.

Article 222-32 of the French Penal Code, enacted in March 1994, specifies that…"Deliberate sexual display in the sight of others in a place accessible to the public gaze is punishable by one year in prison and a fine of one hundred thousand francs." Furthermore, the law also says, “The charge has been worded in such a way as to rule out any possibility of proceedings against persons practicing naturism in places specially designated for this purpose."

The couple was fined £10,000 in 2023 for strolling "almost naked" in public in Italy prior to this incident. They were given the choice by the Italian Constitutional Court to pay the fine or go to jail for breaking the law.

Sources close to Kanye West's fashion projects have disclosed that West has a dedicated design team based in Italy who create clothing for him and, in this specific instance, Censori. Furthermore, West has partnered with Mowalola Ogunlesi, a London-based designer of Nigerian descent, to design the Yeezy Gap collection. As per Page Six, Ogunlesi said, "She (Bianca) has a lot to say in what she wants to wear. Everything Bianca is wearing is really from her and Ye's brains. They want to show people that you can do this yourself. It's stuff that's attainable - tights. With tights, you can cut them and sew it - if it doesn't work out you can put on another pair."

Triptii Dimri's intimate scene with Ranbir Kapoor in Animal might have earned her a new fan base, but it did leave her parents 'completely rattled'. In an interview with Vogue India, Triptii got candid about the sequence with Ranbir, and having ‘to have a long discussion on why that scene was crucial’ with her parents after they watched Animal. She also defended her decision to do Animal. Also read | CBFC deletes close-up shots of an intimate scene in Ranbir Kapoor's Animal: A list of all censor cuts

Triptii Dimri said, "I know my reasons for doing the film. Sandeep sir [director Sandeep Reddy Vanga] was clear that it was going to be a small role, but I found the character interesting. If we start making decisions based on what audiences are going to say, then as actors, we won’t ever be able to do what we want to do. I want to choose roles that push me out of my comfort zone. There’s a lot of advice on offer and I listen to it all, but it comes down to instinct. I might make mistakes along the way, but I’m allowed to.”

On her intimate scene with Ranbir Kapoor in Animal, Triptii said, “My parents were completely rattled when they saw it. We had to have a long discussion on why that scene was crucial."

A few days before Animal's release on December 1, the Central Board of Film Certification had suggested eight cuts to Sandeep Vanga Reddy's Ranbir Kapoor-starrer, including an 'intimate scene' between two characters. Close up shots of the characters – Ranbir's Rannvijay Singh aka Vijay and Triptii Dimri's Zoya – were deleted in an intimate sequence.

In December 2023, during an interview with India Today, Triptii had said Ranbir and others on set kept asking her if she was okay during the shooting of the intimate scene.

She had said, "They ensured that there were no more than five people, including the director, the DOP, and the actors during the scene. Nobody else was allowed on set, all the monitors were shut, and they were like, ‘this is the scene we are doing. If at any point you feel you're uncomfortable, let us know. We'll go at your pace... Every five minutes, Ranbir Kapoor was checking up on me and asking, ‘Are you okay, are you comfortable?’ I think these things really matter. People are sensitive to these things.”

Anil Kapoor plays Ranbir's father in the film, while Rashmika Mandanna is paired opposite him. Bobby Deol plays the antagonist in the film that was released in five languages – Hindi, Tamil, Malayalam, Telugu and Kannada – and performed very well at the box office.

Get ready, Superman fans! James Gunn, the head honcho at DC Studios, has just dropped some awesome news on Superman's birthday. The iconic superhero is getting a makeover, with a brand-new movie and a fancy new costume. This marks a fresh start for Superman's adventures on the big screen. The makers have further assured that the highly anticipated superhero franchise is officially underway, so keep an eye out for its release in 2025!

First things first: Superman: Legacy is now just SUPERMAN. In either case, it's a suitable title for the mega cinematic comeback of the Man of Steel. With a massive budget at stake and James Gunn at the helm, fans are confident that the forthcoming Superman film will be a visual spectacle. "When I finished the first draft of the script, I called the film Superman: Legacy." He continued, By the time I locked the final draft, it was clear the title was SUPERMAN," Gunn revealed in his Instagram post.

A Superman shocker no one saw coming! Taking to his Instagram Gunn said, "Overjoyed to be announcing the start of principal photography on SUPERMAN today, February 29, which just so happens to be - coincidentally and unplanned - Superman's birthday.” The glimpse of the costume shared on Instagram reveal has fans buzzing about the logo. The new design is strikingly similar to Superman from DC Comics from the iconic Kingdom Come storyline by Mark Waid and Alex Ross, which is set in a future parallel reality.

Don't worry, fans! The story still feels new and exciting. Even though the two versions of Superman from Kingdom Come and the DC Universe (DCU) look similar, they're different. Kingdom Come's Superman is older and more experienced, while the DCU's Clark Kent is younger and just starting out as a superhero.

Imtiaz Ali’s Diljit Dosanjh and Parineeti Chopra-starrer Amar Singh Chamkila will premiere on Netflix on April 12. The film is based on the life of the titular singer, who was assassinated at age 27. Talking about the biopic at a press meet, Diljit stated that he was initially apprehensive about how the film would be made.

A post shared by Netflix India (@netflix_in)

India Today quoted Diljith as saying, “I thought I knew a lot about Chamkila before I met Imtiaz sir. Humein jab pata chala ki Bollywood mein film bann rahi hai Chamkila, toh humein laga ki ye kya banayenge? Hum banayenge, humne Jodi film banayi hai, jiske humein rights nahi mile toh humne fiction bana di. (When I learnt Bollywood is making a film on Chamkila, I wondered what they would make. I made it, I made a film called Jodi, I didn’t get the rights for it, so I turned it fictional.) I thought they wouldn’t be able to make it. When the pandemic hit and Jodi wasn’t released, I got a call from Imtiaz sir. I thought I was getting sued but he wanted to cast me in his film instead.”

Diljith admits that he changed his mind once he heard Imtiaz’s idea for the film. “His perspective was different. It was Chamkila’s story, even I didn’t know that well. Amar Singh Chamkila wrote his own music, played it himself, and performed it on stage. So, the fact that such a big film was going to be made on him was a matter of pride for me and my people. I just surrendered to Imtiaz sir’s vision,” he said.

A post shared by DILJIT DOSANJH (@diljitdosanjh)

Parineeti plays Chamkila’s wife Amarjot in the film. She was also a proficient singer and often collaborated with her husband. Chamkila and Amarjot were both killed in an assassination in the 1980s that remains unsolved. AR Rahman has composed the film's music.

Originally appeared on E! Online

Stephen Baldwin is leaning on his faith.

The "Usual Suspects" actor raised eyebrows when he took to Instagram to reshare a post asking for prayers for daughter Hailey Bieber and son-in-law Justin Bieber.

"Christians, please when you think of Justin & Hailey, take a moment to offer a little prayer for them," a Feb. 26 Instagram Reel from Victor Marx read, "to have wisdom, protection and to draw close to the Lord." The All Things Possible Ministry founder also noted, "There are special challenges that folks in high visibility positions face."

In the since-expired Instagram Story, shared by Page Six, Baldwin reposted the Reel, which features Justin playing the guitar and singing "I Could Sing of Your Love Forever."

Baldwin did not give a reason as to why he was asking for prayers, and E! News has reached out to reps for Baldwin, Hailey Bieber and Justin Bieber for comment.



Justin Bieber, 29, has maintained a lower profile since 2022, when he canceled his Justice World Tour following his diagnosis with Ramsay Hunt Syndrome, which he explained "is from this virus that attacks the nerve in my ear and my facial nerves and has caused my face to have paralysis."

"As the result of this illness, I was not able to complete the North America leg of the Justice Tour," he posted to Instagram Stories at the time. "I realized that I need to make my health the priority right now. So I'm going to take a break from touring for the time being. I'm going to be ok, but I need time to rest and get better."

Bieber added, "Thank you for your prayers and support throughout all of this! I love you all passionately!"

The "What Do You Mean" singer gave an update on his diagnosis in March 2023, sharing a video of himself, zooming in until he flashed a full grin with the caption, "Wait for it…"

He eventually made his return to the stage at the NHL All-Star Player draft in Toronto on Feb. 1, singing a medley of his hits.

And while fans were hoping he'd surprise audiences at the Super Bowl alongside friend and mentor Usher on Feb. 11, the "U Got it Bad" singer explained why Bieber opted not to participate.

"I think that it might've been the fact that he's just wanting to tell a different story right now," Usher said on The Breakfast Club Feb. 16, "and I understand that."

The "Yeah!" singer added, "We're gonna do something else in the future. No love lost or anything like that."

Multiple conspiracy theories have been floating around regarding the Princess of Wales' health in recent days. 

Middleton underwent abdominal surgery last month, but speculations on the 42-year-old's health did not arise until Prince William "unexpectedly withdrew" himself from his godfather's memorial service on Tuesday (February 27). According to People, a spokesperson for Kensington Palace caught word of the various health conspiracies circulating the internet and decided to put the rumors to bed. 

"We were very clear from the outset that the Princess of Wales was out until after Easter and Kensington Palace would only be providing updates when something was significant."

The Princesses' spokesperson assured that Middleton is "doing well" and that the recovery process is going smoothly. As previously stated, Kensington Palace released multiple statements regarding the royal mother-of-three's post-surgery recovery that revealed inside information on the timeline. The statement in question directly noted that Middleton would not "return to public duties until after Easter."

The Princess of Wales remained in the hospital for 13 days postoperative and was safely escorted back to Kensington Palace to heal. Per People, a "a source close to the royal household" urged all citizens to model Middleton's behavior in taking proper time to recover after an ailment. 

Thanks to the latest information from Kensington Palace, the public can now be sure that Middleton is in fact healing properly, and is predicted to make a highly-anticipated return to the public eye towards the end of March.

While this story itself isn't a thing of the new, the X (formerly Twitter) trend #HYBEDivestFromZionism may likely have caught your eye lately during daily internet scrolling sessions. Fans of several groups under the HYBE label banner (BTS, SEVENTEEN, TOMORROW X TOGETHER, LE SSERAFIM, NewJeans, ENHYPEN and others) have called a boycott campaign to action, urging the Korean entertainment company to dismiss its American unit's CEO, Scooter Braun. While the campaign rages on and continues to spread awareness like wildfire, BTS fans, aka ARMYs, have especially taken the pioneering stand against Braun's alleged support of Israel as the ravaging conflict continues to tear down Palestine's Gaza Strip.

At a rally held in Tel Aviv in December 2023, Braun had urged for the Israeli captives to be returned, who'd been taken hostage during the October 7 attacks when Hamas gunmen stormed into Israel. “I had to come and stand with my people,” said the American producer. In later reports, the Korean label had remarked, “It's a personal statement that is separate from company management” (The Korea Times). However, the music giant that merged with Braun's Ithaca Holdings in 2021 has yet to comment on the ongoing fan protests.

Many HYBE group fans have long been silently boycotting the label's merchandise, demonstrating their rejection of the company's association with Braun. However, the latest development around this arena has taken a bigger step to publicising their moral fight against HYBE America CEO's position. Some fans sent a truck to the company's Seoul headquarters on February 23, again pushing for Braun to be removed from operations.

This campaign hasn't been constrained to the HYBE backyard. Fans have advocated for the removal of ‘Zionists in the industry’ by targeting all ‘big four’ of the K-pop industry - HYBE Entertainment, YG Entertainment, JYP Entertainment and SM Entertainment. Alongside #HYBEDivestFromZionism, #하이브시오니스트를제거하다 and #StrikeAgainstThe4 have also partaken in the race for advocacy. Meanwhile, a ‘Help Divest Scooter Braun from HYBE’ Change.org petition has also been initiated.

To name a few, American record producer Benny Blanco, Israeli songwriter Omer Fedi and others also joined the ranks of similarly invoked criticism.

One of the trucks sent earlier displayed a harrowing view of Palestine in ruins, with the message, “They could've been your friend”. Another slide adds to the message campaign message, seeking out the industry's underlying humanity:

"Korean and international ARMY demand HYBE divests from Zionism and Zionists in the industry.

If our demands are not met ARMY will continue to push for you to meet our demands. Do not look away when the same thing that happened to your Korean ancestors is happening to Palestinians!

We ask that you stand for humanity, for the right side of history, and against violence."

New details surrounding Heath Ledger's death have emerged as Hollywood director Stephen Gaghan revealed the phone call he received after the fact.

Ledger's body was discovered by a housekeeper on Jan. 22, 2008. The "10 Things I Hate About You" star's death was ruled accidental and attributed to a mixture of prescription drugs – OxyContin, Vicodin, Valium, Xanax, Unisom and Restoril.

At the time of Ledger's death, Gaghan had been working with the 28-year-old on an adaption of Malcolm Gladwell's "Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking."

Gaghan recalled the phone call he received from Ledger’s father after he arrived at the scene.

"They were there with the body and our script was in bed with him, and your book was on the bedside table," he said on Gladwell's "Revisionist History" podcast series "Development Hell." "I think my number was on the script, like written. These guys, as you can imagine, they are in shock and they dialed that number and I don’t know why."

"I’m in an airport with my wife [Minnie Mortimer] just going from one place to another, and I literally just collapse, never happened to me before or since," the director added. "My feet went out from under me. I just literally sat down because I was like, 'What?' The emotion, what they were going through, I should not have been a party to in any way really, and yet as a human or as somebody who just cares, I just was there and I was listening and my wife was looking at me. I remember her face and I was just like, I was speechless. I just listened and listened and listened. It was just really, really sad. And it’s still sad. For me, I just had to put a pin in it."

Gladwell's podcast series revisits projects that were never made – including the "Blink" adaptation. With Leonardo DiCaprio attached to the project, the film originally landed with a studio in 2005. However, it never got off the ground.

"We pick a studio, we huddle with our agents, we pick a winner, checks are cashed," Gladwell said. "Some brilliant producer is assigned to our case, and off we go. Only it never happens. A year passes, then two years, then three years. And this is why we’re doing ‘Development Hell,’ an entire series devoted to scripts that never happen. This is always the most devastating part of the story, the plot twists that happen off the page."

Eventually, "Blink" landed with Universal Studios and Gaghan spent some more time developing the script. After re-working DiCaprio's character, the director realized he had written the part for Ledger.

"I’d gotten to be very, very close with him instantly," Gaghan recalled. "I just had a real connection with him that was kind of unusual and really special to me. I got really excited and I started seeing him as the main character. Once I started seeing that I couldn’t unsee it, and obviously it was very delicate in a way. Leo’s totally cool. I mean, obviously, he has a thousand choices, but in my mind it was a big deal."

Gaghan abandoned the revived project after Ledger's death.

BUFFALO, N.Y. — Two weeks after a mother and daughter were killed while walking out of a Drake concert in St. Louis, the Canadian rapper mentioned them in a stadium filled with 18,000 fans as a reminder of how fragile life is.

Drake mentioned the Feb. 14 incident during his concert in Buffalo, New York, during a monologue in the middle of his show on Tuesday night. He specifically mentioned watching a viral video showing the moment the car hit 42-year-old Laticha Bracero and 21-year-old Alyssa Cordova, a video that the now-released suspected driver's defense attorney said may cause issues in the prosecution of the case.

"I saw a video today ... we had a show in St. Louis where a mother and her young daughter lost their life leaving the show," Drake said at the Buffalo concert. "I wanted to say to you, as happy as these [concerts] are, I wanted to say to you that you never know what somebody else's reality will be when they walk out of this building."

Drake immediately followed up the mention with a call to action for all of his fans.

"For this moment that all of us are together, all 18,000 people, what I want to do ... I want you to turn to somebody that you do not know, I want you to look them in the eyes, and I want you to prove that you are grateful for your life," he said. "I want you to take five seconds out of your day to make somebody else's day. Just show them some love, because you never know what comes next."

Eagles co-founder Don Henley testified this week that handwritten lyric drafts for their 1976 "Hotel California" album that ended up at auction were always his sole property. 

"I always knew those lyrics were my property. I never gifted them or gave them to anybody to keep or sell," Henley said in a New York City courtroom on Wednesday. 

Three rare book experts, Glenn Horowitz, Craig Inciardi and Edward Kosinski, are on trial, charged with scheming to sell around 100 pages of "developmental lyrics to the Eagles song 'Hotel California,'" according to the original indictment filed by the New York District Attorney's office in 2022.

The manuscripts are collectively valued at over $1 million, according to the district attorney.

Prosecutors allege the three men circulated fake stories about the manuscripts’ ownership in order to sell them.

Defense lawyers argue that the men obtained the drafts legally from a writer who worked on an Eagles biography with Henley decades ago that was never published after Henley gave them to him. Kosinski, Inciardi and Horowitz have pleaded not guilty.

The case centers on how the legal pad pages made their way from Henley’s Southern California barn to the biographer's home in New York's Hudson Valley, and then to the defendants in New York City.

Henley has testified that he allowed the unpublished biography writer Ed Sanders to look at the drafts, but he was required to give them back. 

Sanders, who isn’t charged in the case, sold the drafts to Horowitz, who then sold them to Inciardi and Kosinski. The two men then put them up for auction in 2012.

Justin Timberlake will be out with a new album which will release on March 15.

Did Justin Timberlake just confirm that NSYNC will reunite for singer’s upcoming song? Justin Timberlake will soon be out with a new song titled “Paradise”. The song will be a part of a larger album rollout that is set to release on March 15.

While making the announcement of the new album, Justin seemed to hint that his former band NSYNC might come together and feature in one of the songs. Almost confirming what their fans have been wishing upon for a long time, Justin Timberlake took to TikTok to reply to a fan’s comment on his recent announcement. 

A fan wrote, “Blink twice if *NSYNC is on a song called ‘Paradise’.” Justin Timberlake responded to that comment with a candid video that showed him moving his sunglasses to reveal his eyes, intentionally blinking twice before flashing a sly smile.

Raising eyebrows, NSYNC members too played along. NSYNC member Chris Kirkpatrick responded with eye emoji comments and Lance Bass responded with his own video. Members JC Chasez and Joey Fatone have yet to comment on the same. 

The comment came on Justin Timberlake’s announcement for deluxe vinyl edition of “Everything I Thought It Was”. 

This news comes just months after NSYNC joined forces on a new song for the first time in more than two decades as part of the soundtrack of the film Trolls Band Together. 

In addition, Justin Timberlake also teased new music from NSYNC during an appearance on The Kelly Clarkson Show earlier this January. He told Kelly that the band had been in the studio, “so there may be a little something in the future, too.”

Drishyam is the story of a common man named Vijay Salgaonkars in Goa, who is living a happy life with his wife and two daughters. However, his life goes upside down when his daughter accidentally kills a teenage boy Sam. To save his family, Vijay goes to every extent possible. Both the first and second parts of the movie garnered rave reviews from the audience and critics alike. 

Ajay Devgn's Drishyam is one of those movies to be watched several times. The Hindi version of the edge-of-the-seat thriller is based on the Malayalam thriller of the same name starring South Indian star Mohanlal. 

The part 1 and 2 of the film have been termed as one of the best mystery thrillers ever made in Indian cinema. After roaring success at the Indian box office, the movie is now set for a Hollywood remake. 

The deal has been done between the Panorama Studio, who have joined hands with Gulfstream Pictures and JOAT Films to acquire rights of ‘Drishyam’ 1 & 2 in Hollywood.

After Korea and Hollywood, our mission is to produce Drishyam in 10 countries in the next three to five years”.

Mike Karz and Bill Bindley of Gulfstream Pictures said in a joint statement, “We are very happy to collaborate with Panorama Studios and JOAT Films on an English language adaptation of ‘Drishyam.’ The film is a timeless thriller that has entranced audiences across the globe. We can't wait to bring the movie to fans here in the U.S."
