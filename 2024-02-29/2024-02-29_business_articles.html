Chef Robbie Felice joins Fox News' Stuart Varney with the latest on how he is expanding his businesses as profits thrive despite record high inflation on 'Varney & Co.'

Atlanta-based Chick-fil-A announced the recall of its popular Polynesian sauce dipping cups because of concerns they were contaminated with wheat and soy allergens.

"Please discard any Polynesian Sauce dipping cups that you may have taken home between February 14-27, 2024," the fast-food chain said on its website. "The Polynesian Sauce dipping cups may contain a different sauce that includes wheat and soy allergens."

A spokesperson for Chick-fil-A told Fox News Digital the manufacturer of the Polynesian dipping sauce packed some of the cups with Sriracha sauce, which contains wheat and soy.

While the exact number of cups was not known, Chick-fil-A costumers were alerted about the recall on the company’s website and application, as well as through signage at the restaurants.

Restaurants in 27 states have removed the potentially contaminated cups from restaurants, though other states will continue to serve the sauce.

The spokesperson also said the recall was only for Polynesian sauce dipping cups, and has nothing to do with bottled sauce sold in grocery stores.

One letter calls activist investor Peltz one of the “wolves in sheep’s clothing" and also one of the “villains” in a Disney story. 


							By 

	Caitlin Huston


Business Writer


	The grandchildren of Walt Disney and Roy O. Disney are voicing their support for Bob Iger in his board seat battle against Nelson Peltz.


	Two separate letters were sent to shareholders Thursday from each set of grandchildren, including Abigail Disney, who has been outspoken against recent Disney practices. 




	In the letter from grandchildren of Roy O. Disney, which is signed by Abigail and three others, the grandchildren outline the “magic” they experienced at the company throughout their childhoods, and say that Iger can continue that spirit at the company. Meanwhile, they call Peltz one of the “wolves in sheep’s clothing” and also one of the “villains” in a Disney story.

	“Bob Iger, his management team, and the Board of Directors are faithful to this magic. They understand that the longevity of The Walt Disney Company isn’t only the result of smart business decisions; it is rooted in the strong emotional connection Disney continues to forge with generations of people from around the globe,” the letter reads.




	The statement adds, “We may not agree about everything, but we know that our grandfather would be especially proud of what Disney means to the world today. We also know that, like us, he would be very concerned by the threat posed by self-anointed ‘activist investors’ who are really wolves in sheep’s clothing, just waiting to tear Disney apart if they can trick shareholders into opening the door for them.”


	The Roy O. Disney grandchildren go on to mention the hostile takeover attempt of Disney by Saul Steinberg — who they say was friends with Peltz — and “was defeated, much as these activists must be defeated today.”


	The grandchildren of Walt were more succinct, but also threw their support behind Iger, saying he can help continue the “brand of integrity and storytelling” created by their grandfather. 


	“Bob Iger has grown this company in a modern world, and he continues to maintain a balance of creativity and profit. It is still a company based on the desire to entertain and explore. There have been challenging times, but this current management has adjusted and grown through those challenges,” the letter reads. 


	Peltz, an activist investor, is staging a proxy fight against Disney due to what he says is Disney’s lagging stock performance, as well as a lack of ownership of Disney shares from the company’s board. Blackwells Capital has also nominated its own board slate of Craig Hatkoff, Jessica Schell and Leah Solivan. All parties have been campaigning, including Disney, which launched an animated video featuring Prof. Ludwig Von Drake, in the lead up to the April 3 shareholder meeting. Voting for most shareholders must be submitted before 11:59 p.m. on April 2.

	











	In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Peltz’s Trian Partners pushed back on the claims in the letter. 


	“We love Disney and recognize building on its rich history of delighting loyal fans is essential to its future success. Trian invests in great companies like Disney and helps them grow and thrive for the long term – and we have the track record to prove it at companies like P&G, Heinz and Mondelez,” the statement reads.

Shares of Dell Technologies popped more than 15% during extended trading Thursday after the company released fourth-quarter results that beat analysts' estimates and showed strong demand for its artificial intelligence servers.

Here's how the company did:

Dell's revenue for the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter fell 11% from $25.04 billion in the year-ago quarter. The company reported net income $1.16 billion, up 89% from the $614 million it posted in the same period last year.

Chief Financial Officer Yvonne McGill said in a release that the company is increasing its annual dividend by 20% to $1.78 per share, which she called a "testament to our confidence in the business."

Dell's Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) reported $9.3 billion in revenue for the quarter, down 6% year over year but up 10% from the third quarter. Servers and networking revenue made up the bulk of that, with $4.9 billion in revenue driven by "AI-optimized servers." Storage revenue came in at $4.5 billion.

The company's Client Solutions Group (CSG) reported $11.7 billion for the quarter, down 12% year over year. That includes $9.6 billion in commercial client revenue, which fell 11% since the fourth quarter of last year, and $2.2 billion in consumer revenue, down 19% year over year.

"Our strong AI-optimized server momentum continues, with orders increasing nearly 40% sequentially and backlog nearly doubling, exiting our fiscal year at $2.9 billion," Chief Operating Officer Jeff Clarke said in the release.

For its first quarter, Dell said during its quarterly call with investors that it expects to report revenue between $21 billion and $22 billion.

The company said it is encouraged by momentum around AI, and that it expects to return to growth for fiscal 2025. However, the company noted that the macroeconomic environment is causing some customers to be cautious about infrastructure costs.Don't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:

ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Minnesota’s budget outlook has improved thanks to higher corporate profits, officials said Thursday as they projected a slightly bigger surplus that will give the Legislature a little bit more breathing room this session.Minnesota Management and Budget said the current two-year budget period, which runs through June 2025, is now expected to end with a surplus of just over $3.7 billion. That’s up more than $1.3 billion from the last forecast, which was released in December. That compares with an overall budget of $72 billion, which was set last year.“Our forecast is good news. Our economy is humming along,” Democratic Gov. Tim Walz said at a briefing for reporters. “We made critical investments in our budget last year to grow our economy, lower costs for middle class families, from tax cuts to free school meals, to investments in our workforce and career and technical education.”The budget office is also forecasting a smaller “structural imbalance” for the next two-year budget, which begins in July 2025. If lawmakers spend the entire $3.7 billion surplus, the next budget would start out with a $1.5 billion deficit instead of dipping $2.3 billion into the red as previously forecast. Republican leaders said they still consider that a deficit. But if the entire surplus is left in the bank, the next budget would start out $2.2 billion in the black.“In order to protect the investments that were made in programs that serve Minnesotans, it will be important that policymakers exercise caution in enacting additional ongoing spending this legislative session,” Budget Commissioner Erin Campbell told reporters.Minnesota Democratic Gov.

(AP Photo/Trisha Ahmed)Photo: ASSOCIATED PRESS/Trisha AhmedThe governor said he plans to issue his supplemental budget proposal in a couple weeks. He said it won’t include tax increases. Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman, of Brooklyn Park, said she had already received “a few texts from people asking for things.” But she and other leaders made clear that they don’t plan on much extra spending. “Today’s improved budget forecast shows that Democratic leadership continues to have Minnesota on the right path,” Hortman said at the press conference. She went on to say, “I do not foresee making any commitments to spending that we can’t pay for.”But there’s one place for growth. The improved forecast means that the state can borrow more money for a public infrastructure package known as a bonding bill. State debt guidelines now allow the state to borrow $980 million for the bill, up from $830 million in the previous forecast, because interest rates are slightly lower, Campbell said.Walz said that means there will probably be enough money to add more local projects to the bill, as some lawmakers have urged, but that he’ll leave those decisions to the Legislature. The governor proposed a combination of $982 million in borrowing and cash in January. The final package is still expected to have an unglamorous focus on maintaining the state’s existing infrastructure, like roads, bridges and water treatment facilities. It will require at least some Republican votes to reach the 60% majorities in both chambers that are needed when the state takes on more debt. The budget office said the main reason for the improved outlook is higher tax collections due to higher-than-expected corporate profits, while spending projections have barely changed. The state’s labor shortage isn’t quite as tight as it was. Unemployment remains low but is expected to rise slightly.Republican leaders said the state would be in much better shape if the Democratic majority had not spent the entire $17 billion surplus that the state had going into the 2023 legislative session.“It’s time to cut spending and budget responsibly instead of trying to maintain the reckless spending from last session,” said House Minority Leader Lisa Demuth, a Republican of Cold Spring, at the press conference. “Family budgets and small businesses need meaningful tax relief now. And that’s what Republicans are asking for.”

In Risky Space Business, Intuitive Machines Sets Sights on Second Moon Landing

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Intuitive Machines and its space-cargo customers expect the company to emerge stronger from its problem-plagued moon landing this week, with improvements set for the company's second lander after its first went where no private firm has gone before.

The company's Odysseus moon lander on Thursday ended its week-long mission near the lunar south pole after a mix of successes and failures that illustrated the type of risks the company and NASA, the mission's biggest backer, have come to embrace.

NASA is counting on a series of low-budget, private excursions to the moon to serve as pathfinders for missions carrying astronauts this decade. The plan allows financial room for failure and offers companies big incentives to succeed on a shoestring.

"It's a new way of going to the moon, eventually to Mars, and it's a new moon that we go to," NASA chief Bill Nelson said in an interview, calling Intuitive Machines' mission a successful example. "We don't go to a permanently lit, smoother area on the equator like Apollo, we go to a very hazardous, dark area with a bunch of pits."

Intuitive's shares - which had nearly tripled, then plummeted in wild swings over the course of the Odysseus mission - closed on Thursday up about 20% from before the launch, giving the company a market value of about $600 million.

In its final descent, Odysseus stumbled to an off-kilter landing that left it leaning sharply to one side after a series of technical problems, including the need for a last-minute workaround for a laser instrument designed to tell the spacecraft where the surface was.

The rough touchdown impeded the vehicle's functions once it arrived. NASA and the lander's commercial participants could communicate with their instruments but failed to get all the data they wanted.

Studies on galactic observations, for instance, "will not be conducted, nor will an image of the galaxy be obtained,” said Steve Durst, who led a team at the Hawaii-based International Lunar Observatory Association that put a dual-camera system on board Odysseus to capture images of the Milky Way Galaxy from the lunar surface.

Still, Durst said: "We're delighted that our country has finally touched the moon again - even though a little bit stumbling - but we're back. And that's significant."

And although other experiments were disappointing - a camera developed by students at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University never deployed in space as intended - some worked fine.

Lonestar Data Holdings, a Houston-based startup developing space-based data centers, had a small server aboard the lander to test data transmission between Earth and the moon.

"We got everything we needed out of the mission, and we're incredibly happy," Lonestar chief executive Chris Stott said. Lonestar has already booked space on the next Intuitive Machines flight this year.

That mission, called IM-2, is sold out, and a third is planned. Intuitive chief executive Steve Altemus said Wednesday that since the landing, the European Space Agency had expressed interest in flying on one of his company's missions.

Altemus said that non-lethal mistakes had illustrated an array of improvements to make on IM-2. The most egregious mistake on the mission was forgetting to turn off a safety switch that prevented the landing laser from working; Altemus said the IM-1 team had gotten better at anticipating potential problems and workarounds.

"As we went through the mission, we got further and further ahead thinking about the possible failures, and what could get us, and what we had to fix in that certain time frame," he said.

As for the equipment, "When I think of major redesigns, I'm thinking about adding cameras, and adding antennas, things like that," he added.

Part of the mission's success was that, by past standards of space budgets, it was a bargain.

NASA put $118 million into the Intuitive Machines mission, and the company spent roughly $100 million itself.

"This was not an Apollo-era, multibillion-dollar program where a failure's not an option. These are the low-cost bets, an order of magnitude cheaper," said Chad Anderson, head of venture capital firm Space Capital. "So you get to try again."

Microsoft (MSFT) continues to roll out more generative AI capabilities across its software offerings with the debut of its Copilot for Finance. The company says the AI service, which is launching as a public preview, will make it easier for workers to sort data and find errors in financial reports.

Microsoft has been adding its generative AI-powered Copilots to a slew of its business offerings ranging from Copilot for Microsoft 365 and Copilot for Sales to Copilot for Service. That’s in addition to the company’s Copilot in Windows 11, which is built into all Windows 11 PCs running the latest software updates.

Microsoft’s Copilot for Finance, the company says, can provide real-time insights into corporate finance data, cutting down on the rigamarole of having to enter and search through seemingly endless rows and columns in Excel.

The tech giant says its latest Copilot can also streamline audits, detect data variances, and help users generate PowerPoint presentations and emails based on available financial information using natural language prompts.

The Windows maker isn’t revealing pricing for Copilot for Finance, but the service includes the company’s Copilot for Microsoft 365, which adds generative AI capabilities to the Microsoft 365 productivity suite. That platform traditionally costs $30 per user per month.

Microsoft is putting an enormous amount of effort into ensuring it has a Copilot for each of its productivity platforms as it races to out-innovate rivals, including Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Salesforce (CRM). Both of those companies, as well as a slew of other smaller firms, are also building generative AI services for their enterprise products to prove to customers that they’re on the bleeding edge of today’s hottest tech trend.

Last week, Google debuted its Gemini Business, a $20-per-month add-on for its Gemini for Workspace productivity suite. The company also offers Gemini Enterprise, a $30-per-month add-on for Gemini for Workspace with enhanced features for meeting summaries and transcriptions.

The push to bring generative AI tools to more enterprise-friendly services comes as Microsoft and its rivals seek to further monetize their enormous investments in generative AI technologies in recent years.

Microsoft has already invested billions of dollars in ChatGPT developer OpenAI and is lined up to invest billions more throughout the next decade. On Tuesday, the company also disclosed it is working with OpenAI rival Mistral and will begin offering that firm’s AI models via its Azure cloud platform.

In its most recent earnings report, Microsoft revealed that AI services contributed 6 percentage points of growth to Azure revenue, up from 3% in the prior quarter. Shares of the tech juggernaut are up 63% over the last 12 months.
