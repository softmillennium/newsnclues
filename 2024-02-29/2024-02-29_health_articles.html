CHICAGO (CBS) -- A hack at the company Change Healthcare has crippled pharmacies across the country – in just the latest in a troubling trend in which cyberattacks have affected people's health across the country.

A Naperville man has been left pleading for help from his hospital bed. He said when he went to the pharmacy, he was told he would need to pay out of pocket for medicine on which he depends.

"They said, 'There's nothing we can do for you,'" said Alan Townsend.

Townsend said he ended up in the hospital after trying to pick up his medications for congestive heart failure and diabetes – only to be told Medicaid would not cover the cost.

"This is medicine that if I don't take it, I'll die," Townsend said.

The cyberattack targeted Change Healthcare – which processes transactions for about one in three U.S. patients' records. Hospitals and pharmacies can't get paid – and some patients are unable to get their medication.

In some cases, it has even led to delays in hospital discharges.

"Right now, I'm trapped in the hospital," said Townsend. "I just can't imagine what people are going through that are worse than me."

Patrick Berryman is with the National Community Pharmacists Association – made up of independently-owned pharmacies.

"In some cases, they might have been asked to pay cash. In other cases, they may have been given a couple of days' supply," Berryman said. "Change Healthcare was one of the two biggest switches in the country that independent pharmacies had to deal with."

A Russian-speaking ransomware group known as Blackcat has claimed responsibility for stealing more than six terabytes of sensitive medical records.

Toby Gouker is with First Health Advisory – a cybersecurity firm with clients in the health industry.

"It's an attack on the healthcare supply chain," Gouker said. "Some of the larger systems are losing $100 million or so a day of revenue."

"It's super frustrating to know my life is getting worse because of the system," added Townsend. "It needs to be fixed, and needs to be fixed fast."

Since the attack, many pharmacies have developed workarounds to get prescriptions processed. Deerfield-based Walgreens say they are continuing to fill prescriptions with minimal delay or interruption.

By  Amrita Khalid, one of the authors of audio industry newsletter Hot Pod. Khalid has covered tech, surveillance policy, consumer gadgets, and online communities for more than a decade. 

Health insurance provider UnitedHealth has identified Blackcat as the group behind a debilitating cyber attack that has disrupted healthcare providers nationwide, Reuters is reporting. The attack has led to more than a week-long outage of the the United-owned Change Healthcare system, disrupting payments at hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies across the nation. 

Since Change Healthcare acts as a middleman between healthcare providers and insurance companies, the breach has hindered everyday transactions like electronic pharmacy refills and new insurance claims. The company first identified suspicious activity on its IT systems on February 21st, according to an SEC filing. 

The breach could last for weeks, UnitedHealth Group Chief Operating Officer Dirk McMahon told STAT. The insurance company is setting up a loan program for healthcare providers in the meantime. 

Blackcat, also known as ALPHV, has claimed credit for numerous hacks over the past year, including the MGM casino breach in Las Vegas, a hack on Reddit’s systems, and many others. 

In a joint cybersecurity advisory, federal agencies including CISA and the FBI warned that Blackcat is now intentionally targeting the healthcare system. “Since mid-December 2023, of the nearly 70 leaked victims, the healthcare sector has been the most commonly victimized,” the agencies wrote.

The US government has even offered a combined $15 million reward for any actionable intelligence on the group’s whereabouts. An attempt by the FBI to seize Blackcat’s servers and sites last year seemingly failed —the group quickly regained control. 

In a darknet message that was later deleted on Wednesday, Blackcat also claimed it stole millions of patient records, including sensitive medical and insurance data in the UnitedHealth breach, Reuters reported. The group also admitted, in the same message, to stealing data from Medicare, the military medical agency Tricare, and even CVS Health. No further details were provided about the timing of these breaches, and the message was reportedly deleted without explanation. Reuters was unable to reach the hackers or verify any of their claims.

Even the theft of sensitive records from UnitedHealth alone could impact millions of people. Change Healthcare handles nearly 1 in 3 patient records in the US, the American Hospital Association told HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra in a letter sent on Monday. “Any prolonged disruption of Change Healthcare’s systems will negatively impact many hospitals’ ability to offer the full set of health care services to their communities,” wrote AHA president Richard J. Pollack. 

UnitedHealth is currently working with Google-owned Mandiant and cybersecurity software vendor Palo Alto Networks, CNBC reports.  The company hasn’t indicated whether it plans to pay the ransom.

Health care providers across the country are reeling from a cyberattack on a massive U.S. health care technology company that has threatened the security of patients’ information and is delaying some prescriptions and paychecks for medical workers. 

The hack could also disrupt discharging people from the hospital, a major hospital association said.

Change Healthcare announced Thursday that a ransomware group that had claimed responsibility for the attack was at fault. Change Healthcare also said it is assessing the impact of the attack, which it first acknowledged on Feb. 21 and has affected billing and care-authorization portals across the country.

“Patient care is our top priority and we have multiple workarounds to ensure people have access to the medications and the care they need,” Change Healthcare said in a statement.

Owned by UnitedHealth Group, Change Healthcare manages health care technology pipelines, processing 14 billion transactions a year. The company said its investigation determined that Change Healthcare, Optum, UnitedHealthcare and UnitedHealth Group systems have been affected. Change also confirmed Thursday that ransomware group ALPHV, or Blackcat, made the breach. The company didn’t respond to a question about whether it paid or negotiated a ransom. 




One of the most immediate impacts is that people are seeing delays in getting prescriptions, American Hospital Association spokesperson Ben Teicher said. Change Healthcare said most affected pharmacies are using workarounds like writing things down.

But the severity of the situation may still be unfolding, the American Hospital Association said in an email to The Associated Press. Hospitals are having issues with processing claims, billing patients and checking insurance coverage for care, the AHA said, but the attack also could affect the ability to pay workers and buy medicine and supplies. 

“The impact to hospitals is just now really starting to crystallize and as a result has been underreported,” Teicher said. “As a result we can’t really speak to the longer term aftermath, but it can result in hospitals not being able to make payroll or patients still waiting for services to be approved.”

Health systems told the Healthcare Association of New York State that they’ve had trouble with various things, including “an inability to verify patient eligibility and coverage … communicate pharmacy prescriptions, file claims … and receive normal cash flow to support operations, among other issues,” association president Bea Grause said. 

Several major health care providers that serve multiple states did not respond to requests for comment. 

Cybersecurity experts say ransomware attacks have increased substantially in recent years, especially in the health care sector. This one comes on the heels of an attack last month on a children’s hospital in Chicago, which had to take phone, email and medical records systems offline. 

An FBI spokesperson in Tennessee said he could not confirm or deny whether the FBI is investigating. The FBI also said it’s “aware of this incident” but didn’t have anything else to provide because the incident “is ongoing.” 

“As far as we can tell, the attack is being contained,” said Allan Liska, a threat intelligence analyst at Recorded Future. “We don’t think it’s going to get worse. But when you have a critical system like this that’s down for an extended period … the longer it’s down and the longer that recovery takes, the more impact it’s going to have on patient care.”

Thousands of pharmacies and health systems throughout the country, including in Washington, are scrambling to find different ways to fill prescriptions and bill for medication after a recent cyberattack hit a division of UnitedHealthcare, the nation’s largest health insurer.

The data breach on Change Healthcare, part of UnitedHealth’s Optum, was discovered  Feb. 21 and appeared to be coming from a foreign country, The New York Times reported earlier this week. A spokesperson for UnitedHealth estimated more than 63,000 pharmacies nationwide have been affected by the attack and have been forced to “[modify] electronic claim processing to mitigate impacts,” but said the system has received “no reports of continuity of care issues.”

“They are downplaying it,” said Jenny Arnold, CEO of the Washington State Pharmacy Association, which provides support for the state’s 2,000 community pharmacies and their staffers. “And the pharmacy community is frustrated.”

While the effects of the breach vary widely, Arnold said “nearly every pharmacy and health system is impacted in some way.”

Change, which was acquired by UnitedHealth Group in 2022, mainly helps pharmacies verify a patient’s insurance coverage for their prescriptions, facilitate and send electronic prescriptions and check claims information, but many other types of health systems, including hospitals, physician groups and dental clinics, also use the platform, Arnold said.

“For some pharmacies it is as simple as some of their systems have glitches, and they cannot process manufacturer and other discount cards,” she wrote in a message. “Some are not able to received electronic prescriptions and some have more severe challenges processing prescriptions.”

In the past week, many pharmacies have found other ways to process prescriptions and submit claims, which are “working well,” but UnitedHealth’s lack of transparency around the problem has been difficult, Arnold said. 

“Since identifying the cyber incident, we have worked closely with customers and clients to ensure people have access to the medications and the care they need,” UnitedHealth said in a statement this week. “We also continue to work closely with law enforcement and a number of third parties … on this attack against Change Healthcare’s systems.”

UnitedHealth has not shared an updated timeline for when systems might be back online.

Change also handles a number of prescription drug discount cards, which allows holders with or without insurance to save money on medication. Because they’re distributed and processed electronically, Arnold added that pharmacies are still working to find reliable discount card alternatives.

“As these are for expensive medications, most of these patients are electing to wait until the coupon goes through before picking up their medications,” said Matt Binder, who owns three Seattle-area pharmacies, including Ostroms Drug & Gift, Bob Johnsons Pharmacy and Madison Park Pharmacy and Wellness Center. 

Fortunately, Binder said, impacts to his stores have been limited since they don’t use Change systems for electronic prescriptions or for billing insurance. 

Another big unknown, Arnold said, is what happens when pharmacies can’t see whether an insurance plan is going to cover an entire claim, potentially resulting in reimbursement problems for health systems and higher copay charges for patients after they get their medication. 

“Health systems are providing care hoping the claim will be paid after services are rendered,” Arnold said. “It’s leaving a lot of health care in the lurch. I fear pharmacies and health systems are going to end up disproportionately bearing the burden of this outage.”

While it’s unclear exactly how many pharmacies in Washington use Change software, a spokesperson for Rite Aid, which owns Bartell Drugs, said “only a small percentage” of the store’s claims were  affected by the outage and that it was able to process many claims through another billing system.

Last week’s breach is the largest recent cyberattack on a health care-related system, though these types of attacks have become more common in recent years, prompting federal cybersecurity agencies to prioritize cybersafety among hospitals and other health organizations.

In December, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported that the medical data of more than 88 million people was exposed in the first 10 months of 2023. The department also saw a 93% increase in large, health care-related breaches reported to the agency between 2018 and 2022.

Health systems are generally targeted because of the massive amount of medical data they store, which can be extremely valuable to hackers, but also because of their increasing reliance on technology and Internet-connected devices, according to local cyber experts.

In this case, Arnold encouraged patients to first check in with their regular pharmacy to see which prescriptions it can still fill and what its capabilities are. 

“The pharmacy that knows you best knows which insurance you have, what meds you’ve filled and are in the best place to help you,” she said. “Even if that’s suggesting you go to another pharmacy.”

NEWS ALERT: Senate passes short-term spending bill to prevent government shut down, heads to Biden next 



CNN 

February 29, 2024, 8:12 AM

Washington (CNN) — A week after a cyberattack disrupted insurance processing at pharmacies across the US, health care professionals from Maryland to New York tell CNN that the hack continues to upend their businesses, potentially cutting into revenue.

Raeya Disney, a psychotherapist who treats trauma victims in Maryland, said she worries she is “at risk of having to give up my office space” if the billing outage continues much longer.

“I’ve begun manually billing and I’m praying that I will be paid,” Disney told CNN.

Purvi Parikh, an allergist with a private practice in New York, said the hacking incident “just puts a lot more burden on physician practices, hospitals, pharmacies that now are scrambling to figure out the alternatives of how to get claims submitted or fill prescriptions.”

Parikh hasn’t been able to submit claims to insurance carriers for a week, she said.

It’s all part of the fallout from a cyberattack that a week ago hit Change Healthcare, a unit of health IT giant UnitedHealth that processes prescriptions to insurance for tens of thousands of pharmacies nationwide.

Carter Groome, chief executive of Health First Advisory, a cybersecurity firm whose clients include big health care organizations, estimated that some health care providers are losing more than $100 million per day because of the outage.

“That’s just not sustainable in an industry with not a lot of cash on hand,” Groome told CNN.

“This is our Colonial Pipeline,” he said, referring to a 2021 ransomware on one of America’s biggest pipelines that disrupted fuel shipments for days and cemented ransomware as a national security concern in the minds of senior US officials.

In the wake of the hack, Elevance Health, which owns Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield and insures millions of Americans, has severed network connections to Change Healthcare “out of an abundance of caution,” Elevance spokesperson Leslie Porras told CNN in an email.

“The ability for our members to access medical care, services or fill their prescriptions remains unaffected,” Porras said.

As of Wednesday morning, Change Health Care said the company’s affected network was still offline. Tyler Mason, a company spokesperson, said that insurance claims submissions have returned to “pre-disruption levels” because health care providers are using “alternative clearing houses” to submit claims.

Mason said that doctors and patients can use these workarounds to address the problems described by Parikh and Disney.

“Since identifying the cyber incident, we have worked closely with customers and clients to ensure people have access to the medications and the care they need,” Mason said in an email. “As we remediate, the most impacted partners are those who have disconnected from our systems and/or have not chosen to execute workarounds.”

But confusion among some health care professionals about how to adapt to the situation remains.

Amy Cizik, a health care researcher in Utah, has been trying to get her pharmacy in Salt Lake City to process her insurance for days. Her 16-year-old daughter has a rare genetic syndrome and takes multiple medications to manage the conditions that come with the syndrome, Cizik told CNN.

“She needs the drug to function at school, to function well in our household,” Cizik said.

With medication running out, Cizik said she spent an hour on the phone Tuesday trying to resolve the situation. The pharmacy transferred her to the insurance provider, which transferred her to another firm that handles prescription drug benefits on behalf of insurers.

No one could resolve the issue, she said.

“As somebody who has a child with chronic illness with multiple prescriptions who works a fulltime job, me caring for her is a whole other job that I do,” she said. “And this is just adding to that.”

Cizik said the pharmacy was finally able to process her insurance on Wednesday morning, narrowly avoiding having to pay $1,000 over the counter for the medication.

Senior US cyber officials have been concerned about the cyberattack from the moment that news of the hack broke. Officials from the FBI and departments of Health and Human Service (HHS) and Homeland Security have held regular calls for days to try to get a handle on the problem, CNN previously reported.

Andrea Palm, the deputy HHS secretary, told CNN on Tuesday that the department continues to be in close touch with Change Healthcare as the company tries to restore its network.

Forensic evidence recovered in the investigation indicates that a prolific ransomware gang was responsible for the hack, according to private briefings Change Healthcare executives have given to other health care executives, two people familiar with the conversations told CNN.

The ransomware gang, which includes Russian-speaking cybercriminals, rents out their so-called malicious software, known as ALPHV or BlackCat. Hackers using the malware have claimed a slew of attacks on US universities, health care providers and hotels in the last 18 months. On Wednesday, the ransomware gang claimed responsibility for hacking Change Healthcare, listing the company as a victim on its dark-web site.

Reuters first reported on the connection between ALPHV ransomware and the Change Healthcare hack.

The Justice Department in December announced an operation targeting the ALPHV gang, including the seizure of some of its computer infrastructure. But well-oiled cybercriminal groups often bounce back from US law enforcement crackdowns.

As of Tuesday afternoon, the American Hospital Association (AHA), an industry group that represents thousands of hospitals and health care clinics across the US, was still receiving reports from members that the cyberattack was interfering with the processing of insurance claims, John Riggi, AHA’s national advisor for cybersecurity and risk, told CNN.

“This was a systemic attack,” Riggi said. “This was an attack not only on Change Healthcare. This was an attack on the entire health care sector.”

The COVID-19 pandemic was a breaking point for 43-year-old Tamalyn Paredes, an addiction counselor at a methadone clinic in Portland, Oregon. Living in California at the time, she worked at a group home for children with serious emotional disturbances – a job she described as taxing, especially when kids would lash out. 

Helping those with mental health conditions hit close to home for Paredes. She lived with depression and suicidal thoughts for years, but the hormonal side effects of ovary removal surgery in 2019 made things worse.  

“I felt like my life was falling apart,” she said. 

After moving to Oregon for a new job in October 2021, she decided to prioritize her mental health and see a doctor for treatment. She was diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed medications, which she said have been life-changing. 

Today, Paredes takes three medications to manage her mental health. Her sleep quality has improved. She has more control over her emotions. Focusing her attention at work has become easier, especially after being fired for performance issues in previous jobs. 

“I cannot go back to not being medicated,” she said. 

A USA TODAY analysis of Medicaid data for the 60 most used psychiatric drugs showed a growing number of people sought mental health treatment and medication during the pandemic as it pushed people into isolation and dismantled support systems.  

The analysis also revealed a lingering effect of the pandemic: Mental health-related prescriptions rose further in 2022, up 12% from 2019, outpacing the less than 1% growth in overall prescriptions. That includes prescriptions for generic Zoloft, the most common antidepressant medication, which rose 17% over the same period. 

More than half of these drugs saw an increase in prescriptions since 2019, and the steepest increase was among ADHD drugs: Concerta and generic Adderall.

Even before the pandemic, the use of mental health drugs was on the rise due to more affordable medication options and broadening acceptance of mental health treatment. That increase accelerated as the pandemic deepened the country’s mental health crisis following widespread loss and adversity.  

The upending of normal structures due to COVID-19, alongside the heightened awareness of mental health and the expansion of conditions being diagnosed, are likely contributing to the rise in mental health prescription drugs, Amy Werremeyer, president of the American Association of Psychiatric Pharmacists, told USA TODAY. 

According to the Census Bureau’s January 2024 survey, the percentage of people experiencing anxiety or depression remains double that of pre-pandemic levels. 

Across all ages, over a fifth of adults – and more than a third of those under 30 – reported feeling anxious or depressed. Among transgender and bisexual people, the problem is worse: 57% of transgender people and 44% of bisexuals said they experience anxiety or depression. 

“This is just coming to a point where for many people, it’s been unmanageable,” said Dr. Smita Das, chair of the American Psychiatric Association’s addiction council. 

One silver lining of the pandemic, Das said: “We all started to talk about mental health more and bring it to the forefront.” 

The growing toll that the mental health crisis is exacting on the country is borne out in other data, too. For example, lives lost to suicide and drug overdoses are at record levels. 

Policymakers and government officials have taken note and recommended actions to fortify mental health programs and reinforce social support systems, such as creating mobile crisis teams, establishing a national suicide prevention hotline and implementing paid family leave laws.  

U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, last year, issued an advisory underscoring the urgency to address “the public health crisis of loneliness, isolation, and lack of connection.” 

“There's increasing recognition that we shouldn't be thinking about mental health conditions any differently than we think about physical health conditions,” Werremeyer said.  

“But for some reason in the past,” she said, “we have blamed people for having to take depression medication or substance use disorder medication.” 

Financial barriers, such as limited insurance coverage for mental health treatment or high costs for uninsured patients, also make it difficult for some people to access medications, Werremeyer said.  

Mental health drug use has grown over the past two decades — partly due to the introduction of lower-cost generics, according to Arthur Wong, a managing director focused on healthcare at rating agency S&P Global Ratings. 

It has become a high-demand area, Wong said, with drugmakers developing new alternatives and researching novel approaches to treat depression and anxiety.  

Among the generics that became available this century, Zoloft’s generic version, sertraline, is the most widely used drug for mental health, according to USA TODAY’s analysis of federal drug use data. The lower-cost alternative was released 15 years after its brand name hit the market in 1991.  

As of early February, generic Zoloft is 300 times cheaper than the brand name, based on average prices pharmacies pay per pill. That means, a month’s supply of Zoloft can cost patients without insurance upwards of $400, while the average retail price for the generic alternative hovers around $20, according to GoodRx. 

In the last five years, prices of the 30 most prescribed generic psychiatric drugs dropped faster than the average decrease across all generic drugs, based on USA TODAY’s analysis of National Average Drug Acquisition Cost data that contains information about the amount retail community pharmacies pay for drugs.

While generic prices trend downward, brand-name prices have steadily risen, a phenomenon dubbed the “generic paradox.”  

It's not uncommon for brand manufacturers to raise prices after lower-cost generic equivalents become available, said Andrew Mulcahy, a senior health economist at RAND, a nonprofit research organization. 

Less than 10% of prescriptions are for brand-name medications, but drug companies still turn a profit by selling to a “small slice of patients,” Mulcahy said. 

While some patients prefer to take brand-name drugs because they believe generic alternatives are inferior or less effective, despite meeting the same Food and Drug Administration standards, others stay on costlier medications because no other drug works effectively for them.  

The pandemic spurred telehealth expansion, but also aggravated challenges such as burnout among behavioral health workers, high turnover rates and nationwide staffing shortages. 

This, in turn, jeopardizes the quality of care, especially for underserved communities. 

“The vicarious trauma can be high because we hear some horrific stories,” said Tamalyn Paredes, who counsels people with opioid use disorder. 

Paredes treats 140 patients, triple the number she’s supposed to, simply because there are more people in need than there are providers. 

Rural, remote areas are hit especially hard. On many tribal lands, for instance, mental health care “doesn’t exist at all,” said Lori Jump, CEO of StrongHearts Native Helpline, a nonprofit organization that works with Indigenous communities. 

Most non-profit centers that operate under government authority rely on grants to provide for patients who can’t afford to pay. Some received a temporary reprieve through the 2021 American Rescue Plan, which distributed over $3 billion for mental health and substance use grant programs across the country.  

Central Plains Center in Plainview, Texas, was one of 40 community behavioral health clinics to get a federal grant. It received over $1 million. Despite that, CEO Sherri Bohr said she worries about future funding and what will happen once the grant runs out this August.   

The facility, Bohr said, serves under 4,000 people a year, most of whom are low-income, uninsured or enrolled in Medicaid.  

Another concern weighing on her is the shortage of licensed therapists eager to work in rural clinics, Bohr said. “This isn’t the kind of job you get if you just want a paycheck,” she said.  

Case in point: A job opening for a therapist at Central Plains Center has remained unfilled for three years. 

“They don't keep their roots here,” said Jason Johnson, its associate CEO. “They tend to see our small town as a stepping stone.” 

The uptick in people seeking treatment and medication does not provide a full accounting of the impact of the pandemic on mental health because many are reluctant to seek help, particularly people of color, LGBTQ+ communities and people with disabilities. 

It takes time to overcome that hesitation, said Das, a Stanford University professor, adding that among some communities it gets labeled “a personal failing.” 

A 2022 national drug use survey showed that among adults with serious mental illness who didn’t receive treatment, a majority reported that they should have been able to handle their mental health on their own. 

Tanisha Malcom, who is Black and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 20 years ago, said her family didn’t believe in mental illness or therapy. To them, mental health conditions “were not even considered something real,” Malcom said. “No one believed that this was happening to me because ‘it doesn't happen to us.’”  

The New York City resident said the underlying message was, “You have to be strong, be tough. You don't have time to be depressed." 

Malcom, who lives alone, also felt anxious and unsupported during the pandemic, she said. Watching COVID-19 cases and deaths rise higher and higher worsened her mental health, so she kept the TV off altogether. As someone with comorbidities, Malcom said leaving the house was nerve-racking. She lost friendships and didn’t have a community.  

To remedy this, she co-founded the Black Minds Matter support group in May 2020 at the National Alliance on Mental Illness of New York City to support Black people like herself who live with mental health conditions. Today, the support group is thriving, Malcom said, adding that participants share wisdom about how to navigate every aspect of their daily lives being Black and managing mental health conditions.  

They feel “seen, empowered and cared for. It’s just like a big group hug,” she said. 

Tamalyn Paredes, who helps people with addictions on the opposite coast in Oregon, said she finds fulfillment in her demanding job by connecting patients with the resources they need. Her goal is to become a licensed clinical social worker, drawing from her experiences at the methadone clinic and children’s group home in California. 

“I found that from working with the kids, it gave me street cred,” Paredes said. “People always say, ‘It gets better, it gets better,’ but I’m proof that it does.”  </p>
