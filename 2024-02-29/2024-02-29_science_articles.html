					The chronic disease affects roughly one-eighth of the global population				

The global prevalence of obesity has soared over the last 30 years. A new analysis suggests that more than 1 billion people worldwide now live with the chronic disease.

It’s no secret that global obesity rates have been rising over the past few decades. But a new analysis quantifies the upsurge.

More than 1 billion people worldwide were living with obesity as of 2022, researchers report February 29 in the Lancet. That’s about one-eighth of the global population (SN: 11/15/22). For comparison, nearly 800 million people had obesity in 2016, according to the World Health Organization, or WHO.

Obesity is “defined by the presence of excess body fat that impairs health,” says obesity expert Arya Sharma of the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, who was not involved in the study. The chronic disease can raise the risk for conditions like heart disease and type 2 diabetes, vulnerability to diseases like COVID-19, and can also limit mobility and negatively affect mental health (SN: 4/22/20).

Global health researcher Majid Ezzati and colleagues examined more than 3,600 population-based studies published over the last several decades encompassing 222 million participants across nearly 200 countries and territories. The researchers divided each participant’s reported weight by their height squared to find their body mass index, or BMI.

Analyzing the trends suggested that in 2022, almost 900 million adults worldwide had a BMI of 30 or above, classifying them as having obesity. In children and adolescents ages 5 to 19, nearly 160 million were estimated to have the chronic disease, defined as BMI above a certain point on the WHO’s growth reference curves, which account for age and sex.

From 1990 to 2022, the prevalence of obesity roughly doubled in women, tripled in men and quadrupled in children and adolescents. At the same time, global rates of those who were underweight fell. “We shouldn’t be thinking about [underweight and obesity] as two separate things, because the transition from one to the other has been very rapid,” says Ezzati, of Imperial College London.

The estimated obesity rates should raise alarms, he says. “Governments and societies need to deal with this” through prevention and medical care. Despite new anti-obesity medications like Wegovy showing incredible results, Ezzati adds, their high costs and lack of incorporation in worldwide medical guidance will make them inaccessible to most people for the near future (SN: 12/13/23).

Ezzati notes that one of the biggest driving factors of obesity’s increased prevalence is limited access to and the unaffordability of healthy foods. Sharma adds that societal-level lifestyle changes — such as getting less sleep, increased stress levels and spending less time at home — can also lead to eating more processed foods and overconsumption (SN: 12/21/18; SN: 5/16/19).

“When you look at appetite, there’s a complex biology behind it,” Sharma says. “And that biology is affected by environmental changes.”

The surprise pregnancy of Charlotte, a stingray living in a tank without any male rays, has captivated people across the world and stirred a sudden interest in parthenogenesis, a scientific term that essentially means virgin birth. 

Speculation about the stingray has racked up more than 12 million views for a TikToker. The talk show host Jimmy Kimmel weighed in on Charlotte’s apparent immaculate conception with a segment about the ray, which resides at the Aquarium & Shark Lab, in Hendersonville, North Carolina. 

While a virgin birth sounds like a rare event, experts on parthenogenesis said Charlotte has performed a miracle of life far more common than most people understand. Dozens of species — zebra sharks, California condors and Komodo dragons — can reproduce asexually through parthenogenesis. Scientists have only started to unravel the mysteries of this phenomenon, and a better understanding of the process could help them harness its power for conservation. 

“There’s nothing unnatural about asexual reproduction,” said Mercedes Burns, a biologist at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, who studies sexual conflict in animals. “Invertebrates or fishes are doing amazing things in their lifetimes in order to reproduce successfully.” 

The frenzy over Charlotte’s baby bump began earlier this month, when the Aquarium & Shark Lab announced that the stingray was expecting, suggesting on social media that she’d been either impregnated by a shark that shares her cage or that she had developed pups through parthenogenesis. 

Kevin Feldheim, a researcher at Chicago’s Field Museum who is a parthenogenesis expert, said the shark impregnation theory might have helped make Charlotte a media darling, but it has no basis in reality because they are such distant genetic relatives. 

“The divergence between sharks and stingrays is 350 million years. And as comparison, the divergence between humans and platypus is 180 millions years,” he said. “The shark scientists were not really happy with that press release. No one would even think of that as an option.” 

Once the ray gives birth to pups, researchers will have to evaluate the offspring and do genetic testing to confirm they’re the results of parthenogenesis, which is the only likely cause, Feldheim said. He added that confirmation will be important because elasmobranchs — a subclass of fish that includes rays, sharks and skates — can store viable sperm for several years in a special gland. 

Scientists are only just beginning to understand how many species can perform parthenogenesis. He said the first convincing evidence of the phenomenon in sharks was published in 2007. 

Feldheim said he’s counted 15 species of elasmobranchs where parthenogenesis has been observed by scientists since then. 

The phenomenon has been observed in every class of animals, except for mammals, which have a mechanism that prevents parthenogenesis.  

“Genes responsible for early stage development of zygotes have to come from both sperm and egg. If they’re only present in the egg, that zygote will arrest its development,” Burns explained, adding that mammals are “all in” on sexual reproduction. 

The common form of parthenogenesis happens during meiosis, when gametes (the cells that create new organisms in sexual reproduction) are created. When eggs are produced, byproducts are created called polar bodies, which contain genetic information. 

During spontaneous parthenogenesis, eggs fuse with polar bodies to create a new offspring without the genetic contribution of another parent. 

The extent to which parthenogenesis exists in the wild remains unclear. It’s often observed in zoos, where it’s easier to spot because animals are separated from one another and often solitary. 

“Females are held in aquariums around the world, oftentimes without a male, and if they started laying eggs, I‘m assuming aquariums would toss them, because they weren’t fertile,” Feldheim said. “It’s now being studied in a little more depth in a couple species around the world because we’ve started to know how it’s relatively common in a captive setting.”

The process could be playing out in wild animals with similar rates, but it’s much harder to detect. 

Why vertebrates have developed the ability to reproduce asexually is a bit of mystery. 

Researchers found a population of small tooth sawfish in Florida that’s just barely hanging on, Feldheim said. The researchers found several of the creatures were reproducing through parthenogenesis. 

“This species is at much lower numbers than it has been in the past. It’s very possible those females couldn’t find a mate,” he said, which would make parthenogenesis a “backup way” to reproduce when pickings are slim. 

But, the phenomenon has also been demonstrated in zebra sharks when mates were available. 

Burns said it’s possible parthenogenesis is a response to environment feedback. It’s also possible it’s just a happy fluke of cell division and a reminder of how life can bring gifts of random chance and little explanation.

					Understanding the effect could help forecasters determine whether a hurricane may strengthen after landfall				

Hurricane Florence roared across the Carolinas in September 2018, gaining new intensity as it swept over already waterlogged soils. The resulting rainfall broke records, and floodwaters continued to inundate towns such as Conway, S.C., (shown) two weeks after the storm had passed.

Once a hurricane makes landfall, it’s usually the beginning of the end for the storm. But a tropical cyclone passing over warm, waterlogged ground can get a jolt of energy that refuels its fury, researchers reported in January at the American Meteorological Society’s meeting in Baltimore.

This phenomenon, called the brown ocean effect, mimics how the ocean fuels tropical cyclones by giving the storms a ready supply of water and heat. Understanding this effect, researchers say, could help forecasters warn residents that an inland hurricane might counterintuitively strengthen.

Using satellite measurements of wind speeds, rainfall and soil moisture, geologist Dev Niyogi and colleagues examined how this effect was at play for Hurricane Florence, a relatively weak storm when it made landfall in the Carolinas in September 2018 (SN: 9/13/18). The data revealed a powerful feedback mechanism: As Florence passed over already-soaking soil, its rains intensified, ultimately leading to record-breaking rainfall and flooding.

It’s one of the first observational confirmations of this long-hypothesized phenomenon, says Niyogi, of the University of Texas at Austin. The brown ocean effect can also help some storms stay strong longer as they travel over land, he says, allowing them to penetrate deeper inland before dissipating (SN: 11/11/2020).

The idea of the brown ocean effect was described in 2013 by atmospheric scientist Marshall Shepherd and geographer Theresa Andersen, prompted in part by the very strange evolution of Tropical Storm Erin in 2007. The storm was weak and disorganized when it made landfall, but as it drifted northwest toward Oklahoma, it encountered flooded ground due to heavy rains that year. The storm suddenly strengthened, puzzling scientists as it even formed an eye for the first time.

Computer simulations have long suggested that wetter soils can intensify monsoon rains as well as cyclones. “Water evaporates from the ocean as water vapor, but when it gets into hurricanes, it condenses,” says Shepherd, of the University of Georgia in Athens. As the water changes from gas to liquid, it also releases heat — a jolt of storm-strengthening energy.

In Anderson’s dissertation work at the University of Georgia, she identified at least a dozen storms between 1997 and 2008, including Tropical Storm Erin, that were probably strengthened by this effect post-landfall.

And now, Shepherd says, there’s a growing body of scientific studies hunting for — and finding — the fingerprints of this effect in specific storms. “Tropical storms are not intelligent,” he says. “They don’t know the difference between wet soils, oceans and wetlands” as sources of energy.

The new study is among that body of work. Niyogi and colleagues used high-resolution satellite data on soil moisture, temperature and changes in rainfall before, during and after Hurricane Florence’s arrival on land. “As the storm system was moving, you could trace the source of moisture, see rainfall maxima,” Niyogi says.

The data revealed a powerful positive feedback between bursts of intense rain and soil moisture, the team found. How long the soils were wet before the storm passed over them also made a difference, they calculated: The heaviest rains occurred over soil that had already been saturated for about three days. That’s about how long evaporation from the soaked soil helped keep the atmosphere just above the ground nice and humid — ideal for feeding energy to a storm.

Saturated soil isn’t the only criterion — soil temperature was also key, the team determined. When the soil reaches a certain threshold temperature — one that’s yet to be determined, Niyogi says — the conditions are especially right to spin up a storm. The team’s findings were also reported in 2023 in Geophysical Research Letters.

Shepherd coauthored a separate study, also presented at the American Meteorological Society’s January meeting, that detailed how the effect contributed to flash floods inundating Texas during 2015’s Tropical Storm Bill.

And perhaps the most striking recent case of this effect came in 2021, when Hurricane Ida roared ashore in Louisiana, at almost the same location as 2005’s Hurricane Katrina. However, Ida lingered much longer before dissipating — probably fueled by days of rain soaking the ground and increasing the humidity ahead of its landfall, researchers reported in 2022 in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.

What these data show, Niyogi says, is that “the brown ocean effect exists, if you look for it.”

Shepherd agrees: These studies confirm that the brown ocean effect “is real,” and that computer weather models need to incorporate the influence of land as well as ocean and atmosphere on tropical storms. That’s particularly important when it comes to forecasting the danger these storms might pose to inland residents, he says. “If a storm moves inland, the model needs to capture that there’s wet soil there.”
