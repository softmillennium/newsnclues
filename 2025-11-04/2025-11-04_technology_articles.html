                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Netflix is looking for exclusivity, which means video podcasts that it licenses from iHeartMedia could no longer be uploaded to YouTube. It's worth noting that if a deal does come together, iHeartMedia might not license its entire podcast catalogue to the streaming service. The news comes a few weeks after Netflix signed a similar deal with Spotify that will bring a curated selection of sports, culture, lifestyle, and true crime podcasts from Spotify Studios and The Ringer to Netflix. Some of Spotify's biggest shows, including “The Joe Rogan Experience,” will remain on YouTube. For Netflix, these video podcast deals will give it a new way to better compete with YouTube, which is the most-watched platform for video podcasts after surpassing 1 billion monthly active podcast viewers earlier this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Our latest spotlight on up-and-coming startups in Seattle covers a lot of ground — dog-influenced connections, shareable travel itineraries, personalized exam prep, and streamlined product reporting. This regular series spotlights early stage startups that are getting off the ground with innovative ideas. Read on for brief descriptions of each company — and a pitch assessment from GPT-powered “Mean VC,” which we prompt to offer both positive and critical feedback. The business: Learning platform that helps high school students prepare for SAT, ACT, and AP exams through personalized daily practice. The bootstrapped startup has served more than 200 beta users and plans to expand its pilot program later this year. Leadership: CEO Dong Zhang spent three years at Amazon as a machine learning scientist and two years at IBM as a data scientist. Mean VC: “AceRocket hits a timeless market with an AI-driven, adaptive prep system that could actually make standardized test study less soul-crushing and more effective. But the test-prep space is dominated by giants with brand trust, so unless you show radically better outcomes — or pivot fast when tests go optional — you're launching into headwinds, not orbit.” The business: AI-native social travel companion that automatically turns real trips into shoppable itineraries friends can copy, personalize, and book. Boop wants to create the world's largest network of itineraries — connecting travelers, creators, and local businesses through personalized recommendations. Leadership: CEO Nancy Li Smith is a longtime product leader with stints at Meta, Microsoft, and more recently BrightAI. Mean VC: “Boop taps into the perfect intersection of social discovery and travel commerce, with a clear path to viral growth if itineraries truly feel personal and shareable. But unless Boop cracks retention and monetization beyond influencer sparkle, it risks becoming another glossy app people forget between trips.” The business: Automates product reporting by pulling live data from tools like Jira, GitHub, and Slack, turning it into leadership-ready narratives. Former Microsoft director Jeremy Schreiber recently joined as chief commercial officer. But automation in reporting is a graveyard of ‘almost useful' tools, and unless Dotted nails narrative accuracy and context, leaders won't trust what it writes any more than what they already ignore.” The app organizes puppy playdates and events that help dog owners form real-world friendships. Mean VC: “FurFriends cleverly uses dogs as social catalysts to thaw the ‘Seattle Freeze,' tapping into a playful, emotionally resonant niche with real community stickiness.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than two months ago, Tesla published its fourth “Master Plan,” a gauzy post about how the company wants to spread “sustainable abundance” via its future products. Details remain woefully absent, but that hasn't stopped Tesla from making it the central prop in its bid to convince shareholders to hand CEO Elon Musk a compensation package worth $1 trillion at the company's annual meeting on Thursday. Even Musk, who said that criticism was “[f]air” and claimed Tesla would “add more specifics,” acknowledged the plan's lack of details. Musk has maintained he cares less about the money and more about retaining control over Tesla and the “robot army” he wants to build — and he has threatened to leave if the vote fails. Each of those included concrete goals and tangible ideas, though some were so lofty that Tesla has still not yet accomplished them. The third Master Plan, released in 2023, focused on creating a sustainable energy economy and came in the form of a 41-page white paper. Tesla and Musk didn't respond to a request for comment. In August of this year, he wrote in another post that “Master Plan 3 was too complex for almost anyone to understand,” and said “Master Plan 4 will be concise.” Tesla published the plan just a few days later. It is highlighted on the pamphlets that instruct shareholders how to vote. It's been referenced in interviews by board chair Robyn Denholm and design leader Franz von Holzhausen. “A few days ago, Elon unveiled an inspiring next chapter for Tesla with Master Plan, Part IV, which is focused on creating a Sustainable Abundance for all,” Denholm and fellow board member Kathleen Wilson-Thompson wrote in a September letter to shareholders, again without going into further specifics. Denholm has been on a media blitz drumming up support for the $1 trillion pay package vote, but she has not been asked to lay out a clearer vision for Master Plan 4. Musk himself has not directly brought up Master Plan 4 on X since his September 2 post about adding more specifics. “[M]y initial reaction to it as a Tesla shareholder, Tesla owner, Tesla fan, and I saw a lot of this in the Tesla Community, was that it seemed like it was a little lacking in details compared to the previous Master Plans, which were pretty concrete,” host Ryan McCaffrey said, who then quickly pivoted to a more positive set of questions for the chief designer. “So, why are you excited about Master Plan Part 4 and sort of how is Tesla going to get this done? “We'll do it in Tesla fashion of course,” von Holzhausen responded. Most recently, he was a reporter at Bloomberg News where he helped break stories about some of the most notorious EV SPAC flops.

The layoff “is part of a limited restructuring of specific Philips Ultrasound activities within an ongoing strategic transition plan that was announced in 2024,” Mario Fante, Philips' global external relations director told GeekWire via email. We understand that Philips Ultrasound has revised their complaint procedures and have updated the corresponding complaint records to include additional information and to address the inspectional findings,” states the FDA letter. The layoffs are “completely unrelated to any regulatory action,” Fante added. Cloud moves fast, don't get left behind. AWS re:Invent connects you with global leaders, builders, and innovators.

People should have to think about CDNs and platforms as little as they think about what particular ISP is carrying their traffic between a server and their home.There should be a digital bill of rights that curtails the power of platforms in controlling access, reach, and forces interoperability, and eliminates arbitrary algorithmic enforcement, and allow due process with mandatory backout periods giving people the reasonable opportunity to recover digital assets, communicate with audience, and migrate to a new platform.The status quo is entirely untenable; these companies should not have the power to so casually and arbitrarily destroy people's livelihoods.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not defending Youtube's behavior here. It's bad and shouldn't just be shrugged off. I just don't think that shouting "monopoly!" If you want a video hosting and streaming site that has less market dominance and better moderation policies, that already exists. Frontend/index makes money off ads, and then pays some of that back to the host. Creators could in theory be paid by the video hosts, since views make the host money.Then heavy handed moderation could be a disadvantage then, because they would be lacking content other sites have (though some of that content would be distasteful enough most frontends would ban it).

In 99.999% of cases, when a platform removes a user, there's zero relationship between that user and the people involved in making that decision.If Congress made a law tomorrow (laughable in the current environment, I know) that said that any public video platform provider with over X users couldn't ban anyone except for specific reasons, then YouTube would, indeed, have to keep such people on their platform.

I don't love the way language around this is evolving as it is mostly a marketing tool to make these tools seem much more than they are. Primarily this is driven by the current generative "AI" bubble That could be as simple as a database lookup against flagged accounts or a simple heuristic score.We're over-AI-ing everything. Heuristics are just rules of thumb without necessarily having a rigid law or clean classification.You can derive heuristics from mathematically modeling something or even applying machine learning, but they need not necessarily involve either set of techniques.

An extremely fortunate RTX 5090 owner who contacted Nvidia after breaking their GPU while trying to install a custom liquid cooling block has received a brand new card free of charge, despite voiding their warranty as a result of the daring modification. However, the Blackwell flagship features a notably delicate design, which could pose risks if you damage one of the fragile internal components. It is somewhat refreshing to see a damaged GeForce RTX 5090 that is not caused by the melting of the 16-pin power connector from time to time. Although this individual was fortunate enough to have his graphics card with a broken connector replaced by Nvidia, this may be an exceptional case; nonetheless, it sets a notable precedent. It is understandable if you have not observed the insides of a GeForce RTX 5090 Founders Edition. This graphics card, priced at $1,999, indeed represents a significant investment, and even for those with the financial capability, obtaining it can be challenging because it is hardly in stock. Nevertheless, an online search for the internal structure of the GeForce RTX 5090 Founders Edition reveals that it employs a modular design comprising three circuit boards. This design resembles connectors typically found within smartphones or tablets. An owner of a GeForce RTX 5090 Founders Edition, along with NorthridgeFix, a specialized graphics card repair shop, encountered this problem firsthand. The courageous user disassembled his GeForce RTX 5090 Founders Edition in order to install a custom water block aimed at liquid cooling the graphics card. Nevertheless, NorthridgeFix subsequently identified that the user had bent one pin and damaged another, which was sufficient to render the GeForce RTX 5090 Founders Edition non-functional. Although Nvidia confirmed that it did not sell replacement parts, the company agreed to replace the graphics card at no cost after the issue was escalated to a senior representative. If liquid cooling is included in your plans, it would be advisable to consider purchasing a custom GeForce RTX 5090, as aftermarket designs are generally more convenient. Nevertheless, there remains some risk, as with everything in life. Alternatively, you may opt for one of the GeForce RTX 5090 variants equipped with an AIO liquid cooler or a pre-installed water block, if you're willing to pay a premium. However, if you are among the fortunate owners of a GeForce RTX 5090 Founders Edition, it is highly recommended that you refrain from disassembling it. We suspect Nvidia may handle these situations on a case-by-case basis, so you may not have the same luck as the owner in this story.

The ultra-rich that don't want to pay white collar workers to build software?The advantages of LLMs are tiny for software engineers (you might be more productive, you don't get paid more) and the downsides are bad to life-altering (you get to review AI slop all day, you lose your job). The advantages of LLMs are tiny for software engineers (you might be more productive, you don't get paid more) and the downsides are bad to life-altering (you get to review AI slop all day, you lose your job). This is already a fact and it's set in stone - making AI cheaper won't change anything in that regard. However, a cheaper AI will allow the laid-off software engineers to use models independently of those firing them, and even compete on a equal footing. (You can have inflation while your currency go up relatively to all the others on the FX market, like what happened to USD in 2022-S1, or you can have massive inflation difference between countries sharing the same currency, like it happened in the Euro Area between 2022 and today). Not to mention that "debasement" doesn't make sense anymore given that there basically aren't any currencies on the gold standard anymore. At best you could call a pegged currency that was devalued as being debased (with the base being the pegged currency), but that doesn't apply to USD. "debasement" therefore is just a pejorative way saying "inflation" or "monetary expansion". Or, for $300, you can buy an RTX 5060 that is better than the best GPU from just 6 years ago. It's even faster than the top supercomputer in the world in 2003, one that cost $500 million to build.I find it hard to pity kids who can't afford the absolute latest and greatest when stuff that would have absolutely blown my mind as a kid is available for cheap.

The shareware/unlock-code economy of the 90s was probably the closest you'd get to cutting out the middlemen, where you could download from some BBS or FTP server without the dev getting involved at all and then send them money to have them email you an unlock code, but it was a lot of manual work on the developer's part, and a lot of trust. Stripe is way more expensive than regular payment processors. Convenient for sure, but definitely not cheap. Do you have some concrete examples of where I can look? Is the same doubling happening world-wide or is this US-specific, I guess is my question?Edit: one data point, I last bought 128GB of RAM in March 2024 for  ~€536, similar ones right now costs ~€500, but maybe the time range is too long. Edit: one data point, I last bought 128GB of RAM in March 2024 for  ~€536, similar ones right now costs ~€500, but maybe the time range is too long. RAM usage for a lot of workloads scales with core/thread count, and my general rule of thumb is that 1G/thread is not enough, and 2G/thread will mostly work, and 4G/thread is probably too much, but your disk cache will be happy. Also, the same applies to VMs, so if your hosting a VM and give it 16 threads, you probably want at least 16G for the VM. The 4G/thread then starts to look pretty reasonable.Just building a lot of opensource projects with `make -j32` your going to be swapping if you only have 1G/thread. This rule then becomes super noticeable when your on a machine with 512G of ram, and 300+ threads, because your builds will OOM.

I suspect they would rather face shortages then satisfy market demand. overproduction means unsold units which is very bad, you pay a cost for every unsold unitunderproduction means internal processes are strained, customers are angry, but a higher price per a unit... can you increase the price by more than you are underproducing? underproduction means internal processes are strained, customers are angry, but a higher price per a unit... can you increase the price by more than you are underproducing? I think the Nintendo ecosystem has been a pretty good example of where intentional underproduction can backfire. Another example might be that migration to SSD was likely accelerated by (forced) underproduction of spinning disks in 2011. We use SSDs for a lot of things that traditional magnetic media would be better at simply because the supply has been so overpowering for so long.You can train your customers to stick with you by bathing them in product availability. We've allowed a certain management class to terrorize us into believing this stuff is always bad. We've allowed a certain management class to terrorize us into believing this stuff is always bad. It means that buyers want to pay more, but something is getting in the way of the seller accepting that higher price. Satisfying market demand is the only way to maximize profitability.Why do you think companies would prefer to make less profit here? Why do you think companies would prefer to make less profit here? Either way, without competition expect it to increase further. The other way I look at this is that these companies have been collecting an insane amount of wealth and value over the last 2-3 decades, are finally in a situation where they feel threatened, and are willing to spend to survive.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But 12 months out from that devastating slate of losses, Democratic digital programs are still plagued by the same issues that doomed them last year. Despite millions of dollars in influencer investments and “lessons learned” memos, party insiders say Democrats are still stuck running social media programs that strive for authenticity, but often clash with the party's unrelenting desire to maintain control. “I can't, for the life of me, figure out why we are still so rigid and moderating everything when we have nothing to lose for the first time,” says one Democratic digital strategist, who requested anonymity to speak candidly. In a statement, DNC chair Ken Martin said that the show—which runs news headlines and interviews with party officials in an attempt to be MSNBC-lite—“cements our commitment to meet this moment and innovate the ways we get our message across a new media landscape.” The show, hosted by DNC deputy communications director Hannah Muldavin, has brought in only around 16,000 views total across more than 100 episodes since its launch. “We're focused on reaching as many people as possible, and we've made huge progress this year in expanding our reach,” a spokesperson from the DNC tells WIRED. “Since January, the DNC has seen enormous follower growth on high-traffic platforms like TikTok and Instagram, accruing over 3.8 billion impressions across our accounts. We are building relationships with hundreds of creators so that the Democratic Party is a constant presence on voters' feeds, cutting across interests and backgrounds. Since the government shut down earlier this month, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer has hosted a string of highly-produced videos that have barely registered outside of the Washington, DC, ecosystem. (Schumer's Senate office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.) And many of their ideas never make it to party platforms. A few strategists who spoke with WIRED insist that the tides are turning in a more positive direction as the party prepares for next year's midterm elections. “The digital narrative has made this into an on-year election for a lot of people.” Some Democrats have been innovating: Of the possible 2028 presidential contenders, Gavin Newsom and Pete Buttigieg have shown a willingness to appear on more nontraditional platforms. Earlier this year, Buttigieg appeared on the Flagrant podcast, hosted by comedian Andrew Schulz, which president Donald Trump appeared on last year. In October, Newsom joined Twitch streamer Connoreatspants to play Fortnite while discussing the Trump administration and Democratic messaging failures. In New York, Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani has set new standards for what digital programs should look like going forward, creating content that mixes humor and policy in effective ways that routinely go viral outside of the New York media world. But Mamdani's digital and electoral success so far has highlighted not just what's possible for Democrats online, but just how much the party fears the success it doesn't control. “Because if we actually talk about how easily it would be to replicate both what he's doing digitally and the issues he is promoting, then that's a threat to the establishment. Without significantly overhauling the strategy that contributed to Trump's return to office, Democrats fear 2026 could be a repeat of 2024.“If you are so scared of entrusting your candidate to be themselves, you need to get the hell out of Democratic politics,” says Caleb Brock, a Democratic digital strategist who is currently the director of digital strategy for California representative Ro Khanna.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two scientists argue that the growing commercial efforts to counter climate change by reflecting away sunlight will thwart responsible research in the field. Last week, an American-Israeli company that claims it's developed proprietary technology to cool the planet announced it had raised $60 million, by far the largest known venture capital round to date for a solar geoengineering startup. MIT Technology Review's guest opinion series, offering expert commentary on legal, political and regulatory issues related to climate change and clean energy. We also strongly dispute some of the technical claims that certain companies have made about their offerings. In addition, any decisions about whether or how they should be used should be made through multilateral government discussions, informed by the best available research on the promise and risks of such interventions—not the profit motives of companies or their investors. But research won't be useful unless it's trusted, and trust depends on transparency. That means researchers must be eager to examine pros and cons, committed to following the evidence where it leads, and driven by a sense that research should serve public interests, not be locked up as intellectual property. In recent years, a handful of for-profit startup companies have emerged that are striving to develop SRM technologies or already trying to market SRM services. That includes Make Sunsets, which sells “cooling credits” for releasing sulfur dioxide in the stratosphere. Our strong impression is that people in these companies are driven by the same concerns about climate change that move us in our research. However, we do not think startups—which by definition must eventually make money to stay in business—can play a productive role in advancing research on SRM. Adding business interests, profit motives, and rich investors into this situation just creates more cause for concern, complicating the ability of responsible scientists and engineers to carry out the work needed to advance our understanding. The only way these startups will make money is if someone pays for their services, so there's a reasonable fear that financial pressures could drive companies to lobby governments or other parties to use such tools. A decision that should be based on objective analysis of risks and benefits would instead be strongly influenced by financial interests and political connections. The need to raise money or bring in revenue often drives companies to hype the potential or safety of their tools. Indeed, that's what private companies need to do to attract investors, but it's not how you build public trust—particularly when the science doesn't support the claims. Even diamonds, which are extraordinarily nonreactive, would alter stratospheric chemistry. First of all, much of that chemistry depends on highly reactive radicals that react with any solid surface, and second, any particle may become coated by background sulfuric acid in the stratosphere. That could accelerate the loss of the protective ozone layer by spreading that existing sulfuric acid over a larger surface area. (Stardust didn't provide a response to an inquiry about the concerns raised in this piece.) In materials presented to potential investors, which we've obtained a copy of, Stardust further claims its particles “improve” on sulfuric acid, which is the most studied material for SRM. But the point of using sulfate for such studies was never that it was perfect, but that its broader climatic and environmental impacts are well understood. That's because sulfate is widespread on Earth, and there's an immense body of scientific knowledge about the fate and risks of sulfur that reaches the stratosphere through volcanic eruptions or other means. If there's one great lesson of 20th-century environmental science, it's how crucial it is to understand the ultimate fate of any new material introduced into the environment. Chlorofluorocarbons and the pesticide DDT both offered safety advantages over competing technologies, but they both broke down into products that accumulated in the environment in unexpected places, causing enormous and unanticipated harms. Grandiose claims notwithstanding—and especially considering that Stardust hasn't disclosed anything about its particles or research process—it would be very difficult to make a pragmatic, risk-informed decision to start SRM efforts with these particles instead of sulfate. We don't want to claim that every single answer lies in academia. But the math for sunlight reflection is just different. The essential questions of whether or how to use it come down to far thornier societal issues: How can we best balance the risks and benefits? How can we ensure that it's used in an equitable way? How do we make legitimate decisions about SRM on a planet with such sharp political divisions? Trust will be the most important single ingredient in making these decisions. And trust is the one product for-profit innovation does not naturally manufacture. We can't make investors in these startups do anything differently. Our request is that they think carefully, and beyond the logic of short-term profit. If they believe geoengineering is worth exploring, could it be that their support will make it harder, not easier, to do that? A measure I call the Green Premium reveals where we can invest in climate progress for maximum impact.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I feel cool in the abstract sense, and I don't know how to accurately define this feeling from the perspective of a gadget-obsessed nerd plugging away at a review product like I do any day of the week. The gaming laptop has just enough of everything I want from a portable machine. It's light, pretty, and relatively powerful—and, beyond all that, it has a sleek, seamless haptic trackpad and ultrabright RGB keys. The next person to come along and tell me RGB is a worthless expense can go ahead and tell it to the Predator Triton's mini LED per-key backlit keyboard. Few laptops offer so much in a small package, though it may not be the perfect device for gaming. The Predator is arriving at the tail end of 2025, a time when most big laptop launches have already come and gone. What's more, it's on the expensive end of 14-inch gaming laptops with these specs, demanding $2,500 for a system that may be overshadowed in just a few months when the next slate of next-gen CPUs arrives. Not only that, but it arrives just short of being the perfect “everything” laptop. Battery life won't match the “all-day” span you can find among recent thin devices, from Apple's M-series MacBooks to all those AMD, Intel, or Qualcomm devices that aren't running a discrete GPU under the hood. You pay more for unique qualities, and when the Predator Triton works so well, it becomes easier to overlook any flaws and—yes—even that price. As soon as you unbox the Acer Predator Triton's frame, you'll quickly realize how sturdy this miniature beast feels in your hand. There's very little flex on the lid or keyboard. The unit weighs just 1.6 kg, or around 3.5 pounds, equivalent to two and a half hardcover books. There are other things going on under the hood that set this device apart. Acer promised this would improve thermal conductivity and enhance the device's heat dissipation. Otherwise, you have a standard slate of ports, including HDMI, two USB-A 3.2 slots, one Thunderbolt 4 slot, and another USB-4 port for DC power. There's an additional headphone jack and a microSD card slot that will prove handy for some creators, though I will remain wistful for a full SD card slot on a 14-inch Windows laptop, like the one my 14-inch MacBook Pro has. Another prominent feature that sets the Predator Triton apart is its seamless haptic touchpad. There's no physical “click” either: Instead, the middle portion is pressure-sensitive and provides force feedback. But I never found myself swiping where I wasn't supposed to, unlike with the notorious Dell Pro Premium—the laptop formerly known as the XPS 13—which also lacks any barrier to mark where the touchpad starts and ends. Acer borrowed heavily from Asus in designing its Predator Triton 14 AI. The Corning Gorilla Glass is smooth to use. The keyboard's flat keys with 1.7mm of key travel also kept me feeling like a smooth operator. I also have to recognize the per-key RGB. The lights seem extra bright and remain clear even when I'm sitting next to a window. You'll have to remember to stick the stylus back in your bag—preferably in your backpack, if it has a pencil holder—and hope you don't forget it at your table at Starbucks. If you were looking for a 2-in-1 laptop or tablet-like experience, this isn't it. I tried out the pen in apps like Photoshop, where the trackpad essentially acts as a scaled version of your canvas. However, this hover function sometimes didn't work, and I would jab down on the wrong part of the picture. This could make selecting specific parts of the image more difficult than simply clicking with a mouse. However, once you master using the stylus as a faux pen, it starts to feel incredible. The stylus has tilt support and 4,096 pressure levels. I'm no artist, so I couldn't tell you how useful it may be when your drawing surface is barely any larger than your iPhone screen. The pen runs on a single AAA battery, with an estimated 12 months of life before you need to replace the cell. Unlike a device like the Apple Pencil Pro, there are no on-pen controls to make sure you don't have to swap between your mouse and pen to select a new tool. If you want an all-in-one laptop and drawing pad, I can't think of a better alternative than the Predator Triton 14 AI. If I were judging the Acer Triton 14 AI purely on its gaming performance, it would come up short compared to recent laptops like the Razer Blade 14. Thankfully, the performance delta isn't enough for me to say everyone should go out and grab a different device for a similar price—that may depend on the apps you expect to run. If the one thing you care about is in-game performance with the supported Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 GPU, then there are other devices of similar scale that will perform better. That device costs $2,700 without any discount, though it regularly sells for less. Compared to that slim gaming machine, the Predator is a loud beast that can't quite keep up with Razer's gazelle-like speeds. It's one of Intel's Lunar Lake devices that promised strong performance with excellent battery life in lightweight laptops, though few, if any, sported the top-end SKU. It has the same eight-core configuration as the more ubiquitous Core Ultra 7 258V (four performance cores and four efficiency cores), but with a higher 5.1GHz clock speed and 30W power draw. Finally getting the long-awaited Intel Core Ultra 9 288V in my hands proved underwhelming. The Core Ultra 9 288V is a lightweight laptop chip with a 30W envelope that can't reach the heights of CPUs designed for gaming laptops. Intel's Arrow Lake-H series has proved fairly strong across the many 16- and 18-inch laptops I've used this year. A 14-inch chassis will necessarily limit its performance in some apps. In our Blender tests, which measure how long it takes to render a BMW scene on both the CPU and GPU, the Intel chip took 3 minutes and 50 seconds, compared to just over 1 minute for the 16-inch Lenovo Legion Pro 7i with its Intel Core Ultra 275HX chip. At max resolution with all the ray tracing enabled to make Night City glow with more realistic lighting, you can technically achieve at least 35 fps with DLSS upscaling set to auto. It's a similar story in games like Horizon Zero Dawn: Remastered and Black Myth Wukong, where, at max resolution and with no frame gen, you can squeak by at just over 30 fps on the highest settings. The ceiling for an RTX 5070 and an Intel Core CPU may be lower than what you want, despite the asking price. I could barely make Marvel's Spider-Man 2—which, to be fair, is notoriously hard on the GPU, especially with ray tracing enabled—playable at medium settings with DLSS enabled. Meanwhile, in Baldur's Gate III, I found I could easily hit 60 fps in most settings without even needing to use DLSS, thanks to the latest updates. It was so loud I could barely hear the game audio. Sticking to the lower power profiles will be good enough for most of those same games I described before, with a difference of a few fps, at most. Being that it has a Lunar Lake CPU, the Triton qualifies as a Copilot+ PC, which ostensibly means you get access to all of last year's AI features. The NPU, or neural processing unit, central to this type of PC, isn't anywhere close to the end-all, be-all. Luckily, I found the battery could make up for some of the limited performance, even if few current gaming-ready laptops with the latest RTX 50-series GPUs will offer true “all-day” battery life. The Acer Predator Triton 14 AI is extremely portable for a gaming laptop. The device fit snugly into any backpack I threw it into, and it doesn't require a proprietary charger. The accompanying 140W power brick was small enough that I could wrap it up and tuck it up into the bottom of my bag without much consideration to how much heft I had to bring to and from work. Such a small brick is a nice change of pace after lugging around the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i's 400W power brick—the most brick-like of any power adapter I've used. However, the device's limited power draw is indicative of its overall performance. Like most traditional gaming laptops, the Predator Triton 14 will not last you from dawn till dusk. I was able to get close to 30 minutes more when I put the device on Quiet power settings and turned off all RGB lighting. That's the same story for every 2025 gaming laptop, and at least Acer's device is far less cumbersome than other options. When you use as many laptops as I do, coming back to an OLED display is like rubbing the sleep from your eyes every morning, thinking, “Oh, right, this is how things are supposed to look.” OLED, which stands for organic light-emitting diode, offers deeper black levels and better contrast than more traditional LCD screens. OLED displays are notoriously dimmer than others, but you'll find this one bright enough, indoors, for most use cases. Even hanging out near a window in full daylight, I wasn't disturbed from my perch. At least the screen isn't as glossy as those of some recent Lenovo devices I've used, and it wasn't reflective to the point that I had to angle myself just to read my own text. If you were hoping this laptop would be a full audio-visual suite for all your work, the Predator Triton's sound quality does punch above its small stature. However, I wouldn't say it's anywhere near the perfect audio specimen. It sports six speakers, four downward-firing and two on the side. If you're working on a table or desk, the noise becomes more muffled than it is if you're holding it aloft. It creates an awkward echo effect that won't occur when you're using the laptop on your lap. If you listen to the crackle in the opening video of Cyberpunk 2077, you'll start to identify when it's a little too much. This can enable a small sense of spatial audio in some supported games, but the effect will be less reliable than you'd achieve with a good pair of headphones. It doesn't help that Windows 11's most recent update has ballooned the number of Copilot AI apps vying for your attention. Running the machine for the first time was like opening up a beautifully wrapped present on Christmas and needing to dig through 15 layers of bubble wrap, old newspaper, and expired coupons to get to the good stuff beneath. I keep imagining the “everything laptop,” something that can handle everything well, from work to creative tasks to gaming. I can't imagine anything that would look far off from the Acer Predator Triton AI 14—at least, as long as you have its power brick nearby and easy access to an outlet. Even if performance may not be up to par with other devices at similar price points, I still prefer the other unique benefits Acer's latest brings to the table. Or at least I will, until Acer decides to stick a Panther Lake chip in this thing and figures out how to give it all-day battery life. At that point, it may truly strike gold. Maybe Nintendo had the right idea with all those exclusives. Your laptops, mini PCs, and PC parts will all cost more just before the holidays. This is what happens when you ignore hardware for years while dumping all your once-exclusive titles onto other platforms. We reviewed a ton of gadgets this year. Here's our list of winners for everything that blew us away.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kara Swisher is the epitome of a multi-hyphenate: a podcast host, journalist, author, and CEO agitator. Deeply sourced and happy to ask the hard questions, she doesn't care about being liked. As she said during a recent live event, “I have four kids!” As the host of On With Kara Swisher, her twice weekly podcast for Vox Media, she grills leaders in tech and politics, coaxing them to share the things they may not reveal on any other gabfest. For Pivot, her Vox show with New York University marketing professor Scott Galloway, she keeps the banter between herself and her cohost—but still, she doesn't hold back. Swisher's opinions are her own, and she doesn't hesitate to share them. Swisher brought all of her opinions, and more, to this week's episode of The Big Interview, going deep on AI, Silicon Valley's relationship with President Donald Trump, and which tech CEO is her least favorite. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. KATIE DRUMMOND: Kara Swisher, welcome to The Big Interview. Thank you for being here. Actually nobody listening to this can see it, but it's a giant version of the WIRED cover with Edward Snowden. One of our reporters, Andy Greenberg, had this in his house for years, and then finally was like, “My wife needs me to get this out of the house. Can I bring it to the office?” And I said, “sure.” So now it sits behind me when I record this podcast. I did a good interview with him many years ago. We like to start with some quick-fire questions. I'm sure you're used to this kind of thing. Most active text thread you're on. The tech exec you would least want to get stuck in an elevator with. More disruptive: AI or social media? What's the biggest lie Silicon Valley keeps telling itself? Who would play you in a biopic? I was just having a meeting about that. But do you want more, or quick [answers]? OK. My Burn Book sold to a production studio, Tomorrow Studios—maybe it'll get made, maybe it won't. But I'm actually meeting writers, and I think they feel like they can sell it. Who do they feel like would play you? It should be a believable lesbian, right, who's kind of a sassy person. They're all too tall is the problem. There's no one sort of tiny. Yes, there are, but it's gotta be—I'm just trying to think who it would work well with. I mean, probably the woman who plays Wednesday, what's her name? It's gotta be someone who—well, they don't have to be … height doesn't matter. I guess they can act their way out of that. The one that Walt Mossberg and I did together with Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. That was a really important interview. I think it's gonna last the test of time. I think people will watch it centuries from now. It was really a highlight of my career. Usually in these conversations I would sort get into someone's background and ask them about their childhood. I'm not gonna do that. I feel like we have too much to talk about. But I did want to use this as an opportunity to ask you about being a woman, being a gay woman, no less, in an historically male field. The subjects of your reporting very often are men. You said that you wanted to write a series of three books for women and other people who may need these books, and they would be: No Is a Complete Sentence; Yes, I'll Take That; and Maybe I'll Call You Back. Yeah, I think it's brilliant. Tell me more about the experience of being a woman, and gay woman, in the field you're in. I think gay has not hurt me, actually, in the field, because I think that men are more comfortable with me for some reason. I don't know what it is. So I think they're relatively comfortable with the gay part. I've never really gotten any kind of pushback on that issue. Actually, I do think it's a net positive in general. I think I've told this story, but I was at an event, and a bunch of VCs were looking at the ladies and they're like, “Oh, she's cute. What do you think, Kara?” And I go, “Still a feminist. I don't talk about women objectively like that.” As a woman, I don't think that's hindered me necessarily, either. Even if they do it in hiring, and they create these manospheres in technology, which they've done for a long time, it hasn't kept me out. They haven't favored men—or men who are slavishly attentive to them—until recently. Then they're willing to do interviews. I think there's a lot to your style and your approach that has meant that you are often described as unlikable. I don't hear a lot of strong-willed men being described as unlikable. I mean, how did you learn not to care? Or do you just genetically not care? You know, again, it may have gone along with being a lesbian. Just like, I don't need the favor of men. It's that I'm being honest with them. I actually have gotten more than my fair share of great interviews, right? They haven't not interviewed with me. Why are you so mean? One more question on this topic. I've wanted to ask you this. I get a lot of advice as a woman in this job in particular, about the way I dress, about the fact that I don't wear makeup. Every time there's a social clip of me that runs on the WIRED account, at least one person will say, “Makeup, please.” I don't wear makeup. I'm not interested in wearing makeup. But for women in general who are ambitious, who work in male-centric spaces. Sometimes when men start down that negging road, I often go, “Did you lose weight? Oh, no, I guess not.” That's one of my favorites. I was on a TV show, and one of my sons was with me, who was, I guess, maybe 12 or 13 at the time. I went in and the guy who was sitting in the green room with my son was like, “Doesn't your mother smile?” And my son looked at him and said, “Did you just say that?” And that's all he said. I get “smile” a lot and have started just saying “No, that's just my face.” I really don't hear it anymore. I have enough toddlers in my life that I don't need more. Well, speaking of toddlers, we have to talk about leadership in the tech industry. When you look back now, who among this set has continued to take their responsibility to all of us, to society, most seriously, and who has failed the most profoundly? The surprise to me has been Mark Cuban, actually. I broke the story when he sold his company to Yahoo. And he was somewhat of an arrogant little prick … I actually just interviewed him, and I reminded him that you said he was an arrogant prick. But I still liked him. I never necessarily know what he's gonna say, but I always know he is gonna have thought about it. I suspect through having kids and other things, he's really developed and matured. Another person like that is Evan Spiegel from Snapchat. He was mad at the press and decided I was the press. There was a whole bad set of emails… He was in college, like, I'm gonna give him an out. We were having lunch, and he yelled at me. Honestly, I don't know why you're yelling at me.” He was mad at the press, in general. [Airbnb CEO] Brian Chesky is another person I like a lot who I really think is honest about his feelings. We don't, like, cuddle and comb each other's hair. But I really think he tries to be a better person, I guess a better man. Most of them do not try to be a better man, but in general, Zuckerberg is at the top of the list. Elon Musk obviously, but I think he's plagued by other issues. I think there's a lot going on there that is really, um, I don't want to say tragic, because he kind of brings it on himself. You know, Tim Cook these days is a little bit—especially since he's retiring—I'm like, Really? This is how you want to go out? Well, this is what I'm wondering about. This cozy dynamic between tech leaders and politicians. Here we all are at dinner together. I want your assessment of why these executives—they're not only working with the administration behind the scenes, you have to imagine they're doing that—but there is this overt demonstration of fealty that we are seeing. It's interesting you bring up Mark Cuban. I asked him this question, and he said, “If they need to get knee pads that are embroidered with a D on one knee and a T on the other knee, and show up at the White House every day, they don't have much of a choice.” He seemed to think that was just the way business works. That it's a business imperative. In any administration, there's versions of that, right? So you have to curry favor. It's usually just dinner and a donation. Now this guy requires a different kind of fealty, which is a very explicit, performative fealty. So if this is the cost of doing business, this is the cost of doing business. I feel they don't have to. I don't think it's the cost of doing business. But they seem to think it is. And there certainly are a lot of juicy bits to slice up. But I think they feel a duty to their shareholders. They don't have a duty to society. On the other side, there's people who like it. People who like to exercise power. Zuckerberg would be one of those. So I think he kind of wants to do it. He's so tired of ladies telling him what to do. He is gonna put on his MMA mitts and go for it. Any performative maleness should be a sign for you to run for the hills. And some of them have switched, like Sergey Brin has gotten quite Trumpy. I know this from his family, most of whom are horrified. He's got a girlfriend who's real Trumpy. So there he goes down Trump Avenue, and I kind of think it makes sense. I ran into one of them, and I'm not gonna say which one, and they're like, “Looks like we won, Kara. We beat you, Kara.” They're in DC where I live, which, I'm like, “Why did you come to my home? I moved all the way across the country to get away from you.” It was at some event. “Looks like we won, Kara.” And I go, “Hmm, you did. It's obviously different for any given executive, right? When you think about the short-term gain, long-term pain, how do you see this playing out in three years? Assuming we have a different administration in a way that hurts these companies. I think it's really shortsighted, because at some point someone else will be in charge. I do make the joke over and over: If Kamala Harris won, Mark Zuckerberg would be a they/them. He'd be like, “I love kombucha and Charli XCX, my favorite. I think a lot of them are in fear. You know, they can see what he's doing. I was with some Apple people who are just horrified by Tim's behavior. I go, “Well, I guess, shareholder value.” And they said, “It isn't good for shareholder value. It's not, because it's not what our company is.” So in the short term, they get a tariff break. But as a rule, it's not about businesses, it's about oligarchy and therefore you don't compete based on the right things. You also don't let little companies rise. What has felt interesting to me is that there's obviously the silence at the executive level, which we didn't see in 2016 to this extent, but there's also the silence of the workforce inside these companies. I mean, you hear it anecdotally, but we're not seeing mass uprisings inside Google, inside Apple. We're not seeing this really spill over. They just fired an Amazon person who protested for Palestine. Like when did those free-speech warriors let that happen? They don't want people to say what they think, or else I'd be doing regular interviews with Mark Zuckerberg. Well, Mark, you're a big important man. When you look at Silicon Valley, when you look at the industry, when you look at leadership, do you have any hope that we will see a new kind of leader emerge in this industry? Is it a generational shift? What does that require, and are there people out there who are representative of that to you right now? My son is a tech person, and he's studying tech at Michigan, and it's not 'cause I trained him or anything. He's also a frat bro, so I didn't stop that. All his friends and the people around him talk about much deeper things like energy, about fixing things, about climate. I just taught a course at Michigan, largely so I could irritate my son for seven weeks. I was so moved by the students. They're not dumb and idealistic, although I don't mind that in a college student, by the way. They really do have a sense of community. Like my son, he's a mechanical engineer. He wants to make things, and a lot of it has to do with community helping people. At the same time, he's a capitalist, right? But he doesn't see it as a power thing. Maybe someday he will, and then I'll slap him back to last Sunday. But I do think that he has the real idealism of like, I wanna make something that matters, that'll help a lot of people. I've been doing this documentary for CNN about longevity and health and all those people I find to be really moving. But it's not like dumb optimism. Like a lot of the early internet people, like Zuckerberg was always like, What I really wanna build is something to bring the world together. It was all like, We're here for the community. They had like 10 of them that when I immediately got there from the East Coast, I was like, that's a bullshit. These younger people aren't like that. I was glad to do that teaching thing at Michigan, because the problem is these guys, right? It's not the younger people. I do think we've left them with a bag of shit. Both my older sons aren't on social media anymore. I don't think they're unusual. Like my one older son got off a bunch of them, and I said—well, I didn't tell him to do it—so I was like, “Why did you do that?” And he goes, “It makes me feel bad.” A very simple sentence. He understands, and all his friends are like that too. It makes me feel bad too. Well, why do you stay on Twitter, then? I don't want to be there. I don't need to be there. I am curious about you and social media. In particular, I would say that when I see criticism of Kara Swisher, it's usually on social media, and it's something to the effect of, “Kara Swisher was bullish on the industry for too long. Now here she is tearing them down …” “… but she won't answer for her role in X, Y, Z.” Do you pay attention to that? I was writing about their businesses. I think where it comes from is Elon, and I did have great hopes for Elon. I think that's where most of it comes from. I was never nice to Zuckerberg. I was very questioning of all their privacy issues. I was questioning all their sneaky bullshit they did around people's counts. I really did like Steve Jobs. I don't think they were slavish, and I thought they were actually fascinating. I think it's all around Elon. I really was so tired of all these very selfish people like Zuckerberg. I had great hopes when someone was working on cars and climate and really cool stuff. There were a bunch of smart people working on stupid things. So I guess when Steve died, I and others were looking for that, looking for a bigger idea. So yeah, I would cop to that. The idea that I made any of these people is just utter bullshit. If you actually go back and listen to the interviews, they're not as kind as you think they are. When I do the heel turn and I'm like, wait a minute, this is a real problem. I'm quite liberal, but that's my issue with a lot of liberals: When people change, the purity tests are exhausting. For a lot of friends of mine who are conservative, who do not like Trump. That part I'm like, Oh, for fuck's sake. You and your purity test can go fuck yourself. I have to ask you about AI. One of the things we've been covering at WIRED a lot recently are the talent wars, which I am obsessed with just because they are so outrageous and outlandish. I mean, much credit to the reporters who go get these scoops. Can I please make a point? You are so smart in creating narratives, and this is a great one. That was a big narrative for us. But this one is really breathtaking. Who would you rather work for: Sam Altman or Mark Zuckerberg, if they were both offering you a hundred million dollars? How do you differentiate between the two? I think in the times I've spent with Sam, there are touches of normalness. Like he understands his problem better. Mark has no idea about his problems. He doesn't look backwards for one second. I thought when Sam did this whole opt-out thing, I thought that was breathtakingly typical of these people. This AI thing, it's really interesting because I think, didn't AMD just announce another Oracle deal today? I mean the deals are—it's on a daily basis. [Pivot podcast cohost] Scott Galloway and I had said it reminds us of PurchasePro back with AOL. You don't remember this, but AOL did a bunch of deals like this where you give people money and then they'd buy ads on your service. It was called round-tripping at the time. And one of these companies came up to me and said, “Well, you shouldn't call it round-tripping Kara, they're real.” I'm like, Well, nothing's being made here. Like, you're just moving $5 back and forth. And I said, “Would you prefer ‘circle jerk'? I'll use that word if you like, 'cause that's what it feels like.” And salaries are part of that, right? You know, at some point someone's going to be very wealthy from this, and so maybe the bet isn't a bad one. It's just that if everyone's making this bet, especially around talent and investments, someone's going to lose just like they did in the early internet era. Except the profound effect of it is massive, because these are the companies that are holding up the entire stock market. So it has bigger implications. With the salary stuff it's like every time I read a story of yours I'm like, That's insane. My question to you is: From where you sit, what is the there there with AI, what's real in this moment and what is marketing? What's really important about AI is it's a general-purpose technology, right? It's not like you're going from farming to mechanized farming, that's a single device. It's going to effect information people. But in combination, which I think is left out of a lot of this, is robotics plus AI. I think robotics gets no attention. But I'm talking about real robots. They're not gonna look, by the way, like a humanoid robot. A lot of gears, like very, very simple robots that are gonna do everything. So if everything's getting affected, some companies are gonna control quite a lot of everything, right? Then it will take individual companies in those sectors, like insurance or whatever the sector happens to be, medicine—and then they will be the winner of that game. So if you were one of the winners, you'd think the money was well-spent. And if you aren't, then it's just gone. Anyone you're willing to bet on at this stage? I mean, I'm always sort of sitting there going, Is OpenAI Netscape or Google? Everyone thought Netscape hung the fucking moon, and then it just didn't. I suspect Google itself has a lot of advantages. In some areas, Microsoft, not so much Amazon. Apple will sort of ride on everybody's rails. Where does Meta end up in all of this? They have a lot of information. I think [Zuckerberg] is just throwing money at it. Where he could go is advertising. That's an area he certainly can dominate. Well, now I'm interested in talking about journalism with you. Edward [Snowden] is now on your shoulder, just so you know. I'm interested in your assessment of tech journalism and the balance between quote-unquote “access” journalism. Which is essentially where a company, let's say, invites you in. You meet with all their executives, you write something that is tacitly agreed will be a friendly piece versus accountability journalism. I remember 15, 20 years ago, access was really much more the name of the game. Then in the mid-2010s, it really shifted. I'm curious if you think we still need the access part. Is there value in that kind of reporting? As someone who had a lot of access, being at The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, I always felt it was kind of icky, you know what I mean? It wasn't good, and you didn't really get that much out of it. It wasn't really a plus. It was interesting, because we got a lot of access even though we weren't big, 'cause they thought we could hurt them. I don't think access gives you much of anything, because people are leaky as can be these days. I think I kind of perfected that at All Things D, with Yahoo. The joke that I was in the heating ducts and stuff like that. Like getting stuff not from them—getting memos, getting insiders to say what was happening. When I started really doing that more heavily, as opposed to when I was at The Wall Street Journal, everything changed. The power dynamic was very different 'cause you didn't need those people. Like what you guys did with DOGE was sort of classic. I don't think you were hanging around with Elon Musk at all. But you didn't need to, because there were enough sources. As communications have changed, people can text or Signal, and that didn't exist in my earliest days. They had to call you or you had to physically see them. I don't mind having interesting conversations. Like if you guys did a great Big Interview with Tim Cook, I'd be interested in it. Well, if he would say anything, which again, is the issue with access—it's very controlled. I think some of those interviews we did at the Code Conference and All Things D, like Mark's wedding interview was a moment for him. But the more problematic interview was the later one he agreed to do with me about the Holocaust deniers, where I got him to say stuff. After that, I knew I was never gonna get another interview, because something in me is able to get him to say a thing that's the truth, right? For some reason, in our rapport, he seems nervous or whatever it happens to be. So I think all of them looked around and said, “Why should we talk to fucking Kara Swisher, an unlikable bitch? She's always going to bust our chops and not saying how smart we are.” So then they just did their own media. I couldn't do a conference like Code today. They go do their own thing. I mean, as a journalist, it's much more interesting work to be doing. You have to call the company, you have to get the response. But I've noticed lately, I was reading one of your stories, and they didn't get back to you. They don't necessarily feel the need to be in touch. I've noticed that more than anything else, like you call them for a fact and they don't even get back to you now. That seems like a really bad development. Let me ask you this: The New York Times did a story on your podcasting success earlier this year. They had a quote from you that caught my attention. You said, “At the end of this long career, it's like, ‘Oh wow. I made something people really like. '” What caught my attention was the “end of a long career” bit, because it made me think, do you see yourself stopping at any point? Is retirement an appealing option for you? Or maybe you wouldn't characterize it as retirement? You know what happens, I just keep doing really well. So far, everything's worked really well, and every time I make more money, it's sort of weird. Like the podcasting thing worked out rather well for me. It's actually a product I really am proud of. At the same time, one, I think older people should get outta the fucking way for young people. I was thinking I'll write historical novels or, you know, sit in my garden. Like, I'll make honey or something. Scott and I signed another four-year deal with Vox. And I think On is another four-year deal. I suspect maybe one more after that. That was the other thing that was interesting about The New York Times story: the enormous amount of money you stand to make. Because of the deal you made with Vox Media, you're very well-positioned to make a lot of money. I'm less interested in the money itself, although I love that for you, but I'm actually interested in the decision to talk about how much money you make, which I don't think people do enough. I'm just curious about why you did that. Well, you just answered it: Because people don't. We also lose power when we don't say what people aren't making, 'cause a lot of it is bullshit, right? So we already made a lot of money from our last deal. How much money did you make? In that one, um, $25 million, both of us together. So in that case, I had a guarantee of $500,000 for each show. And then if the guarantee wasn't met, you didn't get any more. I don't love guarantees, by the way. I think you shouldn't have guarantees. I get why people do them, but we got a better split by not having the guarantee. So the last one we were getting a guarantee of, this is just for Pivot, each of us $500,000. Vox made it and more. You know, it was so interesting, because a lot of the union people were like, Oh, giving Kara the money. Well, you have a lucrative product. It also makes money to help Vox as a business. They were able to do different and more things. So I just think people should talk about what they make, especially women. If you fuck up, you say, “Oh, that didn't make money.” Like, we did a conference down in Florida. Didn't make money because it was hard. It's hard in the first year. Then we just didn't do it anymore. But most of the things I've done, all of the things I've done, have made money. Well, speaking of making money, you're talking about retiring at 70. What I'm wondering is when, if ever, will you buy The Washington Post from Jeff Bezos? Well, I have a whole plan. Are you still working on this plan? I have an investment banker who's been talking to his people. They are not engaging, and I don't know. Like he has run this thing into the fucking wall. I guess he just doesn't care. I have an idea that will make it break even, like not a really great business, at all, by any means. But I think it's more than that. I have an idea about creator networks and stuff like that, but now it's kind of water under the fucking bridge. If he had actually engaged with me at the time, or people like me. Instead he brings in this terrible CEO, who just soils himself on a daily basis and doesn't want to do anything with it. So it's sort of like, Why are the Ellisons on CBS? Why do the Ellisons want this? They aren't interested in news. This is a cheaper way to get the studios. None of these people care about the news. I happen to care, like an idiot. I think I could do OK and employ people and create really good truthful reporting. It wouldn't be for the money. What role do you see yourself playing in that? I'd probably just be chairman of the board, or maybe editorial director. I don't even need a title. I would get a kick-ass bunch of editors … I have a bunch of people I think would be great at it, but my theory depends more on journalism across the country. A friend of mine is the CEO now. I was speaking in front of his staff. They're trying to redo themselves. They happen to have a nice billionaire who owns them. Very innovative stuff they're trying there. My friend Rene Sanchez is doing this thing in Louisiana that's amazing. There's all this stuff that needs a joint advertising, legal, distribution, video framework. The New York Times, they do all their things really well by themselves, but there's room for someone who brings everything together that has journalistic trust. I think The Post still barely has that. My question for you is, the Ellisons own CBS News now. They have oversight of TikTok and its algorithm. You've got Bezos at The Post. I'm like, Show of hands of people who last watched the CBS Evening News. So what they're buying is curiously problematic. The question, I guess, is where does journalism go from here? I wouldn't rely on broadcast networks as journalism. There's a reason I had you on [my podcast] and others. I'm gonna do one of those every quarter, because I'm so sick of seeing “things don't work.” There's many roads to get to places. So you could do what you're doing, which is taking a storied brand and actually reinvigorating it and trying all manner of different things. I totally see your strategy—what you've done there and it's worked, right? Subscriptions are up, maybe you'll move into something else. I think we would've done rather well. We really literally said that to each other. But we would be exhausted. And it sounds like you're making enough. But someone should do that. Not us, but someone should do that. Speaking of which, we're gonna wrap up. But before we do I'm gonna force you to play a little game. This is like Fuck, Mary, Kill but for nerds. So what piece of tech would you love to control? What would you alt, so alter or change? What would you vanquish from the earth? Just add safety guidelines and have more government regulations. I'm not like one of those doomers, like it's gonna kill us. Control, I think government, so you could reform it so that it was more democratic. I think our form of government, as problematic as it is, has always been the best one. So I would get money outta politics. I would make the Supreme Court bigger. Guess who invented the internet? I think our government is so critical to so many things that it deserves to have a renaissance. Unfortunately, it's been captured by oligarchs and a very coin-operated president. He's the least of my worries. What's the most of your worries? The tech guys, I would say everybody should be. Or just wealthy people in general controlling all of our fates. They do not have our interests at heart, and I worry that they have too much. I think we're gonna get to a point where they're so rich it just will not end well. I mean, it never ended well in the Gilded Age. The Gilded Age people only had the railroads, which were critical, but not everything. That worries me, especially when they have proven themselves to be selfish pricks most of the time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Japanese trade organization that includes heavy-hitting media creators like Studio Ghibli, Square Enix, and Bandai just announced that it sent a letter to OpenAI dated October 28 concerning alleged copyright violations. The letter includes some observations about the similarity of Sora 2 videos to “Japanese content,” and issues two requests: It asks OpenAI not to use CODA content as training data without prior permission, and requests that OpenAI “responds sincerely” when a CODA member complains about copyright issues. Sora 2, OpenAI's top-of-the line text-to-video model was released in late September, and anyone with an interest in AI watched in a mix of amazement and disgust as copyright hell was unleashed immediately. That included a great deal of content that looked a lot like Japanese media properties like Pokemon, Hideo Kojima's video game universes, and some unspecified Studio Ghibli production. The similarity between Sora 2 and Japanese images and video “is the result of using Japanese content as machine learning data,” CODA says. Japan's Copyright Act has a potentially relevant section on AI called Article 30-4 that may shed some light on CODA's logic, and its reason for starting with such a gentle approach to achieving redress—namely that Japan is a permissive legal environment for this sort of thing. According to a government fact sheet on the law, “exploitation for non-enjoyment purposes” such as “AI development or other forms of data analysis may, in principle, be allowed without the permission of the copyright holder.” CODA, however, says that in Japan, “prior permission is generally required for the use of copyrighted works, and there is no system allowing one to avoid liability for infringement through subsequent objections.” Subscribe and interact with our community, get up to date with our customised Newsletters and much more. AWS joins OpenAI's tangled web of dealmaking. The "electrocution" in this analogy is a lawsuit. OpenAI has been catching more heat for alleged copyright infringement, and now companies like Square Enix and Ghibli have put their foot down. Now to Figure Out the Profit Part.</p>
