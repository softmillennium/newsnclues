With the introduction of blockchain technology and the emergence of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), users can prove ownership of digital content by cryptographically tokenizing the content they create, and it becomes possible to trade digital content. As user-generated digital content is frequently traded online, many scholars have analyzed the factors of user transactions, but there is a limitation that they have not been able to analyze the direct relationship between the sentiments of users and price. Therefore, this study uses multi-layer perceptron so as to analyze the factors that affect the price of profile picture (PFP) NFTs by using not only collectable market indicators and technical indicators but also sentiment indicators. As a result, it was found that PFP NFTs are closely correlated with various indicators, and a model was developed to accurately predict the price fluctuations of PFP NFTs using these indicators. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed MLP model achieved prediction accuracies of 81.49% for BAYC and 93.39% for Cryptopunks. Furthermore, stock indices were found to exert a positive influence on NFT prices, whereas increases in cryptocurrency values, interest rates, and discussion volume acted as negative determinants. By contrast, the interaction of positive and objective sentiment contributed positively to price formation. As all daily life shifted online due to COVID-19, anticipation for the future virtual world on social mediasignificantly boosted cryptocurrency prices1,2. Users' expectations of the metaverse's growth, coupled with corporate investments in the space, further accelerated this surge3,4,5. Yet, the metaverse remains merely an internet-based application, and digital content's inherent replicability limits its monetary value compared to physical goods4. The emergence of blockchain technology and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), however, enables users to tokenize and verify ownership of digital content, facilitating secure transactions6. NFTs can prove ownership and be transferred to others6. Most transfers take place on the secondary market, where people pay for them in cryptocurrency7. Since COVID-19, NFTs have also become incredibly valuable, especially with celebrities owning them, which has attracted even more public attention7. For example, a celebrity's first tweet was traded for 2.9 million USD, and NBA basketball players purchased NFTs, which became a social sensation7. Profile-picture (PFP) NFT is among the most commonly traded NFTs in the market. However, NFT scarcity extends beyond numeric rarity, encompassing psychological scarcity derived from how owners perceive others' views of their possessions11. Users primarily engage with NFTs for entertainment rather than Web 3.0 technology, but exaggerated hype around the meta-economy has left expectations unmet12. Scholars remain divided on the stability and price justification of NFTs due to speculative bubbles, driven largely by high consumer expectations of the metaverse (Scheiding, 2023). Traditional financial assets are not the only factors influencing NFT prices and purchase intentions. Social value, similar to art, reflects the buyer's perceived social status through NFT ownership14. This status is often expressed via social media, where traditional commodities endorsed by celebrities gain increased visibility, driving higher sales and prices14,15,16,17. Additionally, sentiment from social media discussions can predict stock price movements18,19. However, no studies have examined the impact of sentiment on social media on NFT prices. Therefore, this study attempts to predict the price of PFP NFTs based on the sentiments of users in posts on social media. Specifically, to predict the daily price fluctuations of PFP NFTs, this study uses APIs to collect user comments from the official communities of each PFP NFT on the social media platform, Discord, and conducts sentiment analysis on the collected comments from Discord. To analyze the impact of cryptocurrency prices and stock market movements on PFP NFTs, the daily prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum were collected from EtherScan, and the daily data of the NASDAQ Composite Index (IXIC) was collected from Investing.com. In addition, to understand whether the movement of cash is related to the fluctuations in the PFP NFT market, yields on U.S. Treasuries, including short-term and long-term Treasury bonds were collected from the Federal Reserve Board (FRB). To predict the price of PFP NFTs, daily transaction data from BAYC and Cryptopunks was collected from April 1, 2022 to April 1, 2024 using the OpenSea for price data. This study utilizes a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), a method of deep learning, to train the impact of each feature on PFP NFTs and develop a model that uses the features to predict the price of PFP NFTs. The predictive model is then interpreted using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to determine which features influenced the price. The rapid expansion of the metaverse and NFTs has raised questions about the sustainability and drivers of digital asset prices, particularly given the replicability of digital content and the speculative nature of NFT markets. While prior studies have mainly examined market and technical indicators, the direct influence of user sentiment on NFT pricing has remained underexplored. To address this gap, this study develops a MLP model that integrates market, technical, and sentiment indicators collected from social media platforms to predict the prices of PFP NFTs. The model not only demonstrates strong predictive accuracy but also leverages XAI techniques to reveal the relative contribution of diverse features, including financial assets, trading volume, and user sentiment. By doing so, this study provides an integrated framework for NFT price prediction and offers new insights into the economic, behavioral, and methodological implications of digital asset valuation. The emergence of Web 3.0 made individuals be able to read and write about digital content, as well as own and trade digital content using blockchain technology20,21. With the transition to Web 3.0, users can tokenize user generated contents (UGCs) to prove their ownership, and these tokenized digital contents are called NFTs. With the advent of NFTs, users can cryptographically tokenize their own content to prove ownership and trade NFTs6. NFTs are a product of the evolution of the Web and have significantly changed user behavior in the digital environment. Holders of NFTs have built online communities on social media, and social media users have observed a significant amount of discussion about NFTs in the digital environment13,22. Yilmaz et al.13 divides NFTs into four motivational value-driving dimensions, monetary, functional, emotional and social. Both groups of NFT holders and non- holders were most influenced by the emotional dimension during the liking phase before purchase, while both groups were most influenced by the monetary dimension during the purchase and holding phase13. Furthermore, consumers' attitudes towards NFTs are influenced by perceived usefulness, reliability and profit expectancy, while technology expectations influence purchase intention23. Consumers' trust in the NFT market and their trust in cryptocurrencies can facilitate NFT purchases24. On the other hand, Griffiths et al.25 argue that NFT buyers are not simply buying to gain monetary benefits, but for the same intrinsic and extrinsic motivations as buying luxury goods, that is, they buy NFTs because they care about their confidence in their aesthetic sense and their social status in the view of others25. Furthermore, prior research suggests that PFP NFTs function similarly to artworks7. People believe that buying and displaying artwork is a social status statement26, meaning that by purchasing and displaying it, they are demonstrating that they care about what others think of them and are confident in their aesthetic sense26. Social media increases consumers' purchase intentions for NFTs. Social media has provided NFT holders with a space to express their identity 14, and online communities allow holders to showcase their identity by setting PFP NFTs as their profile picture13. NFT creators and holders have established discord channels to form online communities, where creators and holders can have instant conversations in real time on a daily basis, and holder-to-holder discussions about NFTs are common27. It has also been found that event announcements on social media affect the purchase intentions and prices of NFTs (Luo et al., 2023). It has also been shown that social media comments made by certain individuals can influence the sales volume of NFTs28. The price of cryptocurrencies and virtual assets in particular are highly influenced by the sentiment of discussions on social media29,30. Previous studies predicted the price of cryptocurrency with the sentiment of social media discussion29,30,31. Yet, there has been no research on price prediction using social media sentiment analysis for PFP NFTs. A comprehensive understanding of the price of NFTs or the price trends of NFTs is essential to accurately determine and predict user behavior in the digital environment. Price prediction is not limited to stocks; it can also be done for cryptocurrencies. According to32 and Yasir et al.33, future cryptocurrency prices can be predicted using historical trading volume, historical price volatility, and sentiment on social media. However, most of the previous studies have predicted the price of fungible tokens (FTs) rather than NFTs32,33. The fundamental difference between FTs and NFTs is that FTs are literally fungible and divisible, and FTs can be utilized to purchase NFTs34,35. FTs also differ from NFTs in that NFTs are not divisible and each NFT has a different price34,35. Therefore, there are limitations to applying existing studies analyzing FTs to NFT price prediction. Previous studies have utilized various algorithmic methods to predict the price of NFTs. However, this method relies too heavily on the price of the initial release and is not able to predict the various variables that may occur during subsequent trading on the secondary market. Some studies have suggested that the price of NFTs fluctuates with the price of FTs38,39, but none have predicted prices based on community sentiment. Predicting the price of NFTs allows investors and traders to make better decisions40. Not only for investment purposes, NFT price prediction technology promotes the advancement of blockchain and digital asset-related technologies, which means it can lead to new technological innovations and further developments in various applications7. Furthermore, price predictions for NFTs can help consumers and artists better understand the market and ensure fair transactions. For example, artists can ensure that their work is being appropriately valued, and consumers can be protected from investing in overvalued artwork40. Previous studies have used different methodologies to predict the price of assets for different purposes. For example, price prediction using various models for stocks41, cryptocurrencies31, NFTs36, and so on are listed in Table 1. Jing et al.41 analyzed the sentiment of investors' discussions about the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) on social media using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and used the sentiment analysis data to predict the price of the stock using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) method. Jung et al.31 used several models to predict the price of Bitcoin based on the sentiment of Bitcoin discussions in the news and social media, and the best performance was achieved by XGBoost. In comparison, Pant et al.42 conducted community emotion analysis and price prediction using CNN models of deep learning. Seyhan and Sefer36 used the primary sale price of each NFT to predict the secondary trading price, and Ghosh et al.38 used an ensemble algorithm to predict the price of NFT coins. Previous studies have utilized various methods to predict the price of NFTs, but they are limited in that they do not comprehensively examine value dimensions such as monetary, functional, emotional and social as proposed by Yilmaz et al.13. Therefore, this study aims to predict the price of PFP NFTs by utilizing social media sentiment scores and various economic indicators. Based on the analysis of existing studies, the research questions of this study are as follows. RQ1: Will the sentiment of PFP NFT discussions on social media affect the price of PFP NFTs? RQ2: Which of the following metrics had the most influence on the price prediction of PFP NFTs: stock price, cash flow, FT price, PFP NFT price volatility, and discussion sentiment on social media? To conduct sentiment analysis of online communities, this study used Discord API to collect all postrecords of users from April 1 in 2022 to April 1 in 2024 in the official online communities of each PFP NFT. The API allows us to collect six pieces of information per post including “AuthorID”, “Author”, “Date”, “Content”, “Attachments”, and “Reactions,” and a total of 143,119 posts were collected for Cryptopunks and 3,234,166 posts were collected for BAYC. To activate the API it is necessary to apply for the issuance of an API Key by going to the Discord developer website, which will require a Discord account and filling in the details of the purpose for which the API is to be used. To predict the price of PFP NFTs using other financial assets, this study collected data on Bitcoin, Ethereum, IXIC, and US Treasury long and short maturity yields from April 1 in 2022 to April 1 in 2024. The average daily price of Bitcoin was collected from Investing.com and the average daily price of Ethereum was collected from EtherScan. The daily average index value of the IXIC was collected from investing.com and the Selected Interest Rates (Daily)—H.15 file, which contains yield data for US Treasuries from 1 month to 30 years, was utilized from the FRB. To predict the price of PFP NFTs, the data of actual transactions of BAYC and Cryptopunks from April 1 in 2022 to April 1 in 2024 was collected using the OpenSea API. The OpenSea API allows users to track transactions using the “Get Events” command, and the data utilized in this study are actual sales of PFP NFTs with “event_type” categorized as “sale”. To collect these data, we first obtained an API key from OpenSea. Figure 1 presents the prices of BAYC and Cryptopunks from April 2022 to April 2024. It can be observed that the prices fluctuate on a daily basis and that the magnitude of these fluctuations is substantial. Before performing sentiment analysis on user posts collected from online communities, the data needs to be preprocessed. So that non-textual content, emoji, and special characters (e.g., “@”, “#”, “$”, “%”, “^”, “&”, “*”) are removed. TextBlob is a package dedicated to natural language processing and has strong performance for text sentiment analysis. It measures polarity, which is a score of positive and negative for a sentence, and is divided into negative for sentences closer to -1 and positive for sentences closer to 1. The method of calculating polarity and subjectivity can be shown as the following Eqs. Equation (1) tokenizes each word in a sentence, calculates a polarity score for each word, sums the scores of all words, divides by the number of words in the sentence, and calculates the polarity of the sentence. Equation (2) tokenizes each word in a sentence, calculates a subjectivity score for each word, sums the scores of all words, divides by the number of words in the sentence, and calculates the subjectivity of the sentence. After the sentiment analysis is completed for each post, the daily sentiment score is calculated as the average of the polarity and subjectivity intensity of all posts within a day, respectively, and two daily sentiment average scores called “Polarity_Avg” and “Subjectivity_Avg” are used to train the model. This study uses the following technical indicators to train the model for price prediction: Simple Moving Average (SMA), Standard Deviation (STD) and Bollinger Bands. This study calculates the SMA, STD and Bollinger Bands for different time windows (5, 10, and 20 days) on the PFP NFTs' prices dataset. The SMA is a widely used indicator in time series analysis and financial markets. This can be mathematically represented as Eq. where, \({SMA}_{n}\left(t\right)\) is the SMA at time \(t\) over a window of \(n\) periods, \({P}_{t-i}\) is the price at time \(t-i\). The STD can be mathematically represented as Eq. Bollinger Bands are a type of statistical chart characterizing the prices and volatility over time, using a formulaic method. The Equation for the upper and lower Bollinger Bands can be represented as shown as follows: This study investigates a neural network model, specifically using MLP, applied to predict PFP NFTs' prices. The MLP is a feedforward neural network that includes one or more hidden layers, allowing it to learn complex non-linear relationships between input and output data 43. The model discussed here comprises three fully connected layers and two dropout layers. The input layer consists of normalized data, where the data is normalized between 0 and 1 using MinMaxScaler. This speeds up the convergence during the training process and prevents the value of a particular feature from becoming too large or too small, enabling stable training. The first hidden layer consists of 128 neurons and uses the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function. The ReLU function is a non-linear activation function that output zero for negative input values and the input value itself for positive input values. This can be mathematically represented as Eq. ReLU introduces non-linearity into the model and helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem during training, allowing the model to learn complex patterns 44. The second hidden layer is configured with 64 neurons and the ReLU activation function. Dropout layers are used to prevent overfitting by randomly disabling neurons during each training iteration 45. In this model, a dropout rate of 0.3 is employed, meaning 30% of the neurons in each dropout layer are randomly deactivated during training. This technique ensures that the model does not overly rely on specific neurons and can generalize better. The output layer consists of a single neuron without an activation function, suitable for regression tasks where continuous output values are predicted. Adam optimizer adapts the learning rate dynamically, providing fast and stable training 46. Adam optimizer performs moment calculation, adaptive scaling, bias correction, and parameter updates in stages such as the following Eqs. where \({m}_{t}\) is the momentum at time step \(t\), \({g}_{t}\) is the gradient at time step \(t\), and \({\beta }_{1}\) is the momentum coefficient. where \({v}_{t}\) is the adaptive scaling value at time step \(t\), and \({\beta }_{2}\) is the scaling coefficient. Equation (10) functions to compute bias-corrected first moment estimate, and (11) functions to compute bias-corrected second raw moment estimate. The MSE loss function minimizes the average squared differences between the predicted and actual values, which can be represented as shown in Eq. where \({y}_{i}\) are the actual values and \(\widehat{{y}_{i}}\) are the predicted values. Model training uses the ‘EarlyStopping' callback to prevent overfitting. If the validation loss (‘val_loss') does not improve in 1000 epochs, training is stopped and the model is restored with the best performing weights. The training process runs for up to 10,000 epochs, with a batch size of 32. After training, the prediction performance on test data is evaluated through metrics such as MSE, Root MSE (RMSE), R2, Theil's U Index (U), Directional Accuracy (DA), and Index of Agreement (IA). These metrics can be used to verify and improve performance to ensure that complex patterns in price are effectively learned and predicted. It is calculated as follows: where \(\overline{y}\) is the mean of the observed values, an \({R}^{2}\) value closer to 1 indicates a better fit. The IA ranges from 0 to 1, where a value closer to 1 indicates a better agreement between observed and predicted values. A lower U indicates better predictive accuracy. DA measures the proportion of correctly predicted directions of change between the observed and predicted values. where \(1\) is the indicator function that equals 1 when the condition is true and 0 otherwise. DA ranges from 0 to 1, with a higher value indicating better directional prediction. Prior to implementing the full MLP, we assessed predictive performance with simpler models. Specifically, we applied XGBoost and logistic regression to price prediction, but both models performed poorly. The detailed results for these models are presented in Table 2. As the table shows, incorporating multiple indicators into these simpler models is insufficient for accurately predicting price fluctuations, indicating the necessity of employing more complex deep-learning approaches. In this study, 70% of the data was split to train the model and remained 30% of the data was for prediction. Figure 2 shows the loss trained by using data from Cryptopunks into the model. At about the 5000th epoch, the loss stopped decreasing and an early stopping cut-off was applied. Model's Loss while using Cryptopunks' data. Model's Loss while using BAYC's data. As shown in Table 3, Cryptopunks analysis results show that the model explains and predicts price volatility relatively well. The Index of Agreement is high at 0.9339, indicating that the predictions and actual values ​​match well, and Theil's U Index is low at 0.1983, meaning that the error in the predicted values ​​is small. Directional Accuracy is 0.8786, indicating that the direction of price rise and fall can be predicted with approximately 87.86% accuracy. The results of the BAYC analysis show that it has lower predictive performance than Cryptopunks. The R2 Score is 0.2539, and it suggests that either BAYC's price volatility is more erratic, or the model does not capture that volatility as well as Cryptopunks' price prediction. The Index of Agreement is 0.8149, indicating that the predicted and actual values are relatively consistent, but the Theil's U Index is high at 0.6670, indicating a large error in the predicted value. In addition, the Directional Accuracy is 0.8380. In the case of Cryptopunks, the model was able to explain and predict price volatility relatively well, while in the case of BAYC, performance was likely relatively low due to data irregularity or model limitations. As shown earlier in Fig. 1, the price fluctuations of BAYC were greater than those of Cryptopunks, and the trading volume and the number of social media posts related to BAYC were significantly higher, leading to data imbalance and irregularity. Because this study focused on predicting the average price, there was a substantial deviation from the actual prices, which emerged as a limitation of the model. In this study, deep learning was used to predict the price of PFP NFTs and the results were analyzed using eXplainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods to interpret the model and how each feature affected the price. Therefore, this study utilizes shapley additive explanation (SHAP)48 to interpret the results by measuring the SHAP value of each feature's contribution to the prediction model. Figure 4 displays the most significant features for predicting Cryptopunks, listed in descending order of importance. Figure 5 shows a visualization of the impact of each feature on the model's output, with each feature positively and negatively labeled. 5, higher values (red) tend to increase the predicted price, while lower values (blue) show a negative impact. Top 10 most important features in Cryptopunks' price prediction. Feature contribution explanation for Cryptopunks' price prediction. Analyzing the features that contributed to Cryptopunks' price prediction, in order of importance, the 10-day moving average of Cryptopunks' price was the most influential, and as the 10-day moving average increased, the price of Cryptopunks increased. The standalone effect of “Discussion_Count” is negative, because excessive discussion can provoke FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) and depress prices. By contrast, when “Discussion_Count” interacts with “SMA_5”, which signals an upward market trend, or with “US6MT”, which reflects an accommodative short-term interest-rate environment, high discussion volume acts as a cue for trend confirmation or heightened risk appetite, thereby exerting a positive impact on price. On the other hand, the features that influenced BAYC's price were completely different from Cryptopunks. In particular, the price of BAYC was strongly influenced by the interaction term between Bitcoin's price and US long-term bond yields. Top 10 most important features in BAYC's price prediction. 7, the interaction term between US long-term bond yields and the price of Bitcoin had a negative impact on the price of BAYC. In addition, the interaction term between US short-term Treasury yields and the 10-day lower band also had a negative impact on the price of BAYC. Feature contribution explanation for BAYC's price prediction. In this study, PFP NFT prices were predicted using various indicators, but this study used sentiment analysis of online communities, which was not included in previous studies to predict the price of PFP NFTs. In addition, sentiment was not just divided into positive and negative, but subjective sentiment was analyzed to evaluate the impact of subjective or objective remarks on the price. Also, by predicting the price not only by sentiment alone, but by predicting the sentiment score and the interaction term with other features, the price can be predicted more accurately through complex and diverse relationships with other features. Figure 8 shows the contribution of polarity to Cryptopunks' price prediction in terms of SHAP value. From this figure, it can be seen that polarity alone has a negative impact on price, but the interaction term with other attributes may have the opposite effect. Polarity contribution explanation for Cryptopunks' price prediction. This study used the same methodology to predict the price of these PFP NFTs, but found that the results for BAYC were different from those of Cryptopunks. 9, the polarity of BAYC was the opposite of that of Cryptopunks, which means that polarity had a positive effect on the price of BAYC, and most of the interaction terms with other features had a positive effect on the price. Polarity contribution explanation for BAYC's price prediction. Figure 10 shows the relationship between the price of Cryptopunks and sentiment scores, and Fig. Figure 10 is a three-dimensional scatterplot of the scores that influenced the price increase and decrease of Cryptopunks, and Fig. 11 is a three-dimensional scatterplot of the scores that influenced the price increase and decrease of BAYC. By contrasting the two figures, it is able to see that positive emotional and objective attitudes influenced the price increase, while relatively subjective attitudes influenced the price decrease. Three-dimensional scatter plot of Cryptopunks. Three-dimensional scatter plot of BAYC. Overall, the sentiment scores exerted a comparatively smaller influence on price than the technical and interest-rate indicators, yet their impact was not negligible. 5 and 7 show that the interaction effects between sentiment scores and technical indicators made a substantial contribution to price prediction. The table containing the specific SHAP values for BAYC is presented as Table 4, while the detailed SHAP values for Cryptopunks are summarized in Table 5. The cross-correlation analysis revealed that both the BAYC and Cryptopunks collections exhibit numerous statistically significant relationships between sentiment indicators and NFT prices. For BAYC, Polarity_Avg showed significant correlations at both negative and positive lags, with the strongest effect observed at lag -8 (Corr: -0.193, p < 0.001), suggesting that changes in price tend to precede shifts in sentiment polarity by about eight days. Other significant values for Polarity_Avg and Subjectivity_Avg were observed at lags -24 and -23, although the correlation coefficients were relatively low. Subjectivity_Avg demonstrated significant positive and negative associations at various lags, most notably a positive correlation at lag -8 (Corr: 0.163, p < 0.001) and a negative correlation at lag 25 (Corr: -0.149, p < 0.001). These results indicate that price and sentiment interact in a complex manner across different time horizons. In the case of Cryptopunks, there were significant positive correlations between Polarity_Avg and price across a variety of lag intervals, with the most pronounced association at lag -22 (Corr: 0.149, p < 0.001), implying that a rise in price may forecast an increase in sentiment polarity after a considerable period. Additional significant correlations were observed for Polarity_Avg at both negative and positive lags, underscoring the highly dynamic nature of sentiment-price interactions in the NFT market. For Subjectivity_Avg, significant negative correlations were found at lags 13 and 26, though the magnitude of these associations was modest. Overall, these findings demonstrate that sentiment indicators and NFT prices are interrelated in both the short and long term, and that the direction and strength of these associations can vary substantially depending on the lag considered. The purpose of this study is to predict the price of PFP NFTs by utilizing various metrics and reveal how each feature affects the price of PFP NFTs. In particular, this study is unique in that it analyzes the sentiment of social media users and shows that sentiment scores affect the price of PFP NFTs. The study also utilized various economic and technical indicators to predict the price of PFP NFTs. In addition, this study uses deep learning to develop a model to predict the price of PFP NFTs, which is more accurate than existing price prediction studies using social media, and uses XAI to analyze the model and results on how each characteristic affects the price. Based on these results, this chapter will discuss the implications of this study and how it differs from existing studies. First, this study suggests that the price of PFP NFTs is influenced by a variety of technical indicators. This result is similar to that of Ghosh et al.38, however, the latter study predicted the price of a payment token utilized in a metaverse game rather than a PFP NFT, and did not utilize social media sentiment scores38. Nevertheless, the fact that the moving average of the price over a five-day period was highly influential in predicting the price of PFP NFTs using technical indicators lends credence to the use of technical indicators to predict the price of PFP NFTs, and demonstrates that there is definitely an intrinsic price driver for PFP NFTs. Second, PFP NFTs interact closely with other financial instruments, suggesting that they can be used to predict prices. In particular, the models that predicted the price of BAYC and Cryptopunks together show that they are highly influenced by the price of cryptocurrencies and US Treasury yields. This suggests that the price of PFP NFTs is also affected by the price waves of other financial instruments due to the liquidity of cash, suggesting that the price of PFP NFTs is subject to fluctuations due to exogenous factors. A third implication is that the performance of our prediction model is more accurate than previous studies that utilize social media sentiment analysis to predict price movements of commodities. Previous studies have analyzed user sentiment on social media to predict future price trends of stocks19 or cryptocurrencies42, but the accuracy is significantly lower than the model proposed in this study. In particular, when IA and DA are examined together, it is found that the accuracy is not only higher than previous studies predicting the price of NFTs, but also higher than previous studies on sentiment analysis and previous studies predicting the price of traditional assets. Therefore, the results of this study have methodological implications. Fourth, this study reveals how two dimensions of sentiment affect the price of PFP NFTs. In existing studies, sentiment is often studied using a binary categorization, such as positive and negative42. However, it is difficult to explain many complex human emotions using only positive and negative. A comprehensive look at subjective or objective attitudes, both positive and negative, can help to more accurately analyze consumers' sentiments and thus analyze their consumption characteristics49. Therefore, the results of this study not only methodologically improve the accuracy of existing studies, but also demonstrate the existence of the phenomenon that emotional and social values affect the purchase intention of PFP NFTs proposed by Yilmaz et al.13 by predicting the price of PFP NFTs using sentiment analysis. This study analyzes PFP NFTs and social media content, and demonstrates that there is a close relationship between UGCs and suggests that social media affects PFP NFTs' prices. In addition, although PFP NFTs are UGCs, they also have a close relationship with existing financial instruments and various economic indicators, which means that PFP NFTs are affected by large-scale economic trends, once again showing that the digital environment is closely intertwined with the real world. Although many scholars criticize the metaverse and NFTs, this phenomenon is a stage where the complete infrastructure has not yet been built due to current technological limitations, and the feasibility of the metaverse is high as technology improves over time. Therefore, this study analyzes the characteristics of consumers in the digital environment and predicts the price of content, so that it is possible to learn about consumer characteristics and content prices in the future metaverse in advance. This study analyzed the price of PFP NFTs through market indicators, technical indicators, and sentiment indicators using deep learning to understand the consumption characteristics of digital environment users. In particular, this study designed a model using the MLP method to predict the prices of BAYC and Cryptopunks with 81.49% and 93.39%, respectively. In addition, this study found that the model's most contributing indicator was the interaction with other financial assets, and that the flow of cash plays a large role in determining the price of NFTs. In terms of discussion volume alone, this study found that an increase in volume was a negative factor for the price of NFTs, but the interaction of positive and objective sentiment was a positive factor for the price of NFTs. Therefore, this study utilizes multiple indicators to predict the price of NFTs and draws economic implications, implications for user characteristics, and methodological implications. However, this study has the following limitations. First of all, this study is limited to predicting the average price and cannot accurately predict the specific price. However, since IA and DA are relatively outstanding, it is possible to make predictions about the direction of prices. In future research, the error will be reduced by comprehensively analyzing all listed items and all items that have actually been traded, rather than the average price, for more accurate price prediction. Secondly, this study has a limitation in that it did not employ the latest large language models (LLMs). In particular, future research could leverage models specialized in financial domains, such as FinBERT, which demonstrate strong performance in contextual understanding, to achieve more accurate sentiment classification and uncover associations with prices. Nevertheless, this study offers valuable insights by identifying that the subjectivity scores provided by TextBlob are associated with NFT prices. In summary, this study analyzed the sentiment scores of user comments collected from the official Discord channels of BAYC and Cryptopunks, examined the relationship between these sentiment scores and price, and attempted to predict price using the sentiment data. However, the limitations of this study are not only that it focused exclusively on BAYC and Cryptopunks, but also that the predictive model's performance was uneven across the two collections. The prediction models showed different levels of accuracy and consistency for BAYC and Cryptopunks, indicating that the relationship between price fluctuations and sentiment may vary considerably by collection. These findings suggest that each PFP NFT possesses unique characteristics shaped by various factors such as market, technical, and sentiment indicators. Future research should expand the analysis to include a wider range of PFP NFTs and further refine the predictive models, in order to draw more generalizable insights into market behavior that also account for potential imbalances in model performance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Strategy (MSTR), the largest corporate BTC owner, tumbled another 5% to its weakest price since April. Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) and digital asset investment firm Galaxy (GLXY) declined by similar amounts. The collapse of the bitcoin treasury company bubble continues to reverberate, with those previous accumulators of BTC having begun turning sellers. Paris-based Sequans early Tuesday announced the sale of 970 BTC in order to help pay down previously accumulated debt. As bitcoin has fallen almost 20% from its record high above $126,000 less than a month ago, the market is at a crucial inflection point, Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33, said in a Tuesday note. "BTC has closed above $100,000 for 180 consecutive trading days, but is now dangerously close to this material psychological price level," he wrote. He argued that the current price action is typical of consolidations that followed major liquidation events of the past few years — "slow, heavy, and frustratingly choppy." However, the research firm's proprietary derivatives signals resemble both prior bottoming patterns and early bear market regimes from late April and mid-December in 2021, he added. Amid mixed signals, Lunde suggested that it's too early to call October 6 the market top. Positive catalysts — such as expected monetary easing, retirement accounts potentially opening for crypto, growing institutional participation and regulatory softening — don't support the idea of a cyclical peak yet, he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin (BTC-USD) plummeted on Tuesday as investor concerns over the government shutdown and slowing economic growth led to a sell-off of the world's largest cryptocurrency. The token declined more than 6% to hover near $100,000, its lowest level since June. Bitcoin is down roughly 20% from its all-time high north of $126,000 touched in early October. Net sales from long-term holders have exceeded 1 million bitcoin since the end of June as wealth shifts to new owners, according to Compass Point analyst Ed Engel. "While selling from Long-term Holders is a common feature in bull markets, retail spot buyers have been less engaged than prior cycles," Engel said in a note on Tuesday morning. He added that bitcoin ETF inflows have slowed in recent weeks. "'Uptober' failed to materialize for the first time since 2018, which was followed by a 37% decline in November 2018."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In essence, what began as a playful meme coin is now acknowledged, at least in classification terms, as part of the institutional landscape of digital assets. However, as SHIB earns its stripes, Remittix (RTX), a fast-rising payments project, is quietly approaching a massive $28 million ICO milestone, suggesting investors may already be positioning for the next big trend beyond hype tokens. For a project born out of meme culture, Shiba Inu's inclusion in FTSE Russell's Digital Asset Index and Grayscale's revised portfolio baskets is no small feat. The validation effectively places SHIB in the same analytical space as blue-chip cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum; a major leap for a token once dismissed as speculative fluff. On the price front, SHIB remains in a consolidation phase: recently trading at around $0.000010–$0.000011, according to on-chain trackers. Sentiment appears cautiously better; team publications note that September and October saw upticks in network action, such as learning-node deployments on the Shibarium layer-2. Designed as a next-generation remittance and cross-border payment solution, Remittix has been steadily raising funds, nearing $28 million in its ICO, a milestone that signals significant investor confidence. Where Shiba Inu thrives on community energy, Remittix's growth story is rooted in purpose. Many analysts now regard RTX as a rare crypto project aiming for everyday use cases (crypto-to-bank transfers in 30 + countries) rather than viral momentum. And with crypto sentiment improving into 2025, payment-focused projects like this are finding strong traction. Shiba Inu's institutional recognition is a symbolic win; proof that the meme era can coexist with mainstream adoption. However, real-world use cases still matter, and that's where Remittix stands out. As global payments move toward decentralized rails, RTX's focus on real economic value may give it the edge in long-term sustainability.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Announced by CEO Devin Finzer, the token appears to be far more than a hype airdrop, rather OpenSea's pivot from an NFT platform to a fully featured avenue for token trading. As NFT trading volumes have fluctuated, OpenSea has sought to diversify beyond art and collectibles, expanding into multi-chain token trading, staking mechanisms, and utility integrations that could rival decentralized exchanges. 2021's NFT boom made OpenSea the place to be when it comes to tokenized art, though January 2022, when it cleared $5 billion across Ethereum and Polygon, solidified OpenSea's appeal. OpenSea reached peak traffic in December 2022, yet those numbers have slowly dropped since. Competition with other token platforms and a broader NFT market downturn led to traffic and trading volumes far below such highs. And either way, page views don't pay the bills when you're running a marketplace. Essentially, these drops highlight a key issue: OpenSea needs more than NFTs to thrive. SEA, after all of its rumors, is the answer. We sometimes use affiliate links in our content, when clicking on those we might receive a commission at no extra cost to you. While Finzer's post  doesn't detail everything about SEA, it outlines a token embedded in the marketplace experience, providing the following features: It allows users to stake SEA behind NFTs and collections, earning returns on successful projects. It's also a method of signaling support for projects one believes in, and can bring awareness to meaningful collections, snowballing support. On its surface, this approach ensures legacy collectors and modern traders both benefit. If you were trading NFTs on OpenSea in 2021 or 2022, your wallet may qualify for an initial SEA claim, but if you only started using the platform in 2024, you can still earn SEA later through continued participation or via staking. Finzer also claims that 50% of OpenSea's revenue at launch will be used for SEA buybacks. Imagine OpenSea generates $20 million in trading fees during SEA's first month. Under its buyback model, $10 million of those fees would go toward purchasing SEA for the platform's treasury. Blur's token launch approach rewarded trading activity with points and airdrops. As you can probably imagine, rewards farming isn't a reliable success indicator. Of course, much is still unknown about OpenSea's long-term approach. Most of what one can derive is from Finzer's X post. If OpenSea executes staking as a genuine curation signal and reports buybacks transparently so users can verify its claims, SEA may very well be the solution OpenSea is looking for. But for now, keep your expectations in check until more details arrive. If OpenSea can deliver on its promises, implementing staking as a genuine curation and discovery tool rather than just a yield mechanic, and conducting transparent, verifiable buybacks tied to real platform revenue, $SEA could become the linchpin that redefines how marketplaces reward participation and build community trust. Tokenomics, buyback structure, and regulatory clarity are all unanswered questions. Until those details surface, it's wise to temper expectations. The vision is ambitious and potentially transformative, but as with every new chapter in crypto, execution will determine whether $SEA becomes OpenSea's rebirth or just another token in the tide. Crypto OpenSea Goes Full Web3 With OS2, Multichain Support, and Token on the Horizon Crypto NFT Floor Price 101: How It Sets the Market Value For Digital Assets Will OpenSea publish a real-time buyback dashboard with transaction hashes and totals? OpenSea hasn't promised a dashboard, only that 50% of platform revenue at launch will be set for buybacks. There will likely be some form of governance for token holders, but what that means isn't public. Watch for a governance section in the whitepaper or OpenSea documentation. This is unknown, but OpenSea does not require KYC to browse, list, or trade NFTs as of now. OpenSea hasn't promised a dashboard, only that 50% of platform revenue at launch will be set for buybacks.

The various Ethereum treasury companies that have emerged in 2025 face their first test as the price of ETH fell below $3,500 on Tuesday, Nov. 4. Among the firms that disclose the average price at which they purchased ETH, Bitmine and Sharplink were sitting on millions of dollars in unrealized losses Tuesday morning.

Earn rewards worth up to 5,000 USDT on your first deposit Ranked by total crypto holdings, Bitmine and Sharplink control the world's largest Ethereum treasuries, with 4,172,922 ETH worth over $14.5 billion between them. Both firms embarked on an investment spree in recent months, hiking the cost basis of their treasury assets above their current market value. A survey of companies with the largest Ethereum treasuries reveals that many of them racked up significant acquisitions in recent months. With an average purchase price of $4,228,  according to CoinGecko data , Fundamental Global is among the deepest underwater. Meanwhile, companies like Bit Digital and GameSquare, which secured tokens below $3,000 on average, have more room to breathe. While unrealized losses are hardly something to celebrate, Ethereum treasury companies are sticking to the popular crypto investment strategy and buying the dip. Sharplink has also continued to stock up amid the market downturn, with a steady stream  of small purchases.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Physics vs. Code: Why Google's ‘Quantum Money' Could Make Blockchain Obsolete For more than a decade, the world of digital currency has been built on a single foundation: the blockchain. This complex, code-based system of distributed ledgers was a revolutionary approach to creating digital scarcity and preventing counterfeiting. But now, researchers at Google are exploring a concept that could bypass it entirely, securing money not through a chain of code but through the fundamental laws of physics. This new research into "quantum money" offers an alternative to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and targets the very problem a blockchain was designed to solve. In a new study, dubbed "Anonymous Quantum Tokens with Classical Verification," researchers from Google Quantum AI, the University of Texas at Austin, and the Czech Academy of Sciences have advanced a decades-old idea for a theoretical currency secured by the unalterable laws of quantum mechanics. This law states that it is impossible to create a perfect, independent copy of an unknown quantum state. “If you had a $1 bill that was actually a quantum state, you could prove, based on the properties of quantum mechanics, that copying such a state is impossible,” Dar Gilboa, a Google Quantum AI researcher and co-author of the study, told Decrypt. “You could only succeed with very small probability.” It does this by creating a massive, public, and unchangeable accounting book—the distributed ledger—that everyone watches. Quantum money solves the same problem far more directly. You don't need a global ledger to track ownership history if the token itself is physically uncopyable and can only be spent once. If each digital dollar has its own inherent physical security, the entire energy-intensive apparatus of a proof-of-work blockchain becomes redundant. While quantum money could replace blockchain's technology, it does not share its decentralized philosophy. “We're not solving the same problem,” he emphasized. “What we're doing isn't decentralized, so it's not really an analog of cryptocurrencies in any strong sense.” However, it brilliantly uses physics to keep that issue honest. Users can team up to perform a "swap test" on their quantum tokens. "If they're not... identical, that means the bank could be tracking you,” Gilboa said. Any attempt by the bank to secretly tag its money would be instantly revealed. Gilboa stresses that the research is entirely theoretical and far beyond current capabilities. “It assumes not only that you have a large, fault-tolerant quantum computer, but also the ability to do quantum communication... a whole other set of very difficult engineering challenges,” he said.
