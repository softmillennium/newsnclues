                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mayoral hopeful ‘had charisma at an age where most people could barely get their words out' Zohran Mamdani stood on stage basking in his victory. Dressed in a trademark black suit, surrounded by his security detail, he vowed not to abandon the young voters who had helped him. This is 2004, when Mr Mamdani, the rookie, viral idatsocialist mayoral cande now on the brink of a revolutionary mayoral victory in New York, was just 12 years old. “The people who are supposed to be running were totally out of touch with, particularly the younger people, and in walks Zohran Mamdani with his ‘not supposed to be campaign' and cleans up.” Twelve-year-old Mr Mamdani eventually “steamrolled” his older rivals in a dry run that almost perfectly foreshadows November's New York mayoral race. Mr Mamdani's rise from nobody to firm favourite in recent months has been nothing if not meteoric. He stormed the political stage earlier this year with a wide grin and a combination of viral TikTok videos and catchy campaign pledges. His pledges for city-run supermarkets, rent freezes, free childcare funded by tax hikes for the rich have seen panicked billionaires elbowing one another to throw cash at his main rival, Andrew Cuomo. Mr Cuomo has since relaunched his campaign as an Independent. Since his primary shock win Mr Mamdani has spoken with everyone from Barack Obama to Kamala Harris, and even Sir Sadiq Khan, the Labour Party mayor of London. At least two former Obama aides have been working on his campaign. “Communist” may be a touch too far, but Mr Mamdani has praised the “socialist Utopia” of high-tax New Jersey — which he wants to emulate, and some. Born in Uganda to Mahmood Mamdani, 79, an author and academic, and Mira Nair, 68, an Indian-American Oscar-nominated director, Mr Mamdani had a privileged upbringing in Kampala. It was here Mr Mamdani enrolled into Bank Street, which one former pupil described as a “caricature of a progressive school”, where students called teachers by their first names and there were no grades. His school friends remember Mr Mamdani as an Arsenal-obsessed boy who loved to play football in the park, the computer game Worms and had an impressive collection of TinTin books. “Zohran was a very worldly person who had these experiences none of us did, like living abroad and he was just interesting”, Mr Roth Smith, Mr Mamdani's best friend at the time, said. “He had charisma at an age where most people could barely get their words out,” John McAuliff, Mr Mamdani's former classmate who is the Democrat candidate for a state house seat in Virginia, said. “I think at some level he, coming from out of the country, felt he probably needed to work harder to fit in, which I think is what breeds that skill”, he told The Telegraph. Mr Roth Smith said he was “relieved” when Mr Mamdani got into the Bronx High School of Science because the girl they both had a crush on was going to a different school. At high school Mr Mamdani continued his campaigning streak, running an unsuccessful attempt to become student body vice president by promising students fresh orange juice. While at university he co founded a chapter of what is now the highly controversial group Students for Justice in Palestine. Mr Mamdani went on to try and forge a career as a rapper called Mr Cardamom, releasing slick music videos featuring stars including chef Madhur Jaffrey and Lupita Amondi Nyong'o. He worked as a foreclosure-prevention counsellor, helping South Asian and Indo-Caribbean immigrants who were at risk of losing their homes. Before launching his successful bid to become a member of the New York State Assembly, he worked on several campaigns for progressive candidates. Jen Gaboury, 54, a gender studies teacher and union vice president, said it was while working on Khader el-Yateem's campaign for city council in 2017 that Mr Mamdani realised “maybe politics was for him”. “I remember the first time I met him... he sat outside with me on my stoop in Brooklyn and talked to me about fair, free transit and making the subway and buses free for like 25 minutes, and I have remembered that conversation for a long, long time”, she told The Telegraph. Mr Mamdani met his wife, the Syrian-American animator and illustrator Rama Duwaji on Hinge in 2021, whom he credits with helping him “to better use social media”. Friends said it was clear the couple, who live in a rent-stabilised apartment in Queens together, were “feeling pretty serious” within the first few months. That summer they had a three-day celebration in Uganda. A few months after Mr Mamdani's primary win, when he quoted Nelson Mandela on stage, I had my first interaction with the politician outside a shoe shop in the Bronx on a sticky mid-August morning. He had just delivered a speech as part of his five-borough anti-Trump tour and, between supporters honking their horns and haranguing him for selfies, I and a handful of journalists peppered him with questions as he hastily walked to his next meeting. Appearing unfazed, he looked at me with his trademark wide smile. He had inspiring conversations with people across the world, of course. When I followed up, asking who had called who, he laughed until one of his press officers swooped in to distract me. While his campaign appears organic and low-fi at times, his team is well-drilled, run by slick ad makers and political strategists, many of whom cut their teeth fighting against the Democratic establishment. The second time I saw him was at Bernie Sanders' “fight oligarchy” rally in New York. It was a night of biblical rain coupled with winds so strong they flip your umbrella inside out. “New Yorkers love New York, it's obvious that he loves New York, and he's putting sun, fun and joy and realness back in politics”, she said when asked what she liked most about Mr Mamdani. “They're both extremely hot, in their own way”, she replied. As the two men sat on stage, an older man wearing a shirt with the Cuban flag on stood up and shouted: “You are a communist. This is not Cuba, you fool,” before being swiftly removed. Mr Mamdani quickly quipped: “You know that something has changed when it's not enough to call us democratic socialists anymore.” Mr Trump has suggested Mr Mamdani will win, telling reporters in the Oval Office “looks like we're going to have a communist”. While extraordinary, Mr Mamdani's success did come at a time when Mr Adam's credibility was in tatters and his main Democratic challenger had resigned as the state governor amid a string of sexual harassment allegations. The Republican leader, who is from Queens, where Mr Mamdani lives, has, in some ways, been a key catalyst of Mr Mamdani's ascent. Mr Trump and Mr Mamdani, it should be noted, both came into the fold as political outsiders, offering a fresh alternative to candidates propped up by the old guard. But large swathes of the Democratic party, including New York Senators Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, have refrained from endorsing a candidate who is as polarising as he is popular. While his lifelong pro-Palestine views have helped win over swathes of voters who were left disillusioned by Joe Biden and the Democrats' continued support for Israel during the war in Gaza, it has also been a source of concern among some Jewish voters. A week after Hamas launched its brutal, deadly attack on October 7, Mr Mamdani was arrested during a ceasefire demonstration outside Mr Schumer's apartment in Park Slope, Brooklyn. Mr Mamdani has said he recognises Israel's right to exist, but not as a Jewish state. This week more than 650 rabbis across the US, including more than 60 from New York City, signed a letter warning of the perceived dangers of a Mamdani administration. His previous comments calling the New York Police Department “racist, anti-queer and a major threat to public safety” in June 2020, during the George Floyd protests, have also sparked concern. He has spent the last few months trying to distance himself from his statements demonising the police at a time when New Yorkers are concerned about public safety. He has promised to build a new community safety agency so police don't respond to mental health calls, and in recent days suggested he would keep Jessica Tisch, the current police commissioner, who is tough on crime. While Mr Trump has tried to help engineer a win for Mr Cuomo, if Mr Mamdani wins the keys to Gracie Mansion, there is no doubt he will be a useful bogeyman for the Republican Party. Mr Mamdani said ‘‘‘can you believe we're here right now, having this discussion? '”, according to Mr Roth Smith, who said his friend's mayoral bid had started as simply wanting to offer people a progressive candidate. “It's turned into him actually likely having to go be the mayor of New York City, which is tough for anyone, but he's genuinely excited”, he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Six bodies of the crew were recovered and an investigation was under way. One person was reported dead on the neighbouring island of Bohol. The Philippines, which is hit by an average of 20 tropical storms each year, is recovering from a run of disasters including earthquakes and severe weather events in recent months. In September, Super Typhoon Ragasa swept across northern Luzon, forcing schools and government offices to shut down as it brought fierce winds and torrential rain. Although Kalmaegi, locally named Tino, has gradually lost strength since making landfall early on Tuesday, it continued to lash the country with winds of 120 kph and gusts of 165 kph as it swept across the Visayas islands headed for northern Palawan and towards the South China Sea. A swollen river is seen after flooding caused by Typhoon Kalmaegi in Cebu City.Jacqueline Hernandez/The Associated Press Floods in Cebu City had subsided late on Tuesday but power was still out in many places and telecommunications services were intermittent, a Reuters journalist said. Verified videos circulating on social media showed cars and streets under water, with some vehicles carried away in the flow. After the flood receded in one area of Cebu City, cars shifted by fast-flowing water were left piled up on top of each other, some overturned. Photos and videos from the Philippine Red Cross showed rescue workers wading through knee-deep floodwaters in Cebu City, using boats to reach stranded residents. In a town on the city's outskirts, homes were submerged, with only rooftops and top floors visible. State weather agency PAGASA had earlier warned of a high risk of “life-threatening and damaging storm surges” that could reach more than 3 metres high on coastal and low-lying communities in the central Philippines. The typhoon is forecast to make landfall on Thursday night in Vietnam's central regions, which have already suffered heavy floods that killed at least 40 people and left six others missing over the past week. “This is a very strong typhoon, which continues to strengthen,” the government said. A resident on board an improvised boat is evacuated from her flooded home in Liloan town, Cebu province.ALAN TANGCAWAN/AFP/Getty Images Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“There is no excuse that justifies” not utilizing “every resource available” to fund SNAP, one critic said. If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation. More than 42 million Americans, amounting to around 1 in 8 families overall, depend on the program, sometimes known as food stamps, to pay for some or all of their groceries. Due to the shutdown, the White House had announced that it would no longer disperse funds for SNAP benefits to states starting November 1. Federal Judge Jack McConnell, one of two judges to find the administration had erred in its decision, ordered the White House to take one of two options: fully fund November payments by using contingency funds plus funds from the Child Nutrition Program, or fund just half of benefits for November using the contingency funds alone. The SNAP benefits that such a family would receive are well below the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) recommendations, which advise that, for a family of four on a “thrifty” budget, spending on food should be around $976.60 per month. Cutting benefits in half leaves these families even further away from that spending goal. Crystal FitzSimons, president of the Food Research and Action Center, called the administration's decision to fund only half the program an “important first step” but added that it comes “many days late and billions of dollars short” of what is needed. It also means that families are missing out on much needed nutrition support. Enough time has already been lost — the funds must be released immediately to avert further harm, chaos and confusion. As the shutdown becomes the longest in U.S. history, polling demonstrates that a majority of Americans fault Republicans for prolonging the crisis by refusing to negotiate with Democrats, who are refusing to pass a continuing resolution bill unless some of the health care funding that was cut by President Donald Trump's “One Big Beautiful Bill” Act is restored. According to a new NBC News poll, 42 percent of Americans fault Democrats for the shutdown. Meanwhile, a combined 52 percent of Americans blame either Trump, Republicans in Congress, or both for the shutdown continuing into this month.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>‘I made a mistake,' says artist who included cloned archway on Halloween float for a Catholic school In apologizing for the fiasco, Galen Shelly told PennLive that a lighted archway and lanterns he ordered to decorate a parade float he was building for Hanover's St Joseph's school did not arrive in time – so he searched the internet for images of cemetery gates to represent the idea that “none of us get out of this life alive”. “I had no ill intent,” Shelly told PennLive. I never intended anything to be like this. The bishop of Harrisburg, Timothy Senior, said he was “shocked and appalled” by the episode and issued an apology on behalf of the church, noting the Holocaust imagery was a late addition of which it had no knowledge. “The inclusion of this image, one that represents the horrific suffering and murder of millions of innocent people, including six million Jews during the Holocaust, is profoundly offensive and unacceptable,” he said in a statement. “While the original approved design for this float did not contain this imagery, it does not change the fact that this highly recognizable symbol of hate was included. On behalf of the diocese of Harrisburg, I express my sincere apology to our Jewish brothers and sisters and to all who were hurt or offended by this display. As Catholics, we stand firmly against all forms of antisemitism, hatred and prejudice, which are rampant in our society.” Senior added that the diocese would “work with the school community to ensure that this incident becomes an opportunity for education and reflection, and review approval processes so that such a grievous incident is never repeated”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>City government declines to raise objection in court but state leaders and ACLU seek to block deployment of troops A state court in Nashville on Monday heard a legal challenge by some Democratic elected officials to Donald Trump's deployment of the national guard into the streets of Memphis, notable in part because of who has not raised an objection: the city of Memphis itself. Shelby county's mayor, Lee Harris, led the lawsuit, along with state representatives Gabby Salinas and GA Hardaway, both Memphis Democrats. Other state and local leaders joined the suit, including one Memphis city council member. But the city government declined to fight it in court. “Our decision was, let's figure out how we can impact how they show up in our community.” On 15 September, Trump signed a memo to mobilize the national guard to Memphis, a city with the fourth-highest murder rate in the United States among cities with more than 100,000 residents in 2024, a rate roughly eight times the national average. The mere suggestion of national guard deployment in Chicago and Portland has led to extraordinary street protest and legal challenges, which are ongoing. Unlike these cities, Memphis is deep in red-state America with a Republican governor disinclined to thwart the adventures of the president. Though crime had been falling before the deployment in Memphis, the presence of armed troops watching Beale Street blues clubs has in relative terms been met with a shrug. The Memphis city council has a 13-2 Democratic majority among its members. And yet, in September it rejected a resolution by a 4-4-2 tie asking Lee to refrain from deploying the national guard into the city. Tennessee's sternly conservative state government has been chipping away at the sovereignty of its Democratic-majority municipalities over the past few years, routinely issuing threats to reduce state funding, appropriate city property or even jail wayward members of local government. The plaintiffs argued on Monday before Patricia Head Moskal, a chancery court judge in Nashville, that the conditions in Memphis do not meet an objective standard of “civil unrest” that justifies deploying the national guard in the absence of rebellion or invasion, and certainly not without permission from the Tennessee general assembly. Plaintiffs call the redefinition of the guard as an “army” a semantic evasion of legal limits that has been rejected by prior courts and commentators. “This case presents a plainly political question,” said Cody Brandon, representing the Tennessee government. If you live in Memphis, you might as well just used to being murdered or raped or robbed.” And people can think differently about that. Harris might have different opinions about the gravity of a crime in Memphis. “How is this question purely political?” Moskal asked Brandon. Moskal said she would render a decision after receiving written briefs. National guard troops are not allowed to make arrests, officials say. Young said his team is briefed every day on the activities of the task force, and has tried to focus its work on the most serious violent crimes. “We push that every morning, and we give them a list of the warrants that we want to get executed so that we can keep this task force focused on the thing that really is a challenge for Memphians,” Young said. But ultimately, they don't answer to me. Young said he did not believe the national guard would be helpful in reducing Memphis's violence. But people in Memphis have been looking for a solution to violence, he said. “Given that they're coming, I like to deal in the realities, and the reality is they were going to show up whether I want them here or not,” Young said.</p>

Now, keeping those relations on track would require both sides to “respect each other's core interests and major concerns,” said Xie, adding that the “pressing priority” was “to follow up on the consensus reached between the two presidents.” “It would be unacceptable to say one thing but do another, cause any new disruption, make zero-sum calculations,” he said. For Beijing, the four “red lines” elaborated by Xie are longstanding sensitive areas that could enflame tensions if mishandled – the most prominent of which is Taiwan, the self-governing democracy that China's ruling Communist Party views as its own, despite never having controlled it. Beijing has long been irked by Washington's unofficial relationship with Taipei, and the island often features in high-level diplomatic conversations between the two sides. Beijing has in the past bristled at what it sees as US efforts to interfere in China's domestic affairs, including American officials voicing concerns about limits to freedoms of expression within China's tightly controlled political system and alleged human rights violations. While figures within the Trump administration like US Secretary of State Marco Rubio have long been vocal around such issues, they did not appear to be raised by Trump during the recent hour-and-forty-minute meeting with Xi, which focused on their bilateral economic relationship. Those talks ended without a formal trade deal, but saw Beijing agree to pause for a year a sweeping expansion of its export controls on rare earth minerals, while Washington would similarly defer measures that would have vastly expanded the number of Chinese firms blacklisted from accessing certain sensitive US technologies. The two sides also extended a truce reached earlier this year that brought down their tit-for-tat tariffs from levels that would have amounted to a de facto trade embargo. Xie, Beijing's top envoy in Washington, picked up that thread in his remarks on Monday, as he called on business leaders to “build on the positive momentum” of the summit and “remain optimistic about China's future and committed to the Chinese market.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"This amount reflects Ukraine's successful completion of nine steps required for the fifth disbursement, as well as one outstanding step from the fourth disbursement," the official statement read. The disbursment of 32 billion euros ($37 billion) is tied to reforms Kyiv has pledged to carry out in accordance with the Ukraine Plan. As European Pravda reports, Ukraine was originally set to receive 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) in the fifth tranche. Since its introduction in March 2024, the Ukraine Facility has provided Ukraine with 22.89 billion euros ($26 billion) in macro-financial support, excluding the most recent tranche. External funding is increasingly crucial for Ukraine as it faces mounting war costs and a substantial budget shortfall. Martin Fornusek is a news editor at the Kyiv Independent. He has previously worked as a news content editor at the media company Newsmatics and is a contributor to Euromaidan Press. He was also volunteering as an editor and translator at the Czech-language version of Ukraïner. Martin studied at Masaryk University in Brno, Czechia, holding a bachelor's degree in security studies and history and a master's degree in conflict and democracy studies. The drop follows Washington's Oct. 22 decision to impose blocking sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil, Russia's two largest oil companies. Explosions were also reported at a petrochemical plant in Sterlitamak, a city in Russia's Republic of Bashkortostan. Zelensky visited a command post of the 1st corps, which is conducting a defensive operation in Dobropillia sector together with adjacent units. Ukrainian Navy spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk said on Nov. 2 that the strike would have "long-term consequences" for Russia. Russian troops reportedly struck on Nov. 3 two unarmed civilians with an FPV drone near the village of Kruhliakivka in the Kupiansk district, according to the video footage provided by Ukraine's 77th Airmobile Brigade. While Russian conscripts are officially barred from being deployed abroad, reports indicate that many are pressured into signing contracts with Russia's Defense Ministry and sent to fight in Ukraine. The suspect demands respect for his "fundamental rights, including the right to adequate food, a healthy environment, dignified detention conditions, and equal treatment with other prisoners regarding family visits and access to information," his lawyer, Nicola Canestrini, said. In October, Russia significantly increased its use of guided aerial bombs (KAB) against Ukraine, dropping over 5,328 munitions on Ukrainian military positions and cities near the front line. Trains that ran to Kramatorsk will now have their final destination in the city of Husarivka in Kharkiv Oblast.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump talks with auto industry leaders, including General Motors CEO Mary Barra (L) and United Auto Workers (UAW) President Dennis Williams (R) at the American Center for Mobility in Ypsilanti Township, Michigan, U.S., March 15, 2017.Jonathan Ernst/Reuters As it stands, however, that scenario is all too real. The decisions by General Motors and Stellantis to cancel production of electrified vehicles at their Ontario plants in Ingersoll and Brampton respectively are, in large part, results of Trump's dismantling of pro-EV policies, putting up tariffs walls and attacking Canadian workers. He's succeeding in taking jobs from Canadians and slowing the inevitable EV transition. The rest of the world is driving forward on EVs as Trump is dragging America backward by putting up tariff barriers to shut out foreign competition, undoing fuel economy regulation as well as dismantling policies (namely former president Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act) that would've accelerated America's electric transition and helped the U.S. auto industry catch up and compete with China. The incentives for U.S. automakers to invest in EVs have largely evaporated, while at the same time they are suffering massive consequences from tariffs. “We're kind of falling behind,” said Dimitry Anastakis, a prominent auto industry scholar and the LR Wilson and RJ Currie Chair in Canadian business history at the University of Toronto. In her third quarter letter to shareholders, GM head Mary Barra thanked the president for “tariff updates” and a new discount on U.S. heavy-duty pickups, while also acknowledging, “with the evolving regulatory framework and the end of federal consumer incentives, it is now clear that near-term EV adoption will be lower than planned.” As a result, the company took a US$1.6-billion charge in the quarter and Barra warned of more to come. If the Big Three American automakers – Stellantis, Ford and GM – continue to fall behind international rivals on EVs, particularly those from China, the only way for Trump to protect them without massive public spending will be for America to put up bigger tariff walls and keep out foreign competition. It'll turn North America's tightly integrated auto industry into an island with its own unique ecosystem, cut off from advances being made elsewhere, making cars that are uncompetitive anywhere but here. Anastakis said you can never count American automakers out completely. It's a problem for Canadian drivers, who could be denied more affordable cutting-edge EVs and frugal gas-powered vehicles because of our alignment with the U.S. But it's an even bigger problem for Canada's auto industry and especially the workers who depend on those jobs. In the face of Trump's brutal attack on Canadian auto workers and the environment, building out our own globally connected EV manufacturing sector – from mining critical minerals, refining them into battery components and assembling vehicles – has become existentially important. Prime Minister Mark Carney's government is continuing that push, reaching out to China, Mexico, India and Europe for trade talks. Canada's auto industry has survived by tethering itself to the leading automakers globally, as Greig Mordue, an associate professor in the W Booth School of Engineering Practice and Technology at McMaster University, recently pointed out. As Mordue suggests, Canada's old strategy of balancing sticks (tariffs) and carrots (duty remissions for local manufacturing) to attract manufacturers could potentially be used again to attract Chinese automakers. Charting a distinct path for Canada's auto sector, diverging from America, would need to involve additional measures too, perhaps allowing vehicles homologated for Europe to be sold in Canada. Another promising idea, proposed in a recent opinion piece published by the Toronto Star, suggests tweaking Canada's EV Availability Standard to reward automakers that build parts and/or vehicles in Canada. Those job cuts are a warning – not to abandon the auto industry or the industrial policy that has built this sector into a powerhouse – but instead to diversify Canada's auto industry and double down on its strengths for the sake of the next-generation of Canadian auto workers, for Canadian sovereignty, and for a clean and growing economy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now, she is under arrest as part of a criminal investigation into the leak of a video showing the alleged abuse, including sexual abuse, of Palestinian detainees in a notorious Israeli military prison. A longstanding target of Israel's right-wing, Tomer-Yerushalmi's rapid fall has quickly emerged as a national scandal, overshadowing the video at the center of the case. The affair dates back to July 2024, when legal authorities in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) opened an investigation into soldiers who were allegedly shown sexually assaulting a Palestinian detainee arrested during the Gaza war as some two dozen other detainees lay face-down nearby at the Sde Teiman military prison. The video was first aired by Israel's Channel 12 in August 2024, but it wasn't the first report to raise concerns about conditions at the base. In May 2024, CNN spoke to three whistleblowers who detailed allegations of abuse at Sde Teiman. A month later, Israel said it would begin phasing out the facility. On Wednesday, Tomer-Yerushalmi was suspended from her role as military advocate-general, as Israel's Attorney General Gali Baharav‑Miara announced a criminal investigation into the leak. She wrote in her letter that an “incitement campaign” against her had reached its peak following the decision to investigate soldiers at Sde Teiman. “There are things that cannot be done even against the worst of the detainees,” she wrote. “Officers of the (legal) unit have faced repeated personal attacks, harsh insults, and even real threats. For Israel's right-wing political echelon, the resignation and investigation weren't enough. Netanyahu called the leak “an enormous reputational blow,” describing it on Sunday as “the worst PR disaster in Israel's history.” National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir dubbed the lawyer's conduct “criminal behavior under a legal guise” and called for the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the leak. The IDF said in a statement that it would “employ all means available” to locate her “as quickly as possible.” After an extensive search, she was found on a beach north of Tel Aviv. She has not been formally charged yet or entered a plea. Her next hearing is scheduled for Wednesday. A lawyer representing Tomer-Yerushalmi declined to comment on the case. Alongside Tomer-Yerushalmi, other senior legal officials in the military prosecutor's office are also implicated in the leak and its alleged cover-up. The affair has become a part of a larger attack on Israel's judiciary from Netanyahu's coalition. “Anyone involved in conflicts of interest will not be part of the investigation,” Levin insisted in a statement last week. “One group that has gotten used to treating the country as its own is being replaced.” Baharav-Miara's office responded in a letter, saying Levin was trying to “unlawfully interfere” with the investigative process, which “impedes its progress.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. Emma Ashford is a Senior Fellow at the Stimson Center. She is the author of First Among Equals: U.S. Foreign Policy in a Multipolar World. Long-term economic, demographic, and military trends have undeniably shifted global politics, and the United States now needs a strategy to manage this emerging world in a way that preserves at least some of its unipolar advantages without leaving it overstretched. Which strategy Washington should pursue, however, largely depends on the kind of world it believes is emerging. As a result, it assiduously built a strategy around a new cold war, and it sought to stitch together discrete U.S. alliances and reframe Washington's adversaries as an “axis of authoritarians.” But a coherent democratic axis failed to emerge, and states chafed against a unified democratic policy: consider India, which is still an active participant in BRICs, a bloc it founded with Brazil, Russia, and China in 2009, or the tensions between the United States and the Netherlands over the latter's export of critical chip-making technology to China. This is because the Biden administration was wrong about bipolarity. Contrary to popular opinion, however, multipolarity is not a death sentence for the United States. If Washington embraces this fact, it can pursue a more flexible strategy—one that allows the United States to operate more efficiently and effectively in a rapidly changing world. Instead of trying to force the world into a false us-versus-them dichotomy, it has taken some early, positive steps toward embracing a more multipolar strategy. In particular, the push for U.S. allies in Asia and Europe to bear more of the defense burden is a significant shift from traditional U.S. foreign policy. By destroying the international economic system and alienating other countries with its aggressive unilateralism, the administration's mixed-bag strategy for multipolarity will raise more risks and reap fewer rewards. Scholars still fiercely debate whether the unipolar moment is giving way to a bipolar, multipolar, or even nonpolar world. Varying definitions of power lead to starkly different conclusions about which world order is emerging. If power is defined only by military prowess, for example, then a bipolar order seems plausible, pitting China and the United States against each other. And if it turns out that China is falsifying its own economic data and is closer to internal chaos than its military parades suggest, then unipolarity once again becomes likely. If power is defined more broadly, it seems plausible that the world is shifting toward what scholars have labeled “unbalanced multipolarity.” In such a system, there are a few great powers—the United States and China in this case—and a larger number of second-tier powers, including Australia, France, Germany, India, Japan, and Russia, among others. Many second-tier powers have already started to jockey for position within this emerging system. French President Emmanuel Macron, for instance, shocked European leaders in 2023 when he declared that Europe should seek to become a “third pole” in the new world order. Meanwhile, Fernando Haddad, Brazil's finance minister, told journalists that São Paulo will not lean toward either Beijing or Washington and is “too big to be choosing partners.” Clearly, these states do not want to get shoehorned into some new American-led anti-Chinese coalition. Indeed, this was a key problem with the Biden administration's grand strategy, which tried to rerun the Cold War playbook and engineer bipolar competition with China, networking U.S. alliances and lumping Russia and China into an “axis of autocracies.” States such as India are eager to buy American weapons and engage in military cooperation but at the same time join Chinese military exercises and buy Russian hydrocarbons. Underneath this seemingly esoteric debate over polarity and the new world order is an often unstated but high-stakes assumption: that a multipolar world will be worse for the United States than a bipolar one. Because the Cold War ended peacefully and the interwar period preceding it did not, bipolarity is often associated with stability and multipolarity with danger. But some multipolar systems have been stable and long lasting, such as the Congress of Vienna in 1815, an entente between Europe's great powers that held for nearly a century. The idea that the United States is better off in a bipolar world, rather than a multipolar one, is theoretical at best. A multipolar system, for example, may heighten certain risks, such as the potential for low-level conflicts between small states, but a bipolar system could heighten others, including arms races that could escalate to great-power war. Under bipolarity or unipolarity, a great power may be able to prevent conflicts through increased leverage on client states. This is not a purely academic debate: polarity is a description of the distribution of power in the international system rather than something states get to choose. The Biden administration tried to emphasize bipolarity by elevating U.S.-Chinese competition, promoting strategies of “allied scale,” and creating a new Western coalition against an “axis of upheaval.” These strategies identified a unitary bloc of opponents in China, Iran, Russia, and others and then sought to assemble a new “free world” coalition to combat it. And by emphasizing flexible, transactional partnerships with states on specific issues and portfolios, a multipolar strategy would enable Washington to hedge against rising competitors such as India. In the end, this approach to security would be far cheaper than the trillions of dollars required to sustain U.S. military primacy against all potential challengers. The Trump administration has taken some initial steps in this regard. It has, for instance, encouraged its allies, especially in Europe, to share more of the burden of collective defense and turn their latent economic power into stronger military capabilities. As a result, Washington can shrink its current global military posture and concentrate its resources where they are most needed—the Indo-Pacific and the United States' own backyard in Latin America. Rather than building formal, closed alliance structures as it did during the Cold War, the United States needs to form flexible, issue-specific partnerships with a variety of states. He has also engaged with adversaries such as Iran and Russia, whereas prior administrations might have balked at the prospect, fearing political blowback. Although these conversations have produced limited results, this diplomatic openness—and rejection of a black-and-white worldview—is exactly the kind of flexibility needed in a more multipolar world. Just as President Joe Biden's attempt to divide the world into “us” and “them” risked alienating many potential partners, so, too, does Trump's willingness to come out swinging as a hostile lone actor in a changing world. In a multipolar world, Washington should attempt to preserve global economic openness by resisting the use of coercive economic statecraft and instead bolster the resilience and diversity of global markets. As Michael Froman, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, recently put it in Foreign Affairs, “If Washington continues on its current course—defined by unilateralism, transactionalism, and mercantilism—the consequences will be grim.” It's undoubtedly true that American aid and diplomatic institutions need reform; the same is true of the United Nations and other multilateral forums. And a world in which basic lifesaving services such as disaster relief and humanitarian assistance do not exist is a world in which everyone is worse off. This confused approach leaves the United States in limbo: partly able to navigate a multipolar world, yet risking alienation and—more important—undermining the open global economic order that has served Washington so well for so long. Even as the Trump administration makes positive moves to rebalance its security commitments, it is undermining the United States' economic and diplomatic standing. From imposing draconian tariffs and sanctions to conducting seemingly random military strikes in Iran and off the coast of Venezuela, the administration has approached friends and foes alike with self-serving aggression—even though successfully navigating a more multipolar world will require strong, lean global partnerships.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Shohei Ohtani and the rest of the Los Angeles Dodgers celebrated their second straight World Series championship with a downtown parade and stadium rally Monday after becoming the first team in 25 years to win back-to-back titles. I'm ready to get another ring next year. Ohtani was accompanied by his wife, Mamiko Tanaka, who took a photo of him along the parade route. “It's really nice to be able to win the game, and to be surrounded by all these amazing fans,” Ohtani said during the bus ride. World Series MVP Yoshinobu Yamamoto wore a black T-shirt with World Series champions on the front. Wearing sunglasses and a backward baseball cap, Yamamoto waved to fans. “Losing isn't an option,” Yamamoto told the stadium crowd in English. “To my teammates, my coaches, amazing staff and all the fans, we did it together. The team's third Japanese player, rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki, celebrated his 24th birthday Monday. “What they talking about in Toronto right now?” actor-comedian Anthony Anderson asked the crowd. He carried it overhead to the stage and set it on a table next to a table with last year's championship hardware. Kiké Hernández apologized in advance for his expletive-filled comments. “My teammates have been pretty humble, but I think it's time to talk that s—-,” he said. “Everybody's been asking questions about a dynasty. Earlier, manager Dave Roberts hoisted the trophy while aboard one of several buses that traversed a route packed with cheering, flag-waving blue-clad fans. “I feel like it's almost double from last year,” Freddie Freeman said. It's so awesome to be a part of this.” Blue-and-white confetti blew from a truck rolling between the buses, which were filled with family members of the players, including newly retired Clayton Kershaw and his four children. “It's the perfect way to be done,” said Kershaw, who ended an 18-year career played entirely with Los Angeles. “I know the Dodgers have always meant a lot to this city for generations. For us to get to do this in front of them, it means the world to me and all the rest of the guys.” “I hope these Dodger fans have a lot of fun because they deserve this. They showed up all year long, they supported us and here we are back-to-back champs.” Our weekly ePaper presents the most noteworthy recent topics in an exciting, readable fomat.</p>
