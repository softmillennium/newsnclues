                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown is about to become the nation's longest federal funding lapse ever. The shutdown is poised to hit that milestone on Wednesday, marking its 36th day and surpassing the previous record, which was set in early 2019. There are no further votes scheduled Tuesday on the GOP's short-term continuing resolution, or on an alternative proposal put forward by Democrats, which includes additional spending on health care and other priorities. Both of the longest government shutdowns in U.S. history occurred while President Donald Trump was in office. Please check back for updates. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

President Donald Trump said he will withhold November food stamps until the government reopens. ), will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before! " the president wrote in a Tuesday morning Truth Social post. Trump's announcement comes alongside rulings from federal judges in Rhode Island and Massachusetts calling on the administration to fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which 42 million Americans rely on to afford groceries each month. This would cover 50% of eligible households' current food stamp allotments, the administration said. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins wrote in an X post on Tuesday that "USDA sent SNAP guidance to States. She continued that "If the government opens, families get their FULL benefit much more quickly," but did not say the administration will withhold funds. Democracy Forward, a policy and legal advocacy group and plaintiff in the Rhode Island case, told Business Insider that they filed a motion Tuesday to compel the Trump administration to disperse benefits as soon as possible in accordance with the court orders. Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island has told the administration it must respond by end of day tomorrow and set a new hearing for Thursday, November 6, Democracy Forward said. "The Trump-Vance administration continues to play politics with people's lives through failing to ensure SNAP payments are expeditiously available," Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward," said. The administration needs to fully fund SNAP benefits so people can eat, today." SNAP benefits were set to run out on November 1 after their typical funding sources lapsed. Patrick A. Penn, deputy undersecretary for US Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services, said in a letter to state leaders on October 24 that the Agriculture Department is "suspending all November 2025 benefit allotments until such time as sufficient federal funding is provided, or until FNS directs State agencies otherwise." In documents seen by Business Insider, the US Department of Agriculture previously said it has money held in contingency funds to be used in case of emergency, but that those funds cannot be used for SNAP. Tuesday's Truth Social post is a pivot from Trump's previous stance on SNAP. It's unclear if Trump can use executive power to halt SNAP during the shutdown, especially with two cases pending in federal court. The US Department of Agriculture and White House did not immediately respond for comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The recent wave of white-collar layoffs may have employees and job seekers rattled, but according to New York University Stern School of Business professor Robert Seamans, his current class of MBA students isn't worried. "I don't get a huge sense that they're dreading the job market or that they think there are going to be dramatic changes," Seamans told a gathering of technology executives at last week's CNBC Technology Executive Council Summit in New York City. Seamans said his focus in the classroom is making sure students have the skills they need when they graduate, and that includes generative AI and more generally, machine learning. Running experiments using AI in group settings is one way he gets students used to the technology, its advantages, and its limits. For instance, he recently asked students to write a short paper on whether return-to-office mandates are good or bad for the workforce. The second part of the assignment had students writing another paper, but this time asking the LLM to respond in an adversarial way with critical feedback — what Seamans calls a "black sheep" approach. He added that in his experiment, many of his students preferred the more adversarial way, perhaps because it more closely modeled the variety of opinions and thoughts in an actual workplace. "We don't know what all the best practices are yet, but that's why I want them to keep trying different things," he said. Earlier in the day at the TEC Summit, a group of students in high school and college spoke to CNBC's Contessa Brewer about how they're being exposed to AI (or not) in the classroom. Aarnav Sathish, a high school senior, said his teachers strictly discourage AI in the classroom. Outside of school, however, the 17-year-old uses ChatGPT for help with assignment busywork, quickly adding that he wants to use AI "as a tool and not a crutch." Ezinne Okonkwo, a 19-year-old undergraduate at Columbia University, said her professors also discourage students from using AI, instead preferring that they develop the subject matter skills needed for each class. However, like Sathish, she uses AI outside the classroom for tasks that feel repetitive or that she already knows how to do. "If I have to write a bunch of emails that all feel the same, I'll use it to make them sound a little different," Okonkwo said. "I won't use it for coding if I don't already know how to do it in that coding language." Siblings Carson and Andrew Boyer both attend Georgia Tech, yet are having different experiences with AI. Carson, 19, a freshman, is studying engineering and said his professors allow AI in moderation. Andrew, 21, a senior, says his professors encourage AI usage, but they "don't want us to copy and paste in AI work." He was recently surprised when during a midterm exam for an information security class the teacher allowed students to use the internet and AI. While at first that seemed like a good thing, he soon realized that his professors set up the exam so that AI couldn't complete a lot of the more nuanced and visual questions. "I think the class average was like a 60," Andrew said. If there was one thing that NYU's Seamans wanted the room of tech executives to take away about the young people coming into their organizations, it's that despite the focus on AI, ultimately employers are dealing with humans that require empathy and understanding. "Everyone coming into your companies all have their own human skill set," he said. What they all want is a chance to work with this technology and become a contributing member to whatever team they're on. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

Fears that valuations in the tech sector have reached unsustainable levels ratcheted up on Tuesday after Palantir stock tumbled following its third-quarter earnings report, despite solid results and upbeat guidance. Bond yields dipped as traders shifted to risk-off mode. The 10-year Treasury yield was down one basis point to 4.09%. Doubts are swirling around whether some companies have seen valuations go too far too fast, and whether firms will be able to deliver on their AI ambitions after spending billions on the technology. That compares to Nvidia, which has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of around 29. Also weighing on sentiment on Tuesday were comments from top banking executives, who said that the risk of a market correction is rising. Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon both pointed to risks that the market could see a correction of up to 20%. Pick, however, added that he didn't see this as a negative event necessarily. "We should also welcome the possibility that there would be drawdowns, 10 to 15% drawdowns that are not driven by some sort of macro cliff effect," he said at the Global Financial Leaders Investment Summit in Hong Kong. "Some are doubting whether AI can possibly live up to the hype in terms of future returns," David Morrison, a senior market analyst at Trade Nation, wrote in a note about Tuesday's sell-off. The AI trade has flashed other warning signs in recent weeks. Shares of Meta and Microsoft tumbled after the firms said they would boost capex spending plans, a sign investors are growing skeptical over the buckets of cash being poured into AI. It isn't the first round of volatility for Palantir, which plummeted around 40% from its early-year peak through April amid the broader market selloff. Shares declined another 18% from mid-August through their low in September after the short-seller Andrew Left said he was taking a bet against the company. This all comes at a time when the market is also waking up to the reality that more rate cuts might not be a sure thing.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At South Korea's largest amusement park, crowds of people wait for hours to be a part of the "KPop Demon Hunters" craze. Netflix said in August that "KPop Demon Hunters" had become the most popular Netflix film ever. In October, the streamer said "KPop Demon Hunters" had exceeded 325 million views. The company has sought to capitalize on the popularity, offering two limited-window theatrical screenings for the film and striking consumer product deals with Hasbro and Mattel to get "KPop Demon Hunters" toys and merch on shelves. Agnes Lee helped cast the movie and scout locations from Seoul as an associate producer for the film. "K-pop and K-culture was such a huge and important part of this movie," Lee told CNBC in Seoul. Once popular mainly in Asia, K-pop music has become a global phenomenon. Artists like PSY, who shot to international stardom in 2012 with his viral music video "Gangnam Style," put an international spotlight on K-pop. PSY's hit song became YouTube's most-watched video that year. Since then, other K-pop acts have run up impressive numbers, too. BTS' song "Dynamite" has exceeded 2 billion streams on Spotify. BLACKPINK's 2023 tour became the highest-grossing by a female group on record, according to stats at the time from Touring Data. Now, even "KPop Demon Hunters'" fictional bands are topping the global music charts. And then, after watching it, they realized, 'Oh, wow. I'm a K-pop fan,'" said Danny Chung, a K-pop producer and the voice of the film's character, Baby Saja. "And now there's a whole back catalogue of three decades of K-pop music that they have to dive into." BTS is planning a comeback in 2026 after members of the band completed South Korea's mandatory military service. Enthusiastic investors have pumped up the stock prices of South Korea's "Big Four" K-pop companies. "The breakout success of 'KPop Demon Hunters,' which could become one of Netflix's most-watched content items, underscores K-content phenomenon in global market," Mirae Asset Global Investments said in an Oct. 19 report. "We believe this cultural boom is a key catalyst driving increased international consumption of Korean cosmetics and food products such as noodles." On the political front, speculation is high that China, which blocked K-pop and other South Korean cultural exports under President Xi Jinping's campaign to promote what Beijing considers proper socialist values, could soften its restrictions. "We continue to see K-pop as a direct beneficiary of thawing Korea-China relations," Mirae said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Tuesday suggested that the United States will not pay any SNAP benefits during the government shutdown, contradicting a court filing a day earlier by his administration. Trump said that the benefits, which help feed 42 million Americans, will resume only after Democrats in Congress agree to pass a stopgap funding bill that would reopen the government. The administration on Monday told a federal judge in Rhode Island federal judge that it would pay half of the costs of the SNAP benefits for November. Trump on Tuesday said in a Truth Social post, wrote, "SNAP BENEFITS, which increased by Billions and Billions of Dollars (MANY FOLD!) during Crooked Joe Biden's disastrous term in office (Due to the fact that they were haphazardly 'handed' to anyone for the asking, as opposed to just those in need, which is the purpose of SNAP! ), will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!" The social media post came shortly after lawyers for plaintiffs in a court case challenging the administration's cessation of SNAP benefits told a federal judge in Rhode Island that the decision to pay partial benefits out of a contingency fund did not meet his prior order that any decision to make partial payments "cannot be arbitrary and capricious." The judge, Jack McConnell, had told the administration on Friday that it needed to pay SNAP benefits as soon as possible out of a contingency fund, and that is also needed to investigate whether other federal funds could be used to keep the program fully funded in the absence of a new appropriation by Congress. The Trump administration on Monday told McConnell that it would use all of the $4.65 billion remaining in the contingency fund, but said it had declined to use at least  $4 billion from the Child Nutrition Program to keep SNAP fully funded for November, at least. Lawyers for plaintiffs in the case told McConnell on Tuesday, "The Court should grant a temporary restraining order and preliminary stay on the ground that Defendants' decision not to provide full SNAP benefits—even though they have funds available to do so and even though switching to partial payments at this late date will cause devastating delay — is arbitrary and capricious." Past presidential administrations have continued disbursing funds for SNAP during prior government shutdowns. But the Trump administration recently said SNAP benefits would end this week because Congress had not approved funding needed to continue the program during the shutdown. The administration, in what is seen as an effort to pressure Democrats in Congress to vote to end the shutdown, also refused to use more than $4 billion in contingency funds that Congress had set aside explicitly for SNAP. Separate groups of plaintiffs then sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture in different federal courts to compel the department to continue paying the benefits.

WhatsApp, the popular messaging service owned by Meta Platforms Inc., introduced a standalone Apple Watch app that makes it easier for users to interact with their chats from Apple Inc.'s smartwatch without pulling out an iPhone.

The software also includes features such as call notifications, the ability to record and send voice messages, full-length message previews and message reactions, bringing WhatsApp more in line with what Apple's own messaging app can already do on the watch.</p>

I spent six weeks exploring New Zealand's North and South Islands, and all of my research kept pointing me toward the country's famous train rides — often described as some of the most scenic in the world. To fill a free day in Christchurch, I splurged on a $320 round-trip ticket for the TranzAlpine to see what all the hype was about. I wondered if those checking bags were taking the train to Greymouth and then connecting to another mode of transportation down the South Island's west coast — a popular route I considered exploring, but ultimately decided against. When I got to the counter, I inquired about upgrading one leg of my journey to the Scenic Plus Experience for a few hundred dollars. It includes premium perks like access to a private outdoor viewing carriage, regionally inspired cuisine paired with local wines, and live commentary. Unfortunately, the all-inclusive experience was completely sold out. The seating arrangement felt cramped, gave me a bit of social anxiety, and I didn't like that I was facing away from the direction of travel. The space is intended for dining passengers only, and since it was relatively empty for most of the journey, I kept ordering refreshments so I could stay there instead of returning to the seat I didn't like. It wasn't possible to request a specific side when booking, but since passengers only had to remain in their assigned seats for departure and arrival, I was free to explore and enjoy the scenery from different angles. Even after ordering a second coffee, buying those items separately would have been cheaper because I actually lost $0.36 by pre-booking the meal. In hindsight, I wished I'd forgotten my diet and indulged in the ham-and-cheese croissant sandwich because it would have made the add-on feel more worthwhile. At first, the tracks mostly passed through industrial and residential areas. It felt the scenery only began to change once we reached Springfield — 40 miles outside of Christchurch — which is considered the gateway to New Zealand's Southern Alps. I captured a few amazing shots that were essentially ruined by reflections on the glass. At times, it felt easier to stop trying for photos and just take in the sights. I only stayed for a few minutes before retreating to the dining carriage for a hot tea ($2.34), which I brought back with me to help keep warm while enjoying the panoramas. Screens showed everything from our position along the route and elevation changes to factoids about destinations we were passing. There was also an onboard infotainment app, which I downloaded but didn't use since the screens provided the same details without draining my phone battery. The train arrived just before 10:45 a.m., giving passengers a chance to hop off and snap a photo in front of the Arthur's Pass National Park sign. With the wind picking up and a crowd of people all trying for the same shot, getting a decent picture wasn't easy. The cashier had a record of my pre-booked meals on file. Still feeling peckish, I grabbed a keto-friendly snack: salted peanuts. These weren't included in my meal plan, so I paid $2.35 out of pocket. Greymouth's Central Business District was quiet on this aptly gray Monday afternoon. As I stopped into a few shops and passed some street art, I wondered if the area might be livelier on a weekend. Since I didn't want to risk being late for the return train, I stayed within a short walk of the station. I was finally facing forward, which made the journey much smoother. As a result, I spent far more time in this seat than the one I'd been assigned on the way to Greymouth. That said, if I had only traveled one way, this may have been disappointing because the weather did obscure some of the sightlines. Unlike the breakfast deal, which only included a non-alcoholic beverage, the dinner package allowed me to order any drink except a full-size bottle of wine. My drink pairing was a quarter-bottle of Brancott Estate sauvignon blanc ($7.65), which felt like the perfect portion for one person. The late afternoon light cast everything in a softer glow, making it easier to capture photos than it had been during the first leg. I stayed for about 20 minutes, until a staff member corralled everyone back to their seats as a safety precaution since we were about to go through various tunnels. The train pulled back into Christchurch just after 7 p.m., and within half an hour I was back at my hostel, completing the nearly 12-hour excursion. After returning to Christchurch, I couldn't help feeling like I'd wasted both time and money on the round-trip ticket. Though there were memorable moments in each direction, I would've rather saved money by only taking the train one way. And when comparing the train to a separate road trip I took from Canterbury to Arthur's Pass, I found renting a car not only more convenient but also more rewarding. For travelers considering the famous rail route, I'd suggest taking the train one way — or skipping it in favor of driving yourself for more flexibility and discovery.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Palantir CEO Alex Karp ranted against short sellers, calling out specifically Michael Burry after a filing revealed the investor of "The Big Short" fame had bets against the artificial intelligence software company, as well as Nvidia, at the end of the last quarter. "The idea that chips and ontology is what you want to short is bats--- crazy." "He's actually putting a short on AI. It was us and Nvidia," Karp added. Palantir shares slid roughly 9% on Tuesday even after the software company beat Wall Street estimates for the third quarter and offered upbeat guidance. Investors have grown increasingly wary of lofty valuations in AI-linked names. Palantir's stock, which was up 173% for the year heading into Tuesday's trading, has a forward price-earnings ratio of 228. Nvidia fell more than 2% after gaining over 50% this year. "I do think this behavior is egregious and I'm going to be dancing around when it's proven wrong," said Karp of short sellers. Burry's hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, disclosed put options with a notional value of about $187 million against Nvidia and $912 million against Palantir as of Sept. 30. in a filing. It's unclear whether Burry is profiting from Tuesday's declines. The filing reflects his positions at the end of September, and he may have since adjusted his portfolio by now. Burry declined to comment on his positions. "It's not even clear he's shorting us. It's probably just, 'How do I get my position out and not look like a fool?'" The disclosure comes after Burry hinted at renewed caution in markets in a cryptic post on X last week. Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play," he wrote to his 1.3 million followers on the platform. "With the shorts it's very complex ... honestly I think what's going on here is market manipulation," Karp said. "We delivered the best results anyone's ever seen. I mean these people, they claim to be ethical, but they are actually shorting one of the great businesses of the world." Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

I'd picked up a travel brochure about the city of Port Townsend and joyfully read it aloud as my partner, Carol, and I drove through the area. It described a place great for kayaking, hiking, and biking with an active sailing community and emerald forests — all things my outdoorsy mate loves. We were even more sold on the area when I learned about its charming Victorian homes, historical seaport, array of music and arts festivals, and thriving local writers' community. This was the ideal destination for our second home. But we didn't want to just vacation in the area; we wanted to establish a foothold and be a part of the community for several months each year. Unfortunately, our dream seemed financially out of reach as housing prices in the area continued to climb. Many listings were priced over $500,000, which was well out of our budget. Our prospects looked dismal until our real-estate agent sent us a listing for a wooded lot of trees and wildflowers about 30 minutes out of town. It didn't have power, sewer, or water, and the only permanent structure was an outhouse. But the property did offer a developed road and easy access to Highway 101, as well as excellent cellphone service and WiFi connectivity. In 2022, we purchased the 4.6-acre property, sight unseen, for $160,000 and ordered a rugged, 20-foot Airstream Basecamp for $65,000 to serve as our new abode. To make things a little easier, Carol even set up a small, battery-operated pump for delivering water into our trailer. We've also created strategies for conserving energy, like charging our phones, computers, and battery-operated gardening tools when we drive into town. Our property is landlocked, so Carol pays a monthly fee to store her kayak at a boat haven 18 miles from our property. This also gives us access to a marina 8 miles away. At either location, we can use the coin-operated hot showers and garbage facilities to dispose of our trash. Living off the grid has been an interesting adventure, but we don't regret our decision. The Pacific Northwest is now our home for three to five months a year, just like we dreamed.</p>

During a recent conversation we had, he shared a compelling chart showing that the sector has lagged despite that its earnings growth is soaring. "Healthcare has been beaten down for a lot of reasons — mostly earlier in the year related to potential regulatory hurdles and new administration policies affecting healthcare sectors," Pappalardo said. We think that naturally sets up for some reversal to occur." They cited several factors that contribute to their bullish outlook, like impending drug price clarity, insulation from heightened tariffs, a growing number of mergers and acquisitions, cheap valuations, and AI opportunities. Pappalardo threw in another reason: its defensive nature as the job market appears to weaken. "Even if we get an economic pullback, downturn, or even a recession, healthcare revenues still tend to hold up pretty well," he said. "That tells us companies are investing in future growth because they think there's upside down the road, which bodes well for that sector."</p>

Norges Bank Investment Management, which manages Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund, said on Tuesday it had voted against the Tesla CEO's proposed pay package ahead of the company's annual shareholder meeting on Thursday. The fund, which is Tesla's sixth-largest institutional investor, also voted against Musk's previous pay package in 2024. In January, leaked messages revealed an icy text exchange between the Tesla boss and Norges' CEO Nicolai Tangen, with the billionaire telling Tangen that "friends are as friends do." Tesla's CEO compensation plan has come under fire from some investors, including the California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) and the New York State Retirement Fund. Proxy firms Glass Lewis and ISS have also urged shareholders to vote against it, prompting Musk to label them "corporate terrorists" in a recent earnings call. Several other big investors, including Florida's State Board of Administration and ARK Invest's Cathy Wood, have expressed support. Vanguard and BlackRock, Tesla's two largest institutional shareholders, have not yet said how they are voting. These include raising Tesla's market cap to $8.5 trillion, selling 1 million Optimus robots, boosting annual earnings way above those reported by tech giants Meta and Google, and planning his own succession.</p>
