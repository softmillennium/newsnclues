                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Opinion articles provide independent perspectives on key community issues, separate from our newsroom reporting. It's that the state's leaders — mainly the governor and surgeon general — are endorsing dangerous public health decisions, such as ending childhood vaccination mandates for highly-contagious diseases like measles. And they are expanding their reach with the growing popularity of the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement led by U.S. Secretary of Health and known vaccine skeptic Robert. A recent event in Venice shows there's no fantastical, absurd thinking that's too much for MAHA. The Oct. 2 event in Sarasota County — “The 3 Big C's: Courage, Censorship & Cancer” — honored Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo and his wife, plus “an unlicensed Canadian radiologist who treats cancer with horse paste,” KFF Health News reported. There's no more notable intersection of today's conspiracy theories — from vaccine to election denial — than this. Radiologist William Makis, a keynote speaker at the event, lost his medical license in 2019, the KFF story said, and now uses antiparasitic drugs such ivermectin as a cancer treatment. Ivermectin was also pushed as a treatment for the coronavirus, including by Ladapo, but studies have shown it was not effective. After listening to actor Mel Gibson talk about the benefits of ivermectin on a podcast, Florida First Lady Casey DeSantis, a cancer survivor, has announced some of the state's new $60 million cancer research fund will go into researching the drug. Studies have shown ivermectin could have anticancer effects, but there is no evidence yet that it is effective to treat the disease in humans, the Washington Post reported. Florida has not announced who will conduct the research, which will certainly affect whether the results can be trusted. Ladapo's wife, Brianna Ladapo, who chaired a panel at the Venice event, says she listens to angels and has written that “sinister forces” created the pandemic to “frighten the masses to surrender their sovereignty to a small group of tyrannical elites,” the story said. On a recent podcast, she claimed “chemtrails” — another favorite topic of conspiracy theorists — shaped like a pentagram were “outside our house for the last few weeks” and had made her and her sons sick, KFF reported. To be clear, Joseph Ladapo hasn't publicly endorsed his wife's views. He did appear in a 2020 news conference on the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court organized by a fringe group called “America's Frontline Doctors” that included another doctor who previously claimed some female medical issues are caused by having sex with demons. Demons, pentagram-shaped chemtrails and unproven treatments for cancer may sound like the stuff that only tinfoil-hat wearers would believe. But public distrust in American institutions, including healthcare, has pushed many regular people to look for alternative views on medicine. We understand why Americans distrust “Big Pharma” and the medical establishment. But Florida has now moved to the other extreme, where treatments like vaccines, that have been studied and proven, are dismissed. Those that haven't — or have been proven not to work — are upheld as a silver bullet that an obscure elite has supposedly hidden to keep us sick. Ladapo and others may say they are protecting medical freedom, but Florida is looking more like it's pandering to dangerous and bizarre conspiracy theories.

Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS may be developing a blueish hue after undergoing a rapid and unexpected brightening event while hidden behind the sun, new observations reveal. This is the third time that experts have noted a potential change to the comet's color — but, so far, none of them have stuck. Since then, it has sailed through interstellar space, before making its current rendezvous with our solar system. The comet reached its closest point to the sun, known as perihelion, on Oct. 29, when it was mostly hidden from us, reaching a minimum distance of 130 million miles (210 million kilometers) from our home star — around 1.4 times farther from the sun than Earth. The day before, a pair of researchers analyzing data from spacecraft that could still see 3I/ATLAS revealed that the comet had brightened by several orders of magnitude after disappearing from view, which can't be fully explained by its proximity to the sun. This color change is likely the result of a specific gas, such as carbon monoxide or ammonia, leaking from the comet, they argued. (This study has not yet been peer-reviewed, and no other observations have thus far confirmed the blue coloration.) Then, in September, the comet briefly appeared to be turning green, likely due to the presence of dicarbon or cyanide within its coma. But these changes of coloration were only temporary, and it's currently unclear why that is. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. However, it will not be visible to the naked eye, meaning you will need a decent telescope or a pair of stargazing binoculars to see it for yourself. 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to our planet on Dec. 19, coming within a minimum distance of 168 million miles (270 million km) — around 1.8 times the Earth-sun distance. Between now and then, researchers will get a much better look at the comet, enabling them to study it in even greater detail. —Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS transforms into a giant 'cosmic rainbow' in trippy new telescope image —New photos of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS reveal its tail growing before our eyes —NASA telescope spotted rare interstellar comet 2 months before it was officially 'discovered' The extrasolar entity has displayed several unusual traits since it was first discovered, including an abundance of carbon dioxide, high levels of water leakage and a puzzling anti-tail. As a result of these anomalous characteristics, some researchers have controversially proposed that 3I/ATLAS may be a piece of alien technology in disguise. However, there is no solid evidence to support this theory, and most experts maintain that the object is behaving exactly as a comet should.

He specializes in history, space, strange science, and anything out of the ordinary. Our third confirmed interstellar visitor appears to have changed color for the second time. Meanwhile, another team finds that the comet has begun to show signs of non-gravitational acceleration as it approached perihelion. For those of you who haven't been following the story of our third interstellar visitor, on July 1, astronomers at the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) spotted an object hurtling through our Solar System on an escape trajectory. Astronomers have kept a close eye on the object, now known to be a comet due to its distinctive outgassing behavior. Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb has made a big hoo-ha about this fact, suggesting that an alien spacecraft attempting to view our Solar System or destroy the Earth may choose to be out of our view at perihelion in order to disguise a maneuver, redirecting it towards Earth. It's a hypothesis which nearly all astronomers reject, given the cometary behavior, including astronomers at the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) and NASA. Nevertheless, as the comet approached the Sun, it was a key moment to test this highly unlikely hypothesis (aliens have been suggested as an explanation for cosmological mysteries many times, and so far, we have found zero). So, what have we learned as the object approached perihelion? In a new study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, astronomers report that the comet appears to have changed color (for the second time). Using Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO), SOlar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), and weather satellite GOES-19, the team was able to observe 3I/ATLAS as it approached perihelion on October 29. The team found that the object has brightened significantly, to around magnitude 9, making it brighter than many Herschel 400 galaxies, and visible with a small telescope or a decent pair of binoculars. However, as yet there is not a satisfactory explanation for its rapid brightening, which is far in excess of the rate of brightening seen in more-frequently-seen Oort cloud comets. Meanwhile, observations reported by Davide Farnoccia, a navigation engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, indicate that the comet appears to exhibit signs of "non-gravitational acceleration," or acceleration not caused by gravity alone. "The non-gravitational acceleration was measured at the perihelion distance of 1.36 times the Earth-Sun separation (defined as an astronomical unit or `au'), equivalent to 203 million kilometers," Loeb explains in a blog post, adding that it showed a "radial acceleration away from the Sun of 135 kilometers (=9x10^{-7}au) per day squared" and a "transverse acceleration relative to the Sun's direction of 60 kilometers (=4x10^{-7}au) per day squared". Before you scream "DARK FOREST ATTACK" and start building a bunker world around Jupiter, non-gravitational acceleration does not mean that the object moved by itself. In fact, this may be further evidence of its cometary behavior; its acceleration changed as it approached the Sun and began outgassing, losing mass as it did so. "This implies that over the month it takes 3I/ATLAS to cross a spatial scale of order its perihelion separation from the Sun, 3I/ATLAS would lose about a tenth of its mass. The European Space Agency's (ESA's) Juice spacecraft may be able to detect such mass loss during early November. "Our cursory analysis of this data indicates the comet will likely emerge from conjunction considerably brighter than when it entered, with an extrapolated geocentric V magnitude of ∼9 at perihelion, perhaps driven by prominent, visible gas emission," the team explains, though they add that there are several mysteries to clear up (this is only our third confirmed interstellar object, after all). "It is possible that its H2O sublimation had been held down earlier by cooling from its CO2 sublimation, which remained unusually dominant at r ∼ 3 au, perhaps related to its rapid approach toward the Sun compared to other comets." "Without an established physical explanation, the outlook for 3I's postperihelion behavior remains uncertain, and a plateau in brightness—or even a brief continuation of its preperihelion brightening—appears as plausible as rapid fading past perihelion," the team concludes. "Continued observations may help provide a more definitive explanation for the comet's behavior."</p>

Morgan has tried to feed blueberries to Scout in the past, but she never liked them and would always spit them out. The dog gobbled them up and was even excited for seconds. Morgan was also curious about what Scout thinks of Charlie, the other dog they live with. “She was an only child for 10 years, so I know when I got my golden retriever, it was a big adjustment for her, and I feel like this love-hate relationship between them,” Morgan said. The pet psychic asked Scout some questions and determined that Charlie was sometimes her friend. She sees Charlie as a smaller creature, such as the size of a Shih Tzu, even though they are both about the same size. Then, Scout brought up duck in the context of food, which genuinely shocked Morgan. They had competed in hunting competitions before, and Scout would retrieve ducks. Apparently, Scout was ready to get back out there and compete. She wanted to participate in more exercises involving agility.

A popular UFO-reporting app has been making waves after reportedly recording tens of thousands of mysterious underwater objects up and down the United States' coastlines, raising eyebrows and leaving experts with more questions than answers. Enigma, a non-partisan organization that boasts its "largest query-able historical sighting database for global UFO sightings," has reportedly recorded roughly 30,000 UFO sightings since its launch in 2022. Researchers from Taiwan University say they have discovered a serum that could potentially regrow hair in just 20 days. Researchers rubbed fatty acids onto mice's skin to determine whether it would spark hair growth in these areas. While the Trump administration announced on Nov. 3 that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) will be partially funded, it still remains unclear when SNAP benefits will be allocated, and that is having a negative impact on Native American communities, which is more than twice as likely to rely on the benefits. "Food insecurity is tied to housing instability, so we are very prepared now to see individuals who are going to choose between putting food on the table or paying their rent," said Native Connections Senior Director of Housing Maltilde Serena-Jordan. An Avondale man who was reported missing almost a week ago has been found dead. According to an Avondale Police statement released today, the body of 70-year-old Robert Jones was found on Nov. 2 in a farm area.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Strange glassy blobs strewn across the Australian desert are evidence of an ancient meteorite impact that scientists hadn't noticed until now. According to a new analysis led by geoscientist Anna Musolino of Aix-Marseille University in France, tiny spheres of glass found in South Australia represent an impact-melt composition not found anywhere else in the world. These newly named ananguites, the researchers say, formed in a giant impact that took place some 11 million years ago. The sting in this particular tail is that geologists have yet to find any trace of a crater associated with this event – an event powerful enough to leave mineral traces that persist in detectable quantities for millions of years. Related: A Massive Geological Surprise Has Been Discovered Under Greenland's Ice Sheet "These glasses are unique to Australia and have recorded an ancient impact event we did not even know about," says geochronologist and geochemist Fred Jourdan of Curtin University in Australia. "They formed when an  asteroid slammed into Earth, melting surface rock and scattering debris for thousands of kilometres. These tiny pieces of glass are like little time capsules from deep in our planet's history. The desert across southern Australia is positively strewn with tiny beads of impact glass called tektites. It's part of a region known as the Australasian strewnfield, the fallout created by a giant meteorite impact thought to have hit somewhere in Southeast Asia around 788,000 years ago. The tektites from this fallout found in Australia are known as australites, and they're particularly abundant partly because the suspected impact took place a relatively short time ago. They noted the strangeness of this, suggesting the eight beads may have formed in a separate impact, but no one ever really followed up. The original eight samples were unavailable for re-analysis, but luckily Chapman and Scheiber had provided a detailed chemical description of the oddballs. To confirm, Musolino and her colleagues performed argon dating on two of the six samples; Jourdan and other researchers had used the same technique in 2019 to date tektites scattered around Southeast Asia and Australia to 788,000 years old. Where that impact took place, however, is still a big mystery. That's not surprising given the source crater of the Australasian strewnfield tektites is still unknown, considered something of a "holy grail" for impact cratering science. There are also a few reasons why the ananguite source crater might have vanished, including intense weathering and the aridification of central Australia that started around 33 million years ago. It may also have been mistaken for a volcanic feature in regions such as Papua New Guinea. The findings have been published in Earth & Planetary Science Letters.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Home » China » Psychic Predicts Coup to Oust Xi Jinping as Yu Menglong Death Mystery Deepens Meanwhile, Taiwanese entertainment manager Sun Derong, who has repeatedly spoken out on Yu's behalf, said he received numerous death threats from mainland Douyin (the TikTok version of China) users who predicted he would die on Oct. 25. RELATED: Yu Menglong's Spirit Message (III): Karma, Justice, and the Fate of His Killers Since Sept. 11, more than 600,000 people worldwide have now signed petitions demanding a full, independent investigation into Yu's death. “Justice may be late,” one fan wrote, “but it won't stay hazy forever.” In an Oct. 28 livestream titled: “Any Update on Who Killed Yu Menglong?”, William alleged that Yu's killers were “being protected” and that some are “burning evidence.” She also claimed Yu's former agent — whom she called the “devil agent” — had fled to Taiwan and that the agency itself would soon face boycotts, financial collapse, and eventual closure. William warned that those involved would suffer karmic retribution, adding that they had “used witchcraft or black magic” against her, but it had backfired, leaving them “prematurely aged.” Calling China's judiciary “too corrupt” to deliver justice, she predicted “street justice” and a public reckoning by November. Regarding Sun Derong, William reaffirmed that he is “safe under public protection in Taiwan” and reportedly battling bladder cancer. Around the same time, Chinese netizens reported fires breaking out at several companies in Jiaozhou, Shandong, allegedly registered under Yu Menglong's name. Others noted that the term “Jiaozhou fire” had become a banned keyword and hashtag on Chinese platforms. “If it were just an accident,” one commenter noted, “Why rush to delete everything?” Tai had previously claimed during an Oct. 23 stream that the culprits were planning to burn items stored inside Beijing's 798 Art Museum. With the new fires reported, supporters now fear that critical evidence could have been lost forever. William went further, alleging that Yu's remains had been stolen and were secretly stored in a museum. MORE ON THIS: Insider Alleges Yu Menglong's Body Was Hidden in a Beijing Art Museum Linked to State-Owned Firms On Oct. 17, an X account named “News Investigation” shared footage that appeared to show multiple bystanders at the scene. A woman's scream is heard in the background, with commenters speculating she was later killed. In her most recent livestream, Ty William made sweeping predictions about political turmoil inside China, declaring: “November will be a turning point for China.” She claims that a cascade of scandal videos involving major celebrities will erupt, followed by “unprecedented political chaos.” According to her, nine PLA generals have already been removed and eight key figures are secretly planning a coup to overthrow China's top leader: Xi Jinping.
