                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is an updated version of an article published last month when Max Dowman became Arsenal's youngest-ever starter in the Carabao Cup tie against Brighton. Max Dowman has become the youngest player to feature in a Champions League match after coming on in the 72nd minute for Arsenal against Club Brugge on Tuesday night. Dowman, who is 15 years and 308 days old, has beaten the previous record set by Youssoufa Moukoko, who came on for Borussia Dortmund in December 2020 at the age of 16 years and 18 days. Mikel Arteta, the Arsenal manager, knows he has an exceptional talent at his disposal and has shown he believes Dowman, who is yet to finish secondary school, can compete at the highest level. Dowman began training with Arteta and the first team last season before making his unofficial first-team debut against Milan in a friendly this July. Versatile with a multifaceted skill set, he has been deployed as a right-winger, central midfielder and in the No 10 role throughout his time in the club's academy. He made his first appearance at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium for the under-18s against Manchester United in the FA Youth Cup, two months after turning 15, and often found himself being triple-marked. Arteta spoke about Dowman several times last season and made it clear he would be taking the teenager on the club's pre-season tour to Singapore and Hong Kong. Already playing three years above his age at the club's Hale End academy, he soon found himself being double-marked by Tottenham Hotspur's Djed Spence and Son Heung-min (now at Los Angeles FC) during one of the friendly matches in Asia. Dowman was arguably Arsenal's best player on tour and it came as little surprise when Arteta included him in the squad for their 5-0 win against Leeds United in the Premier League on August 23. At 15 years 235 days, he became the second-youngest player in Premier League history to make their debut after Ethan Nwaneri, his Arsenal team-mate who made his top-flight bow at 15 years and 181 days against Brentford in September 2022. He has now made five appearances for the under-19s, three of them starts, and scored in their most recent match, a 7-0 win against Wales. After Arsenal's 3-2 friendly defeat against Villarreal on August 6, Arteta praised Dowman's “efficiency that he shows in every attack and action”, describing it as “incredible”. “It's been so fast,” Arteta said of Dowman's development. Following his excellent cameo against Leeds, Arteta told Sky Sports: “It is great to change the energy in the stadium by bringing him in and he had an impact. He won a penalty on his debut at the Emirates. They are not overwhelmed by the environment and context.” As well as playing above his age group in Arsenal's academy, and for the first team, Dowman has also been playing higher up in the England setup. Back in May, before representing Arsenal's first team, Dowman was playing for England at the Under-17s European Championship, and his dribbling ability stood out as he made several mazy runs. When he played for England's under-19s against their Spanish counterparts in San Pedro del Pinatar in September, our correspondent Guillermo Rai was at the game and noted that Dowman was “fouled at least nine times during the game, with anger at the treatment he received spilling over into a confrontation between players from both sides after the final whistle”. He still cannot change in the same dressing room as the first-team squad due to his young age, but Dowman's ceiling looks to be incredibly high. The Arsenal manager, however, will want to protect him and ensure that his development continues responsibly. Boasting a strength in depth that few clubs can match, Arteta can continue easing in Dowman slowly, rather than rushing his progress — but it seems inevitable that at some point over the next couple of years, the teenager will cement his name in Arsenal's starting XI.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Portland isn't just where I play, it's home,” Moultrie said. “The community, fans, energy at Providence Park, it's all part of who I am now. Trailblazer, phenom, historic, and a relentless desire to succeed are just a few of the many phrases used to describe Moultrie's professional journey since she officially signed for Portland in 2021, at the time becoming the youngest NWSL player at 15 years old. "We are thrilled to extend Olivia as a Thorn for the foreseeable future” said President and General Manager of Soccer Operations Jeff Agoos. We are proud of her commitment to remain in an environment that will continue to shape her into a world class player and compete for championships each year. She has worked hard to become a leader on this team, and we are happy that Portland will be her home." Moultrie's extension arrives during a career season for the five-year pro, fresh from helping Portland secure their league leading ninth-consecutive playoff appearance (2016-19, 2021-25) and 11th overall postseason appearance. She finished as Portland's top goal scorer and became the NWSL's highest scoring teenager this past September. As a Thorn, Moultrie has appeared in 95 NWSL matches with 65 starts, accumulating 18 goals and 11 assists whilst being a major contributor to the 2022 NWSL Championship, 2021 NWSL Shield and 2021 Challenge Cup winning campaigns (still holding the honor of being the youngest player to win a league championship at 17 in 2022). “Every time I step on the field at Providence Park, I feel the energy of this city and these fans, there's nothing like it,” Moultrie added. “I want to pay back the loyalty that this community has shown me with as many wins and trophies as possible. This is where I became who I am, and getting to keep writing my story here is something really special. The Thorns have an impressive history and winning in our DNA. In addition to her success with Portland, Moultrie has continued her climb as a rising star for the U.S. Women's National Team. She currently has (10) caps with the USWNT since making her senior international debut in 2023, tallying four goals and an assist for the Stars and Stripes while also lifting the Concacaf W Gold Cup and SheBelieves Cup in 2024. By reaching a multi-year extension agreement with Moultrie, the Thorns showcase their commitment to retain top young talent and construct a squad capable of competing for championships to ensure Portland remains the most successful in the NWSL, evident in the Club's league record three NWSL Championships (2013, 2017, 2022), two NWSL Shields (2016, 2021) and NWSL Challenge Cup (2021). Founded in 2012, the Portland Thorns have set the standard for fan support and on-field success in women's soccer since its inaugural 2013 season. One of the world's most supported women's soccer clubs, Portland has led the league in attendance for eight seasons and set a new club playoff attendance record with 25,218 fans supporting Thorns FC in the 2023 semifinal match at Providence Park. Thorns FC have won the NWSL Championship a league-record three times (2013, 2017, 2022) and finished as runners-up in 2018. “Portland isn't just where I play, it's home,” Moultrie said. “The community, fans, energy at Providence Park, it's all part of who I am now.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cristiano Ronaldo has revealed in a new interview with Piers Morgan that he doesn't expect to extend his history-making football career for that much longer, also admitting that his interests in retirement will ultimately lie outside the sport he has dedicated his life to. It comes after the Portuguese icon had been billed as "perfect" for a role upstairs at former club Manchester United. Having chosen Piers Morgan for an incendiary interview marking his exit from Manchester United in 2022, Ronaldo again linked up with the divisive media personality, this time on YouTube channel Piers Morgan Uncensored. "Soon," Ronaldo replied, revealing he has been thinking about how it will go for years. "It will be very, very difficult but I've prepared my future since [I was] 25, 26, 27 years old. There will be lots of calls for Ronaldo to stay in football when he eventually does hang up his boots, with a wealth of expertise and experience to share. But coaching, management or executive roles within the sport don't appear to appeal to the five-time Ballon d'Or winner. "Nothing will compare to the adrenaline we have for football to score a goal," Ronaldo explained, revealing that retiring from football will finally give him the time to pursue other things. [When I retire] I'm going to have more time for me, have more time for my family, to raise my kids. I like to see UFC, the fights. Because I live football 24 hours [each day] to do the right things and perform." Ronaldo's desire to do things with his life other than football suggests leaving the sport altogether, which means recent speculation that he could consider a post-playing career in the boardroom, potentially even back at Manchester United, is quite unlikely to come to fruition. Former team-mate Wes Brown, who won the Champions League alongside Ronaldo in 2008, had said he wouldn't put it past Ronaldo to remain involved in football that way. "He could definitely move into the boardroom," Brown said. "He's got the ability to swerve away from coaching and into the executive level, 100 per cent. Ronaldo probably isn't going to call time on his career before the end of his Al-Nassr contract. Aside from it being incredibly lucrative – worth a reported €257m (£235m/$280m) per year – the veteran forward is still freely scoring for the club and continues to chase trophies. The lack of a major domestic or international trophy since moving to Saudi Arabia – the 2023 Arab Club Champions Cup is the only silverware so far – is a notable blot on Ronaldo's record. Al-Nassr have seen both Al-Ittihad and Al-Hilal win the Pro League in recent seasons, while the King's Cup and wider continental success has also been beyond them. So far in 2025-26, though, Al-Nassr lead the way in the domestic table with a 100 per cent record after seven games. They are only competing in the secondary AFC club competitions this season, but could feasibly be back in the Champions League Elite next year - potentially Ronaldo's last dance in football. Next summer also comes Ronaldo's last crack at the World Cup with Portugal.</p>

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trent Alexander-Arnold was labelled a "rat" as his famous Liverpool mural was vandalised ahead of the defender's return to Anfield with Real Madrid. Having joined Liverpool's academy at just six years old, he went on to make 354 appearances and lift every major club trophy available. When Alexander-Arnold opted to leave on a free transfer to Real Madrid rather than extend his contract, that bond with the Kop was shattered. Liverpool, desperate not to lose their vice-captain for nothing, reluctantly agreed to a £10 million compensation deal that allowed him to join the Spanish giants ahead of the Club World Cup. The mural, which is painted on Sybil Road just a stone's throw from Anfield, remains a proud monument celebrating local success. The image was created by renowned French graffiti artist Akse and was commissioned by Liverpool podcast The Anfield Wrap. It carried a touching quote from the player himself: "I'm just a normal lad from Liverpool whose dream has come true." Now, before his return to Merseyside, the mural has been defaced. Graffiti reading "adios el rata", Spanish for 'goodbye rat', was also emblazoned across the mural. Back in 2022, ahead of a Merseyside derby, vandals struck again, splashing blue paint across the street art in what appeared to be an Everton-inspired jibe. Despite the backlash, Alexander-Arnold revealed that his feelings for Liverpool remain the same and no amount of hatred will change that. Speaking to Prime Video Sport ahead of Tuesday's Champions League clash, he said: "When the draw was announced, I think everyone kind of knew it was going to happen, it was destined for that fixture to come. Obviously, they're a top team, so I knew at some point I'd end up going back there or playing against Liverpool. No matter what, my feelings won't change towards Liverpool. I've got memories there that will last me a lifetime and, no matter how I'm received, that won't change." Alexander-Arnold's participation on Tuesday night remains doubtful, however, with Real Madrid boss Xabi Alonso confirming that the defender is still on a strict rehabilitation plan after suffering a hamstring injury against Marseille in the Champions League, just 10 minutes into the match at the Santiago Bernabeu. Madrid's medical team are aware of the risks and has advised caution to avoid a recurrence. Though he featured on the bench for both El Clasico and Madrid's weekend La Liga clash against Valencia, the England star has yet to play a single minute since returning to full training. Sources suggest he may be included among the substitutes for a late cameo, but a starting role appears 'highly unlikely'. With Dani Carvajal also sidelined, Alonso is expected to persist with Federico Valverde as a makeshift right-back; a tactical switch that has paid off handsomely in recent weeks. "We need him because he has tremendous quality. For many Liverpool fans, watching Alexander-Arold line up, even on the bench, in Madrid white at Anfield will feel surreal. This was the lad from West Derby who grew up idolising Steven Gerrard, who lifted the Champions League and Premier League as one of their own. Now, the same fans who once sang his name may well jeer it. The atmosphere will be tense, and it remains to be seen if Alonso throws him into the mix.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alonso was appointed Madrid manager in May (Oscar Del Pozo/AFP/Getty Images) Alonso was appointed Madrid manager in May (Oscar Del Pozo/AFP/Getty Images) The Athletic has live coverage of Liverpool vs. Real Madrid from Tuesday's Champions League action. Real Madrid lead Barcelona by five points in La Liga, having won 10 of their 11 matches so far. It's been an impressive start for coach Xabi Alonso — who was appointed as Carlo Ancelotti's replacement at the end of last season. The complaints from some Madrid squad members came as something of a surprise, given how Alonso's close and positive relationships with players led to outstanding successes in previous senior roles with Real Sociedad B and Bayer Leverkusen. After retiring as a player at Bayern Munich at the age of 35 in 2017, Alonso's first steps in coaching came during the 2018-19 season, when his Under-14 Real Madrid team went unbeaten as they won regional league and cup titles. That squad of mostly local Basque youngsters all had huge respect, if not awe, for Alonso, who came through at Real Sociedad himself in 2000, before going on to win Champions League titles at Liverpool and Real Madrid, and a World Cup and two European Championships with Spain. “There is nobody better than (Alonso) to convince these players, not just what it means to play well, but to be part of our model,” former Real Sociedad sporting director Roberto Olabe, now at Aston Villa, told The Athletic in November 2021. Alonso's charges over three years with Real Sociedad's reserves included future first-teamers Ander Barrenetxea, Benat Turrientes and Martin Zubimendi, who is now with Arsenal and a regular in Spain's midfield. “We had a pretty strong relationship,” Zubimendi told El Pais in 2023. It was clear that Alonso built a strong relationship with his players. “What I care about in a manager, and all the managers I've had, is how they are, how they treat people,” Lukas Hradecky, Bayer Leverkusen and Finland goalkeeper, told the Bundesliga website in April 2024. Such a close relationship with his players did not mean that Alonso was not strict about what he wanted from them,  however, as Leverkusen left-back Alex Grimaldo told The Athletic in March that year. I like to see how he also encourages the younger players. When Alonso arrived at Madrid in May this year, there was a lot of interest in whether he would be able to transfer the methods that served him so well in his past jobs, given the different challenges involved when dealing with a dressing room full of superstar talents and egos. Training sessions now feature a lot of thorough tactical work, both individual and collective. Players are given detailed videos to study what is expected of them during games. In response to a feeling that standards had dropped towards the end of Ancelotti's four years in charge, the new boss has also imposed further sharpness and discipline around training — including players having to drop for press-ups if they did not react quickly enough during drills during the Club World Cup. Speaking to The Athletic in July, a source close to a squad member wondered whether such intensity and specific instruction would be “sustainable” over the long term, and whether established players would have the “humility” to accept Alonso's ideas. Another to show discomfort at Alonso's management is Federico Valverde, who has spoken publicly about his frustrations at not being able to show his best form in the team's new midfield setup, and his dissatisfaction at playing right-back, where Alonso has been using him because of injuries to Dani Carvajal and Trent Alexander-Arnold. Others in the dressing room are enjoying Alonso's regime much more — with Kylian Mbappe, Arda Guler, Aurelien Tchouameni, Eder Militao and Alvaro Carreras among those thriving under his management. At his Bernabeu presentation in late May, Alonso paid tribute to Ancelotti's influence on the squad he was inheriting. He also said he had learned a lot from all his past coaches but added: “You need to have your own ideas and your own personality.” Following the situation closely is ex-Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher, who told The Athletic that it looks like his former Anfield team-mate Alonso is closer to Guardiola and Mourinho than Ancelotti or Del Bosque. It'll be really interesting to see if his way can work. “The greatest success they have had has been with managers like Ancelotti and Del Bosque, who are not seen as stuck to a certain system or formation or philosophy. During his time as a player at Liverpool, Alonso and then-manager Benitez did not have the warmest relationship, leading to his transfer to Real Madrid in 2009, a situation which Carragher now says was “daft” and could have been resolved better by both parties. Benitez is among those coaches who look to control many details, an approach that did not work out well for him in a six-month spell at Madrid that ended in January 2016. Asked by The Athletic whether Alonso the player liked to be told what to do out on the pitch, Carragher reflected that most managers at most clubs want to monitor their players closely, but then Madrid are not most clubs. “That would be the case with most people in football. From the outside, Real Madrid is a little bit different on that score.” Dermot joined The Athletic in 2020 and has been our main La Liga Correspondent up until now.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cristiano Ronaldo says that he will consider retiring from football “soon” and will “probably cry” when the time comes for him to leave the game behind. The Portugal forward, who has a contract with Al-Nassr until 2027, has netted 952 goals in his career so far and wants to reach 1000 before he hangs up his boots. Ronaldo also intends on playing at next summer's FIFA World Cup in North America in the hope of winning the one trophy that has thus far eluded him. Although the former Manchester United and Real Madrid star claims lifting the World Cup “is not a dream for me”. “Winning one tournament doesn't prove you're one of the greatest players in history,” he said on Piers Morgan Uncensored. “It's just six or seven matches — that's not fair.” Asked when he might consider retiring, Ronaldo replied: “Soon. “But, I have prepared my future since [the age of] 25, 26, 27 years old.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The World Cup is likely to rule out Manchester United going on another mini tour as soon as the season ends next year – and could have a significant bearing on their pre-season plans, too. The World Cup final will take place on July 19 at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, and United are set to go on tour shortly afterwards. Sources stress that a decision has yet to be made and all options remain open, with the current focus on agreeing a mid-season friendly in Saudi Arabia which would compensate for the loss of the post-season trip. But having toured the US for the last three summers in conjunction with a £60m-a-year sponsorship deal with Snapdragon, there is a feeling that United might be better off exploring the Asian market again next year. Ruben Amorim is taking a hands-on approach with Shea Lacey's progression towards the first team. Lacey featured in the Under 21s' first Premier League 2 defeat of the season on Friday night, but was not involved in the National League Cup against Rochdale last Tuesday as part of pre-planning from Amorim and director of football Jason Wilcox. Confidential exclusively revealed how Amorim and Lacey have had numerous one-to-one conversations around the training ground in recent weeks, and his increasing involvement with the first-team group has seen a greater focus on mapping out his route to a debut. ‘He's had a good few days with the first team (last week). We speak every day with the first team and get a week ahead in terms of what games he's going to play and what's right for him. ‘I saw Jason at Barnsley and you have conversations with him, (academy head) Stephen Torpey, Ruben and (assistant) Carlos (Fernandes) around who, where, when, what. ‘We are trying to get ahead of it by planning around the games, and you can't do that without the dialogue that we have.' For Lacey, who is best suited playing in a right attacking midfielder role, the aim is to play a part with the first team when Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui head off to the Africa Cup of Nations, which begins on December 21. Lisandro Martinez could join up with Argentina in the international break, even though he might not have made his comeback for United after a long-term knee injury. Martinez is back in full training for the first time since rupturing an ACL in early February, but Amorim is being careful not to rush the 27-year-old defender. It's understood that United feel Martinez's recovery may be better served by training at a high level with Argentina rather than staying at Carrington when most of his team-mates will be away on international duty and the remainder will be having some time off and lighter workouts. Martinez was hoping to be back in action before the break but only has one more opportunity at Tottenham on Saturday, and Amorim hasn't been taking any chances. He started training with us, but we had to change some things in the exercises for him. Roma are expected to revive their interest in Joshua Zirkzee in the January transfer window as the Dutchman's career at United continues to stagnate. Confidential revealed last month that Zirkzee would look to go out on loan in search of first-team football ahead of the World Cup if his playing time at United doesn't increase. Roma made an unsuccessful bid to sign Zirkzee in the summer and are set to try again for the forward who made his name playing for Bologna in Serie A before moving to Old Trafford in a £36.5m deal. Amorim admitted last week that he expects unsettled stars like Zirkzee and Kobbie Mainoo to ask to go out on loan. United are set to resist calls to relax their season-ticket attendance rules after they were handed an ‘unprecedented' run of midweek and night-time kick-offs. Amorim's side will not play a Premier League match at Old Trafford on a weekend for at least 105 days – between October 3 and January 17 – after several of their games were moved for TV coverage. That will be repeated this week before United face Tottenham, but won't be an issue again for quite a while with the next away game on a Saturday not scheduled until Amorim's side travel to Arsenal in late January. Confidential can reveal they have done just that with two high-profile games that will see the United youngsters host South African side Kaizer Chiefs at Carrington, while also taking on Arsenal in a match at St George's Park. The Kaizer Chiefs are travelling over for a mini-tour of the UK, with further games expected against Leeds United and QPR. Binnion said: ‘Those fixtures plus the two added as a whole give us a fantastic games programme with a variety of experiences, which is what we want to make sure all the players are getting the opportunity that they need.' It was noteworthy to see Under 18s manager Darren Fletcher on the touchline for the past two Under 21 matches – but it is not a long-term role. Confidential understands Alan Wright, Binnion's usual assistant in that age-group, has been granted some time away to deal with a personal issue and Fletcher has stepped in. What it did present on Friday night was the rare opportunity for Fletcher to coach one of his own sons, in this case Tyler. His other son Jack watched from the stands after picking up an injury in first-team training. He is expected to be back involved for Tuesday's match-up against Notts County. Earps' new book, and in particular the comments about her England rival Hannah Hampton and coach Sarina Wiegman, have caused quite a controversy. After beating Atletico Madrid and Valerenga, PSG represent the biggest test so far for United, who are looking forward to welcoming back Earps in front of a big crowd at Old Trafford. Bruno Fernandes walked out for United's game against Brighton at Old Trafford with Paul Brand's two young sons as part of the club's farewell to their outgoing head of performance analysis. Brand is leaving United after 12 years to become the football intelligence lead at UEFA. As well as his sons being mascots, Brand was presented with a framed No 12 shirt by Fernandes who gave a speech in front of players and staff at Carrington on Friday. ‘To see my boys walk out with Bruno at Old Trafford – followed by a simply incredible send-off from all players and staff – it's been the perfect ending to this chapter of my career, and life.'</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Reigning World Cup holders Spain and two-time European champions England have been drawn together in the same group of the European Qualifiers. In one of the standout outcomes, holders Spain and two-time European champions England will go head-to-head in League A Group A3, which also features Iceland and Ukraine, after the draw was made in Nyon, Switzerland, today (Tuesday, 4 November) The league phase for nations in Europe will be played across six matchdays between March and June 2026, with the four League A group winners qualifying directly for the finals in Brazil in two years, and additional spots determined through a two-round play-off system, with one additional berth available through the inter-confederation play-offs.

Europe has been allocated 11 direct qualification spots for the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup, with one additional potential place via the inter-confederation play-offs. The UEFA Women's European Qualifiers are divided into three leagues — A, B, and C — based on Nations League rankings. All remaining League A teams proceed to the play-offs. The League B winners, runners-up and third-place teams, and League C group winners plus the two best runners-up, all advance to the two-round play-off stage held between October and December 2026. The headline result from the draw can obviously be found in group A3, where old rivals England and Spain meet once again. England enter the campaign as reigning European champions, having defended their continental title under Sarina Wiegman in 2025. Spain, meanwhile, arrive as current world champions, still riding the momentum from their triumph at the 2023 World Cup and recent Nations League success. Their meeting in Group A3 sets up a high-profile rematch between two sides who have dominated the international stage in recent years — Spain defeating England in the 2023 World Cup final, before the Lionesses edged a dramatic shootout victory over La Roja in the 2025 UEFA Women's EURO final.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Marcus Rashford reveals which Barcelona players have impressed him since joining the club. Pedri's injury absence could hardly have come at a worse time for Barcelona or Spain. However, for everyone who's been arguing that Barça and the reigning European champions are far too dependent on their little midfield genius, it's come at the perfect time to test the contenders to his throne. It's also a great moment to examine how coaches Hansi Flick and Luis De La Fuente try to cope in the coming weeks while Pedri recovers from a thigh injury. Here are the stark facts: Barcelona are five points behind LaLiga leaders Real Madrid and outside the Champions League top eight -- which means they'd have to enter the playoff round if they are still there at the end of the league phase -- but need to play Celta Vigo, Real Betis, Club Brugge and FIFA Club World Cup champions Chelsea away from home without their best player this season. In fact, he's arguably been Europe's best midfielder this season. Spain, for whom Pedri has been man of the match in each of their last two wins, need good results away against Georgia and at home to Turkey to ensure they win Group E and qualify directly for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. A draw (or defeat) in Tbilisi with Turkey winning their last two fixtures, including against Spain in Seville later this month, would leave La Roja second in the group and needing to sweat it next March against other runners-up. - Yamal paid Clásico price for outburst, but others let him down - Barça's Yamal the youngest named to FIFPRO World XI - Flick asks Rashford to make more from chances If you've been watching the darting, daring, delightful Canary Islander who turns 23 in a couple of weeks, then you'll already be nodding in agreement. Pedri is a man of solutions, a player tailor-made to complement forwards who crave being given the ball in advantageous situations. It partly explains why a more threatening, competitive, quicker Madrid only scored twice instead of the six or seven they threatened to. A really dramatic drop-off; Elche used that ball gain not only to score, but to hit the woodwork twice, although they still lost 3-1 (stream a replay on ESPN+ in the U.S.). Elche's own match report on their official website even said: "Pedri's absence obliged Frenkie De Jong to 'multiply himself' and when he tired in the final third of the match, Barcelona weren't able to keep the ball, threaten us or play consistently." LaLiga lists Pedri as the guy who's made most passes (893) this season even after missing 90 minutes on Sunday. Football publication Marca list him as the third-best in LaLiga at "recuperating" possession (behind Álvaro Carreras and Luis Milla, who've each played a game more) with 65 successes. And in Europe, UEFA's Champions League stats show that Pedri is just outside the top five midfielders for successful/accurate/completed passes this season (193), but that he's got a higher pass accuracy (94.3%) than each of the players who have completed a higher number of passes than him. Those who care about Barcelona will wince at the memory of Xavi's last season in charge, and how they tried defending their LaLiga title without Pedri. Barcelona lost both Clásicos that year -- one when he was out injured and the other when he was just back but nowhere near fully match-fit. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. And just to tie a ribbon on all this, the only two matches De La Fuente has lost as Spain coach in 90 minutes (a Euro 2024 qualifier in Scotland and a friendly against Colombia) both took place when Pedri was out injured. While Pedri recovers, the natural new partner for De Jong is Marc Casadó. He had utterly brilliant assists for Robert Lewandowski and Raphinha against Real Madrid and Bayern Munich at this stage last season -- plus a five-star, man-of-the-match performance on his full debut for Spain in a 3-2 win against Switzerland in Tenerife. He tends to play as a deeper-lying midfielder -- someone who's on the ball less often, but is more dedicated to defensive organisation. All-round, Casadó is fun to watch and a fanatical fan of the club he plays for. When picked in the XI, Casadó will liberate De Jong -- or Dani Olmo, Fermín López or Marc Bernal, all of whom can play No. one for which he's yearned, and one for which he needed the help of a sports psychologist in order to wait patiently. Casadó told Mundo Deportivo: "I'm very ambitious, and that can sometimes backfire. My family and friends calm me a lot, and finding a sports psychologist helped when I was working my hardest, but not getting game time. So frustrating to know that I was giving it my all, but at the same time, to hear the subconscious voice that I could give more! "Working with professionals helped me stay calmer because not everything depends on you. You have to stay calm in your work and keep doing the same thing." I'll bow to no one in my view that while Pedri's a whole different creative force and, on his day, the best midfielder in the world, Casadó is genuinely exceptional. Smart, quick, tough, talented and competitive -- so many clubs would bite Barcelona's hand off to have him. Whether there's enough time for Casadó to oust others in the Spain national team depends on how fit and available legends like Fabián Ruiz and Rodri are, having suffered difficulties in the last few months. Mikel Merino and Martín Zubimendi would be ahead in the queue too, with Olmo and Fermín (now fit) firm De La Fuente favourites. It's time for club and country to demonstrate that despite appearances to the contrary, they don't suffer with dependency on Pedri at all.</p>

An Auckland football club has been targeted in a cyber security attack, with hackers posting sexual images to its social media account. Auckland City FC captured global headlines in June amid their participation as the only amateur club in the Fifa Club World Cup. Now, the Sandringham-based club is making headlines again – this time as the apparent victim of a cyber attack. A series of images showing women in compromising positions have flooded one of the club's verified social media accounts with more than 100,000 followers. The risque content is yet to be deleted. “The hackers have kicked out all the administrators so we have no control... we can't remove anything,” they said. A statement posted to the club's website on Monday said the safety and integrity of its digital platforms are of “utmost importance”. “We are taking all necessary steps to restore normal operations. “We appreciate the patience and understanding of our supporters during this time. After losing their opening match 10-0 to Bayern Munich, they were handed a 6-0 defeat at the hands of Benfica. The club are currently fifth on the New Zealand National League ladder, with two wins from five matches and eight points.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Watching Tyler Adams on the field for Bournemouth against mighty Manchester City on Sunday felt like a microcosm of the U.S. men's national team's roller coaster current reality. And although the USMNT's medical staff is "optimistic it's not bad," as a source texted me on Monday morning, there's no guarantee that the 2022 World Cup captain will be available for selection when coach Mauricio Pochettino names his final roster of 2025 later this week ahead of two friendlies. Tyler Adams and Christian Pulisic are trying to return from recent knocks. Star forward Christian Pulisic has yet to return for AC Milan since injuring his hamstring on Oct. 14 while representing the U.S. in its 2-1 exhibition win over Australia. Even if he returns for the Rossoneri for next weekend's Serie A contest against Parma (which features Miami-born U-20 World Cup Golden Boot winner Benjamin Cremaschi), Pochettino could grant Milan's wish to let Pulisic remain in Italy this month. No room for: Zack Steffen, Roman Celentano, Jonathan Klinsmann, Ethan Horvath, Diego Kochen Turner's season is already done; the Americans' 2022 starter and his New England Revolution didn't qualify for the postseason, but his experience should get him an invitation. Schulte was involved last month; he and the Columbus Crew meet rival FC Cincinnati in a decisive Game 3 this weekend. Predicted in camp (9): Noahkai Banks, Chris Richards, Tim Ream, Mark McKenzie, Miles Robinson, Max Arfsten, Sergiño Dest, Alex Freeman, Kristoffer Lund No room for: Joe Scally, DeJuan Jones, Shaq Moore, John Tolkin, Auston Trusty, Walker Zimmerman All-world left back "Jedi" Robinson didn't suit up for Fulham on Saturday, the fourth straight Premier League game he's missed because of lingering problems with his surgically repaired right knee. Jedi is still working his way back from an lingering knee injury. Ream, who has served as Pochettino's first-choice captain, isn't far behind. Arfsten scored the winner for the Crew on Sunday in MLS Cup playoff action and is in line to start both November games with Jedi missing. The uncapped, 18-year-old Banks rebounded from his worst outing as a pro with a fine performance for Augsburg in last Friday's narrow loss to Borussia Dortmund. With four consecutive Bundesliga starts, he's in line to make his debut this month. Meanwhile, Miles Robinson (who started against Ecuador and Australia in October) and McKenzie (who went the full 90 minutes vs. the Socceroos) should both return. Predicted in camp (8): Tyler Adams, Sebastian Berhalter, Johnny Cardoso, Diego Luna,  Weston McKennie, Yunus Musah, Cristian Roldan, Tanner Tessmann No room for: Paxten Aaronson, Benjamin Cremaschi, Gianluca Busio, Luca de la Torre, James Sands,  Aidan Morris, Gio Reyna Despite another coaching change at Juventus, McKennie kept his spot for Luciano Spalletti's debut, going 85 minutes in a 2-1 win over Cremonese. Spalletti is the fourth full-time manager McKennie has played under in his six seasons with Juve. Still, the November window represents Pochettino's last chance to see both players for four months. Cardoso, who was on Atléti's bench this weekend for the first time since August, has been bothered by ankle issues since the Gold Cup. On Saturday, Musah was an unused substitute for the third time in four Serie A games. Like Pulisic, Gold Cup standout Malik Tillman hasn't played for his club since picking up a hamstring ailment of his own while on international duty. The rugged Morris could benefit if either Cardoso or Musah aren't called, having recently won back his starting job with a Middlesbrough side that is aiming for Premier League promotion. In San Diego, Gold Cup starter De la Torre has been supplanted in former USMNT interim boss Mikey Varas' XI by 35-year-old Panamanian Anibal Godoy for the MLS playoffs. Sands had a rough outing in St. Pauli's Bundesliga loss to Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday. Predicted in camp (6): Brenden Aaronson, Tim Weah; Patrick Agyemang, Folarin Balogun, Ricardo Pepi, Haji Wright Ricardo Pepi could be finally back in a USMNT camp this week. Balogun still returns as the incumbent frontrunner for striker position after his standout performances in September and October. Wright's a no-brainer following his spectacular brace vs. the Aussies last month. But Aaronson has earned his way back into Pochettino's plans with a string of fine showings in the Premier League, including his first goal of the season in Leeds' recent 2-1 win over West Ham.
