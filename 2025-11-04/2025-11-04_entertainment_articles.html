                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Ian McKellen and Tramell Tillman are set to join Ebenezer: A Christmas Carol, Paramount and Ti West‘s new take on the classic Charles Dickens novel with Johnny Depp starring in the titular role. Nathaniel Halpern penned the script, with Emma Watts producing. The classic Dickens story has seen its fair share of retellings over the years with its tale of an elderly miser visited by the ghost of his former business partner and the spirits of Christmas Past, Christmas Present and Christmas Yet to Come. This also marks the second Christmas Carol pic announced this year after Warner Bros put in development an adaptation from Robert Eggers with Willem Dafoe in line to play Scrooge. The Depp version, a thrilling ghost story set in Dickens' London, follows one man's supernatural journey to face his past, present and future and fight for a second chance. While not confirmed, sources say Tillman will play the Ghost of Christmas Present. It is unknown who McKellen will play. Stephen Deuters and Jason Forman are executive producers. Adam Bohling and David Reid are also exec producing. Tillman is coming off his acclaimed performance in the most recent season of Apple's Severance, which won him an Emmy for best supporting actor this year. He is currently in production on Sony's Spider-Man: Brand New Day alongside Tom Holland. This spring, Tillman starred opposite Tom Cruise in Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, which had its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival. For McKellen, the Oscar-nominated actor is no stranger to high-profile IP starring in such hit franchises as X-Men and Lord of the Rings. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In John McTiernan's 1987 jungle chop-a-thon Predator, its appeal came from the unknown. That its quarry—filled out by alpha machos like Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and Dillon (Carl Weathers), among others—had no idea what stalked them, only that it was faster and deadlier. A squad of Rambos up against an enemy who could best them at their own violent game, a sly B-movie subversion of the '80s action flick during its peak. What kind of ridiculous cosmic being would achieve interstellar travel for the sole purpose of hunting big game across the galactic expanse? Dan Trachtenberg successfully remixed Predator with 2022's Prey, a historical action epic where the Predator hunted a Comanche warrior (Amber Midthunder) who lacked the efficiency of automatic weapons but shared Dutch's knack for self-preservation. Trachtenberg charts a wildly different course with Predator: Badlands, a lore-centric franchise expansion that flips the concept on its head by placing the Predator front and center as a hunter-hero with motivations that transcend its species' vicious reputation. Trachtenberg (with Prey screenwriter Patrick Aison) tosses us into the deep end with Dek (Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi), a young Yautja (the Predator's race, cooked up in a 1994 novelization of Dark Horse's Alien Vs. Predator comic), who is having a rough go proving himself worthy of his clan's legacy. We'll learn even more about him before his story's done. After a lively inter-family brawl, where we see Predator fight Predator in the first of many choreographed-to-the-gills and cozily PG-13 battles, Dek sets off to Genna with the burden of tragedy as well as duty to keep him company. However, despite the planet's foreboding nickname, there is a surprising amount of activity on its surface, with the ever-slimy Weyland-Yutani Corporation (of the Alien franchise) setting up a synthetic-staffed research outpost for purposes that threaten Genna's natural order. Fitted with a universal translator (Dek initially calls her “Tool”), Thia is often strapped to Dek's back like C-3PO on Chewbacca during the climax of The Empire Strikes Back, cataloging Genna's many flora and fauna, among them, razor grass, worms that spit acid, grenade grubs, and a googly-eyed mascot creature in the Stitch mold who tags along to complete Dek's oddball family unit. From there, their fates intertwine and play out precisely how they must in a frictionless glide towards the film's sequel-baiting finale, where Badlands fuses iconography from two franchises that haven't had the best of luck sharing space in live action. Yet it's hard to shake the feeling that something is woefully absent from all this Saturday morning frenzy. And speaking of Threepio: That Star Wars echo can't be an accident. In both structure and family-friendly cadence, Predator: Badlands can often come off like a bootleg Mandalorian, with Dek as an (admittedly more belligerent) antihero, meekened somewhat by his adorable misfit sidekicks. Between this, Prey, and this summer's Killer Of Killers, Trachtenberg seems to be forging his own Dave Filoni-esque cinematic universe for the Predator—only with its edges sanded down where they were once barbed and nasty. In fact, the movie feels downright toyetic: Dek's wee alien pal is plush-ready, he has a sword that glows red, he slices up animated beasties who regenerate limbs at will, and when he dispatches synths, they don't spill viscous milk like in the very R-rated Alien movies but short-circuit and collapse in a tidy heap of mannequin limbs. Dek doesn't do much here that might send his new buddies, or his audience, running in the opposite direction in terror.

He was also a beloved father, and when he suddenly passed away in 2007, his child, the writer Helen Macdonald (who identifies as non-binary) took the shock particularly hard. In 2014, Macdonald published “H Is for Hawk,” a deep-feeling memoir about their grief, and how they attempted to heal it by adopting and training a young Eurasian goshawk, in the spirit of their falconer father.

The film also stars Denise Gough, Sam Spruell, and Lindsay Duncan.Per the film's official synopsis, “‘H Is for Hawk' follows Helen (Foy), who, after the sudden death of her father (Brendan Gleeson), loses herself in the memories of their time birding and exploring the natural world together and turns the ancient art of falconry — rooted in European tradition — training a wild goshawk named Mabel to navigate her profound loss. But as she teaches Mabel to hunt and fly free, Helen discovers how deeply she has neglected her own emotions and life. The film premiered at Telluride in September, where our own David Ehrlich wrote in his review that the film “comes alive during the frequent scenes of Helen training Mabel to trust her, to come back to her when she calls, and eventually to hunt with her. At first, Foy plays Helen like someone who has an apache gunship-like killing machine strapped to her arm, and though the actress underwent extensive training for the role, you get the sense that it probably wasn't a struggle for her to get into character during these scenes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen thrilled their fans last night, November 3, by making a joint appearance in matching outfits at the 2025 CFDA (Council of Fashion Designers of America) Awards. Rihanna and A$AP Rocky also attended the ceremony, marking their first red carpet appearance since Rihanna gave birth their third child in September. See a video Mary-Kate and Ashley's speech at the 2025 CFDA awards below. They were also seen side by side posing with Sara Moonves, the editor-in-chief of W Magazine, at New York Fashion Week in September. When Mary-Kate and Ashley stepped up to the microphone to accept their award, one of them thanked boutiques and individual buyers, saying, “You have been our guiding light for the last 20 years now.” She also dedicated the award “to our amazing customers, who truly give us the opportunity to do what we love.” She went on, “From the bottom of our hearts, thank you. Without your support, we would not be here today. So thank you for giving us the love and kindness that allows us to show up to work each day. The girls smiled at each other before carrying their trophy off stage. Mary-Kate and Ashley became America's youngest sweethearts in their joint role as Michelle Tanner on “Full House,” a job they started in 1987 when they were just a year old. Afterwards, they released their own series of adorable sing-along videos before cornering the teen and tween market in films like “Getting There” and “Holiday In the Sun.” Ultimately, they pivoted to fashion and seem hyper-focused on their high-end line, The Row. We could have gone decades without thinking about them at all. Why ruin that for everyone by pushing PR pics? Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kendall Jenner celebrated her 30th birthday with an extravagant beach bash featuring plenty of tequila and a massive firework display. The 818 Tequila founder was joined by her mom, Kris Jenner, and sisters Kim Kardashian, Khloé Kardashian and Kylie Jenner for her seaside soirée Monday night. Kendall's fellow models, Hailey Bieber and Justine Skye, were also in tow. Guests at the star-studded fête dressed to the nines in neutral tones, with the birthday girl opting for a pink and beige silk top paired with a cool geometric-print skirt. The family members posed barefoot in front of a massive silver balloon display that spelled out “Happy Birthday Kendall,” and they also snapped a few fun selfies. Attendees commemorated Kendall's milestone birthday with shots of her 818 Tequila as well as a bottle of Chateau Haut-Brion French red wine from the model's birth year, 1995 (which retails for $595). Family and friends sang “Happy Birthday” to Kendall as she was presented with a beautiful, vintage-inspired white cake decorated with black bows, long candles and several mini bottles of 818 Tequila. There was also a bonfire in the sand that was surrounded by chic Moroccan-style seating featuring cozy pillows, blankets and rugs, as well as twinkling string lights.

Khloé also raved about her “baby sister” in a lengthy tribute post. It feels impossible and yet, here you are; more radiant, grounded, and beautifully you than ever before,” the Good American founder wrote. “Something I've always admired and respected about you is how deeply and unapologetically you live in your truth,” she continued. Kendall thanked her loved ones for celebrating with her by posting an Instagram Story photo of herself dancing in front of the fireworks, writing, “Thank you for all the birthday love.” It's unclear if Kendall's other siblings, Kourtney Kardashian and Rob Kardashian, were at the event, though they weren't seen in any photos.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Monday's episode of Late Night With Seth Meyers, the host took a Closer Look at President Donald Trump's obsessive bathroom renovation, completed while the government is shut down and millions of Americans are about to lose their SNAP benefits. That issue matters, Meyers said, adding, “What matters far less is when the president posts about me, which he did over the weekend, saying among other things that I ‘may be the least talented person to perform live in the history of television,' calling me a ‘deranged lunatic,' and commenting that I ‘talked endlessly about electric catapults on aircraft carriers.” Nevertheless, the Saturday Night Live alum took a little time to address Trump's petty post. “Look, in general, I try to live by the New Yorker's creed: When someone is ranting and raving about you, ignore them. Chances are, they're just going to move on and rave about something else. But there's one thing I simply have to address,” he said. But I'm not the one who talks endlessly about catapults on aircraft carriers!” Cue clips of Trump speaking engagements going back to 2019 talking about the catapults—it seems he's almost as obsessed with catapults as he is with bathroom renovations. !”) are protected as a first amendment right—”Which I have too, right?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Thank you, Berklee College of Music, for bestowing on me this prestigious honor. “Who knows what path my career might have taken if I'd been fortunate enough to learn from some of the great musicians who taught at Berklee. The school says that they are recognizing Dylan's “extraordinary influence on modern music” and “lifelong commitment to creative exploration.” “This is an incredible moment for this institution,” said Berklee President Jim Lucchese. “Bob Dylan's music has shaped how the world hears itself. That's the spirit we try to cultivate here every day. Honoring him feels like a reaffirmation of the creative impulse that built this place.” Adds Berklee's American Roots Music Program artistic director Matt Glaser: “Bob Dylan has spent a lifetime learning, absorbing, and transforming every American song tradition, and Berklee strives to teach all the music that Dylan loves. “As anyone who has read his books or listened to his hundred-plus radio programs can attest, Dylan is also a great teacher and learner,” Glaser continues. “He shows us how to keep learning about music and the arts our whole lives through, and to embrace it all as one thing. Dylan dropped out of the University of Minnesota in 1959 after spending just one semester on campus, where he barely attended any classes. He accepted an honorary degree from Scotland's University of St. Andrews in 2004, but hasn't received one from an American education institution since Princeton awarded him one in 1970. Bad Company Are No Longer Reuniting for Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Performance In his 2004 memoir Chronicles, Dylan looked back on the day. “I was glad to get the degree, though,” he wrote. We piled back into the big Buick and drove away.” This time around, there are no plans for Dylan to appear at any event commemorating the honorary degree from Berklee. It will features students, faculty, alumni, and visiting artists performing Dylan classics like “Blowin' in the Wind, “The Times They Are A-Changin',” and “Chimes of Freedom.” It will culminate in a unique rendition of “It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)” where a hand-selected group of students will take turns singing each of the 20 verses.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jonathan Bailey, People's newly crowned “Sexiest Man Alive,” has had a huge few years. The British actor stole hearts as Anthony Bridgerton on Netflix's “Bridgerton,” starred as Fiyero in 2024's “Wicked,” and will return this November in the sequel, “Wicked: For Good.” Off-screen, Bailey has opened up about love, being “proudly gay,” and what it means to live authentically while guarding his private life. In 2019, The Mirror reported that he was spotted kissing advertising executive James Ellis before the Olivier Awards, where he later won Best Actor in a Supporting Role. The two were seen together again in 2021 but never confirmed a relationship. Having a private life is, for me, completely critical. “Of course I thought that in order to be happy I needed to be straight,” he told GQ in 2022. “I reached a point where I thought, (expletive) this, I'd much prefer to hold my boyfriend's hand in public or be able to put my own face picture on Tinder and not be so concerned about that than getting a part.” At the 2019 Olivier Awards, Bailey used his acceptance speech to talk about representation. “At a time where acknowledging the very existence of LGBTQ people in our schools is being questioned, we have been able to show a lovely and celebratory snapshot of gay love,” he said. “But I can't bring children into my lifestyle now. Johansson and Bailey turned heads when they shared a quick peck on the lips before posing for photographers. When asked about the moment, Bailey told Entertainment Tonight, “I believe in being able to show love in all different ways. And if you can't kiss your friends… life's too short not to.” In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Bailey reflected on his role in the film and what it means to headline such a major project as an out gay actor. “And it's not like I haven't felt that. And there's endless brilliant people who have come before you who have changed the way that people see sexuality.” He continued, “Any sort of sense of prejudice against sexuality is something to fight against, and what better way to do that than to go and play any kind of character. Being an out gay actor, historically, meant that you wouldn't be able to play straight and there weren't any gay parts to play anyway.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wicked: For Good will begin its global premiere tour in São Paulo, Brazil, later this evening. It kicks off a run that will include stops in Paris, London, Singapore, and New York, leading up to the film's Nov. 21 theatrical release date. But the momentous opening will be without one of its stars. Ariana Grande will miss the premiere due to flight delays, she shared on Instagram. “My team and Universal have tried every single thing possible to fix this, we've searched every other flight, overnight, early morning, connecting flights, commercial and also private options and absolutely nothing was available or possible that would get us there in time,” Grande said. “Even in attempting a private option, there is a permit necessary in order to fly from here that takes time to attain.” Please shower my incredible castmates with all of the love that I wish I could be showering you with and have the most beautiful celebration. Brazil's famously passionate pop fans voiced their disappointment online, but some remarks pushed Grande to release a second statement a few hours after the first. “Please don't wish danger on us,” she wrote. No matter how upset or disappointed you are, please please do not wish danger on us or assume that we didn't try.” Last week, the Federal Aviation Administration shared reports on extensive understaffing at airports and air traffic control centers, per the New York Times. Employees at these locations have been working without pay for the duration of the government shutdown that began over a month ago. Bad Company Are No Longer Reuniting for Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Performance Grande reminded upset fans that her flight plans for the premiere of a multi-million dollar film were not scheduled on a whim. Grande noted that she wrapped filming on the upcoming Meet the Parents sequel, Focker In-Law, on Oct. 31, then spent Nov. 1 and 2 working, just as Erivo, Bailey, and Wicked director Jon M. Chu did. “We were all scheduled to leave the same day,” she said. “It just so happened that this plane had a safety problem and I have explained why finding another option was impossible.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The news came days after original drummer Simon Kirke enthused about reuniting with Rodgers at Saturday's (Nov. 8) 2025 event. With just days to go before this year's induction ceremony, one of the 2025 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees has sent his regrets. But, just days after the other surviving original member of the English rock supergroup – fellow former Free member drummer Simon Kirke — revealed that the two planned to reunite to play two songs on Saturday, Rodgers said he cannot participate. “My hope was to be at the Rock & Rock Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony and to perform for the fans, but at this time I have to prioritize my health,” Rodgers, 75, said in a statement without providing any additional information on his condition. “I have no problem singing, it's the stress of everything else. Simon along with some outstanding musicians will be stepping in for me – guaranteed to rock.” But in 2023, Kirke said the band was likely done due to a variety of health issues suffered by Rodgers over the past few years, with the singer revealing to CBS Mornings that year that he'd suffered two major strokes — one in 2016 and another in 2019 — as well as 11 minor strokes. This year's RRHOF induction ceremony will stream live coast-to-coast on Disney+ Saturday (Nov. 8), at 8 p.m. ET, and will be available to stream following the ceremony. ABC will also air a primetime special with performance highlights and standout moments on Jan. 1, at 8 p.m. This year's event will feature an impressive list of performers and presenters, including: Beck, Brandi Carlile, David Letterman, Doja Cat, Elton John, Flea, Iggy Pop, J.I.D, Killer Mike, Maxwell, Missy Elliott, Olivia Rodrigo, Questlove, RAYE, Sleepy Brown, Taylor Momsen, Teddy Swims and Twenty One Pilots.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For a few weeks last November, no villain loomed larger over Madison Avenue and the social media that polices it than Coca-Cola. Only now the ad was filled with AI-generated objects, animals and people — a fact that did not go over well with creatives and many others on the Internet. “Coca-Cola is red because it's made from the blood of out-of-work artists,” decried Hollywood writer Alex Hirsch, one of many such negative comments noting both the spot's labor ethics and its aesthetics. Paul Schrader Has a "Perfect Script" for First Movie Made Only With AI: "We're Two Years Away" On Monday, Coke is trying again, releasing a new generative AI holiday ad with the globe-trucking concept. But this year the craftsmanship is ten times better,” Pratik Thakar, global vp and head of generative AI at Coca-Cola, tells The Hollywood Reporter. “There will be people who criticize — we cannot keep everyone 100 percent happy,” he adds. In a culture where Hollywood creators worry about an AI takeover while a video-watching citizenry braces itself for a wave of synthetic media from Sora 2 and others, an AI commercial at this level is no small thing. The ad features the now-famous Coca-Cola trucks driving through different locales as animals from seals to pandas look on, suggesting a globetrotting trip. It ends as a truck door swings open and Santa appears. While the current generation of AI videos can often take on a disconcertingly stylized quality, Coca-Cola sought to lean into that bug by choosing to portray not people but anthropomorphic animals, which they say they couldn't do before. Now technology has evolved to where we can,” Thakar says. The desired effect is that of a Madagascar or other modern CG animated movie. Those films use artists working from scratch instead of the approach here, in which a model trained on thousands of earlier images generates, with human prompting and shaping, the animation in question. Jason Zada, Secret Level's founder and chief creative officer, says he hopes viewers cannot distinguish this spot from a traditional Hollywood animated movie. “The best compliment I get is when people say a video doesn't look like AI,” he tells THR. (Two other versions of the “holidays are coming” ad were also made this year, an AI one with another studio, Silverside, and a traditionally shot one without the stylized animals, for some Latin markets.) AI is a perhaps unexpected focus for Coke, given the company's history of playing with a kind of schmaltzy humanism in its marketing. Thakar says Coca-Cola is going through a “major marketing transformation, a companywide transformation” with AI at the center of the effort. Zada believes social media gives a skewed impression of how some AI ads are going over. Zada says labor fears are misplaced; while the Coke ad this year required fewer people to make it — he estimated it at 20, compared to the at least 50 an ad of this complexity might typically entail — such efficiencies mean that more could be done in a short amount of time. Brands will allocate the same budgets, Zada believes, leading perhaps to smaller teams on a given ad but more creative overall. “You could do 10 times as much at scale,” he says. Coca-Cola's AI push can be seen as a way to increase its appeal among younger, more zeitgeist-y consumers as the company faces competition from boutique sodas and other upstart beverages. But it also, in the long run, could save the company cash, trimming at least some dollars off its reported $5 billion advertising budget. Madison Avenue executives of course generally are bracing for a potential significant downsizing in budgets  as AI is deployed in areas from creative to research. “Last year we decided to go all in, and it worked out well for us,” he says, noting that “consumer engagement was very high. Yes, some parts of the industry were not pleased we were using a 100 percent Generative AI film, but that's part and parcel of doing something pioneering,” he adds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Boston I'm gonna be honest with ya, after the show last night I was in the ER till 6 this morning," Halsey wrote. The singer-songwriter, who had a two-night stop in Boston for her international Back to Badlands tour, took to Instagram Stories on Sunday (Nov. 3) to share that she experienced a “minor medical emergency” after her concert at MGM Music Hall. Despite the overnight ER stay, she confirmed she would be returning to the stage for her second Boston performance as scheduled. “Boston I'm gonna be honest with ya, after the show last night I was in the ER till 6 this morning,” Halsey wrote. “Minor medical emergency but I am A-Okay now and ready to rock tonight! But if I'm pacing myself, that's why!” She added a thank you to the hospital staff, calling them “the absolute best team I've ever met.” HUNTR/X's 'Golden,' From 'KPop Demon Hunters,' Shines With 14th Week Atop Global Charts The 31-year-old artist has been open about her ongoing health journey. In 2022, Halsey revealed she had been diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and a rare T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder, conditions that she says are now being managed or are in remission. This latest health scare comes amid a particularly prolific era for the genre-blurring star. The Great Impersonator, released in October 2024 via Capitol Records, debuted at No. 2 on both the all-genre Billboard 200 and Top Album Sales charts. Halsey previously ruled Top Alternative Albums for a week each with If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power in 2021 and Badlands in 2015. Halsey has charted 20 songs on the Billboard Hot 100, including two No. She's also earned multiple top 10 albums on the Billboard 200, including Badlands (No. A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Barber succeeds longtime domestic distribution boss Chris Aronson, who didn't survive the Skydance-Paramount merger. David Ellison‘s Paramount Pictures has found its new head of domestic theatrical distribution: Shaun Barber. He succeeds longtime domestic distribution boss Chris Aronson, who didn't survive the Skydance-Paramount merger. Barber officially arrives on the Paramount lot Dec. 1, and will work closely with international distribution chief Mark Viane. They'll both report directly to Josh Goldstine, the studio's newly installed president of global marketing and distribution. Paramount Sued By Exec Who Claims He Was Fired for Being White and Over 50 Barber, a nearly 29-year industry veteran, will join Paramount from Lionsgate, where he served as co-president of worldwide theatrical distribution alongside Kevin Grayson (in separate news, THR has confirmed that Mike Viane — Mark Viane's brother — will be joining Lionsgate as executive vp of worldwide theatrical distribution and operations, reporting to Grayson). Under his leadership, films released through Lionsgate and Summit amassed over $9.3 billion in box office revenue. “Shaun is a deeply respected leader who has spent his career building meaningful partnerships across exhibition and the industry at large. He brings extensive expertise in domestic distribution strategy and will help us strengthen our theatrical business and deliver exceptional experiences for moviegoers,” Goldstine said in a statement. Added Barber, “I'm honored to join Paramount Pictures at this defining moment in its storied history. While the word “distributuion” couldn't be more boring, many of these execs are anything but, especially those working at a major studio side. Historically, they are the ones responsible for dealing with box office reporters on a movie's opening weekend and pushing a particular narrative, whether in good times or bad.</p>
