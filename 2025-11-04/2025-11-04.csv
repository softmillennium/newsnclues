            China has called for the US to avoid crossing four sensitive “red lines” in order to keep the two countries' relations on track following a high-stakes meeting between leaders Xi Jinping and Donald Trump last week.
    


            Taiwan, democracy and human rights, political path and system, and right to development are “China's four red lines,” China's ambassador to the US Xie Feng said during a virtual address to American and Chinese businesspeople in Shanghai on Monday.
    


            “We hope the US side will avoid crossing them and causing trouble,” he said.
    


            Xie made the remarks to an event hosted by the US-China Business Council, according to a readout released by the Chinese Embassy in the US, in comments that come days after Xi and Trump held their landmark meeting last week on the sidelines of an international summit in South Korea.
    


            Those talks – the leaders' first since Trump's return to the White House earlier this year – have been widely seen as a significant step in de-escalating frictions between the two superpowers.
    


            Now, keeping those relations on track would require both sides to “respect each other's core interests and major concerns,” said Xie, adding that the “pressing priority” was “to follow up on the consensus reached between the two presidents.”
    


            “It would be unacceptable to say one thing but do another, cause any new disruption, make zero-sum calculations,” he said.
    


            For Beijing, the four “red lines” elaborated by Xie are longstanding sensitive areas that could enflame tensions if mishandled – the most prominent of which is Taiwan, the self-governing democracy that China's ruling Communist Party views as its own, despite never having controlled it.
    


            Beijing has long been irked by Washington's unofficial relationship with Taipei, and the island often features in high-level diplomatic conversations between the two sides. Trump on Sunday told CBS' 60 Minutes that the subject did not arise during the meeting last week.
    


            Beijing has in the past bristled at what it sees as US efforts to interfere in China's domestic affairs, including American officials voicing concerns about limits to freedoms of expression within China's tightly controlled political system and alleged human rights violations.
    


            While figures within the Trump administration like US Secretary of State Marco Rubio have long been vocal around such issues, they did not appear to be raised by Trump during the recent hour-and-forty-minute meeting with Xi, which focused on their bilateral economic relationship.
    


After Trump trade meeting, it's advantage Xi



            Those talks ended without a formal trade deal, but saw Beijing agree to pause for a year a sweeping expansion of its export controls on rare earth minerals, while Washington would similarly defer measures that would have vastly expanded the number of Chinese firms blacklisted from accessing certain sensitive US technologies.
    


            The two sides also extended a truce reached earlier this year that brought down their tit-for-tat tariffs from levels that would have amounted to a de facto trade embargo.
    


            The measures were greeted with relief by many in the global business community, which for months has been ensnared in the uncertainty of up-and-down economic frictions between the world's two largest economies.
    


            Xie, Beijing's top envoy in Washington, picked up that thread in his remarks on Monday, as he called on business leaders to “build on the positive momentum” of the summit and “remain optimistic about China's future and committed to the Chinese market.”

            Less than a week ago, Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi was the Israeli military's top lawyer, tasked with enforcing the rule of law within the nation's armed forces.
    


            Now, she is under arrest as part of a criminal investigation into the leak of a video showing the alleged abuse, including sexual abuse, of Palestinian detainees in a notorious Israeli military prison.
    


            A longstanding target of Israel's right-wing, Tomer-Yerushalmi's rapid fall has quickly emerged as a national scandal, overshadowing the video at the center of the case.
    


            The affair dates back to July 2024, when legal authorities in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) opened an investigation into soldiers who were allegedly shown sexually assaulting a Palestinian detainee arrested during the Gaza war as some two dozen other detainees lay face-down nearby at the Sde Teiman military prison.
    


            The investigation and subsequent arrest of the soldiers fueled an intense political backlash, with some right-wing members of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition even joining protests and riots outside the Sde Teiman facility and the military court where the soldiers were taken.
    


            The video was first aired by Israel's Channel 12 in August 2024, but it wasn't the first report to raise concerns about conditions at the base. In May 2024, CNN spoke to three whistleblowers who detailed allegations of abuse at Sde Teiman. A month later, Israel said it would begin phasing out the facility.
    


            But that did little to dull the vitriol targeting the military's top lawyer.
    


            On Wednesday, Tomer-Yerushalmi was suspended from her role as military advocate-general, as Israel's Attorney General Gali Baharav‑Miara announced a criminal investigation into the leak. Two days later, Tomer-Yerushalmi submitted her resignation letter, acknowledging that she approved the release of the video and taking “full responsibility for any material that was released to the media from within the unit.”
    


            She wrote in her letter that an “incitement campaign” against her had reached its peak following the decision to investigate soldiers at Sde Teiman. “This campaign continues to this very day and causes deep and serious harm to the IDF, to its image, and to the resilience of IDF soldiers and their commanders,” she wrote.
    


            “There are things that cannot be done even against the worst of the detainees,” she wrote. “Officers of the (legal) unit have faced repeated personal attacks, harsh insults, and even real threats. All of this because they stood guard over the rule of law in the IDF – together with the commanders and alongside them.”
    


            For Israel's right-wing political echelon, the resignation and investigation weren't enough. Hours after Tomer-Yerushalmi stepped down, Defense Minister Israel Katz said he would take “all necessary sanctions against her,” including stripping her of her rank. Katz, who issued no fewer than seven statements against the chief military attorney in less than a week, accused her of involvement in a “blood libel” against the soldiers, even though the veracity of the video has not been questioned, and five soldiers were indicted in February 2025 for the abuse of the detainee. They have denied wrongdoing.
    


            Netanyahu called the leak “an enormous reputational blow,” describing it on Sunday as “the worst PR disaster in Israel's history.”
    


            National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir dubbed the lawyer's conduct “criminal behavior under a legal guise” and called for the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the leak.
    


            Then, Tomer-Yerushalmi went missing.
    


            For several hours on Sunday, the Israeli military and police were unable to locate the woman who had, until just days earlier, been the top lawyer for the country's armed forces. The IDF said in a statement that it would “employ all means available” to locate her “as quickly as possible.”
    


            After an extensive search, she was found on a beach north of Tel Aviv.
    


            On Sunday evening, police arrested Tomer-Yerushalmi on suspicion of multiple offenses: fraud and breach of trust, abuse of official power, obstruction of justice, and disclosure of information by a public official.
    


            She has not been formally charged yet or entered a plea. Her next hearing is scheduled for Wednesday. A lawyer representing Tomer-Yerushalmi declined to comment on the case.
    


            Tomer-Yerushalmi is also suspected of allegedly misleading the High Court of Justice, and senior military and justice officials, about the leak of the footage and even submitting a false affidavit to the court. Alongside Tomer-Yerushalmi, other senior legal officials in the military prosecutor's office are also implicated in the leak and its alleged cover-up. According to the police, there are five suspects in the investigation.
    


            Meanwhile, the Palestinian detainee at the center of the alleged abuse has been returned to Gaza as part of the US-brokered ceasefire agreement, raising questions about the prospects of an effective prosecution of the soldiers accused in the case since the alleged victim is not available to testify.
    


            The affair has become a part of a larger attack on Israel's judiciary from Netanyahu's coalition. Justice Minister Yariv Levin is attempting to bar Baharav-Miara – also a frequent target of the right wing – from probing the leak, suggesting the attorney general's own involvement in the case should also be examined. “Anyone involved in conflicts of interest will not be part of the investigation,” Levin insisted in a statement last week.
    


            “The lies that have been built here over the years, while trampling on the rights of entire populations and severely harming the security of the state and IDF soldiers, are gradually falling apart,” said Levin. “One group that has gotten used to treating the country as its own is being replaced.”
    


            Baharav-Miara's office responded in a letter, saying Levin was trying to “unlawfully interfere” with the investigative process, which “impedes its progress.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","The White House has shared images of Xi Jinping that most Chinese don't see at home","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/03/china/china-xi-laughing-images-apec-intl-hnk","Tue, 04 Nov 2025 00:37:00 GMT","


            Xi Jinping is not known for his easy smiles. China's most powerful Communist leader in decades has built a reputation reinforced by state media during his 12-year rule as a serious and steady hand.
    


            But images released by the White House show a different side of Xi – and one not apparent in images published at home.
    


Xi attended the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea, where he met US President Donald Trump for a bilateral meeting at Gimhae Air Base in Busan.
    


            All eyes were on how the leaders of the world's two biggest economies would sort out their differences on a range of topics from soybeans and fentanyl to rare earth minerals and high-end computer chips.
    


            But aside from the hard-hitting diplomacy, photographs released by the White House captured a rare candid moment between the two leaders.
    


            In a room filled with suited diplomats, Trump was seen in one image with his arm stretched across the negotiation table to show Xi a piece of paper. Whatever was written or printed on the paper remains unknown.
    


            In another image, the Chinese leader appears to grin with his eyes shut, with Foreign Minister Wang Yi laughing by his side. It's unclear if the images were arranged in chronological order.
    


            Two days later, Xi was caught on camera cracking a joke when he exchanged gifts with South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung, according to a Reuters video.
    


            Lee first presented Xi with a wooden board for the chess game Go. Then, the Chinese leader gave Lee and his wife two China-made Xiaomi phones, which an official said came with displays made in South Korea, home to electronic giants Samsung and LG.
    


            Lee then jokingly asked: “How is the communication security?” drawing laughter from the room.
    


            Xi, who was also laughing at this point, replied: “You can check if there's a backdoor.”
    


            A backdoor risk refers to a hidden method of accessing a user's device without them knowing. The issue has prompted a raft of allegations between China and other countries.
    


            Beijing has recently expressed concerns over a US proposal to have advanced chips sold abroad fitted with tracking, a suggestion that prompted US chipmaker Nvidia to say its chips had no “backdoors.” Meanwhile, numerous Western countries have raised cybersecurity concerns regarding certain China-made devices.
    


            The two off-the-cuff moments from Xi contrast with his carefully crafted image at home, where he was recently shown presiding over a military parade in a Mao suit, an outfit associated with Mao Zedong, Communist China's founding father.
    


            Before his meeting with Trump, he chaired a party plenum, delivering speeches in a stoic demonstration of his tight control over China's political apparatus.
    


            Not all Chinese leaders projected such a tightly constructed image.
    


            Xi's predecessor Jiang Zemin, who served as president between 1993 and 2003, was known for his flamboyant personality, cosmopolitan flair and willingness to show off his language skills and interact with journalists.
    


            However, Xi has charted a different course. Along with curbing freedom of expression in China, he has maintained strict control of his image and the flow of information. Elite politics has become so opaque under his rule that pundits look for any clue for China's direction – from parsing Xi's words for their real meaning to assessing the color of his hair.



            Xi's more relaxed international appearances in South Korea barely made it to China's tightly controlled internet. Censors often remove any coverage of Xi that deviates from the official narrative in the country, where most Western news websites and social media platforms are banned.
    


            Footage and images showing Xi's light-hearted exchanges with his US and South Korean counterparts were nowhere to be found on two of the country's most popular social media platforms: Douyin, China's version of TikTok, and Xiaohongshu.
    


            A few posts by Chinese-language news outlets based outside of China that reported Xi's gift exchange with South Korea's Lee were available on X-like platform Weibo.
    


            The posts only displayed a few users' comments despite hundreds of messages. Among the reactions that survived, one user posted a thumbs up emoji and another left a smiling face.

Iran will rebuild nuclear facilities targeted in US and Israeli strikes earlier this year, President Masoud Pezeshkian has said, reiterating that his country is not seeking to develop nuclear weapons.

In June 2025, the US and Israel launched coordinated airstrikes on Iran's Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan nuclear sites, causing major damage, according to satellite imagery and defense analysts. They described it as preemptive strikes to halt Iran's progress toward developing a bomb.

Afterward, President Donald Trump warned that the US could launch renewed strikes if Iran restarts the damaged sites. Tehran, which insists its program is peaceful, condemned the attacks as a violation of sovereignty.

“The scientific knowledge is in the minds of our scientists. Destroying buildings and factories will not create a problem for us – we will rebuild, and with greater strength,” Pezeshkian told state media on Sunday during a visit to the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI).

He said that while nuclear technology has destructive potential, “only a fraction of its applications relate to weapons,” adding that most serve medicine, agriculture, and industry. Pezeshkian rejected Western claims that Iran seeks to develop nukes, saying, “building a nuclear weapon is not on our agenda, and they know this.”

“Unfortunately, targeted propaganda has made the word ‘nuclear' synonymous with bomb-making… All our nuclear activities are aimed at solving citizens' problems and non-military issues,” he stressed.

Western nations have long accused Iran of seeking to obtain a nuclear bomb. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported earlier this year that Tehran has enriched uranium to 60%, short of the 90% required for weapons.

IAEA chief Rafael Grossi later said there is no proof that Iran is developing nuclear weapons, noting that enriched uranium alone does not constitute a weapon.

Efforts to revive the 2015 nuclear deal, which were relaunched this year and were aimed at curbing enrichment for sanctions relief, have stalled since the strikes in June. Tehran later restricted Western monitoring of its nuclear sites, demanding guarantees before talks resume.

AEOI head Mohammad Eslami announced on Sunday that Iran plans to build eight new nuclear power plants in cooperation with Russia to expand its energy capacity. The facilities aim to generate 20,000 megawatts of nuclear power by 2041.

Former US Vice President Dick Cheney has died from complications of pneumonia and heart and vascular disease, his family said in a statement on Tuesday.

“Richard B. Cheney, the 46th Vice President of the United States, died last night, November 3, 2025. He was 84 years old,” the statement reads. “His beloved wife of 61 years, Lynne, his daughters, Liz and Mary, and other family members were with him as he passed. The former Vice President died due to complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease.”

Serving under former US President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2009, Cheney was one of the chief architects of the 2003 US invasion of Iraq. He strongly advocated the claim that then-Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, which was later discredited. Cheney also pushed for the broader ‘war on terror', approved the use of torture on terrorist suspects, and greenlighted the warrantless monitoring of Americans' phone calls and emails.

He left office with one of the lowest approval ratings ever recorded for a US vice president, according to major US pollsters, but expressed no regrets over his policy choices, insisting he did what was necessary after the 9/11 terrorist attacks that killed nearly 2,800 people.

“I would do it again in a minute,” he said in 2014, responding to a Senate report that condemned the CIA's interrogation methods as brutal, ineffective, and damaging to America's global standing.

Critics argue that Cheney's aggressive foreign policy and role in the Iraq War had lasting, damaging effects on the US and the world. The invasion, they say, created a power vacuum that fueled sectarian violence, destabilized the Middle East, and helped spawn extremist groups like ISIS. The war left more than 4,600 US troops and up to 300,000 Iraqi civilians dead, with some studies estimating over 500,000 total war-related deaths.

Cheney suffered from severe cardiovascular disease for much of his adult life and survived multiple heart attacks. His first heart attack occurred in 1978 when he was just 37.

He suffered four more, leading to several surgeries, including bypass operations, angioplasties, and the implantation of a left ventricular assist device in 2010 before receiving a heart transplant in 2012.

Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic has said he will call early parliamentary elections in light of the ongoing anti-government protests.

The unrest began in November 2024 after a roof collapse at a railway station in Novi Sad killed 16 people. In the wake of the tragedy, activists accusing the government of corruption and demanding snap parliamentary elections and Vucic's resignation.

Vucic and his supporters claim the protests are externally driven attempts at regime change and are part of a coordinated “color revolution” backed by Western governments through the use of NGOs. He has accused opposition forces of cooperating with Western, Croatian, and Albanian intelligence agencies to topple his government.

Vucic told reporters on Sunday that parliamentary elections “will be held before the end of the term” of the current National Assembly, which expires in December 2027.

“The competent institutions in our country will make decisions in accordance with the Constitution and the law, but, with respect to the demands of the protesters to hold the elections early… they will be held ahead of schedule,” he said, adding that the exact date will be decided later.

In later remarks, Vucic mentioned a “six-month term,” which some Serbian media interpreted as a hint that the snap vote could take place as early as next year.

Vucic's announcement followed days of renewed demonstrations marking the first anniversary of the Novi Sad tragedy. Supporters and opponents of Vucic's ruling SNS party clashed in Belgrade on Sunday despite police efforts to separate them. Serbian media reported bottles and firecrackers thrown, with dozens detained.

Under public pressure, the government earlier offered concessions to protesters, including several ministerial resignations and the release of documents related to the Novi Sad collapse.

Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) in September accused the EU of trying to stage a Ukraine-style “Maidan coup” in Serbia by fueling the protests. The agency alleged that EU institutions were “brainwashing” Serbian youth – which constitutes the bulk of protesters – using media as tools of influence.

Listeria found in pasta sold by Trader Joe's, Kroger and others as CDC urges people to check fridges and seek care if ill

Six people have died and several dozen have been hospitalized across the US after an outbreak of listeria in precooked pasta meals.

The outbreak was first declared in June, leading to a wave of recalls of the pasta meals. It has now spread, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which recently said that six people have died and 25 have been hospitalized across 18 states.

The CDC said that “one pregnancy-associated illness resulted in a fetal loss”.

The linguine, farfalle and other types of infected pasta were sold by retailers including Trader Joe's, Albertsons, Kroger and Sprouts Farmers Market. The supplier of the products, Nate's Fine Foods, had discovered listeria in a sample of its pasta, according to federal health officials.

“Nate's Fine Foods is committed to the highest standards of food safety and the well-being of our consumers,” the company said in a statement in September.

“Out of an abundance of caution, we are voluntarily recalling select products after being notified of a potential link to a multi-state outbreak of listeria monocytogenes.”

Listeria is a type of bacteria that can cause listeriosis, a condition that causes symptoms such as headache, muscle aches, diarrhea and fever. For high-risk people, such as the elderly and pregnant women, listeria can infect the nervous system, causing severe illnesses, miscarriages and even death.

The CDC said the listeria outbreak has now been found in California, Hawaii, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Washington.

The health agency said that people should check their fridges for the recalled products and clean any surfaces that they have touched. Those aged over 65, who are pregnant or who have weakened immune systems should see a doctor immediately if they experience symptoms after eating the infected food.

The recalled pasta dishes are:

FreshRealm's Home Chef Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo 12.5-oz (sold at Kroger and Walmart)

FreshRealm's Marketside Grilled Chicken Alfredo with Fettuccine 12.3-oz and 32.8-oz (sold at Kroger and Walmart)

FreshRealm's Marketside Linguine with Beef Meatballs & Marinara Sauce 12-oz. (sold at Walmart)

Albertsons Companies store-made deli pasta salads (sold under multiple brand names including Albertsons, Safeway and Vons)

Trader Joe's Cajun Style Blackened Chicken Breast Fettuccine Alfredo 16-oz plastic tray packages

Demer Food Group's Scott & Jon's Shrimp Scampi with Linguini Bowls 9.6-oz

City government declines to raise objection in court but state leaders and ACLU seek to block deployment of troops

A state court in Nashville on Monday heard a legal challenge by some Democratic elected officials to Donald Trump's deployment of the national guard into the streets of Memphis, notable in part because of who has not raised an objection: the city of Memphis itself.

Shelby county's mayor, Lee Harris, led the lawsuit, along with state representatives Gabby Salinas and GA Hardaway, both Memphis Democrats. Other state and local leaders joined the suit, including one Memphis city council member. The ACLU later filed briefs in support of the suit seeking an injunction to block the deployment of troops.

But the city government declined to fight it in court.

“We have city attorneys that have evaluated this when the dialogues began and we felt like the legal authority for the issuance of the national guard from the president and the governor was going to be something that we're not going to be able to overcome,” Memphis mayor Paul Young told the Guardian. “Our decision was, let's figure out how we can impact how they show up in our community.”

On 15 September, Trump signed a memo to mobilize the national guard to Memphis, a city with the fourth-highest murder rate in the United States among cities with more than 100,000 residents in 2024, a rate roughly eight times the national average. Attorneys for the state noted in court that about half of all murders in Tennessee occur in Memphis.

The mere suggestion of national guard deployment in Chicago and Portland has led to extraordinary street protest and legal challenges, which are ongoing. Unlike these cities, Memphis is deep in red-state America with a Republican governor disinclined to thwart the adventures of the president. Tennessee governor Bill Lee accepted the national guard activation and the federal spending that came with it. Though crime had been falling before the deployment in Memphis, the presence of armed troops watching Beale Street blues clubs has in relative terms been met with a shrug.

The Memphis city council has a 13-2 Democratic majority among its members. And yet, in September it rejected a resolution by a 4-4-2 tie asking Lee to refrain from deploying the national guard into the city. The council also refrained from joining the lawsuit as a group. JB Smiley Jr is the only member of the city council who joined the suit.

Tennessee's sternly conservative state government has been chipping away at the sovereignty of its Democratic-majority municipalities over the past few years, routinely issuing threats to reduce state funding, appropriate city property or even jail wayward members of local government.

The plaintiffs argued on Monday before Patricia Head Moskal, a chancery court judge in Nashville, that the conditions in Memphis do not meet an objective standard of “civil unrest” that justifies deploying the national guard in the absence of rebellion or invasion, and certainly not without permission from the Tennessee general assembly.

Joshua M Salzman, an attorney with the Democracy Forward Foundation representing the plaintiffs, said the state is arguing that “tanks can be sent into any city in this state at any time by the governor and there is nothing for the courts to do about it, and there's no role for the general assembly … We are all subject to the whims of the governor. That is not how American law is supposed to function.”

Democratic lawmakers argue that state statute sharply limits how the governor can use the state militia. But one argument of Lee is that the national guard is not the “militia” for legal purposes – it is the army of Tennessee, which is not subject to the restrictions of the militia. Plaintiffs call the redefinition of the guard as an “army” a semantic evasion of legal limits that has been rejected by prior courts and commentators.

The state also argues that it is not paying for the deployment – federal funds are being used – which means taxpayers are not burdened by the call-up.

The state also argues that the decision to call up the national guard is a political issue and what constitutes a “disaster” should be decided by the governor and not a court.

“This case presents a plainly political question,” said Cody Brandon, representing the Tennessee government. “Plaintiffs suggest that death and violence in Memphis is a fact of life of living there. If you live in Memphis, you might as well just used to being murdered or raped or robbed.”

He added: “The governor thought differently. And people can think differently about that. Harris might have different opinions about the gravity of a crime in Memphis. He may have different opinions – I'm sure he does – about the ways to address crime in Memphis. That's not the sort of question that belongs in court.”

The judge appeared skeptical of this argument. “How is this question purely political?” Moskal asked Brandon. “[Lee] made that decision because of an emergency decision because of crime … this is not a policy decision. This is an operational decision, to deploy troops to Memphis, Tennessee.”

Moskal said she would render a decision after receiving written briefs.

The deployment of the national guard in Memphis is part of the Memphis Safe Task Force, which the federal administration and state leaders describe as a broader law enforcement effort to combat crime in the city. National guard troops are not allowed to make arrests, officials say. But other state and federal agencies have surged into the city over the last month, increasing arrests.

Figures from the US Marshals Service show more than 1,500 arrests since the task force began operating with the national guard on 29 September.

Young said his team is briefed every day on the activities of the task force, and has tried to focus its work on the most serious violent crimes. “We push that every morning, and we give them a list of the warrants that we want to get executed so that we can keep this task force focused on the thing that really is a challenge for Memphians,” Young said.

“The more we do that, the more influence we have. But ultimately, they don't answer to me. They answer to the governor. They answer to the president.”

Young said he did not believe the national guard would be helpful in reducing Memphis's violence. But people in Memphis have been looking for a solution to violence, he said.

“Given that they're coming, I like to deal in the realities, and the reality is they were going to show up whether I want them here or not,” Young said. “I think it's really important that the mayor of the city, the person that knows the city the best, is at the table talking to them about how they show up.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The Associated Press

10:18 JST, November 4, 2025

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Shohei Ohtani and the rest of the Los Angeles Dodgers celebrated their second straight World Series championship with a downtown parade and stadium rally Monday after becoming the first team in 25 years to win back-to-back titles.

“Hello, hello,” Ohtani said, speaking in English at a sold out Dodger Stadium. “I want to say I'm so proud of this team. I want to say you guys are the greatest fans in the world. I'm ready to get another ring next year. Let's go.”

Ohtani was accompanied by his wife, Mamiko Tanaka, who took a photo of him along the parade route. Last year, Ohtani carried his dog, Decoy, in his arms on the bus.

“It's really nice to be able to win the game, and to be surrounded by all these amazing fans,” Ohtani said during the bus ride. “I'm really taking it in and enjoying it.”

World Series MVP Yoshinobu Yamamoto wore a black T-shirt with World Series champions on the front. Wearing sunglasses and a backward baseball cap, Yamamoto waved to fans.

“Losing isn't an option,” Yamamoto told the stadium crowd in English. “To my teammates, my coaches, amazing staff and all the fans, we did it together. I love the Dodgers. I love Los Angeles.”

The team's third Japanese player, rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki, celebrated his 24th birthday Monday.

Players walked a blue carpet from center field to a circular blue stage.

“What they talking about in Toronto right now?” actor-comedian Anthony Anderson asked the crowd. “They're talkin' about nothing.”

A woman in the crowd wore a blue T-shirt reading “Let's ruin baseball.”

“I got four. Fill the hand all the way up, baby,” said Mookie Betts, who won a title with the Boston Red Sox and three with the Dodgers. “Three-peat has never sounded so sweet. Somebody make that a T-shirt.”

Rapper-actor Ice Cube drove a bright blue convertible around the warning track with the Commissioner's Trophy in the front passenger seat. He carried it overhead to the stage and set it on a table next to a table with last year's championship hardware.

Kiké Hernández apologized in advance for his expletive-filled comments.

“My teammates have been pretty humble, but I think it's time to talk that s—-,” he said. “Everybody's been asking questions about a dynasty. How about three in six years? We're a motherf——in' dynasty, baby.”

Earlier, manager Dave Roberts hoisted the trophy while aboard one of several buses that traversed a route packed with cheering, flag-waving blue-clad fans. “B 2 B” read one of many hand-lettered signs held up.

“I feel like it's almost double from last year,” Freddie Freeman said. “These fans are crazy. It's so awesome to be a part of this.”

Blue-and-white confetti blew from a truck rolling between the buses, which were filled with family members of the players, including newly retired Clayton Kershaw and his four children.

“It's the perfect way to be done,” said Kershaw, who ended an 18-year career played entirely with Los Angeles. “I know the Dodgers have always meant a lot to this city for generations. For us to get to do this in front of them, it means the world to me and all the rest of the guys.”

Pitcher Blake Snell made the 6-7 gesture with his hands, signifying the Dodgers' wins over the Toronto Blue Jays in Games 6 and 7.

“This is lit,” Snell said. “I love it.”

A bare-chested Hernández filmed the throngs with a hand-held camera.

“Winners win,” he said. “I hope these Dodger fans have a lot of fun because they deserve this. They showed up all year long, they supported us and here we are back-to-back champs.”

The Council of the EU approved on Nov. 4 the fifth tranche of the Ukraine Facility funding in the amount of 1.8 billion euros ($2.1 billion), including some of the money withheld during the previous payment.

""This amount reflects Ukraine's successful completion of nine steps required for the fifth disbursement, as well as one outstanding step from the fourth disbursement,"" the official statement read.

The Ukraine Facility allocates 50 billion euros ($58 billion) in loans and grants to support Ukraine's post-war recovery and modernization between 2024 and 2027. 

The disbursment of 32 billion euros ($37 billion) is tied to reforms Kyiv has pledged to carry out in accordance with the Ukraine Plan.

The fourth tranche, disbursed in August, was reduced from 4.5 billion euros ($5.2 billion) to 3.2 billion euros ($3.7 billion) after Ukraine failed to complete three of the required reforms.

A payment for an uncompleted step from the last tranche — a reform of ARMA, the state asset management agency — was included in the fifth payment.

As European Pravda reports, Ukraine was originally set to receive 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) in the fifth tranche. The EU withheld some of the money until Ukraine adopts two additional judicial reforms.

If the reforms are not implemented by mid-2026, the funds may be lost.

Since its introduction in March 2024, the Ukraine Facility has provided Ukraine with 22.89 billion euros ($26 billion) in macro-financial support, excluding the most recent tranche.

External funding is increasingly crucial for Ukraine as it faces mounting war costs and a substantial budget shortfall. 

Seeking to bolster the country's financial stability amid the Russian invasion, the European Commission proposed a 140 billion euros ($160 billion) ""reparations loan"" covered by frozen Russian assets.

Belgium, a country where the financial company holding much of the assets is based, has been blocking the loan, which could reportedly also threaten Ukraine's funding under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program.

A new UN report shows that global temperatures continue to rise despite a slight slowdown in emissions. It reiterates the call for countries to be more ambitious on climate action.  

As global leaders head to the Brazilian city of Belem to discuss how to keep runaway global heating in check, a new report underscores the need for solid national climate commitments.

Against the backdrop of rising temperatures that marked 2024 as the hottest ever on record, the United Nations Environment Program's (UNEP) latest Emissions Gap Report says the predicted global temperature increase over the course of this century has only slightly fallen, ""leaving the world heading for serious escalation of climate risks.""

As emissions continue to rise — albeit more slowly — the authors said the world was on track to overshoot the 1.5 degree Celsius threshold, ""at least temporarily."" 

Signatories to the 2015 Paris climate accord agreed to try and limit temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees above pre-industrialization levels, with efforts to cap the increase at 1.5 C.

Even if countries were to do everything to reach their self-set national climate targets, the world would still be heading for warming of between 2.3 and 2.5 degrees C by the end of the century. This is a slight improvement on last year's predictions, but under current policies, the study says, the world is actually on track for 2.8 degrees of warming by 2100. 

That temperature rise would be ""difficult to reverse"" and would require much faster additional reductions in the greenhouse gas emissions generated by burning oil, gas and coal. 

UNEP chief Inger Andersen said that ""while national climate plans have delivered some progress, it is nowhere near fast enough,"" adding that proven solutions already exist. 

""From the rapid growth in cheap renewable energy to tackling methane  emissions, we know what needs to be done,"" she said. ""We still need emissions cuts in an increasingly tight window, with an increasingly challenging geopolitical backdrop.""

She added that this is the time for countries to fully commit to and invest in their future through ambitious climate action ""that delivers faster economic growth, better human health, more jobs, energy security and resilience.""

Before the Paris Agreement was reached ten years ago, the predictions for temperature increase by the end of the century were as high as 3.5 degrees Celsius. 

By switching from coal to renewable energies for power generation, some countries have already been able to significantly reduce CO2 emissions. At the same time, global consumption of fossil fuels, and accompanying emissions have risen. In 2024, they climbed 2.3% over the previous year.

The predicted global temperature rise over the course of this century has only slightly fallen, ""leaving the world heading for serious escalation of climate risks,"" according to the authors. 

The report says the only way to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2100 would be to cut emissions more than 55% by 2035. And this would require radical and swift reductions in greenhouse gases.

The study explores a scenario of ""rapid mitigation action from 2025"" that would limit the 1.5 C target by around 0.3 degrees in the coming decades. It would require cutting emissions 46% by 2035, and a reliance on natural and technological carbon capture. 

While the task ahead is daunting, the progress that has been made in the ten years since the Paris Agreement came into force shows that a drastic reduction in emissions is both ""possible and desirable,"" the authors wrote.

The report warns of the dangerous impact of failing to keep global temperature rise in check. 

""Every fraction of a degree avoided reduces an escalation of the damages, losses and health impacts that are harming all nations — while hitting the poorest and most vulnerable the hardest,"" the authors wrote. 

Unchecked heating also increases the risk of triggering tipping points, which could lead to abrupt and irreversible climate changes.

The UN authors emphasized the advantages and opportunities of accelerated climate protection measures for economic growth, new jobs and energy security. The necessary low-carbon technologies are available, and the boom of wind and solar energy continues to exceed expectations and reduce energy costs.

According to the report, achieving the necessary emission cuts requires overcoming political and technical obstacles as well as providing an unprecedented increase in support for developing countries.

Russian forces have claimed advances in Pokrovsk, a vital transport and logistics hub in Ukraine's Donetsk region. The Ukrainian army says that it is holding out for now.

Russia announced on Monday that its troops had made advances in Pokrovsk, a city in Ukraine's Donetsk region.

The key transport and logistics hub has been targeted by the Russian invasion for more than a year.

Russia's Defense Ministry said its troops were destroying what it described as Ukrainian formations near Pokrovsk's railway station and industrial zone. Russian forces have also reportedly entered the Prigorodny area of the city.

On Monday evening, the Ukrainian military said Russian troops did not have full control over the city.

""The invaders continue to attack in small groups of up to five soldiers, without using armored vehicles,"" the operation task force responsible for Ukraine's eastern front line said on Facebook.

Ukraine's 7th Rapid Response Corps meanwhile said that its ""operation of clearing Pokrovsk of occupiers"" was ongoing, adding that Ukrainian forces had thwarted an attempt to cut off the supply route from Rodynske, to the north.

On Saturday, Kyiv announced the deployment of special forces to the eastern city of Pokrovsk, which is under assault by thousands of Russian troops.

Pokrovsk is an important logistics hub that had a population of around 60,000 prior to the war. However, most civilians fled long ago.

If Russia were to capture the city, it could use it as a base from which to advance on the two largest Ukrainian-controlled cities remaining in the Donetsk region: Kramatorsk and Sloviansk.

Moscow is intent on capturing the entire Donetsk region, which it claims to have annexed. Russia now controls 81% of the region

Taking Pokrovsk would also be Russia's most significant territorial gain in Ukraine since seizing the ruined city of Avdiivka in early 2024 following one of the war's bloodiest battles.

According to an analysis of data by the US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW), Russia seized 461 square kilometers (286 square miles) of Ukrainian territory in October.

This was in line with the average monthly gain this year, which is down from the surge in July, when Russia seized 634 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory.

“There is no excuse that justifies” not utilizing “every resource available” to fund SNAP, one critic said.

Did you know that Truthout is a nonprofit and independently funded by readers like you? If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation.

The Trump administration announced on Monday that it will provide only half of the usual Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits in November after money for the program officially ran out on Saturday amid the ongoing government shutdown.

More than 42 million Americans, amounting to around 1 in 8 families overall, depend on the program, sometimes known as food stamps, to pay for some or all of their groceries. Due to the shutdown, the White House had announced that it would no longer disperse funds for SNAP benefits to states starting November 1.

Several states and nonprofits sued the Trump administration over its decision, arguing that contingency funding could partially fund the program, and that funds from other sources could be reallocated to help make up the difference. Federal Judge Jack McConnell, one of two judges to find the administration had erred in its decision, ordered the White House to take one of two options: fully fund November payments by using contingency funds plus funds from the Child Nutrition Program, or fund just half of benefits for November using the contingency funds alone.

After a brief delay in responding to the directive, the Trump administration chose the latter option. 

Recipients are likely to see delays in their payments, as administrative actions (such as creating statistical tables to guide states to calculate payment rates for recipients) need to be completed before funds can be dispersed.

The roughly 50 percent cut in allotments to the program will undoubtedly cause food insecurity for those in need. A family of four in Wisconsin with a household income of $50,000 and a monthly rent of $1,300 per month, for example, will see their benefits drop from $150 per month to $75 this month, amounting to food spending of around $2.50 per day. 

The SNAP benefits that such a family would receive are well below the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) recommendations, which advise that, for a family of four on a “thrifty” budget, spending on food should be around $976.60 per month. Cutting benefits in half leaves these families even further away from that spending goal.

Crystal FitzSimons, president of the Food Research and Action Center, called the administration's decision to fund only half the program an “important first step” but added that it comes “many days late and billions of dollars short” of what is needed.

“There is no excuse that justifies the administration delaying the release of benefits and then choosing not to utilize every resource available to provide full benefits to the 42 million people who rely on SNAP to put food on the table,” FitzSimons said in a statement.

She went on:

The decision to provide only partial benefits forces state agencies to scramble under unclear guidance, which will further delay benefits. It also means that families are missing out on much needed nutrition support. Enough time has already been lost — the funds must be released immediately to avert further harm, chaos and confusion.

As the shutdown becomes the longest in U.S. history, polling demonstrates that a majority of Americans fault Republicans for prolonging the crisis by refusing to negotiate with Democrats, who are refusing to pass a continuing resolution bill unless some of the health care funding that was cut by President Donald Trump's “One Big Beautiful Bill” Act is restored.

According to a new NBC News poll, 42 percent of Americans fault Democrats for the shutdown. Meanwhile, a combined 52 percent of Americans blame either Trump, Republicans in Congress, or both for the shutdown continuing into this month.

Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts.

Emma Ashford is a Senior Fellow at the Stimson Center. She is the author of First Among Equals: U.S. Foreign Policy in a Multipolar World.

 How America Should Navigate a New Global Order

 Emma Ashford

The “unipolar moment” of American predominance is over. Long-term economic, demographic, and military trends have undeniably shifted global politics, and the United States now needs a strategy to manage this emerging world in a way that preserves at least some of its unipolar advantages without leaving it overstretched. Which strategy Washington should pursue, however, largely depends on the kind of world it believes is emerging.

The Biden administration envisioned a bipolar world, with the United States and China locked in a fierce competition. As a result, it assiduously built a strategy around a new cold war, and it sought to stitch together discrete U.S. alliances and reframe Washington's adversaries as an “axis of authoritarians.” But a coherent democratic axis failed to emerge, and states chafed against a unified democratic policy: consider India, which is still an active participant in BRICs, a bloc it founded with Brazil, Russia, and China in 2009, or the tensions between the United States and the Netherlands over the latter's export of critical chip-making technology to China.

This is because the Biden administration was wrong about bipolarity. With increasing economic interconnectedness; the rise of militarily capable regional powers such as Turkey, India, and South Korea; and economic and technological power less concentrated in the hands of the United States and China, it seems more likely that a fragmented and complex multipolar world will follow the unipolar moment.

Contrary to popular opinion, however, multipolarity is not a death sentence for the United States. In an era of declining relative U.S. power, it benefits Americans to let other capable countries handle some of the load of global leadership. If Washington embraces this fact, it can pursue a more flexible strategy—one that allows the United States to operate more efficiently and effectively in a rapidly changing world.

The good news is that the Trump administration appears much more comfortable with the idea of multipolarity than the Biden administration was. Instead of trying to force the world into a false us-versus-them dichotomy, it has taken some early, positive steps toward embracing a more multipolar strategy. In particular, the push for U.S. allies in Asia and Europe to bear more of the defense burden is a significant shift from traditional U.S. foreign policy.

But the Trump administration is still bungling the opportunity to make multipolarity work for U.S. interests. By destroying the international economic system and alienating other countries with its aggressive unilateralism, the administration's mixed-bag strategy for multipolarity will raise more risks and reap fewer rewards.



Scholars still fiercely debate whether the unipolar moment is giving way to a bipolar, multipolar, or even nonpolar world. The answer boils down to power—which countries have it, how they exercise it, and how others perceive it. But power is a notoriously slippery concept, consisting of some combination of wealth, military might, population size, natural resource endowments, and political will. Varying definitions of power lead to starkly different conclusions about which world order is emerging.

If power is defined only by military prowess, for example, then a bipolar order seems plausible, pitting China and the United States against each other. Add economic data, however, and East Asia, Europe, and the Gulf states enter the mix, which suggests a markedly more multipolar world. And if it turns out that China is falsifying its own economic data and is closer to internal chaos than its military parades suggest, then unipolarity once again becomes likely.

If power is defined more broadly, it seems plausible that the world is shifting toward what scholars have labeled “unbalanced multipolarity.” In such a system, there are a few great powers—the United States and China in this case—and a larger number of second-tier powers, including Australia, France, Germany, India, Japan, and Russia, among others. These second-tier powers are weaker than the superpowers but still more than capable of shaping regional dynamics.



Many second-tier powers have already started to jockey for position within this emerging system. French President Emmanuel Macron, for instance, shocked European leaders in 2023 when he declared that Europe should seek to become a “third pole” in the new world order. Meanwhile, Fernando Haddad, Brazil's finance minister, told journalists that São Paulo will not lean toward either Beijing or Washington and is “too big to be choosing partners.”

Clearly, these states do not want to get shoehorned into some new American-led anti-Chinese coalition. They remain unconvinced about a new Cold War–style bipolarity. Indeed, this was a key problem with the Biden administration's grand strategy, which tried to rerun the Cold War playbook and engineer bipolar competition with China, networking U.S. alliances and lumping Russia and China into an “axis of autocracies.”

What the Biden administration found was that many countries were no longer willing to concede to this black-and-white view of world politics. Washington's closest allies welcome trade and investment with China, even if they do not agree with its ideology or repressive governance model. States such as India are eager to buy American weapons and engage in military cooperation but at the same time join Chinese military exercises and buy Russian hydrocarbons. Middle powers act, in other words, in ways that suggest they see a multipolar world in the near future.

Underneath this seemingly esoteric debate over polarity and the new world order is an often unstated but high-stakes assumption: that a multipolar world will be worse for the United States than a bipolar one. The general thinking is that multipolarity will increase the likelihood of instability around the world, strain alliances, and leave Washington vulnerable.

But recency bias plays a role here. Because the Cold War ended peacefully and the interwar period preceding it did not, bipolarity is often associated with stability and multipolarity with danger. But some multipolar systems have been stable and long lasting, such as the Congress of Vienna in 1815, an entente between Europe's great powers that held for nearly a century. The idea that the United States is better off in a bipolar world, rather than a multipolar one, is theoretical at best.

In practice, both world orders have advantages and disadvantages. A multipolar system, for example, may heighten certain risks, such as the potential for low-level conflicts between small states, but a bipolar system could heighten others, including arms races that could escalate to great-power war. Likewise, both systems offer benefits. Under bipolarity or unipolarity, a great power may be able to prevent conflicts through increased leverage on client states. Under multipolarity, free-riding and passing the buck on collective security commitments become more difficult, which in turn lowers the costs of defense and the risks of forward deterrence for the great power.



This is not a purely academic debate: polarity is a description of the distribution of power in the international system rather than something states get to choose. But administrations can lean in to either the bipolar or the multipolar aspects of the system in their strategy. The Biden administration tried to emphasize bipolarity by elevating U.S.-Chinese competition, promoting strategies of “allied scale,” and creating a new Western coalition against an “axis of upheaval.” These strategies identified a unitary bloc of opponents in China, Iran, Russia, and others and then sought to assemble a new “free world” coalition to combat it. But this approach failed because it did not match reality—other countries remain skeptical about a bifurcated world and refuse to take a side.

Instead of artificially cleaving the world in two, the United States should choose to embrace multipolarity and craft strategy accordingly. The benefits would be significant. By leaning in to the more multipolar characteristics of the international system, such as open trade and cooperation, for instance, the United States could retain many of the economic and political perks it has enjoyed for the last 70 years. By pushing allies to take on more of the defense burden, meanwhile, and redirecting U.S. military and economic resources toward pressing security concerns, it could reduce some of the risks of a more confrontational approach to the world and avoid overextension and exhaustion. And by emphasizing flexible, transactional partnerships with states on specific issues and portfolios, a multipolar strategy would enable Washington to hedge against rising competitors such as India. In the end, this approach to security would be far cheaper than the trillions of dollars required to sustain U.S. military primacy against all potential challengers.

To successfully compete in a multipolar world, the United States will need to shift its strategy. The Trump administration has taken some initial steps in this regard. It has, for instance, encouraged its allies, especially in Europe, to share more of the burden of collective defense and turn their latent economic power into stronger military capabilities. The administration has pulled back from funding further weapons shipments to Ukraine, effectively transferring that responsibility to European states. As a result, Washington can shrink its current global military posture and concentrate its resources where they are most needed—the Indo-Pacific and the United States' own backyard in Latin America. Both Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance have suggested the U.S. military will likely draw down troops in Europe and the Middle East to better prioritize its resources for the Indo-Pacific.

The administration is also trying to maintain flexibility in the United States' bilateral and multilateral partnerships. Rather than building formal, closed alliance structures as it did during the Cold War, the United States needs to form flexible, issue-specific partnerships with a variety of states. President Donald Trump has been willing to criticize allies, often gleefully, when dealing with them and to emphasize U.S. interests over shared values. He has also engaged with adversaries such as Iran and Russia, whereas prior administrations might have balked at the prospect, fearing political blowback. Although these conversations have produced limited results, this diplomatic openness—and rejection of a black-and-white worldview—is exactly the kind of flexibility needed in a more multipolar world.

Unfortunately, other U.S. policies seem to directly contradict that worldview in favor of an aggressive unilateralism that increases some of the worst risks of multipolarity, leaving allies unsure of whether the United States is friend or foe, and even making China appear a more reliable and consistent partner. Just as President Joe Biden's attempt to divide the world into “us” and “them” risked alienating many potential partners, so, too, does Trump's willingness to come out swinging as a hostile lone actor in a changing world.



In a multipolar world, Washington should attempt to preserve global economic openness by resisting the use of coercive economic statecraft and instead bolster the resilience and diversity of global markets. But Trump has relied heavily on economic and political coercion, using tariffs, sanctions, and other forms of U.S. leverage to wrest concessions from friendly and unfriendly states alike. The unipolar moment after the Cold War allowed the United States to build a substantial arsenal of coercive tools to weaponize interdependence. Trump has shown himself willing to pull the trigger on those weapons for even the most minor reasons. As Michael Froman, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, recently put it in Foreign Affairs, “If Washington continues on its current course—defined by unilateralism, transactionalism, and mercantilism—the consequences will be grim.”

A final problem with the Trump administration's approach has been the voluntary destruction of American tools of soft power and open hostility to the multilateral structures that act as a safety net against the worst outcomes of an anarchic world. It's undoubtedly true that American aid and diplomatic institutions need reform; the same is true of the United Nations and other multilateral forums. But a United States that cannot engage diplomatically is a fundamentally less competitive and less capable global actor. And a world in which basic lifesaving services such as disaster relief and humanitarian assistance do not exist is a world in which everyone is worse off.

This confused approach leaves the United States in limbo: partly able to navigate a multipolar world, yet risking alienation and—more important—undermining the open global economic order that has served Washington so well for so long. Even as the Trump administration makes positive moves to rebalance its security commitments, it is undermining the United States' economic and diplomatic standing. From imposing draconian tariffs and sanctions to conducting seemingly random military strikes in Iran and off the coast of Venezuela, the administration has approached friends and foes alike with self-serving aggression—even though successfully navigating a more multipolar world will require strong, lean global partnerships. Ultimately, this half-baked strategy for multipolarity may be just as bad as no strategy at all.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","‘It smelled of onions and mustard,' Border Patrol officer hit by sandwich in DC testifies","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/sandwich-thrower-case-washington","Tue, 04 Nov 2025 16:33:57 GMT","


            “He did it. He threw the sandwich.”
    


            That's how the defense counsel for Sean Dunn, the man who threw a sub-style sandwich at a Border Patrol officer in Washington, DC, this summer began the federal trial against him Tuesday morning.
    


            The United States government, Dunn's attorney Julia Gatto told the jury, “turned that moment, a thrown sandwich, into a criminal case. A federal criminal case charging a federal criminal offense.”
    


            The case serves as a certain symbol in the backlash the Trump administration's deployment of federal troops this summer in DC faced from residents. The sandwich-throwing incident also became a moment of resistance in the city, with spray painted posters popping up around the capital in the wake of the alleged assault.
    


            On Tuesday, the Border Patrol officer testified about his experience.
    


            Greg Lairmore told the jury that Dunn “became really irritated and started yelling obscenities” at him and other officers that night before throwing “a subway style sandwich at me that struck me in the chest.”
    


            “It smelled of onions and mustard,” Lairmore said of the sandwich, which “exploded all over my chest.”
    


DC jurors dismissed in the trial of man charged with throwing sandwich at federal agent are deeply skeptical of the case



            Before the incident and after leaving the Subway restaurant, Dunn soon became “red faced and enraged,” Lairmore testified, “calling me and my colleagues all kinds of names. Saying we were fascist.”
    


            “I didn't respond. That's his constitutional right to express his opinion,” Lairmore, a division chief who has been with Customs and Border Protection for 23 years, said.
    


            As neither party disputes the basic facts of the case, jurors will need to determine whether the sandwich throwing is enough to convict Dunn on the misdemeanor assault charge.
    


            “Look, I understand you may all have views of the federal law enforcement presence in DC,” Assistant US Attorney John Parron told the jury during opening statements Tuesday. “And that's fine, we're not trying to convince you otherwise. But respectfully, that's not what this case is about. This case is about the fact that you can't go around throwing stuff at people when you're mad.”
    


            “When we have disputes, we settle them verbally,” Parron added, concluding that Dunn threw the sandwich and “forcibly assaulted him.”
    


            Gatto argued that the throwing of the sandwich served “as an exclamation mark at the end of a verbal outburst,” from Dunn, who was upset by the surge of federal officers in DC and the Trump administrations' deportation efforts.
    


            “He is not a fan. He thinks recent immigration enforcement is racist,” Gatto said, adding that Dunn saw the local federal takeover of DC law enforcement as “fascism.”
    


            Of the charge her client faces, Gatto said, “bodily injury, that's the standard.”
    


            “They will not come close to convincing you beyond a reasonable doubt the conduct was forcible,” Gatto concluded.
    


            A DC jury recently acquitted a different resident who was also charged with assault for allegedly moving her knee up toward an officer while being restrained after filming the officers as they made immigration-related arrests.
    


            The trial, which presiding Judge Carl Nichols called the “simplest case” in the history of the world, is expected to take no more than two days.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","US is yet to follow through on Trump promise to halt ‘all payments' to Colombia as Rubio stresses importance of relationship","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/colombia-us-trump-payments-rubio","Tue, 04 Nov 2025 15:00:01 GMT","


            More than two weeks after President Donald Trump said he would  halt “all payments” to Colombia, there has not been any interruption to the assistance, even after the administration sanctioned the country's President Gustavo Petro accusing him of playing a “role in the global illicit drug trade.”
    


            There is no comprehensive ongoing interagency review of all the US assistance programs to Colombia being carried out, US officials said. They pointed to a strong country-to-country relationship, built on decades of investment and singled out Petro as the biggest impediment to shoring up the joint efforts to tackle illicit drug production and trafficking inside the country.
    


            Days after Trump's social media post deeming Petro a drug trafficker and calling for a cutting of all payments and subsidies to the country, there was an interagency meeting planned with all of the Cabinet heads to discuss US support to Columbia, US officials said. But that meeting was canceled for unknown reasons and has not been rescheduled.
    


            The axing of the inter-agency meeting meant that Trump's national security adviser and Secretary of State Marco Rubio – who has been instrumental to the administration's overall policy approach to the region – was again left as the most influential voice in the president's ear in shaping the policy. Rubio's staff began working with the Treasury Department to quickly put sanctions on Petro into place, sources said.
    


            Rubio, following Trump's initial Truth Social post, publicly cited the “excellent” US-Colombia relationship, founded on strong partnership.
    


            When asked about the status of the policy, a senior administration official highlighted to the country's difficulty tackling drug trafficking under Petro's leadership, and pointed to a review of US assistance at the presidential level.
    


            “Despite billions of US taxpayer dollars invested in Colombia's counterdrug efforts, cartels are thriving under President Petro's failed policies. President Trump is carefully reviewing every program and only investing in projects that show clear value to protecting US citizens,” the official said.
    


            “The politics of Colombia are not actually reflected by the current president,” Rubio said as he prepared to head to Asia with Trump. “Our problem with the current president, in addition to his behavior, which has been erratic and counterproductive, is that in fact he is not cooperating on our counter-drug, and we felt that was best addressed at the individual level.”
    


            Rubio's remarks came as a relief to US officials who had been privately hoping that the administration would climb down and draw a distinction between penalizing the country and targeting the actions and bellicose rhetoric of the president.
    


            Rubio went on to say that the targeting of Petro – whom he called a “hostile foreign leader” – is “separate” from any effort to punish the joint efforts at the working level between the two countries, which the US has invested in for decades.
    


            While the administration has pointed to both Colombia and Venezuela as driving the drug trade, their approach to tackling the problem in each country greatly differs because of contrasting diplomatic histories. Tough sanctions have been imposed on Venezuela by both Republican and Democratic administrations given a rupture in diplomatic relations after the country's National Assembly declared Nicolás Maduro was not the country's legitimate leader in 2019, which was a position the US backed.
    


            And, in 2024, the US accused Maduro of stealing the country's election.
    


            Meanwhile, US-Colombia relations remain intact despite tensions at the top. Trump administration officials have also drawn up plans for strikes inside Venezuela, while there are no plans for the same kind of action inside Colombia.
    


            Trump administration officials are keenly aware of the political calendar in South America's largest country: Petro's presidency will end next year as he is constitutionally barred from running for a second term in the 2026 presidential election.
    


            “Our relationships with the people of Colombia, the economic sector of Colombia, the majority of people in politics in Colombia, and their institutions, in particular their defense institutions, are strong and enduring, and they're going to be strong and enduring long after this individual is no longer the president there,” Rubio said.
    


            Trump's anger towards Petro comes after the Colombian leader has taken on the US president very personally in addition to harshly criticizing the administration's drug war and its support for Israel.  US officials were stunned and angry when Petro joined pro-Palestinian protests in New York in September and called on US soldiers to “disobey the orders of Trump.” It prompted the US to revoke Petro's visa.
    


            But days later, back in Colombia, the left-wing leader doubled down.
    


            “If Mr. Trump keeps being complicit in the genocide, as he is up to today, he deserves nothing but jail, and his army should not obey him,” Petro said in Bogota.
    


            Petro's hostile stance towards Trump continued as the US drug boat strikes in the Caribbean have continued at a steady pace for the last two months. After one strike he accused the US of murdering a Colombian fisherman, fueling tensions and ultimately triggering Trump to declare that the US would halt payments to the nation.
    


            CNN has reported that at least one US military strike in the Caribbean over the last two months targeted Colombian nationals on a boat that had left from Colombia, according to two people briefed by the Pentagon about the strikes.
    


            When the US rolled out sanctions against Petro and two of his family members in recent weeks, Rubio also officially decertified Colombia as a partner in combatting drug trafficking. But the State Department's language announcing the decertification made clear that US support for the country's institutions are expected to endure.
    


            “We remain steadfast in our support for Colombian security forces, its justice sector, and departmental and municipal officials, and we will continue to partner with them in our joint efforts to combat drug trafficking,” the State Department announcement said. “Today's decision is not a reflection on these institutions but rather the failures and incompetence of Gustavo Petro and his inner circle.”
    


            The senior administration pointed to the sanctioning of Petro and his family as a Trump decision after the Colombian president failed to strengthen efforts to tackle the drug problem.
    


            “The decision to impose sanctions on Petro and his family was ultimately made at the Presidential level, as is every action. President Trump made it clear that Colombia is ‘failing demonstrably' to uphold its drug control responsibilities, and Petro has since doubled down in defense of his failed policies,” the official said.
    


            Some US foreign assistance to the country had already stopped after the destruction of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) early in Trump's second term. However, the US has continued to provide funding from the State and Defense departments, including on counternarcotics. The US has provided about $210 million in assistance to Colombia this fiscal year, including about $31 million in agricultural support, according to data from the US Department of State.
    


            While US officials believe that the strategy to target Petro instead of the whole of Colombia's security institutions is settled for the time being, they warn that things could always quickly change.
    


            Speaking a day after Rubio last month, Sen. Lindsey Graham said that Trump believes that both Venezuela and Colombia “have been safe havens for narco-terrorists for too long.” Graham added, during his CBS interview, that Trump said there were plans to brief members of Congress after his trip to Asia “about future potential military operations against Venezuela and Colombia.”
    


            The US has been working to establish the close relationship it has with Colombia since the late 1990s. The Clinton administration launched Plan Colombia in 2000, which was a $1.3 billion program primarily to support the military and security forces' fight against growing and trafficking narcotics.
    


            But before that period in 1997 the US had cut off assistance to Colombia and decertified it as partner in combatting drug trafficking. Many reflected that the action did not produce the intended results.
    


            “US officials concluded that we actually did more damage to ourselves by cutting off assistance to Colombia than actually punish Ernesto Samper,” said Juan Gonzalez, a former NSC official focused on the Western Hemisphere during the Biden administration who is currently a fellow at the Georgetown Americas Institute.
    


            The US support to the Colombian police was robust before that cutoff: helping pay for judicialized wiretaps, training police and vetting them. Gonzalez said that the cutoff in assistance during that period of time limited the US Department of Justice's ability build cases against the cartels inside of Colombia.
    


            Experts say that today's continued funding to Colombia's security and defense forces – which includes ongoing intelligence sharing between the two nations – is critical to achieve the administration's own goals for fighting drug trafficking.
    


            Elizabeth Dickinson, the International Crisis Group's senior analyst for Colombia, said the US support on defense is “really, really significant.”
    


            “We're talking about two militaries that are deeply integrated and cooperating, and they work more closely together, I think, than any other country that the US works with that's not in NATO,” she told CNN. “We're talking about sort of an institutional relationship, sharing of intelligence, sharing of capabilities, day to day collaboration on logistics, operations.”
    


            “If that were to go by the wayside,” Dickinson said, “the capability of the Colombian security forces would be debilitated significantly” at a time when the country is facing major security challenges.
    


            And if intelligence sharing were to be cut, it would leave the US “flying blind,” she said.
    


            “85% of all actionable intelligence that the US uses to interdict drugs in the Caribbean comes from Colombia,” Dickinson said.
    


            “If you are not sharing humint (human intelligence), electronic intel on shipments, routes, organizations, schedules, methods – you're cutting off what's needed to do the stated thing you want to do – stop the flow,” a former US diplomat who worked on the issue told CNN.
    


            Another former US diplomat who worked on the issue said cutting the security funding would be “cutting one's nose to spite one's face.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","‘Country over party': How Dick Cheney helped Liz Cheney stand up to Donald Trump","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/liz-cheney-trump-dick-cheney","Tue, 04 Nov 2025 15:37:25 GMT","


            One year after Donald Trump's supporters attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, former Vice President Dick Cheney joined his daughter Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney on the floor of the House to take a lonely position commemorating the anniversary.
    


            The Cheneys were greeted warmly by Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, then took their seats on the Republican side of the chamber. Looking around, they quickly realized they were the only Republicans there. The former vice president was stunned.
    


            “It's one thing to hear about what's happening in our party, but to see it, like this, in such stark terms,” Dick Cheney told his daughter, according to her 2023 memoir.
    


            Later that day, when reporters asked Dick Cheney what he thought about how Republican leadership had quickly reversed course and folded to Trump, he said: “Well, it's not leadership that resembles any of the folks that I knew when I was here for 10 years.”
    


            The episode is illustrative of the seismic shift inside the GOP since Trump became its standard-bearer, and the story of how Trump expelled former party leaders who broke with him after he attempted to overturn his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden.
    


            Liz Cheney says it is also the story of how her father influenced her life and career, and why she was able to stand up to Trump, a move which cost her both her leadership position and her seat in Congress.
    


            “I want people to know that my father raised me to have the courage of my convictions,” Cheney told CNN.
    


            No doubt many people will remember the 84-year-old Dick Cheney, who died on Monday evening, as one of the most powerful and controversial vice presidents in history. He became a lightning rod for criticism over his role in the Iraq War and earned the nickname “Darth Vader” for his unapologetic support for “enhanced interrogation” of US detainees after 9/11.
    


            But Liz Cheney says she hopes people will also remember that her father was one of the few Republican leaders who broke with his party and spoke out publicly against Trump. In a blunt political ad for his daughter's 2022 primary campaign, the former vice president blasted Trump as a “coward” and a “threat.”
    


            “I want people to remember that my father chose country over party,” Liz Cheney said.
    


            When Liz Cheney voted to impeach Trump after January 6, the disgraced former president still had enough influence to make sure she became a pariah in the GOP. She was kicked out of Republican leadership then defeated in a primary by a Trump ally.
    


            But neither father nor daughter backed down. Liz Cheney accepted Speaker Pelosi's invitation to be vice chair of the House January 6 committee and accused Trump of inciting the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Dick Cheney, once vilified by Democrats, joined his daughter and endorsed Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.
    


            The day Liz Cheney announced that her father would support Harris at the Texas Tribune festival, the audience responded with a huge ovation.
    


            In his endorsement, the former staunch Republican vice president said of Trump, “There has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic.”
    


            In an interview with 60 Minutes in 2021, Liz Cheney underscored their shared commitment.
    


            “I talk to my dad probably just about every single day. And he sees things the way that I see them.”
    


            Still, when asked if she ever imagined that her father would one day vote for a Democrat for president, Liz Cheney shook her head, smiled and said “No.”
    


            When Liz Cheney accepted the Profile in Courage award in May 2022 from the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library, she told a little-known story of how her father was inspired to go into public service. As a young man, Dick Cheney had planned to get his PhD and become an academic, but in 1963, he attended a speech by President John F. Kennedy and was so moved by his words he went to work in Washington.
    


            “I am tempted to stop here to say the moral of this story is if you don't like Dick Cheney's policies, you should blame John Kennedy!” Liz Cheney said to laughter.
    


            Dick Cheney went on to have a decades-long career in Republican politics, serving as the youngest White House chief of staff in history to President Gerald R. Ford, then as a congressman from Wyoming, and defense secretary in the George H. W. Bush administration.
    


            In 2000, Cheney was tapped to lead George W. Bush's vice presidential selection committee — and ultimately, took the job himself.
    


            Cheney added national security gravitas to the ticket. Once in office, he became a powerful and polarizing figure as the chief architect of the “war on terror” following the September 11, 2001, attacks and his role campaigning for the ill-fated war in Iraq in 2003.
    


            Democrats swept back into power in the 2006 midterm elections and with the 2008 election of President Barack Obama, who campaigned on promises to end the wars and other failed policies of the Bush-Cheney administration.
    


            Despite harsh criticism that “enhanced interrogation” was torture, Cheney never backed down. Discussing his memoir in 2011, Cheney said he had “no regrets” and it was “the right thing to do.”
    


            After leaving the White House, he became a strident critic of Obama's foreign policy and wrote two memoirs, including one with his daughter, Liz, titled, “Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America.”
    


            Discussing the book in 2015, Liz Cheney said her father taught her the importance of having “the courage of your convictions” and “how important it is to do what's right for the nation.”
    


            “I feel confident he will be remembered as a man of tremendous courage, and someone who did what he knew was right, even when it was tough, and even when people were criticizing him for it,” she told CNN.
    


            When Trump announced his candidacy for president in 2015 and quickly surged to the top of GOP polls, Dick Cheney said he was “surprised” Trump had done as well as he had.
    


            While publicly, Dick Cheney endorsed Trump in May 2016, privately he always had reservations about Trump's experience, temperament and foreign policy instincts. Early on in Trump's first administration, Cheney said privately that he was alarmed by the chaos as well as Trump's relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
    


            Of course, Dick Cheney had reason to keep his concerns private: His daughter was following in his footsteps. She was first elected to Congress in Wyoming in 2016, the same year as Trump's surprise victory over Hillary Clinton.
    


            As Liz Cheney quickly rose in the ranks of House Republican leadership, she stayed true to the hawkish foreign policy she shared with her father. In general, she backed Trump, but would challenge him on national security. In 2018, Cheney said she was “deeply troubled” by Trump's embrace of Putin at a Helsinki press conference.
    


            But both Cheneys became even more alarmed after Trump refused to accept his 2020 election loss.
    


            They were concerned Trump would try to stop the peaceful transfer of power on January 6, the day Congress was scheduled to certify the election. As Liz Cheney was leaving her parents' house on New Year's Day, her father told her, “Defend the republic, daughter,” according to her memoir.
    


            She responded, “I will, Dad. Always.”
    


            Liz Cheney wrote that her father helped to organize a letter signed by all 10 former defense secretaries, which said that the election was over and warned against any use of the military.
    


            On January 6, when Trump said in his speech on the Ellipse that his supporters should get rid of “the Liz Cheneys of the world,” Dick Cheney called to warn his daughter that she was in danger.
    


            A week later, she was one of 10 House Republicans who joined with Democrats to impeach Trump over the attack on the Capitol. That vote was the beginning of the end of Cheney's role in House Republican leadership. In May 2021, she was forced out as GOP conference chair.
    


            Asked afterward what advice her father had given her, Liz Cheney said in an NBC interview that she learned from him “the importance of having the courage of your convictions.”
    


            “People say well this is courageous, you know, I'm not landing on Omaha Beach — that's courage,” she said. “This is duty, this is what our oath requires and what history requires, and I'm just incredibly proud to be Dick Cheney's daughter.”
    


            Ostracized from the House GOP, Cheney joined Democrats on the January 6 committee, giving the panel a bipartisan imprimatur as it uncovered shocking new details about the attack and Trump's role.
    


            The day Cheney received the invitation from Speaker Pelosi, she happened to be with her father. When she shared the news, he said: “I'm proud of you.”
    


            “Every step of the way he was fully supportive,” Liz Cheney said of her father. “He was heartbroken about what was happening in our country.”
    


            On the first anniversary of the January 6 attack, the Cheneys were met with a line-up of Democrats thanking them for being there to honor the anniversary.
    


            Pelosi specifically applauded the former vice president for his appearance.
    


            “That he would come this day with Liz Cheney, as you know, his daughter, was quite a statement on his part, one that was well received by the rest of us,” Pelosi told CNN's Anderson Cooper that night. “We've had our disagreements, but never a disagreement as to whether everybody was committed to honoring our oath of office to support and defend the constitution of the United States.”
    


            Liz Cheney's role on the January 6 committee put her further at odds with her party as Trump quickly regained his influence over the GOP and vowed revenge.
    


            When Cheney tried to keep her seat in Congress, Trump did everything he could to defeat her.
    


            “There is no RINO in America who has thrown in her lot with the radical left more than Liz Cheney,” Trump said at a Wyoming rally he held in May 2022 ahead of the primary.
    


            In response, Dick Cheney made a television ad attacking Trump to try to help his daughter keep the Wyoming seat he also held for a decade.
    


            “He is a coward,” Cheney said, speaking directly into the camera. “A real man wouldn't lie to his supporters, he lost his election and he lost big. I know it, he knows it, and I think deep down most Republicans know it.”
    


            When Liz Cheney was defeated, she vowed to do everything in her power to stop Trump from returning to the Oval Office.
    


            “Two years ago, I won this primary with 73% of the vote. I could have easily done the same again,” she said in her concession speech. “The path was clear, but it would've required that I go along with President Trump's lie about the 2020 election, it would've required that I enable his ongoing efforts to unravel our democratic system, and attack the foundations of our republic. That was a path I could not and would not take.”
    


            In 2024, Trump easily won the Republican nomination and was facing off against Harris after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race.
    


            The Cheneys had one more decision to make: Whether Dick Cheney would support a Democrat. Breaking with his Republican past, he did.
    


            In September, he issued a statement endorsing Harris: “As citizens, we each have a duty to put country above partisanship to defend our Constitution. That is why I will be casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris.”
    


            Liz Cheney went a step further and appeared at several rallies with Harris, in an attempt to reach out to disaffected Republicans.
    


            “I was a Republican even before Donald Trump started spray tanning,” Liz Cheney said at a campaign event with Harris in October 2024. “I have never voted for a Democrat but this year I am proudly casting my vote for Kamala Harris.”
    


            When Harris and Liz Cheney appeared together, the vice president specifically thanked Dick Cheney as well.
    


            “I also want to thank your father, Vice President Dick Cheney, for his support and what he has done to serve our country. Every endorsement matters, and this endorsement matters a great deal, Liz,” Harris said.
    


            On a lighter note, reflecting on her father's legacy, Liz Cheney said that the “Darth Vader” nickname he was given while vice president was always laughed about inside the family.
    


            “He's really the opposite of his public persona,” she said. “That's why the Darth Vader caricature was so funny to us, and it became a family joke.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Key moments that led to FBI arrests in alleged Michigan terrorist plot","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/04/us/fbi-investigation-michigan-terrorist-plot","Tue, 04 Nov 2025 12:00:02 GMT","


            A series of encrypted phone calls – secretly recorded by a confidential FBI source – tipped off federal agents that a group was allegedly planning to carry out a terrorist attack in Michigan on behalf of ISIS, according to a criminal complaint unsealed Monday.
    


            Mohmed Ali, 20, and Majed Mahmoud, 20, face charges of “Receiving and transferring, and attempting and conspiring to transfer, firearms and ammunition knowing and having reasonable cause to believe that the firearms and ammunition would be used to commit a Federal crime of terrorism,” according to the criminal complaint.
    


            Federal officials have yet to charge a third person – a juvenile described throughout the complaint as Person 1 – in connection with the alleged plot.
    


            But the complaint details how agents doggedly surveilled the alleged co-conspirators for two months as they visited multiple gun ranges and held late-night meetings in local parks during what authorities allege was preparation for a possible terrorist attack.
    


            Then, based on what they believed to be references to a possible attack on Halloween, agents swooped in to seize the weapons and take the men into custody in the predawn hours of October 31.
    


            Here's what we know about how the investigation unfolded:
    


            According to an FBI affidavit supporting the criminal complaint, the agency began surveilling a man, described as “co-conspirator 1,” in 2024 as he traveled in the US and overseas.
    


            In June, agents allegedly tracked the man's phone to Dearborn, Michigan, and physical surveillance led them to Ali's home there, where he stayed for two nights.
    


            The following month, according to the FBI, the man joined a group call from overseas with five others – including an FBI confidential source, who recorded the meeting. Person 1, Mahmoud and Ali do not appear to have been part of this call.
    


5 key questions about how arrests in Michigan terror plot went down



            During the call, the group allegedly discussed “traveling together to Syria to join ISIS” and co-conspirator 1 said they were “gonna die there … unless,” he told the group, “the Amir sends you to Paris for a 2015.”
    


            A review of co-conspirator 1's cellphone allegedly revealed he had “Person 1's phone number saved in his phone under ‘Athari' and ALI's phone number saved in his phone as ‘Bukhari.'”
    


            According to the complaint, one of the participants on the call also stated, “Athari and Bukhari said they were going to stay back and do the ‘same thing as France.'”
    


            “Knowing Athari, it's (the attack) probably going to be at like a club, a disco,” co-conspirator 1 said, according to the complaint.
    


            The reference to Paris stood out to FBI counterterrorism experts. They concluded it was a thinly veiled nod to the coordinated ISIS-linked terrorist attacks that unfolded across Paris in November 2015. More than 130 people were killed in the attacks and scores more were wounded.
    


            After studying the call, the FBI concluded an attack could be imminent and began keeping close tabs on Ali and Mahmoud.
    


Suspects charged in alleged terror plot cited ISIS and may have tried to replicate Paris terror attack on US soil, FBI says



            According to the complaint, in the months following the June meeting with “co-conspirator 1,” Ali allegedly purchased a Beretta A300 Ultimata Black Shotgun, a “Sabre” Forged 16” rifle, as well as a holographic sight “built for close-quarter engagements with fast moving targets.”
    


            Mahmoud also allegedly purchased a rifle and two boxes of ammunition with more than 800 rounds in each box. In October, he allegedly purchased a red dot sight, which provides “the shooter a single point of focus during the aiming process,” according to the complaint.
    


            Then, in September and October, Ali, Mahmoud and Person 1 began practicing at local shooting ranges, under the watchful eye of FBI agents, the complaint states.
    


            Security footage obtained by the FBI shows all three men visiting local gun ranges over the course of several weeks.
    


            On multiple occasions, undercover FBI agents entered the range and surveilled the men from nearby as they practiced firing weapons. Although the agents did not identify themselves, according to the complaint they observed the men practicing with guns and ammunition like those they had previously purchased.
    


            Although Ali, Mahmoud and Person 1 are all under 21, the complaint noted in September they began traveling to a popular area in Ferndale, Michigan, known for its bars and clubs.
    


            “Many of the clubs and bars in this area intentionally attract members of the LGBTQ+ community,” the complaint states.
    


            The following month, FBI agents “observed three individuals appearing to match the physical description” of Person 1, Ali, and Mahmoud meeting at a local park in Dearborn, Michigan, around 9 p.m. They met up again the following week at another park.
    


            Since the men all live with their families, the FBI concluded the late-night meetups at the park “reflect their efforts to meet to plan an attack without being detected.”
    


            In September and October, the FBI received court-approved authorization to surveil communications between Person 1, Ali and Mahmoud.
    


            In calls and messages, they found multiple mentions of “pumpkin,” which agents concluded was a reference to “Halloween as the potential day for the attack they were plotting, an attack that they understood could result in their deaths and martyrdom.”
    


            “So ya, I talked to my brothers. We are going to do pumpkin,” Person 1 allegedly told Ali on October 24, according to the complaint.
    


            The FBI later notes in the complaint references to “brothers” likely mean “other ISIS supporters.”
    


            As the Halloween weekend loomed, a judge authorized the execution of search warrants on Ali and Mahmoud's homes.
    


            In the predawn hours of October 31, FBI agents descended on the Detroit suburb where the men lived and detonated smoke bombs before storming into their homes.
    


            Both Ali and Mahmoud were arrested.
    


            FBI Director Kash Patel later tweeted about the foiled terrorist plot but offered little additional detail. As a result, some Dearborn residents speculated whether the arrests were justified, or perhaps a way to profile the city's large Arab population, which has long been targeted for Islamophobic attacks.
    


            But on Monday, Attorney General Pam Bondi boasted on X the unsealed criminal complaint revealed “a major ISIS-linked terror plot.”
    


            “Our American heroes prevented a terror attack,” Bondi wrote.
    


            Both Mahmoud and Ali were shackled as they were escorted into court Monday, according to CNN reporters who attended the hearing. Both men acknowledged they had read the complaint against them and understood the charges.
    


            Attorneys for both of the men briefly spoke to reporters after the hearing, but declined to comment.
    


            Co-conspirator 1 has not been charged.
    


            If convicted, Ali and Mahmoud could face up to 15 years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine, a spokesperson for the US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Dick Cheney, influential Republican vice president to George W. Bush, dies","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/dick-cheney-death-obit","Tue, 04 Nov 2025 11:17:43 GMT","


            Dick Cheney, America's most powerful modern vice president and chief architect of the “war on terror,” who helped lead the country into the ill-fated Iraq war on faulty assumptions, has died, according to a statement from his family. He was 84.
    


            “His beloved wife of 61 years, Lynne, his daughters, Liz and Mary, and other family members were with him as he passed,” the family said, adding that he died due to complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease.
    


            “Dick Cheney was a great and good man who taught his children and grandchildren to love our country, and to live lives of courage, honor, love, kindness, and fly fishing,” the family added.
    


            “We are grateful beyond measure for all Dick Cheney did for our country. And we are blessed beyond measure to have loved and been loved by this noble giant of a man.”
    


            The 46th vice president, who served alongside Republican President George W. Bush for two terms between 2001 and 2009, was for decades a towering and polarizing Washington power player.
    


            Bush described Cheney in a statement Tuesday as a “decent, honorable man.” “History will remember him as among the finest public servants of his generation – a patriot who brought integrity, high intelligence, and seriousness of purpose to every position,” Bush said.
    


            In his final years, Cheney, still a hardline conservative, nevertheless became largely ostracized from his party over his intense criticism of President Donald Trump whom he branded a “coward” and the greatest-ever threat to the republic.
    


            In an ironic coda to a storied political career, he cast his final vote in a presidential election in 2024 for a liberal Democrat, and fellow member of the vice president's club, Kamala Harris, in a reflection of how the populist GOP had turned against his traditional conservatism.
    


            Cheney was plagued by cardiovascular disease for most of his adult life, surviving a series of heart attacks, to lead a full, vigorous life and lived many years in retirement after a heart transplant in 2012 that he hailed in a 2014 interview as “the gift of life itself.”
    


            Cheney, a sardonic former Wyoming representative, White House chief of staff and defense secretary, was enjoying a lucrative career in the corporate world when he was charged by George W. Bush with vetting potential vice-presidential nominees. The quest ended with Cheney himself taking the oath of office as a worldly number two to a callow new president who arrived in the Oval Office after a disputed election.
    


            While caricatures of Cheney as the real president do not accurately capture the true dynamics of Bush's inner circle, he relished the enormous influence that he wielded from behind the scenes.
    


            Cheney was in the White House, with the president out of town on the crisp, clear morning of September 11, 2001. In the split second of horror when a second hijacked plane hit the World Trade Center in New York, he said he became a changed man, determined to avenge the al Qaeda-orchestrated attacks and to enforce US power throughout the Middle East with a neo-conservative doctrine of regime change and pre-emptive war.
    


            “At that moment, you knew this was a deliberate act. This was a terrorist act,” he recalled of that day in an interview with CNN's John King in 2002.
    


            Cheney reflected in later years on how the attacks left him with overwhelming sense of responsibility to ensure such an assault on the homeland never happened again. Perceptions however that he was the sole driving force behind the war on terror and US ventures into Iraq and Afghanistan are misleading.
    


            Contemporary and historic accounts of the administration show that Bush was his own self-styled “The Decider.”
    


            From a bunker deep below the White House, Cheney went into crisis mode, directing the response of a grief-stricken nation suddenly at war. He gave the extraordinary order to authorize the shooting down of any more hijacked airliners in the event they were headed to the White House or the US Capitol building. For many, his frequent departures to “undisclosed” locations outside Washington to preserve the presidential chain of succession reinforced his image as an omnipotent figure waging covert war from the shadows. His hawkishness and alarmist view of a nation facing grave threats was not an outlier at the time – especially during a traumatic period that included anthrax mailings and sniper shootings around Washington, DC, that exacerbated a sense of public fear even though they were unrelated to 9/11.
    


            The September 11 attacks unleashed the US war in Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban, which was harboring al Qaeda, though the terror group's leader Osama bin Laden escaped. Soon, Cheney was agitating for widening the US assault to Iraq and its leader, Saddam Hussein, whose forces he had helped to eject from Kuwait in the first Gulf War as President George H.W. Bush's Pentagon chief.
    


            The vice president's aggressive warnings about Iraq's supposed weapons of mass destruction programs, alleged links to al Qaeda and intent to furnish terrorists with deadly weapons to attack the United States played a huge role in laying the groundwork for the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. Congressional reports and other post-war inquiries later showed that Cheney and other administration officials exaggerated, misrepresented or did not properly portray faulty intelligence about weapons of mass destruction programs that Iraq turned out not to possess. One of Cheney's most infamous claims, that the chief 9/11 hijacker Mohamed Atta, met Iraqi intelligence officials in Prague, was never substantiated, including by the independent commission into the September 11 attacks.
    


            But Cheney insisted in 2005 that he and other top officials were acting on “the best available intelligence,” at the time.
    


            While admitting that the flaws in the intelligence were plain in hindsight, he insisted that any claim that the data was “distorted, hyped, or fabricated” was “utterly false.”
    


            The conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan also led the US down a dark legal and moral path including “enhanced interrogations” of terror suspects that critics blasted as torture. But Cheney – who was at the center of every facet of the global war on terrorism – insisted methods like waterboarding were perfectly acceptable. Cheney was also an outspoken advocate for holding terror suspects without trial at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba – a practice that critics at home and abroad branded an affront to core American values.
    


            Cheney became a symbol of the excesses of the anti-terror campaigns and the fatally false premises and poor planning that turned the initially successful invasion of Iraq into a bloody quagmire. He left office reviled by Democrats and with an approval rating of 31%, according to the Pew Research Center.



            To the end of his life, Cheney expressed no regrets, certain he had merely done what was necessary to respond to an unprecedented attack on the US mainland that killed nearly 3,000 people and led to nearly two decades of foreign wars that divided the nation and transformed its politics.
    


            “I would do it again in a minute,” Cheney said, when confronted by a Senate Intelligence Committee report in 2014 that concluded enhanced interrogation methods as brutal and ineffective and responsible for damaging US standing in the eyes of the world.
    


            Of the Iraq war, he told CNN in 2015: “It was the right thing to do then. I believed it then and I believe it now.”
    


            Cheney's aggressive anti-terror policies fit into a personal doctrine that justified extraordinary presidential powers with limited congressional oversight. That was in line with his belief that the authority of the executive branch had been mistakenly eroded in the aftermath of the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal that led to the resignation of his first presidential boss, President Richard Nixon.
    


            Yet in his final years, Cheney emerged as a fierce critic of a man who had an even more expansive view of the powers of the presidency than he did – Trump. Cheney had supported Trump in 2016 despite his criticism of Bush-Cheney foreign policies and his transformation of the party of Reagan into a populist, nationalist GOP. But the ending of the president's first term, when his refusal to accept his 2020 election defeat led to the January 6 insurrection, caused Cheney to speak out, in a rare, public manner.
    


            The former vice president's daughter, then-Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, meanwhile, sacrificed a promising career in the GOP to oppose Trump after his attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election and the US Capitol insurrection on January 6, 2021. In an ad for his daughter's unsuccessful campaign to fight off a pro-Trump candidate's primary challenge in 2022, Dick Cheney – who was, by then, rarely seen in public – looked directly into the camera from under a wide brimmed cowboy hat and delivered an extraordinary direct message.
    


            “In our nation's 246-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,” Cheney said.
    


            “He is a coward. A real man wouldn't lie to his supporters. He lost his election, and he lost big. I know it. He knows it, and deep down, I think most Republicans know.”
    


            Richard Bruce Cheney was born January 30, 1941, in Lincoln, Nebraska. While living in the small mountain town of Casper, Wyoming, he met his high school sweetheart and future wife Lynne Vincent. Cheney was accepted to Yale University on a scholarship, but he struggled to fit in and maintain his grades. By his own admission, he was kicked out.
    


            He returned West to work on power lines and was twice arrested for driving under the influence. In a turning point for Cheney, he was given an ultimatum from Lynne, who had “made it clear she wasn't interested in marrying a lineman for the county,” he told The New Yorker. “I buckled down and applied myself. Decided it was time to make something of myself,” he told the magazine.
    


            Cheney went back to school and earned a bachelor's and master's in political science from University of Wyoming. The couple was married in 1964.
    


            Cheney is survived by Lynne, his daughters Liz and Mary Cheney and seven grandchildren.
    


            Cheney began honing his inside power game – at which he became a master – as an aide to Nixon.
    


            He was later picked by Donald Rumsfeld as his deputy White House chief of staff under President Gerald Ford and then succeeded his mentor and close friend in the job in 1975 when Rumsfeld departed to become defense secretary. Cheney was instrumental in reviving their partnership in 2001 when he recalled Rumsfeld from the political wilderness to return to the Pentagon.The pair formed an extraordinary backroom alliance in the Bush administration throughout the war on terror and the Iraq war – much to the frustration of more moderate members of the administration including then-Secretary of State Colin Powell and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice – who took over from Powell in the second term.
    


            While Democratic President Jimmy Carter was in the White House, Cheney decided to run for Congress and was elected to Wyoming's sole US House seat in 1978. Cheney served six terms, rising to become House minority whip, and racked up a very conservative voting record.
    


            In 1989, President George H. W. Bush, who had served with Cheney in the Ford administration, tapped him to serve as his defense secretary, calling him a “trusted friend, adviser.” He was confirmed by the Senate in a 92-0 vote.
    


            As Pentagon chief, Cheney showed considerable skill in directing the US invasion of Panama in 1989 and Operation Desert Storm in 1991 to push Iraq's troops out of Kuwait. Following his stint as defense secretary, Cheney briefly explored a run for president in the 1996 election cycle but decided against it.
    


            During Democrat Bill Clinton's presidency, Cheney joined Dallas-based Halliburton Co. serving as its chief executive officer.
    


            It wouldn't be until the younger Bush decided to run for office that Cheney was chosen to lead the Republican candidate's search for a running mate and, after initially turning down the job, ended up being added to the GOP ticket.
    


            “During the process, I came to the conclusion that the selector was the best person to be selected,” Bush said in the 2020 CNN film “President in Waiting.”
    


            Cheney brought a wealth of knowledge and experience to areas where critics complained Bush was weak. As a former Texas governor, Bush had no elected experience in Washington and little military and foreign policy background compared with Cheney.
    


            Early in Bush's presidency, Cheney led a task force to develop the administration's energy policy and sought to keep its records secret in a fight that lasted Bush's first term and went all the way to the US Supreme Court.
    


            He was, however, at odds with Bush over the issue of same-sex marriage, saying that it should be left to the states to decide. In a 2004 town hall, he noted his daughter Mary's sexual orientation reportedly for the first time publicly, according to The Washington Post. “With respect to the question of relationships, my general view is that freedom means freedom for everyone.People … ought to be free to enter into any kind of relationship they want to,” he said, the Post reported.
    


            His relationship with Bush was complicated in later years, including by Bush's refusal to pardon Cheney's chief of staff Scooter Libby, who had been convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice in 2007 after a probe into who leaked the identity of a CIA operative. Libby was eventually pardoned by Trump in 2018.
    


            In one of the most notorious moments in his personal life, which added to his grizzled legend in 2006, Cheney accidentally shot a hunting partner in the face with birdshot, causing relatively minor wounds.
    


            Cheney's health issues began in 1978, when he had his first heart attack at age 37 while running for Congress. Three more followed in 1984, 1988 and November 2000, just a few days into the Florida presidential ballot recount that resulted in a Bush-Cheney win.
    


            Cheney at the time said that he'd be the “the first to step down” if he learned he'd be unable to do the job and had a resignation letter in case he was deemed incapacitated.Cheney completed both terms under Bush, attending Barack Obama's inauguration in January 2009 in a wheelchair.
    


            A year after a fifth heart attack in 2010, Cheney received a heart pump that kept the organ running until his transplant in 2012.
    


            After leaving office, Cheney returned to private life, penning two memoirs — one about his personal and political career and the other about his struggles with heart disease as well as a book with his daughter, Liz. He became one of the most strident GOP critics of President Barack Obama, who had based his election campaign on promises to end the wars and other changes from what he called failed policies of the Bush-Cheney administration.
    


            Years later, Cheney was decrying his own party — especially its leadership's response to the attack on the Capitol — when he returned to the US Capitol with then-Rep. Liz Cheney on the one-year anniversary of January 6, 2021.
    


            “I am deeply disappointed at the failure of many members of my party to recognize the grave nature of the January 6 attacks and the ongoing threat to our nation,” he said in a statement.
    


            In a remarkable moment, Democrats lined up to greet the former Republican vice president and shake his hand. Former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi hugged Cheney. The former vice president slammed Republican leaders in Congress, saying they do not resemble the leaders he remembered from his time in the body.
    


            It was a scene that would have been unthinkable two decades earlier and an illustration of how the extraordinary changes in American politics wrought by Trump had made former bitter political foes find common cause in the fight for democracy.
    


            “It's not leadership that resembles any of the folks I knew when I was here for 10 years,” Cheney said at the Capitol in 2022.
    


            Cheney continued his criticism of Trump in the following years and went as far as to endorse then-Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat and Trump's opponent in the 2024 presidential campaign. He said he would vote for Harris because of the “duty to put country above partisanship to defend our Constitution.” Cheney emphasized his disdain for Trump at the time and warned that he “can never be trusted with power again,” though Trump would go on to win the presidency a couple of months later.

BOSTON (AP) — Two Massachusetts men were arrested Tuesday in connection with a weekend explosion at Harvard Medical School, authorities said.

Logan David Patterson and Dominick Frank Cardoza face charges of conspiracy to damage by means of fire or an explosive, according to the charging document. Patterson, an 18-year-old from Plymouth, and Cardoza, a 20-year-old from Bourne, were arrested Tuesday morning and were due to be arraigned in federal court later in the day.

The explosion occurred early Saturday on the fourth floor of Harvard Medical School's Goldenson Building. No one was injured. The building houses labs and offices associated with the school's neurobiology department.

According to the charging document, witnesses stated the two men were visiting Wentworth College for Halloween activities. Surveillance footage captured Patterson and Cardoza walking toward the Harvard Medical School. Witnesses said the pair chose the building because it looked abandoned. They also said the pair gained access to the building via the roof, the charging document states.

Medical school officials said the explosion caused no structural damage and that all labs and equipment remained intact. The Boston Fire Department determined that the explosion was intentional. Police said officers did not find additional devices during a sweep of the building.

An officer who responded to a fire alarm that morning encountered two people running from the building, university police said.

Watch live voting from across the U.S. on Election Day 2025, including for Virginia and New Jersey governor, New York City mayor and a California proposition to redraw its congressional district boundaries.

Voters on Tuesday will be casting ballots in U.S. state and local elections with an injection of presidential-level politics, including a pair of competitive races for governor in New Jersey and Virginia, the mayoral race in the nation's largest city and a ballot measure in California that Democrats are counting on for next year's elections to determine control of Congress. 

The off-year elections have drawn President Donald Trump's attention, and no race has attracted as much lip service or social media opinions from Trump as the mayor's race in his hometown of New York City.

Though local issues are a major factor in Tuesday's contests, the winners take on an outsize role in a year when Trump has battled with governors and mayors as he's deployed National Guard troops and immigration agents across cities and states. For Democrats, the offices offer a chance to push back on the president's agenda, while Republicans see it as an opportunity to support his aims. 

Here's what to know about Election Day 2025:

What form of ID to bring: 

Different states have different voter identification rules, so it's important to know the voter ID laws in your state before heading off to cast your ballot. Those laws determine whether voters need to show an ID and, if so, what kind. The National Conference of State Legislatures website provides information on voter ID laws in effect. 

▶ Read more here to find what ID you need to bring to vote in your state. 

How to find your polling station: 

Your polling station is dependent on your residential address. To find out your polling place, get in touch with your state or local election office by visiting their website. You can also check your voter registration.

▶ Find your state or local election office here. 

Before casting ballots, voters can review voter guides and sample ballots that include the candidates and the state or local issues up for a vote. Voter guides offer more information on candidates and ballot measures.

The two leading candidates in a special election to fill the 18th Congressional District seat in Houston that's been vacant most of this year since the death of Democratic Rep. Sylvester Turner stood nearly side by side outside a community center Tuesday asking voters for their support.

Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee and former Houston City Council member Amanda Edwards greeted voters as they drove into the parking lot of the Acres Homes Multi-Service Center in northwest Houston.

Standing by the parking lot's entrance on a hot and sunny day, both candidates passed out campaign flyers as voters rolled down their vehicles' windows and briefly talked to Menefee and Edwards before parking their cars.

Edwards told voters she would represent the congressional district to “bring home economic opportunities, education, housing and health care.”

Menefee's wife, Kaitlyn, handed out flyers and told voters her husband as county attorney had “fought Trump and won before. He'll do it again.” Menefee would then come up to drivers, shake their hands and ask for their vote.

A steady stream of voters trickled into the vote center at the public library in Norco, California on Tuesday morning.

Tyler Ziemann, a 39-year-old firefighter, said he voted against the only state measure on the ballot — a proposal to redraw California's maps to add five Democratic U.S. House seats in response to President Trump's redistricting moves in Texas.

“I think that it's a power grab,” said Ziemann, adding he doesn't typically vote in line with just one political party. “They're just trying to redraw district lines in their benefit, and it should just be done the way we've always done it.”

The Southern California equestrian community of about 25,000 people is lined with riding trails and strip malls and known as “Horsetown USA.” It's one of a cluster of inland cities in a congressional district represented by Republican Ken Calvert that could be affected by the measure known as Prop. 50.

Amy Leos, a 50-year-old Republican from Norco, said she voted against it. “I feel like voting ‘yes' would be setting up even more of a blue state,” Leos said.

While Trump lost Virginia and New Jersey last fall, there were significant shifts to the right in both states. In New Jersey, Trump's 16-percentage-point loss in 2020 shrank to less than 6 percentage points in 2024.

Those shifts were fueled by Trump's increasing popularity among traditional Democratic loyalists: labor union members, Black men, Hispanic voters and younger people. Democrats are particularly vulnerable in New Jersey, which has among the largest percentage of labor union households in the nation.

If those pro-Trump trends continue this week, Democrats could be in trouble.

But Trump isn't on the ballot, of course. And the Trump coalition — especially lower-propensity voters — hasn't typically shown up in the same numbers in nonpresidential years.

The Democratic gubernatorial candidate cast her ballot in the closely watched contest in Montclair, New Jersey, accompanied by her husband, Jason Hedberg, and two of their four children Tuesday morning.

“I think I'm going to do quite well today,” she told reporters afterward.

Asked about Election Day bomb threats at several New Jersey polling places, Sherrill said she was told none of them was credible and state voters wouldn't be deterred.

“Obviously this is an attempt to suppress the vote here, and I don't think New Jerseyans take very kindly to that kind of tampering in our election system,” she said.

Her opponent, Republican Jack Ciattarelli, cast his ballot during early voting last week in Bridgewater.

The president didn't set foot in Virginia or New Jersey to campaign with Republican gubernatorial candidates Winsome Earle-Sears or Jack Ciattarelli, but both contests will likely be viewed as a referendum on Trump's job so far.

The president endorsed Ciattarelli in New Jersey's governor's race but held only a pair of tele-town halls on his behalf, including one Monday night. Trump also did a Monday night tele-town hall for Virginia Republican candidates, but he didn't mention Earle-Sears, speaking mostly in favor of the GOP candidate for attorney general.

Earlier in the campaign, Trump gave Earle-Sears only a half-hearted endorsement, saying he supported the GOP candidate for governor though he didn't use her name. Earle-Sears was nonetheless a fierce defender of Trump and his policies, just as Ciattarelli was in New Jersey.

Back in June, voters in New York City's Democratic primary had the option to select up to five candidates by order of preference under a system known as ranked-choice voting. This time around, they can only pick one. That's because the ranked-choice system, approved by ballot measure in 2019, only applies in primaries — not in the general election match-up.

Still, in a memorable moment from last month's debate, the candidates were asked how they would fill out their ballots if the ranked-choice system were in effect. Cuomo and Sliwa both said they'd only rank themselves, while Mamdani said he'd rank himself first followed by Sliwa. “Oh, please,” the Republican replied, deploying a bit of Gen Z slang, “don't be glazing me here, Zohran!”

Stephanie Uhl, 38, is currently working without pay for the Defense Department under the government shutdown and said of the Republican Party's support for tariffs and the current risk to SNAP benefits, “I hate what they're doing to the economy.”

“I can afford (it) just fine, but it bothers me that it affects so many other people, and they don't care,” she said after casting her ballot at the Aurora Hills Library in Arlington.

Uhl, who describes herself as caring more about issues than party, said she voted for former Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger for governor, but couldn't bring herself to vote for Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for attorney general, after learning of the violent references he made to other Virginia lawmakers in text messages made public last month.

Tuesday offers a test of two very different Democratic philosophies on display from candidates: toeing a moderate line or fully embracing far-left progressivism. But it also presents a scenario in which both, or neither, could be successful — making drawing conclusions going forward more difficult.

The party's candidates for governor, New Jersey Rep. Mikie Sherrill and former Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, have focused largely on the economy, public safety and health care, distancing themselves from some of the Democratic Party's far-left policies.

A growing collection of Democratic leaders believe the moderate approach holds the key to the party's revival after the GOP won the White House and both congressional chambers last year. Tuesday could be a key indicator of whether they're right.

Election Day comes in the midst of a federal government shutdown that's already spanned more than a month. Both parties in Congress blame each other, and there's no end in sight.

Will it matter?

Virginia is home to more than 134,000 federal workers, many of whom have been furloughed or are being forced to work without pay. New Jersey has nearly 21,000 federal employees, according to the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service, out of a total of more than 2 million such government employees nationwide.

Either number is more than enough to swing a close election.

At the same time, millions of people may be losing critical food assistance from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, offering voters another urgent reason to express their displeasure.

“Many Mamdani voters will be furious that you came from behind by stoking what they will see as Islamophobia, with recent ads and appearances on conservative media,” said host Brian Lehrer in an interview on WNYC radio.

Cuomo at first insisted Lehrer had it “upside down.” “I am all about unifying,” he said, touting his record as governor and accusing Mamdani of being the divisive one.

But Lehrer continued to press Cuomo, who has been criticized for failing to speak out against bigoted attacks on Mamdani from some allies.

Cuomo responded that he's met with members of “the Muslim community” and said he wants to make them a “big part” of his administration and appoint them to senior positions.

The Republican mayoral candidate and animal rights activist tried to bring a cat with him into the polling place when he voted in the 2021 city election, but was rebuffed.

On Tuesday, he settled for a cat tie and held a book about cats, “Pawverbs For A Cat Lover's Heart,” while wearing his signature red beret at a school in the Bronx as he accompanied his wife, Nancy.

“And you know animals throughout the city will be partying hearty because they'll have a friend both in Gracie Mansion and in City Hall,” he said.

Sliwa had cast his ballot earlier during early voting.

Nearly 20% of Chester County voters were left off the original poll books provided to polling locations, according to county officials.

Voters registered as anything other than Republican or Democrat were missing from poll books, including those registered with the Green Party, with the Libertarian Party, with another party or without party affiliation. It amounted to about 75,000 registered voters out of roughly 385,000 in the county.

County election officials became aware of the problem just after polling places opened and were “actively deploying” supplemental poll books to 230 polling locations, according to county spokesperson Rebecca Brain. There will be a formal review.

A majority of voters in Chester County, about an hour's drive west of Philadelphia, backed Democrat Kamala Harris over Republican Donald Trump in last year's presidential election. Voters on Tuesday were weighing in on local offices, as well as on members of Pennsylvania's highest court. Three Democratic justices on the state Supreme Court were running in retention elections, in which voters give a “yes” or “no” on whether they serve another term.

Third-party voters were offered a provisional ballot if their name wasn't in the poll book Tuesday morning.

Republican officials in Texas are asking voters to add language to the state constitution they say will make sure noncitizens don't vote in any elections there.

Critics of the measure up for a vote Tuesday say it's not necessary and perpetuates a false narrative that voting by noncitizens is a serious problem.

The Texas Constitution's article on voting begins with a list of people forbidden to vote, such as those under 18. The amendment would add noncitizens to the list. It's already illegal under state and federal law for non-citizens to vote.

Supporters note that at least 20 communities across the country allow noncitizens to vote in local elections, including the District of Columbia.

Voters in 14 other states have added similar language to their constitutions, and proposed amendments will be on the ballot in Kansas and South Dakota in November 2026.

The U.S. doesn't have a single government agency that collects and releases election results. The Associated Press has filled this gap for nearly 180 years.

Elections are administered locally by thousands of offices, following standards set by the states. In many cases, the states themselves don't offer up-to-date tracking of results.

The AP provides critical information in the period between Election Day and the official certification of results, which typically takes weeks.

The seat in the 18th Congressional District has been vacant since the death of Democratic Rep. Sylvester Turner in March. Turner was only months into his first term after serving as Houston's mayor.

Sixteen candidates are on the ballot in the heavily Democratic district. The biggest names include Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee and Amanda Edwards, a former Houston City Council member. If no candidate gets more than 50% of the vote Tuesday, there will be a runoff.

Democrats accused Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott of delaying the special election after Turner's death to protect the GOP's slim majority. Abbott has said Harris County officials needed more time to prepare for the election.

Confusion has lingered because many of the district's residents will vote in a different district next year under a redrawn map demanded by President Trump in an effort to increase the number of GOP seats.

One thing on voters' minds heading into Election Day in the two states holding elections for governor was the rising cost of energy bills.

The parties were split on the solutions they were pitching to voters.

The Democratic candidates embrace clean energy options like wind and solar. Meanwhile, the two states' Republican nominees are more closely aligned with the policies of President Donald Trump, who's called climate change a “con job” and promotes more traditional energy sources like gas and coal.

Democrat Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli are fighting to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy.

While New Jersey has been a reliably blue state in Senate and presidential election years, it's shown signs of shifting Republican. And it swings back and forth between parties in odd-year contests for governor.

Sherrill is a four-term U.S. representative and former Navy helicopter pilot. Ciattarelli is a former state Assemblyman backed by Trump.

The former New York governor cast his ballot at a high school shortly after 10 a.m., talking and shaking hands with people at the polling location while surrounded by TV news cameras.

Wearing a suit and white shirt with no tie, he stooped over a privacy booth as he marked his choices before leisurely strolling toward an exit and making a brief stop to talk with supporters in a hallway.

The Department of Justice said last week it would send federal election observers to California and New Jersey, following requests from their state GOP officials.

The election monitors will be in six jurisdictions: Passaic County, New Jersey, and Los Angeles, Orange, Kern, Riverside and Fresno counties in California.

Some leading Democrats in the states were critical of the move, which they said could intimidate voters.

The self-described democratic socialist said he would not cave to any threats by the president to withhold money from the city.

“I look forward to fighting for every single dollar this city is owed,” he told reporters Tuesday morning. “I look forward to utilizing every single tool at my disposal as the next mayor of this city to fight for the people of it. That means using the courts. That means using the bully pulpit. That means ensuring that we actually follow the letter of the law,” Mamdani said.

“But I will not be intimidated by this president,” he said.

Cuomo said President Trump telling Republicans to vote for him over Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa “could be very helpful because if they don't vote for Sliwa, they would vote for me.”

Trump endorsed Cuomo, the former Democratic governor of New York who's running for mayor as an independent, on Monday.

Cuomo said Trump “is pragmatic” and is telling Republicans the “reality of the situation, which is, if you do not vote, Mamdani is going to win.”

The Republican president opposes Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, who's ahead in the polls.

Cuomo said voters should look beyond political party and vote for him to save New York City from Mamdani.

“It's about saving the city, and that's not being overly dramatic,” Cuomo said on Fox News Channel's “Fox & Friends,” which is one of Trump's favorite TV news programs.

In Virginia, the attorney general's race grabbed the national spotlight following reports that Democrat Jay Jones had texted a Virginia delegate in 2022 messages suggesting the then-Republican House Speaker should get “two bullets to the head.” Before the scandal, he was seen as the race's likely winner. The Republican incumbent has focused much of his campaign on the resurfaced texts.

In Pennsylvania, voters will cast Yes or No votes on whether to retain three justices of the state's Supreme Court 5-2 Democratic majority. Partisan control of the court could play a role in the 2028 presidential race because justices might be asked to rule on election disputes in one of the country's battleground states.

Detroit, Pittsburgh, Jersey City and Buffalo will elect new mayors, while incumbents in Atlanta, Minneapolis and Cincinnati seek another term.

Polling sites opened at 7 a.m. Voters will decide whether to approve partisan U.S. House maps favoring Democrats.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom and other Democratic allies say the measure is a tool to counter a Trump-backed plan in Texas to help Republicans gain more congressional House seats next year.

The Department of Justice said it will send election watchers to voting centers in Los Angeles, Orange, Kern, Riverside and Fresno counties. California's attorney general vowed to fight any disruption.

Millions of people had already cast their votes ahead of election day. As of Monday evening, 29% of ballots had been returned.

California's polls close at 8 p.m.

It's up to voters in California to enact a new congressional map that could flip as many as five Republican-held U.S. House seats to Democrats.

The so-called Proposition 50 is backed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, a fierce Trump critic with presidential ambitions, in response to a new Texas map that state GOP passed in August to elect more Republicans to the U.S. House in the 2026 midterms.

It's the Democrats' best opportunity in an unprecedented state-by-state redistricting battle. They need to gain three seats in the 2026 elections to take control of the House.

Democratic state legislator Zohran Mamdani, independent candidate and former Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa are looking to lead the nation's largest city.

Mamdani's campaign generated excitement among progressives especially after his comfortable win over Cuomo in the primary in June. He secured key endorsements from party leaders like New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and U.S. House Democratic Leader Hakeem.

The winner will replace outgoing Mayor Eric Adams, who initially sought renomination as a Democrat, ran as an independent, and then dropped out and endorsed Cuomo.

The Democrat kicked off his busy Election Day morning schedule by voting with his wife, Rama Duwaji, at a local school.

He held a brief news conference outside afterward, wearing an “I Voted” sticker on the left lapel of his dark gray suit jacket.

“We are on the brink of making history in our city. On the brink of saying goodbye to a politics of the past,” he said.

He then embarked for several TV and radio appearances.

New Jersey law enforcement and election officials responded swiftly after threats were made against several polling locations as voting began in one of two states that will be electing new governors.

Lt. Gov. Tahesha Way, who serves as the state's top elections official, described them as emailed bomb threats targeting polling places in seven counties but said law enforcement determined there are no credible threats at this time.

New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin said some polling locations had already reopened to the public, while voters at others were being directed to nearby polling locations to cast their ballot. Law enforcement officers “have worked swiftly to secure these polling locations and ensure the safety of every voter,” he said.

Bomb threats also disrupted voting across several battleground states during last year's presidential election.

Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears and Democratic U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger are looking to replace term-limited Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin.

The winner is set to become the first female governor in the state. An Earle-Sears' victory would turn her into the first Black female governor of any U.S. state.

Spanberger is a former CIA case officer turned Congresswoman, and Earle-Sears is a Marine veteran.

In the first off-year general election of Trump's second term, we are watching high-profile races for Virginia and New Jersey governor, New York City mayor and a proposition in California to redraw the state's congressional map.

The results of these contests and others on Tuesday's ballot will signal how voters are feeling about Trump's agenda and about how Democrats are responding to it.

More than half of the states will hold contests on Tuesday.

Norway's sovereign wealth fund, one of Tesla's biggest investors, said Tuesday that it will vote against a proposed compensation package that could pay CEO Elon Musk as much as $1 trillion over a decade. 

There will be more than a dozen company proposals up for a vote Thursday during Tesla's annual meeting, but none have generated more division than Musk's potentially massive pay package.

“While we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk's visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk consistent with our views on executive compensation,” said Norges Bank Investment Management, which manages the country's Government Pension Fund Global. “We will continue to seek constructive dialogue with Tesla on this and other topics.” 

The fund has a 1.16% stake, the sixth largest holding among institutional investors. 

Baron Capital Management, which holds about 0.4% of Tesla's outstanding shares said Monday that it will vote in favor of the compensation package. 

“Elon is the ultimate “key man” of key man risk. Without his relentless drive and uncompromising standards, there would be no Tesla,” wrote founder Ron Baron. “He has built one of the most important companies in the world. He's redefining transportation, energy and humanoid robotics and creating lasting value for shareholders while doing it. His interests are completely aligned with investors.”

Musk is the company's largest investor, holding 15.79% of all outstanding shares. 

Tesla management has proposed a compensation arrangement that would hand Musk shares worth as much as 12% of the company in a dozen separate packages if the company meets ambitious performance targets, including massive increases in car production, share price and operating profit.

ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Kimberly Guilfoyle, a former California prosecutor, television personality and close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, officially took office Tuesday as the first U.S. female ambassador to Greece.

Guilfoyle, 56, who was once engaged to Donald Trump Jr., presented her diplomatic credentials to Greek President Constantine Tassoulas after being sworn in Sept. 29 in Washington.

The former Fox News host's arrival comes as the United States works to boost liquefied natural gas exports to eastern Europe through Greek port facilities.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum are expected in Athens this week for talks focused on expanding Western gas exports to war-torn Ukraine through a modified multinational pipeline network.

Guilfoyle and the visiting officials are scheduled to meet with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and attend ministerial meetings organized by the Washington-based Atlantic Council.

Since 2018, Greece and the United States have strengthened military ties, including expanding U.S. access to Greek bases and increased involvement of American defense contractors in Greece's multibillion-dollar armed forces modernization program.

Guilfoyle attended a black-tie welcome reception over the weekend in Athens. Joined by local business leaders and several Cabinet members, she took part in a lively Greek dance — linking arms with other guests and keeping pace as the music sped up.




“I know we will do amazing things for these two exceptional countries,” she told attendees. “I will not disappoint the United States of America. I shall not disappoint Greece.”

At Tuesday's ceremony, Guilfoyle presented her credentials after the new ambassadors from Norway, Harriet Berg, and Canada, Sonya Thissen.

Dick Cheney, the hard-charging conservative who became one of the most powerful and polarizing vice presidents in U.S. history and a leading advocate for the invasion of Iraq, has died at age 84. Political analyst Scott Lucas said he would be “remembered primarily for the 2003 Iraq war, which, in one way was the pinnacle of American power.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — Dick Cheney, the hard-charging conservative who became one of the most powerful and polarizing vice presidents in U.S. history and a leading advocate for the invasion of Iraq, has died at 84.

Cheney died Monday due to complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, his family said Tuesday in a statement.

The quietly forceful Cheney served father and son presidents, leading the armed forces as defense chief during the Persian Gulf War under President George H.W. Bush before returning to public life as vice president under Bush's son George W. Bush.

Cheney was, in effect, the chief operating officer of the younger Bush's presidency. He had a hand, often a commanding one, in implementing decisions most important to the president and some of surpassing interest to himself — all while living with decades of heart disease and, post-administration, a heart transplant. Cheney consistently defended the extraordinary tools of surveillance, detention and inquisition employed in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

Bush called Cheney a “decent, honorable man” and said his death was “a loss to the nation.”

“History will remember him as among the finest public servants of his generation — a patriot who brought integrity, high intelligence, and seriousness of purpose to every position he held,” Bush said in a statement.

Years after leaving office, Cheney became a target of President Donald Trump, especially after his daughter Liz Cheney became the leading Republican critic and examiner of Trump's desperate attempts to stay in power after his 2020 election defeat and his actions in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol.




“In our nation's 246-year history, there has never been an individual who was a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,” Cheney said in a television ad for his daughter. “He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him. He is a coward.”

In a twist the Democrats of his era could never have imagined, Cheney said last year he was voting for their candidate, Kamala Harris, for president against Trump.

For all his conservatism, Cheney was privately and publicly supportive of his daughter Mary Cheney after she came out as gay, years before gay marriage was broadly supported, then legalized. “Freedom means freedom for everyone,” he said.

A survivor of five heart attacks, Cheney long thought he was living on borrowed time and declared in 2013 that he awoke each morning “with a smile on my face, thankful for the gift of another day,” an odd image for a figure who always seemed to be manning the ramparts.

He said Republicans need to have “first-class” candidates and look to its strategy and a new generation. (AP Photo/David J. Phillip, File)



In his time in office, no longer was the vice presidency merely a ceremonial afterthought. Instead, Cheney made it a network of back channels from which to influence policy on Iraq, terrorism, presidential powers, energy and other conservative cornerstones.

Fixed with a seemingly permanent half-smile -- detractors called it a smirk -- Cheney joked about his outsize reputation as a stealthy manipulator.

“Am I the evil genius in the corner that nobody ever sees come out of his hole?” he asked. “It's a nice way to operate, actually.”

A hard-liner on Iraq who was increasingly isolated as other hawks left government, Cheney was proved wrong on point after point in the Iraq War, without losing the conviction he was essentially right.

He alleged links between the 9/11 attacks and prewar Iraq that didn't exist. He said U.S. troops would be welcomed as liberators; they weren't.

He declared the Iraqi insurgency in its last throes in May 2005, back when 1,661 U.S. service members had been killed, not even half the toll by war's end.

For admirers, he kept the faith in a shaky time, resolute even as the nation turned against the war and the leaders waging it.

But well into Bush's second term, Cheney's clout waned, checked by courts or shifting political realities.

Courts ruled against efforts he championed to broaden presidential authority and accord special harsh treatment to terrorism suspects. Bush did not fully embrace his hawkish positions on Iran and North Korea.

From the beginning, Cheney and Bush struck an odd bargain, unspoken but well understood. Shelving any ambitions he might have had to succeed Bush, Cheney was accorded power comparable in some ways to the presidency itself.

That bargain largely held up.

As Cheney put it: “I made the decision when I signed on with the president that the only agenda I would have would be his agenda, that I was not going to be like most vice presidents — and that was angling, trying to figure out how I was going to be elected president when his term was over with.”

His penchant for secrecy and backstage maneuvering had a price. He came to be seen as a thin-skinned Machiavelli orchestrating a bungled response to criticism of the Iraq War. And when he shot a hunting companion in the torso, neck and face with an errant shotgun blast in 2006, he and his coterie were slow to disclose that episode.

It was “one of the worst days of my life,” Cheney said. The victim, his friend Harry Whittington, recovered and quickly forgave him. Comedians were relentless about it for months. 

When Bush began his presidential quest, he sought help from Cheney, a Washington insider who had retreated to the oil business. Cheney led the team to find a vice presidential candidate.

Bush decided the best choice was the man picked to help with the choosing.

Together, the pair faced a protracted 2000 postelection battle before they could claim victory. Recounts and court challenges left the nation in limbo for weeks.

Cheney took charge of the presidential transition before victory was clear and helped give the Republican administration a smooth launch despite the lost time. In office, disputes among departments vying for a bigger piece of Bush's constrained budget came to his desk and often were settled there.

On Capitol Hill, Cheney lobbied for the president's programs in halls he had walked as a deeply conservative member of Congress and the No. 2 Republican House leader.

Jokes abounded about how Cheney was the real No. 1 in town; Bush didn't seem to mind and cracked a few himself. But such comments became less apt later in Bush's presidency as he clearly came into his own.

On Sept. 11, 2001, with Bush out of town, the president gave Cheney approval to authorize the military to shoot down any hijacked planes still in the sky. By then, two airliners had hit the World Trade Center and a third was bearing down on the capital from nearby Dulles airport in Virginia.

A Secret Service agent burst into the West Wing room, grabbed Cheney by the belt and shoulder and led him to a bunker underneath the White House. “He didn't say, ‘Shall we go?'” Cheney told NBC News years later. “He wasn't polite about it.”

Cheney talked to Bush again from the bunker and told him, “Washington was under attack, as well as New York.”

After Bush's return to the White House that night, Cheney was taken to a secret location to keep the president and vice president separated and try to ensure that at least one of them would survive any further attack. 

Cheney said his first reaction to hearing of the crash of the fourth hijacked plane, in Pennsylvania, was that the U.S. might have shot it down per his order. It came down after passengers fought the hijackers.

Politics first lured Dick Cheney to Washington in 1968, when he was a congressional fellow. He became a protégé of Rep. Donald Rumsfeld, R-Ill., serving under him in two agencies and in Gerald Ford's White House before he was elevated to chief of staff, the youngest ever, at age 34.

Cheney held the post for 14 months, then returned to Casper, Wyoming, where he had been raised, and ran for the state's lone congressional seat.

In that first race for the House, Cheney suffered a mild heart attack, prompting him to crack he was forming a group called “Cardiacs for Cheney.” He still managed a decisive victory and went on to win five more terms.

In 1989, Cheney became defense secretary under the first President Bush and led the Pentagon during the 1990-91 Persian Gulf War, which drove Iraq's troops from Kuwait. Between the two Bush administrations, Cheney led Dallas-based Halliburton Corp., a large engineering and construction company for the oil industry.

Cheney was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, son of a longtime Agriculture Department worker. Senior class president and football co-captain in Casper, he went to Yale on a full scholarship for a year but failed out. 

He moved back to Wyoming, eventually enrolled at the University of Wyoming and renewed a relationship with high school sweetheart Lynne Anne Vincent, marrying her in 1964. He is survived by his wife and daughters.

National Air Traffic Controllers Association's Nick Daniels tells ‘The Story' how the government shutdown is fueling frustration among air traffic controllers and impacting flight delays across the country.

FIRST ON FOX: A Republican senator wants to stop members of Congress from receiving paychecks as federal workers go without pay during the ongoing government shutdown.

As the shutdown enters its 35th day, federal employees, air traffic controllers and other employees have either missed paychecks or received only partial pay. Members of Congress, however, are constitutionally required to get a paycheck, even if the government is closed.

Some lawmakers have said that they would forego a paycheck, while others have introduced legislation to prevent their colleagues from getting paid.

SENATE REPUBLICANS PLOT LONGER-TERM FUNDING BILL AS GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN CONTINUES

Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., jumped into that arena and has two bills that would both halt lawmakers from getting paid as the shutdown continues and deal with the constitutional issue.

""I don't see missing paychecks or empty dinner plates as leverage or bargaining chips,"" Kennedy said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""My bills ensure Congress feels the same pain as the folks we're failing to pay — our troops, air traffic controllers, and federal workers. If we can't do our jobs and fund the government, we don't deserve a paycheck — plain and simple.""

One of the bills, the ""No Shutdown Paychecks to Politicians Act,"" would see lawmakers go without pay for every day that a shutdown is underway. Members of Congress on average make $174,000 a year. That number can fluctuate depending on whether a lawmaker is in a leadership position.

GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN SPARKS GOP PLAN TO PENALIZE LAWMAKERS WITH NEW SALARY TAX

Kennedy's desire to see that lawmakers don't get paid runs into the Constitution, however.

Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution requires that ""Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.""

Then there is the 27th Amendment, ratified in 1992, which prevents Congress from passing a law affecting its pay during the current congressional term.

That's where his other bill, ""Withhold Member Pay During Shutdowns Act,"" comes into play. That legislation would sidestep the 27th Amendment by not cutting pay to lawmakers, but instead withholding it in escrow until after the November 2026 elections.

MORE LAWMAKERS SAY THEY'RE REJECTING PAYCHECKS AS GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN DRAGS ON

That bill is also being carried in the House by Rep. Bryan Steil, R-Wis., who said in a statement to Fox News Digital, ""If service members, men and women of federal law enforcement, and other essential employees are working without pay during the Schumer shutdown, members of Congress should not be paid either.""

Kennedy's effort is not the only legislative attempt to stop lawmakers from getting paychecks during the shutdown.

Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, introduced legislation that would impose a tax, similar to Kennedy's bill, that would increase each day that the Senate is in session.

Then there's a constitutional amendment proposed by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., last week that would require lawmakers forfeit their paychecks. That money would then be sent to the U.S. Treasury Department to help pay down the national debt.

Passing a constitutional amendment requires that two-thirds of the House and Senate advance the proposal and then be ratified by three-fourths of the states.

Fox News Bret Baier spotlights key moments from Dick Cheneys life and career, as he is remembered as arguably the most influential vice president in American history.

Former President George W. Bush said that former Vice President Dick Cheney's death was ""a loss to the nation"" and said that Cheney was ""the one I needed"" when he became his running mate in 2000.

""Laura and I will remember Dick Cheney for the decent, honorable man that he was,"" Bush said in a statement obtained by Fox News. Cheney's death was announced Tuesday morning.

""History will remember him as among the finest public servants of his generation — a patriot who brought integrity, high intelligence and seriousness of purpose to every position he held,"" Bush's statement reads, in part.

Cheney served as Bush's vice president from 2001 to 2009, spanning the 9/11 attacks and helping shape U.S. policy in the ""war on terror,"" including the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He also served as a Republican congressman, Defense secretary and White House chief of staff in his decades-long public career.

""As a young White House aide and chief of staff, a congressman, a secretary of defense and my vice president, Dick earned the confidence and high opinion of five presidents,"" the statement continues.

""I asked him to join my ticket in 2000 after first enlisting him to help me find the best running mate. In our long discussions about the qualities a vice president should have — deep experience, mature judgment, character and loyalty — I realized that Dick Cheney was the one I needed.""

""I'm still grateful that he was at my side for the eight years that followed.""

Cheney was also elected vice president in 2004 with Bush and flourished as one of Bush's inner circle of advisers on defense and foreign policy. Bush said Cheney's steadiness and judgment proved invaluable once they entered office together.

""Dick was a calm and steady presence in the White House amid great national challenges. I counted on him for his honest, forthright counsel and he never failed to give his best,"" the statement reads.

""He held to his convictions and prioritized the freedom and security of the American people. For those two terms in office, and throughout his remarkable career, Dick Cheney's service always reflected credit on the country he loved.""

Bush said Cheney's love for America was second only to that of the former vice president's family. 

""Laura and I have shared our deepest sympathies with Vice President Cheney's wife, Lynne, and their daughters and granddaughters of whom he was so deeply proud. We are praying for Lynne, Liz, Mary and the Cheney family as they honor a great man.""

Dallas Cowboys legend Troy Aikman reacted to owner Jerry Jones teasing he made a trade ahead of the deadline as the team was losing to the Arizona Cardinals on Monday night.

Jones said on Stephen A. Smith's SiriusXM Show that the team made a deal and could make two more, but didn't say who the team traded for or any other information about the supposed move.

The ""Monday Night Football"" broadcast brought Jones' statement up as Dallas trailed 24-10 against Arizona. Aikman offered a blunt response.

""He may want to cancel that trade,"" Aikman said. ""I don't think one player, from what I've seen tonight, is going to make a difference for this team.

""If you're talking about (Cincinnati Bengals defensive end) Trey Hendrickson, he was on this defense in Cincinnati. That was the equivalent of what we're watching here tonight and he couldn't change their fortunes.""

The Cardinals won the game, 27-17.

Jones told reporters after the game the trade was still on the table.

ESPN reported on Tuesday morning that Dallas was finalizing a deal for Cincinnati Bengals linebacker Logan Wilson, who requested to be traded last month.

Fox News political analyst Lisa Boothe and former DNC press secretary Jose Aristimuno discuss polls aggregating which party Americans blame for the government shutdown on ‘America Reports.'

The 2025 government shutdown is hours away from breaking a record to be the longest-ever in history.

The prior record was held by the 2018-2019 government shutdown during President Donald Trump's first term. Trump signed legislation ending that shutdown in the 9 p.m. hour on the 35th day.

Tuesday marks the 35th day of the current fiscal standoff. And with no deal reached yet between Democrats and Republicans in Congress, it's all but certain that the dispute will bleed into day 36.

The previous shutdown occurred over a disagreement on funding Trump's border wall. But this time, it's Democrats' priorities being caught in the middle.

SENATE RETURNS TO WORK AS GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN NEARS LONGEST IN US HISTORY OVER OBAMACARE FIGHT

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., speaks to the media next to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on the day U.S. President Donald Trump meets with top congressional leaders from both parties, just ahead of a September 30 deadline to fund the government and avoid a shutdown, at the White House in Washington, D.C., Sept. 29, 2025. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)

Republicans have for weeks pushed a short-term extension of fiscal year (FY) 2025 federal funding levels called a continuing resolution (CR), aimed at giving lawmakers until Nov. 21 to strike a deal on FY2026 spending.

The measure is largely free of unrelated policy riders, save for an added $88 million aimed at enhanced security funding for lawmakers, the White House and the Supreme Court. 

But Democrats have said they will reject any federal funding bill that does not also extend enhanced Obamacare subsidies that are set to expire at the end of 2025. The enhanced subsidies were a COVID-19 pandemic-era measure that a majority of Republicans have said is no longer needed.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., have said they are open to discussing a reformed version of those subsidies, but rejected pairing the two issues together.

The House passed the CR on Sept. 19. Johnson has kept his chamber out of session since then in a bid to pressure Senate Democrats to agree to the GOP bill — though they have rejected it 13 times since then.

Senate Republicans have looked for different markers throughout the shutdown as possible exit points for Senate Democrats, like the nationwide ""No Kings"" protests, federal workers missing paychecks, the opening of open enrollment across the country on Nov. 1 and now the upcoming record-setting shutdown later Tuesday night. 

Sen. Mike Rounds, R- S.D., noted that both the elections on Tuesday, and the record-breaking push ""as a protest against the president,"" could factor into how much longer Senate Democrats continue to drag the shutdown out. 

TRUMP'S 'NUCLEAR' DEMAND NOT LANDING FOR SENATE REPUBLICANS AMID SHUTDOWN

""Here's the reality, they're at about 25% approval rating right now, and as one of their colleagues told me, the only way they can really go up is to show their base that they're fighting with the president, and that's what they're doing right now,"" Rounds said. 

""So once they get to the point where they think they made their point, then I think there's a possibility of actually getting something done,"" he continued. 

There has been more optimism in the upper chamber over the last several days than the entire shutdown so far, as more and more bipartisan conversations are cropping up. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., believed that lawmakers were close to an off-ramp, but there still hasn't been a concrete move made toward ending the shutdown yet.

Senate Democrats, led by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., still want a solid deal on expiring Obamacare subsidies, and want Trump to get more involved. That desire, despite the optimism, will likely see the House-passed CR fail for a 14th time Tuesday morning. 

When asked if breaking the record would add more weight to lawmakers' ending the shutdown, Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., believed it would take an outside force. 

""I don't see what it is,"" he said. ""It'll take some type of an outside inflection point, or the best negotiator in the world to come in."" 

Meanwhile, funding for critical government programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the Women, Infants, and Children program (WIC), as well as national flood insurance are running critically low on funds — potentially ensnaring millions of Americans.

Robert Khachatryan, founder and CEO of Freight Right Global Logistics, told Fox News Digital the federal government needs to continue cracking down on illegal immigrants in the trucking industry.

A trucking executive claims that the U.S. has allowed ""foreign-owned entities"" that don't follow regulations to ""export"" and ""exploit"" the industry, which he believes explains the surge in illegal immigrant drivers.

The federal government is cracking down on illegal immigrant truck drivers following a wave of fatal crashes across America. In late October, the Department of Homeland Security announced 146 illegal immigrant truck drivers were arrested along northwest Indiana highways as part of ""Operation Midway Blitz.""

On Oct. 15, Borko Stankovic, an illegal immigrant, was driving on U.S. Highway 20 in Indiana when traffic came to a stop due to a Ram Sprinter turning near Douglas Drive, but the suspect didn't appear to slow down in his semi-truck, according to FOX 32. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News Digital Stankovic has been in the U.S. since February 2011 when his nonimmigrant visa status expired.

Stankovic attempted to make a hard evasive left turn when he entered opposite traffic and hit a Subaru Crosstrek, the Portage Police Department said. The semi-truck then jackknifed as a result and collided with the Ram Sprinter, which was pushed into a road sign.

Officials said the driver of the Subaru, 54-year-old Jeffrey Eberly, died at the scene.

Stankovic possessed a suspended commercial driver's license (CDL) which belonged to a family member and wasn't licensed to drive a truck himself, authorities said. He was charged with felony reckless homicide and felony criminal recklessness resulting in death.

In a separate incident on Aug. 12 in Fort Pierce, Florida, Harjinder Singh was driving a semi-truck when authorities said he attempted to make a U-turn in an unauthorized area. The trailer then jackknifed and was hit by a minivan, killing all three people inside the minivan, officials said.

Singh crossed the U.S. border illegally in 2018 and was issued a CDL in California, authorities said. Singh was charged with three counts of vehicular homicide.

Zach Meiborg, who owns Meiborg Brothers Trucking in Illinois, told Fox News Digital that a sizable portion of the trucking industry has been shipped off to foreign-owned countries who don't have an issue with hiring illegal immigrants even though it's against the law.

""We're watching our bureaucrats export the most vital industry to our economy to foreign-owned entities, typically in the Eastern Bloc, formerly Russia. That's why they have no problem hiring them,"" Meiborg said. ""Where foreign-owned companies realized they could exploit like five different areas of the trucking economy and explode the growth of their fleets. And they did it by just flat out breaking the laws and our bureaucrats that regulate us looked the other way.""

Meiborg said some trucking companies saw an opportunity to move their operations offshore during the COVID-19 pandemic, putting American companies at a disadvantage.

""Their dispatch is over there, their safety is over there, the recruiting is over there, and they do it all digitally online,"" he said. ""So they're running foreign labor, imported from overseas, not trained, they're paying them 1099, not W-2, not complying with any of the ACA or state tax laws or federal tax laws.""

Meiborg said these companies are creating their own electronic logbooks and self-certifying that they're following certain regulations, therefore manipulating the system with little to no oversight.

The Department of Transportation has begun taking action to combat the number of illegal immigrants operating semi-trucks. In late September, the agency announced an emergency interim final rule that would increase federal oversight of how states issue non-domiciled commercial driver's licenses.

(St. Lucie County Sheriff's Office)

Robert Khachatryan, founder and CEO of Freight Right Global Logistics, told Fox News Digital that the federal government needs to continue strengthening its oversight of the industry if it wants to address the number of illegal immigrants driving commercial trucks.

""It's just about enforcing the existing law, right? It's not like we're saying change the law, don't provide driver's licenses to illegal aliens. They're not supposed to. The law is very clear. You need to be a legal resident or you need to be a U.S. citizen to obtain a commercial driver's license in most states, as far as I know. So it just comes down to enforcement,"" Khachatryan said.

Sununu's record on Israel presents possible landmines in New Hampshire Senate bid","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/congressional/3873307/john-sununu-record-israel-presents-issues-new-hampshire-senate-election-2026/","Tue, 04 Nov 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

John E. Sununu, the former New Hampshire Republican senator seeking to reclaim his seat from retiring Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), has a mixed voting record on supporting Israel that could reignite Jewish criticism and present an obstacle in a contested GOP primary.

Sununu, an Arab-American with Palestinian and Lebanese heritage and elder brother of former New Hampshire Republican Gov. Chris Sununu, opposed several pro-Israel resolutions in the late 1990s and early 2000s during his three terms as a congressman.

During his single term as a senator from 2003 to 2009, John E. Sununu was an outlier in his party, advocating more humanitarian assistance to Palestinians.

SENATE GOP EMBRACES SUNUNU'S ‘INDEPENDENT STREAK' IN NEW HAMPSHIRE RACE

More recently, he's tiptoed around taking a position on the Israel-Gaza war that's become a flashpoint of U.S. politics and elections, even as he seeks the nomination of a party that staunchly embraces Israel.

During his three terms as a New Hampshire congressman from 1997 to 2003, Sununu opposed a series of pro-Israel resolutions, according to voting records.

In 1997, he was one of three Republicans to vote against a measure from then-Rep. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) called upon the U.S. to affirm its support for Jerusalem to remain the undivided capital of Israel and urged U.S. officials to refrain from any contradictory actions.

In 1999, he was one of six Republicans to oppose a measure expressing opposition to Palestinians declaring themselves a free state.

In 2000, Sununu was one of two Republicans to vote “present” on a resolution expressing support for Israel and condemning the Palestinian Authority for violence. That same year, he was one of two Republicans to oppose the Peace Through Negotiations Act, which was against Palestinian statehood and would have withheld U.S. aid and resources to international organizations that recognize the region as a free state.

Sununu has long advocated that the United States should take a less involved role in expressing what Palestinians should or should not do. Sununu ultimately prevailed in his 2002 Senate campaign, but not without criticism and obstacles from the pro-Israel lobby due to his voting record, which some Jewish organizations and leaders perceived as anti-Israel.

In the weeks before his October campaign launch and prior to a U.S.-led peace deal announced by President Donald Trump, Sununu was asked by New Hampshire ABC affiliate WMUR if the Senate should put restraints on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's actions in Gaza. Sununu said he was “not going to wade into foreign policy as I travel across New Hampshire to listen to people, to understand their perspectives, and, obviously, to make my decision.”

“I think dealing with Middle East politics is among the most complex, challenging, difficult things,” Sununu continued, “and the scale and the scope of the suffering, starting with Oct. 7, and the suffering we're seeing today in the Middle East, isn't something that's going to be solved with a soundbite from me or anybody else.”

A Sununu campaign spokesman told the Washington Examiner that the Republican candidate supports Trump's policies in the Middle East and Israel's right to defend itself, but did not address Sununu's voting record on the U.S. ally.

“John Sununu knows that peace in the Middle East has been elusive for decades, and he supports President Trump's policies that have reshaped the dynamics of the region and brought about an historic ceasefire,” Mike Schrimpf, a Sununu spokesman, said in a statement. “Israel has every right to defend itself and remains America's strongest ally in the region.”

Schrimpf also lauded the administration's efforts to weaken Iran's nuclear capability and support for the Lebanese government in disarming Hezbollah.

“With this bold approach, the administration has created an unprecedented opportunity for peace initiatives to move forward in the region,” Schrimpf said.

The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the leading pro-Israel lobbying group, did not respond to a request for comment about Sununu or whether it might get involved in the New Hampshire Senate primary and general elections. His primary opponent, former Massachusetts GOP Sen. Scott Brown, was among the top recipients of contributions from the pro-Israel lobby in the 2012 cycle, when he was ousted by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).

Despite his string of anti-Israel votes, Sununu took several positions as a senator that were more in line with his party and in support of the U.S. ally. He voted in favor of defense spending bills in 2005 and 2007 that authorized military assistance to Israel. In 2008, he cosponsored a pro-Israel resolution reaffirming Israel's 60th anniversary and “the bonds of friendship and cooperation between” the U.S. and Israel.

The Senate GOP's campaign arm, which is supporting Sununu over Brown, said Sununu will be a stronger Trump ally on Middle East policy. In addition to Brown, the National Republican Senatorial Committee whacked Rep. Chris Pappas (D-NH), the likely Democratic nominee.

“Liberal Chris Pappas would appease Democrats' pro-Hamas radical base and guarantee Jewish Americans and Israelis have one less ally in the U.S. Senate, while John Sununu will stand with America's ally and support President Trump's peace efforts in the Middle East,” NRSC Regional press secretary Samantha Cantrell said in a statement.

Brown, who himself has a checkered record on cultural issues that stand in contrast to conservative values, criticized Sununu on what he said “is not a complicated or nuanced issue for me.”

“Israel is our strongest ally in the Middle East and deserves the total and undivided support of the United States it has received under President Trump,” Brown told the Washington Examiner in a statement. “I have traveled to Israel, seen the threats they face firsthand, and long supported Jerusalem as the capital. I am deeply troubled by some of the eroding support for Israel — not just from the extreme voices in the Democratic Party but also some of the anti-Zionist views on the right.”

GOP SENATE HOPEFUL SCOTT BROWN ONCE CALLED DEI A ‘CORE VALUE.' NOW HE SAYS IT'S ‘WOKE'

Brown faced criticism in his 2012 reelection campaign, which he lost to Warren, for featuring a man in a campaign ad who was later discovered to have made antisemitic social media posts and derogatory remarks about Warren and former President Barack Obama.

Former Vice President Dick Cheney died Monday night at age 84, his family announced.

Cheney was the 46th vice president of the United States. He served under President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2009. He previously served as chief of staff to President Gerald Ford and as defense secretary for President George H.W. Bush.

“Richard B. Cheney, the 46th Vice President of the United States, died last night, November 3, 2025,” a statement given to Punchbowl News reads. “His beloved wife of 61 years, Lynne, his daughters, Liz and Mary, and other family members were with him when he passed. The former vice president died due to complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease.”

“Dick Cheney was a great and good man who taught his children and grandchildren to love our country, and to live lives of courage, honor, love, kindness, and fly fishing,” the statement continues. “We are grateful beyond measure for all Dick Cheney did for our country. And we are blessed beyond measure to have loved and been loved by this noble giant of a man.”

The former vice president was born in 1941 in Lincoln, Nebraska. He dropped out of Yale University and then received his bachelor's degree from the University of Wyoming. He worked in the White House during the Nixon and Ford administrations and was elected to represent Wyoming in the House of Representatives. He served in Congress from 1979 to 1989. He was then nominated and confirmed as defense secretary in 1989 during the H.W. Bush administration.

Cheney suffered from heart-related health problems for much of his life. He had five heart attacks between 1978 and 2010 and underwent a successful heart transplant in 2012.

He was vice president during the 9/11 attacks. He was seen as a chief architect of the Iraq War and known for his outsize influence behind the scenes during the W. Bush administration.

Former President George W. Bush released a statement on Cheney's legacy Tuesday morning, saying Cheney's “love for America was second only to his family.”

“The death of Richard B. Cheney is a loss to the nation and a sorrow to his friends. Laura and I will remember Dick Cheney for the decent, honorable man that he was. History will remember him as among the finest public servants of his generation – a patriot who brought integrity, high intelligence, and seriousness of purpose to every position he held,” Bush wrote in a statement.

The White House lowered its flags to half-staff in honor of Cheney Tuesday morning, per CBS News's Jennifer Jacobs.

Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who served with Cheney in two administrations, said he was “an inspiring presence and mentor who taught me a great deal about public service.”

“I will remember his toughness but also his sense of humor.  He was indefatigable in his determination to defend this country and patriotic to his core,” Rice continued.

Former Vice President Mike Pence shared similar sentiments to Bush in an X post, noting condolences to Cheney's family on behalf of himself and his wife Karen.

“Throughout his long career, he was an American patriot who championed the men and women in our Armed Forces and the importance of maintaining a strong national defense for America's security at home and abroad. @KarenPence and I will always be grateful for Vice President Cheney's service and his personal kindness during our time in office,” Pence said. 

Former Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a close ally of former Rep. Liz Cheney as they worked together on the Jan. 6 committee, released the following statement on her father's passing.

“I'd like to share my family's deepest condolences to my friend @Liz_Cheney for the passing of her father.  A man who, like his daughter, deeply loved his country,” Kinzinger wrote.

In the final hours of the New York City mayoral race, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo has found support from figures who don't typically cozy up to Democrats.

A number of Republicans, now including President Donald Trump and tech magnate Elon Musk, have backed Cuomo to avoid a Zohran Mamdani mayoralty.

The late moves signal a concern from the socialist's opposition that his win is inevitable, given that he has led all his opponents in the polls by double digits for months. Two AtlasIntel polls have given the Cuomo campaign hope, with a single-digit lead by Mamdani, but the survey still shows Cuomo outside the margin of error to win.

Trump wrote a Truth Social post on Monday, which he later reposted, boosting Cuomo. He said the Democrat had a “record of success” and that Cuomo is “capable” of doing a fantastic job. The president also echoed a Cuomo campaign talking point, which is that a vote for the Republican Curtis Sliwa “is a vote for Mamdani.”

“Whether you personally like Andrew Cuomo or not, you really have no choice. You must vote for him, and hope he does a fantastic job. He is capable of it, Mamdani is not!” Trump wrote.

The president had not endorsed Cuomo in the race before now, but previously signaled his preference for him. At one point, he was a vicious rival of Cuomo and blasted his leadership day after day.

“Governor Cuomo has shown tremendously poor leadership skills in running N.Y. Bad time for him to be writing and promoting a book, especially since he has done such a poor job with Covid and Crime. So many unnecessary deaths. The City & State have sunk to historic lows,” he wrote on X in October 2020 during his first term.

Cuomo later said at a news conference in Manhattan that Trump was “not endorsing me, he's opposing Mamdani.” Cuomo added that he won't blame Sliwa if he loses.

“No, I'm not going to blame anyone, because I'm not going to lose tomorrow,” he said.

The Mamdani campaign called Trump's endorsement the “nail in the coffin” for Cuomo. Sliwa said the president is “entitled” to his own opinion, but that the “people's opinion” is the only one that concerns him.

Musk's endorsement came a few hours before the president's, but reflected much of the same sentiment: any votes for Sliwa equaled support for Mamdani, and Cuomo should be mayor.

“Remember to vote tomorrow in New York! Bear in mind that a vote for Curtis is really a vote for Mumdumi or whatever his name is. VOTE CUOMO!” Musk wrote on his X social media platform. He pinned the post to his page, signaling its importance.

Other notable Republicans backed Cuomo in the final hours before Election Day.

White House adviser Stephen Miller matched Trump's support for Cuomo.

“The Anti-Mamdani vote which is really the pro-NYC vote, the pro-America vote, needs to unite behind a leading candidate and that's Andrew Cuomo,” he said.

Former Republican New York Rep. George Santos, who once posted on social media that he hopes Cuomo “goes to hell” and said he had a role in “murdering senior citizens in nursing homes during the pandemic,” endorsed Cuomo.

“A vote for Curtis is a vote for Mamdani… As bad and horrible as Cuomo is I rather him over the jihadist sympathizer. Please vote like your life depends on it!” he wrote on X, noting his support for Cuomo was “forced.”

All of the endorsements likely will not move New York Democrats, who largely do not like the administration, Trump, Musk, or Santos. However, Republicans could be swayed by Trump's endorsement and move their votes to Cuomo. However, his nod could also alienate Democrats supportive of Cuomo.

Some New York Republicans stuck with Sliwa in the closing hours of the race. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani reiterated his endorsement of Sliwa on Monday and said voters shouldn't have to vote for someone in high office whom they don't feel good about.

“You're not supposed to vote for someone in high office you gotta hold your nose about,” he said on his show. “They can go in there, and they don't have to hold their nose, and they can vote for Curtis. And then we can have a mayor so we don't have to walk around New York City holding our nose.”

Endorsements aside, New York City voters will choose their next mayor on Tuesday. 

If Cuomo loses to the politically inexperienced Mamdani, it will be because voters ultimately could not stomach the ugly parts of his long political career. Trump and Republicans savored opportunities to blast Cuomo when they could on his faults, and now they're turning to voters to ask them to support the former governor.

Mamdani said in a CNN appearance that the timing of the Trump endorsement was odd. He said Cuomo “wanted to be able to make the message to Democrats that he was, in fact, the governor that he said he was,” but then waited until the last moment to “fully embrace the MAGA movement that we have long said he is tied to.”

TRUMP SAYS NYC VOTERS HAVE ‘NO CHOICE' BUT TO VOTE CUOMO FOR MAYOR

New York Democratic strategist Max Burns suggested to the Washington Examiner that he believes the endorsement effort is shameful and amounts to a Hail Mary. 

“Shame is a dead idea in American politics, you do whatever you can and hope the Hail Mary works, even if it reveals you to have no values whatsoever,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The top two Republicans in Congress are keeping expectations low for their party as voters head to the polls for a spate of elections viewed as bellwethers for next year.

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) said Tuesday that, barring a “surprise,” voters are on track to elect Democrats in statewide elections in Virginia and New Jersey, plus a mayoral race in New York City.

“Today is a big Election Day in these blue states,” Johnson said in opening remarks at his press conference. “We certainly hope for a surprise. But, I mean, it won't be a big surprise if the front-runners, the Democrats, the radicals, win some of these elections.”

Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) similarly tempered expectations, telling the Washington Examiner, “I assume they may very well perform well.”

Recent polls show some of the Republican candidates in neck-and-neck matches. Republican Jack Ciattarelli, who is running for governor of New Jersey, is just 3 points behind his Democratic opponent, Rep. Mikie Sherill (D-NJ), and the attorney general race in Virginia is also extremely close.

Yet Republicans are bracing for the possibility of a nightmare scenario in which Democrats not only win, but win resoundingly. Traditionally, New Jersey and Virginia have been blue strongholds, but the overperformance of Republicans, including President Donald Trump, in those states has put them under a microscope.

Republicans are also feeling pessimistic about their chances of keeping the governor's mansion in Virginia, where Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears (R-VA) is running to replace Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA).

“Of course, everybody will be spinning it based on what expectations were and all that,” Thune said, before cautioning reporters against reading too much into election night.

In particular, analysts are looking to see whether the races mirror the strong turnout Democrats have seen in other off-year races, particularly special elections for open House seats.

“I think if you look at these races that are being run, most of them are kind of focused on local issues,” Thune added. “I mean, some of them are focused on economic issues, which will be an issue in the midterm elections, but I think we've got a great case to make next year.”

SHERRILL AND CIATTARELLI RALLY SUPPORT IN THEIR HOMETOWNS NIGHT BEFORE ELECTION DAY

Johnson said he is “watching New York City very closely,” using the mayoral election to tie congressional Democrats to socialist Zohran Mamdani, who is expected to defeat former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, the independent, on Tuesday night.

“They're terrified the Marxists are taking over their party, and the evidence today may show that that is true,” Johnson said.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Dick Cheney, the hard-charging conservative who became one of the most powerful and polarizing vice presidents in U.S. history and a leading advocate for the invasion of Iraq, has died at age 84.Cheney died Monday night due to complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, according to a statement from his family.

“For decades, Dick Cheney served our nation, including as White House Chief of Staff, Wyoming's Congressman, Secretary of Defense, and Vice President of the United States,” the statement said. “Dick Cheney was a great and good man who taught his children and grandchildren to love our country, and to live lives of courage, honor, love, kindness, and fly fishing. We are grateful beyond measure for all Dick Cheney did for our country. And we are blessed beyond measure to have loved and been loved by this noble giant of a man.”

The quietly forceful Cheney served father and son presidents, leading the armed forces as defense chief during the Persian Gulf War under President George H.W. Bush before returning to public life as vice president under Bush's son, George W. Bush.

Cheney was, in effect, the chief operating officer of the younger Bush's presidency. He had a hand, often a commanding one, in implementing decisions most important to the president and some of surpassing interest to himself — all while living with decades of heart disease and, post-administration, a heart transplant. Cheney consistently defended the extraordinary tools of surveillance, detention and inquisition employed in response to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

Years after leaving office, he became a target of President Donald Trump, especially after daughter Liz Cheney became the leading Republican critic and examiner of Trump's desperate attempts to stay in power after his election defeat and his actions in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol.

FORMER VICE PRESIDENT DICK CHENEY DEAD AT 84

“In our nation's 246-year history, there has never been an individual who was a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,” Cheney said in a television ad for his daughter. “He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him. He is a coward.”

In a twist the Democrats of his era could never have imagined, Dick Cheney said last year he was voting for their candidate, Kamala Harris, for president against Trump.

A survivor of five heart attacks, Cheney long thought he was living on borrowed time and declared in 2013 he now awoke each morning “with a smile on my face, thankful for the gift of another day,” an odd image for a figure who always seemed to be manning the ramparts.

His vice presidency defined by the age of terrorism, Cheney disclosed that he had had the wireless function of his defibrillator turned off years earlier out of fear terrorists would remotely send his heart a fatal shock.

In his time in office, no longer was the vice presidency merely a ceremonial afterthought. Instead, Cheney made it a network of back channels from which to influence policy on Iraq, terrorism, presidential powers, energy and other cornerstones of a conservative agenda.

Fixed with a seemingly permanent half-smile — detractors called it a smirk — Cheney joked about his outsize reputation as a stealthy manipulator.

“Am I the evil genius in the corner that nobody ever sees come out of his hole?” he asked. “It's a nice way to operate, actually.”

A hard-liner on Iraq who was increasingly isolated as other hawks left government, Cheney was proved wrong on point after point in the Iraq War, without ever losing the conviction that he was essentially right.

He alleged links between the 2001 attacks against the United States and prewar Iraq that didn't exist. He said U.S. troops would be welcomed as liberators; they weren't.

He declared the Iraqi insurgency in its last throes in May 2005, back when 1,661 U.S. service members had been killed, not even half the toll by war's end.

For admirers, he kept the faith in a shaky time, resolute even as the nation turned against the war and the leaders waging it.

But well into Bush's second term, Cheney's clout waned, checked by courts or shifting political realities.Courts ruled against efforts he championed to broaden presidential authority and accord special harsh treatment to suspected terrorists. His hawkish positions on Iran and North Korea were not fully embraced by Bush.

Cheney operated much of the time from undisclosed locations in the months after the 2001 attacks, kept apart from Bush to ensure one or the other would survive any follow-up assault on the country's leadership.

With Bush out of town on that fateful day, Cheney was a steady presence in the White House, at least until Secret Service agents lifted him off his feet and carried him away, in a scene the vice president later described to comical effect.

From the beginning, Cheney and Bush struck an odd bargain, unspoken but well understood. Shelving any ambitions he might have had to succeed Bush, Cheney was accorded power comparable in some ways to the presidency itself.

That bargain largely held up.

“He is constituted in a way to be the ultimate No. 2 guy,” Dave Gribbin, a friend who grew up with Cheney in Casper, Wyoming, and worked with him in Washington, once said. “He is congenitally discreet. He is remarkably loyal.”

As Cheney put it: “I made the decision when I signed on with the president that the only agenda I would have would be his agenda, that I was not going to be like most vice presidents — and that was angling, trying to figure out how I was going to be elected president when his term was over with.”His penchant for secrecy and backstage maneuvering had a price. He came to be seen as a thin-skinned Machiavelli orchestrating a bungled response to criticism of the Iraq war. And when he shot a hunting companion in the torso, neck and face with an errant shotgun blast in 2006, he and his coterie were slow to disclose that extraordinary turn of events.

The vice president called it “one of the worst days of my life.” The victim, his friend Harry Whittington, recovered and quickly forgave him. Comedians were relentless about it for months. Whittington died in 2023.

When Bush began his presidential quest, he sought help from Cheney, a Washington insider who had retreated to the oil business. Cheney led the team to find a vice presidential candidate.Bush decided the best choice was the man picked to help with the choosing.

Together, the pair faced a protracted 2000 postelection battle before they could claim victory. A series of recounts and court challenges — a tempest that brewed from Florida to the nation's highest court — left the nation in limbo for weeks.

Cheney took charge of the presidential transition before victory was clear and helped give the administration a smooth launch despite the lost time. In office, disputes among departments vying for a bigger piece of Bush's constrained budget came to his desk and often were settled there.On Capitol Hill, Cheney lobbied for the president's programs in halls he had walked as a deeply conservative member of Congress and the No. 2 Republican House leader.

Jokes abounded about how Cheney was the real No. 1 in town; Bush didn't seem to mind and cracked a few himself. But such comments became less apt later in Bush's presidency as he clearly came into his own.

Cheney retired to Jackson Hole, not far from where Liz Cheney a few years later bought a home, establishing Wyoming residency before she won his old House seat in 2016. The fates of father and daughter grew closer, too, as the Cheney family became one of Trump's favorite targets.

Dick Cheney rallied to his daughter's defense in 2022 as she juggled her lead role on the committee investigating Jan. 6 with trying to get reelected in deeply conservative Wyoming.

Liz Cheney's vote for Trump's impeachment after the insurrection earned her praise from many Democrats and political observers outside Congress. But that praise and her father's support didn't keep her from losing badly in the Republican primary, a dramatic fall after her quick rise to the No. 3 job in the House GOP leadership.

Politics first lured Dick Cheney to Washington in 1968, when he was a congressional fellow. He became a protégé of Rep. Donald Rumsfeld, R-Ill,, serving under him in two agencies and in Gerald Ford's White House before he was elevated to chief of staff, the youngest ever, at age 34.

Cheney held the post for 14 months, then returned to Casper, where he had been raised, and ran for the state's single congressional seat.

In that first race for the House, Cheney suffered a mild heart attack, prompting him to crack he was forming a group called “Cardiacs for Cheney.” He still managed a decisive victory and went on to win five more terms.

In 1989, Cheney became defense secretary under the first President Bush and led the Pentagon during the 1990-91 Persian Gulf War that drove Iraq's troops from Kuwait. Between the two Bush administrations, Cheney led Dallas-based Halliburton Corp., a large engineering and construction company for the oil industry.

Cheney was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, son of a longtime Agriculture Department worker. Senior class president and football co-captain in Casper, he went to Yale on a full scholarship for a year but left with failing grades.

He moved back to Wyoming, eventually enrolled at the University of Wyoming and renewed a relationship with high school sweetheart Lynne Anne Vincent, marrying her in 1964. He is survived by his wife, by Liz and by a second daughter, Mary.

The web archive Common Crawl has been quietly funneling paywalled articles to AI companies—and lying to publishers about it.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Editor's note: This work is part of AI Watchdog, The Atlantic's ongoing investigation into the generative-AI industry.

The Common Crawl Foundation is little known outside of Silicon Valley. For more than a decade, the nonprofit has been scraping billions of webpages to build a massive archive of the internet. This database—large enough to be measured in petabytes—is made freely available for research. In recent years, however, this archive has been put to a controversial purpose: AI companies including OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Nvidia, Meta, and Amazon have used it to train large language models. In the process, my reporting has found, Common Crawl has opened a back door for AI companies to train their models with paywalled articles from major news websites. And the foundation appears to be lying to publishers about this—as well as masking the actual contents of its archives.



Common Crawl has not said much publicly about its support of LLM development. Since the early 2010s, researchers have used Common Crawl's collections for a variety of purposes: to build machine-translation systems, to track unconventional uses of medicines by analyzing discussions in online forums, and to study book banning in various countries, among other things. In a 2012 interview, Gil Elbaz, the founder of Common Crawl, said of its archive that “we just have to make sure that people use it in the right way. Fair use says you can do certain things with the world's data, and as long as people honor that and respect the copyright of this data, then everything's great.”



Common Crawl's website states that it scrapes the internet for “freely available content” without “going behind any ‘paywalls.'” Yet the organization has taken articles from major news websites that people normally have to pay for—allowing AI companies to train their LLMs on high-quality journalism for free. Meanwhile, Common Crawl's executive director, Rich Skrenta, has publicly made the case that AI models should be able to access anything on the internet. “The robots are people too,” he told me, and should therefore be allowed to “read the books” for free. Multiple news publishers have requested that Common Crawl remove their articles to prevent exactly this use. Common Crawl says it complies with these requests. But my research shows that it does not.



I've discovered that pages downloaded by Common Crawl have appeared in the training data of thousands of AI models. As Stefan Baack, a researcher formerly at Mozilla, has written, “Generative AI in its current form would probably not be possible without Common Crawl.” In 2020, OpenAI used Common Crawl's archives to train GPT-3. OpenAI claimed that the program could generate “news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans,” and in 2022, an iteration on that model, GPT-3.5, became the basis for ChatGPT, kicking off the ongoing generative-AI boom. Many different AI companies are now using publishers' articles to train models that summarize and paraphrase the news, and are deploying those models in ways that steal readers from writers and publishers.

Common Crawl maintains that it is doing nothing wrong. I spoke with Skrenta twice while reporting this story. During the second conversation, I asked him about the foundation archiving news articles even after publishers have asked it to stop. Skrenta told me that these publishers are making a mistake by excluding themselves from “Search 2.0”—referring to the generative-AI products now widely being used to find information online—and said that, anyway, it is the publishers that made their work available in the first place. “You shouldn't have put your content on the internet if you didn't want it to be on the internet,” he said.

Common Crawl doesn't log in to the websites it scrapes, but its scraper is immune to some of the paywall mechanisms used by news publishers. For example, on many news websites, you can briefly see the full text of any article before your web browser executes the paywall code that checks whether you're a subscriber and hides the content if you're not. Common Crawl's scraper never executes that code, so it gets the full articles. Thus, by my estimate, the foundation's archives contain millions of articles from news organizations around the world, including The Economist, the Los Angeles Times, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The New Yorker, Harper's, and The Atlantic.



Some news publishers have become aware of Common Crawl's activities, and some have blocked the foundation's scraper by adding an instruction to their website's code. In the past year, Common Crawl's CCBot has become the scraper most widely blocked by the top 1,000 websites, surpassing even OpenAI's GPTBot, which collects content for ChatGPT. However, blocking only prevents future content from being scraped. It doesn't affect the webpages Common Crawl has already collected and stored in its archives.



In July 2023, The New York Times sent a notice to Common Crawl asking for the removal of previously scraped Times content. (In their lawsuit against OpenAI, the Times noted that Common Crawl includes “at least 16 million unique records of content” from Times websites.) The nonprofit seemed amenable to the request. In November of that year, a Times spokesperson, Charlie Stadtlander, told Business Insider: “We simply asked that our content be removed, and were pleased that Common Crawl complied.”



But as I explored Common Crawl's archives, I found that many Times articles appear to still be present. When I mentioned this to the Times, Stadtlander told me: “Our understanding from them is that they have deleted the majority of the Times's content, and continue to work on full removal.”

The Danish Rights Alliance (DRA), an organization that represents publishers and other rights-holders in Denmark, told me about a similar interaction with Common Crawl. Thomas Heldrup, the organization's head of content protection and enforcement, showed me a redacted email exchange with the nonprofit that began in July 2024, in which the DRA requested that its members' content be removed from the archive. In December 2024, more than six months after the DRA had initially requested removal, Common Crawl's attorney wrote: “I confirm that Common Crawl has initiated work to remove your members' content from the data archive. Presently, approximately 50% of this content has been removed.” I spoke with other publishers who'd received similar messages from Common Crawl. One was told, after multiple follow-up emails, that removal was 50 percent, 70 percent, and then 80 percent complete.



By writing code to browse the petabytes of data, I was able to see that large quantities of articles from the Times, the DRA, and these other publishers are still present in Common Crawl's archives. Furthermore, the files are stored in a system that logs the modification times of every file. The foundation adds a new “crawl” to its archive every few weeks, each containing 1 billion to 4 billion webpages, and it has been publishing these regular installments since 2013. None of the content files in Common Crawl's archives appears to have been modified since 2016, suggesting that no content has been removed in at least nine years.



In our first conversation, Skrenta told me that removal requests are “a pain in the ass” but insisted that the foundation complies with them. In our second conversation, Skrenta was more forthcoming. He said that Common Crawl is “making an earnest effort” to remove content but that the file format in which Common Crawl stores its archives is meant “to be immutable. You can't delete anything from it.” (He did not answer my question about where the 50, 70, and 80 percent removal figures come from.)



Yet the nonprofit appears to be concealing this from visitors to its website, where a search function, the only nontechnical tool for seeing what's in Common Crawl's archives, returns misleading results for certain domains. A search for nytimes.com in any crawl from 2013 through 2022 shows a “no captures” result, when in fact there are articles from NYTimes.com in most of these crawls. I also discovered more than 1,000 other domains that produce this incorrect “no captures” result for at least several of the crawls, and most of these domains belong to publishers, including the BBC, Reuters, The New Yorker, Wired, the Financial Times, The Washington Post, and, yes, The Atlantic. According to my research and Common Crawl's own disclosures, the companies behind each of these publications have sent legal requests to the nonprofit. At least one publisher I spoke with told me that it had used this search tool and concluded that its content had been removed from Common Crawl's archives.

In the past two years, Common Crawl has been getting cozier with the AI industry. In 2023, after 15 years of near-exclusive financial support from the Elbaz Family Foundation Trust, it received donations from OpenAI ($250,000), Anthropic ($250,000), and other organizations involved in AI development. (Skrenta told me that running Common Crawl costs “millions of dollars.”)



When training AI models, developers such as OpenAI and Google usually filter Common Crawl's archives to remove material they don't want, such as racism, profanity, and various forms of low-quality prose. Each developer and company has its own filtering strategy, which has led to a proliferation of Common Crawl–based training data sets: c4 (created by Google), FineWeb, DCLM, and more than 50 others. Together, these data sets have been downloaded tens of millions of times from Hugging Face, an AI-development hub, and other sources.



But Common Crawl doesn't only supply the raw text; it has also been helping assemble and distribute AI-training data sets itself. Its developers have co-authored multiple papers about LLM-training-data curation, and they sometimes appear at conferences where they show AI developers how to use Common Crawl for training. Common Crawl even hosts several AI-training data sets derived from its crawls, including one for Nvidia, the most valuable company in the world. In its paper on the data set, Nvidia thanks certain Common Crawl developers for their advice.

AI companies have argued that using copyrighted material is fair use, and Skrenta has been framing the issue in terms of robot rights for some time. In 2023, he sent a letter urging the U.S. Copyright Office not “to hinder the development of intelligent machines” and included two illustrations of robots reading books. But this argument obscures who the actors are: not robots but corporations, and their powerful executives, who decide what content to train their models with and who profit from the results.



If it wanted to, Common Crawl could mitigate the damage done by those corporations to authors and publishers without making its data any less accessible to researchers. In his 2024 report, Baack, the ex-Mozilla researcher, pointed out that Common Crawl could require attribution whenever its scraped content is used. This would help publishers track the use of their work, including when it might appear in the training data of AI models that aren't supposed to have access. This is a common requirement for open data sets and would cost Common Crawl nothing. I asked Skrenta if he had considered this. He told me he had read Baack's report but didn't plan on taking the suggestion, because it wasn't Common Crawl's responsibility. “We can't police that whole thing,” he told me. “It's not our job. We're just a bunch of dusty bookshelves.”

Skrenta has said that publishers that want to remove their content from Common Crawl will “kill the open web.” Likewise, the AI industry often defends its presumed right to scrape the web by invoking the concept of openness. But others have pointed out that generative-AI companies are the ones killing openness, by motivating publishers to expand and strengthen their paywalls to defend their work (and their business models) from exploitative scrapers.



Promoting another dubious, feel-good idea, Common Crawl has said that the internet is “where information lives free,” echoing the techno-libertarian rallying cry that “information wants to be free.” In popular usage, the phrase is frequently stripped of its context. It comes from a remark made by the tech futurist Stewart Brand in 1984. In a discussion about how computers were accelerating the spread of information, Brand observed that “information sort of wants to be expensive, because it's so valuable.” But, paradoxically, he said, “information almost wants to be free” because computers make the cost of distributing it so low. In other words, it's not that information should be free—rather, computers tend to make it seem free. Yet the idea is deployed today by secretive organizations such as Common Crawl that choose which information “lives free” and which doesn't.



In our conversation, Skrenta downplayed the importance of any particular newspaper or magazine. He told me that The Atlantic is not a crucial part of the internet. “Whatever you're saying, other people are saying too, on other sites,” he said. Throughout our conversation, Skrenta gave the impression of having little respect for (or understanding of) how original reporting works.



Skrenta did, however, express tremendous reverence for Common Crawl's archive. He sees it as a record of our civilization's achievements. He told me he wants to “put it on a crystal cube and stick it on the moon,” so that “if the Earth blows up,” aliens might be able to reconstruct our history. “The Economist and The Atlantic will not be on that cube,” he told me. “Your article will not be on that cube. This article.”

The end of the former vice president's career reflected its beginnings.

In Vice President Dick Cheney's later years, former detractors sometimes expressed puzzlement about his political trajectory. The onetime designated villain of the Iraq War had somehow mutated into a hero of the anti-Trump constitutional resistance. Had he changed? Or had they misjudged him?

People do change. Perspectives can shift. But oftentimes the secret to later-life decisions is encoded in early experiences.

Richard Bruce Cheney arrived in Washington in 1968 as a 27-year-old congressional intern. Within seven years, he rose to become White House chief of staff.

That spectacular ascent owed much to Cheney's talents and work ethic. It owed more to the catastrophes and traumas of Vietnam and Watergate. As more senior staff resigned in disgrace or faced indictment, the way lay open for a younger man untainted by previous failures and scandals. Early in the Nixon administration, Cheney formed a close bond with Donald Rumsfeld, another thrusting young man a few years his senior. The president who succeeded Nixon, Gerald Ford, named Rumsfeld his first chief of staff. Rumsfeld selected Cheney as his deputy. In November 1975, Rumsfeld moved to head the Department of Defense. Cheney succeeded him in the White House job.

Cheney's boyhood coincided with America's rise to global preeminence. At age 34, he found himself near the top of the U.S. government at a time of humiliation and defeat. The new Ford administration set to work restoring the government's credibility at home and America's position in the world.

After Ford's electoral loss in 1976, Cheney ran for Congress from his native Wyoming. He won his seat and rose rapidly in the House leadership. Along the way, he and his wife, Lynne, co-wrote an insightful analysis of congressional power.

The party of which Cheney was now a leader had been badly split by Ronald Reagan's challenge to Ford in the 1976 Republican primaries. Cheney was a Ford loyalist sympathetic to Reagan's ideas, and especially Reagan's faith in American power. The argument between Ford and Reagan was less about what America should do than about what America could do. Ford was most influenced by Henry Kissinger's deep pessimism about American capabilities. The most insightful analysis of Kissinger's thinking, Barry Gewen's The Inevitability of Tragedy argues that Kissinger did not believe that the United States was institutionally, ideologically, or temperamentally suited to global leadership. True statesmanship required the U.S. to reach the best deals it could get before its power ran out.

Cheney never accepted that view. His robust support of Reagan's self-confident policies elevated him to the No. 2 position among House Republicans in 1987. He was poised to become the next Republican speaker of the House but for another chance occurrence. In 1989, newly elected President George H. W. Bush nominated John Tower as secretary of defense. Tower, a U.S. senator from Texas, was a longtime Bush ally. He was also an alcoholic, a sexual harasser, and a man who had offended enough fellow senators that they felt little inclination to overlook the first two offenses in the list. When his nomination fell apart, Cheney got the appointment instead—and then efficiently organized the U.S. liberation of Kuwait from Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War of 1990–91.

Governments make mistakes, then overcorrect for those mistakes. The Bush administration halted its 1991 campaign at the Kuwait-Iraq border. The administration collectively assumed that the Iraqi military or the Iraqi people would finish off Saddam Hussein without direct U.S. intervention. Instead, Saddam brutally crushed rebellions against his rule, in great part because the U.S. loosened its “no fly” rules to allow Saddam to use helicopter gunships to massacre civilian demonstrators. Inside Iraq, this permission was interpreted as U.S. complicity in Saddam's survival. In fact, the decision seems to have been an unauthorized bungle by the U.S. commander in the region, Norman Schwarzkopf, who later told an interviewer that the Iraqis had “suckered” him.



The lesson Cheney took was that the Saddam problem would not solve itself. As Saddam resumed his aggressions and provocations after 1991, Cheney counted the end of the Gulf War as unfinished business. Like Ford, Bush lost reelection. Cheney entered private life as CEO of Halliburton, a major government contractor. He became a regular at events of the American Enterprise Institute. I got to know him a little in those days: a man who spoke little, listened deeply, and fitted everything he heard into a well-stocked and well-organized mind.

As conservative as he was on economics and national security, Cheney had little interest in the socially reactionary side of the conservative program. He voted in favor of the anti-abortion wish list in the House, but ignored the issue once he no longer faced a local electorate. (Later, he would endorse same-sex marriage during the election of 2004, at a time when the Bush-Cheney reelection campaign was hoping to use state referendums to ban same-sex marriage to energize voters against the Kerry-Edwards ticket.)

His indifference to the hottest of hot-button conservative issues doomed from the start any hope for a Cheney presidential run in 2000. Instead he offered the benefits of his deep experience to George W. Bush's campaign.

Bush organized his campaign and his administration on a lesson he had learned from his father's defeat in 1992.

The elder Bush delivered arguably the most successful foreign-policy record in U.S. history: not only the Gulf War victory, but also the peaceful end of the Cold War, the securing of the dangerously poorly managed Soviet nuclear arsenal, and more. None of it mattered much to the U.S. electorate in November 1992. The younger Bush concluded that his energy and attention in his first term would be focused tightly on the domestic agenda. Foreign-policy tasks, including the inherited Saddam problem, would await his second term, if he won it. Cheney's expertise on security matters buffered Bush from being distracted by non-crucial foreign-policy work. That plan exploded with the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, but it explains much about how the Bush administration found itself situated on the day of the al-Qaeda terror attacks.



By the end of 2001, the Taliban had been toppled in Afghanistan, but Osama bin Laden had escaped. The Bush administration faced a messy set of choices about what to do next. Reconstruct Afghanistan? That was the option urged by many Democrats. But nation-building in the world's least hospitable environment seemed a costly and doomed undertaking. Declare victory and return to the domestic agenda? There were many on the Bush team who favored that approach, but with Osama bin Laden still at large, who would believe that occupying Kabul counted as victory? There had to be something else the U.S. could do, equal to the horror of the attack the U.S. had suffered on 9/11.

Finishing Saddam seemed, to many, that “something.”

After the Iraq War went wrong, Bush and Cheney were often and angrily accused of lying about Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction. This seems to me a charge grounded in a deep misunderstanding of events. Before 9/11, the administration underestimated al-Qaeda. After 9/11, it overcorrected in the opposite direction about Iraq. Every ambiguous piece of evidence was interpreted in the most ominous possible way, less as a political device than out of sincere conviction. Never again would the administration repeat the undervigilance of September 10.

Saddam Hussein wanted for his own reasons to convince the world that he possessed—or soon could possess—terrible weapons. He succeeded. President Bush said in his 2002 State of the Union address, “Iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support terror. The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax, and nerve gas, and nuclear weapons for over a decade. This is a regime that has already used poison gas to murder thousands of its own citizens—leaving the bodies of mothers huddled over their dead children. This is a regime that agreed to international inspections—then kicked out the inspectors. This is a regime that has something to hide from the civilized world.”  I was part of the team that worked on that speech. In retrospect, there is a bitter irony in the last line of the quoted text. Saddam did indeed have “something to hide,” but it was precisely that his regime's plots to develop weapons had collapsed in corruption and incompetence. Saddam himself may not have understood the magnitude of the failure.

The Iraq War consumed the Bush administration—and, before it was over, undercut Cheney's standing within the administration. The U.S. did eventually stand up a successor regime, but not the strong and pro-Western regime hoped for in 2003. Iraq has returned to world oil markets, but it remains a violent and unstable place open to Iranian influence and intimidation.

Anger and resentment left behind by the war were an important source of support for Donald Trump's campaign for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. Trump flat-out lied when he pretended to have opposed the Iraq War in advance. But that lie did not matter much so long as his main opponent for the nomination was the brother of the president who had started the war. Trump won the nomination and then entered the presidency. Over the decade since, he has remodeled the Republican Party into everything that Cheney had always opposed and rejected.

Trump's Republicanism is deeply pessimistic about America's role in the world. It sees the United States as one great power among many, no better than the others.

Trump's Republicanism is radically statist and protectionist, in service to reactionary cultural politics.

And it is above all contemptuous of law and constitutional limits. The very week of former Vice President Cheney's death, the Trump administration will argue at the Supreme Court in favor of the president's power to impose limitless tariffs on his sole personal claim that some kind of economic emergency exists, without any right of anybody else to question or refute that claim—meaning that the president has effectively discarded and replaced Congress's Article I power to tax or refrain from taxing.

The young constitutional conservative elevated to the highest offices of government by the Watergate scandal would have been appalled and disgusted—and so was the old constitutional conservative who lived to see his cherished daughter a leader of the last band of principled conservative opposition to Trump's attempt to overthrow a presidential election by fraud and force.

“In my beginning is my end,” wrote T. S. Eliot. There was one Dick Cheney all along. Know him better as you tell and honor the life story of this great servant of the American people in all his strengths and weaknesses, triumphs and failures.

Popular ideas about inflammation have lost touch with medical reality.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

My patient's lungs were filled with blood, and he lay intubated in an ICU bed. His kidneys were failing, too. The cause of his illness was not a mystery: He had been previously diagnosed with an autoimmune disease that, in many cases, leads to severe organ damage, and he clearly needed the same treatment he'd received before, a drug that suppresses the immune system. With it, he started to improve in days.



At a follow-up visit, I suggested re-dosing the medication in a few months, to prevent future episodes of life-threatening inflammation. That word caught his attention. “What caused it?” he asked. “The inflammation, I mean.”



He and his wife exchanged uncertain glances as I explained that doctors don't know what sets off most autoimmune inflammatory diseases: It's likely a complex interplay between genetics, environment, and bad luck. But we do know how to treat them. At the next visit, his wife asked me about the potential causes of chronic inflammation that she'd read about online—tick bites, heavy-metal exposures, nutritional deficiencies—as well as anti-inflammatory treatments including herbal supplements, acupuncture, and energy healing. I began to worry that framing the conversation around inflammation—a word that clearly meant one thing to me and quite another to this couple—had been a mistake.



Doctors caring for patients with autoimmune diseases have long thought of inflammation in precise terms: Cells of the immune system lodge in tissues and release messenger molecules, called cytokines, that rev up the body's response to a perceived insult. In recent years, scientists have been able to identify many cytokines and create targeted therapies for a host of disabling, sometimes fatal, diseases.



At the same time, popular culture has latched on to the concept of inflammation and made it a catch-all term for “something amiss in the body”—a bête noire for wellness gurus, health influencers, and the “Make America Healthy Again” movement. A YouTube or TikTok search for chronic inflammation might lead to Josh Farris, also known as “The Gut Guy,” who argues that rubber-soled shoes prevent us from connecting to the earth and force the body to steal energy from other cells, causing “an inflammation loop cycle.” The MAHA report, which the White House released in May, suggests that ultra-processed foods and the overuse of medications may be contributing to chronic inflammation in children. Even as conventional treatments for autoimmune diseases have become more effective than ever, alternative treatments, including nutritional supplements, breathing exercises, hyperbaric oxygen chambers, and cold plunges in frigid water, have proliferated.



Andrew Weil is perhaps the person most responsible for inserting the phrase anti-inflammatory into the American lexicon. Weil, a Harvard Medical School graduate who completed his internship before deciding to explore nontraditional medical practices, told me that his views on inflammation are simple and have not changed over the decades. According to Weil, acute inflammation is a natural, protective response to injury or infection and is an important part of healing. Chronic inflammation is a low-level, persistent activation of the immune system that can damage the body over time and is linked to ailments such as cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and autoimmune conditions. Weil argues that following his anti-inflammatory food pyramid and taking up practices such as meditation, yoga, and tai chi can help prevent and treat these diseases of chronic inflammation.



To support his claims, Weil cites population studies showing that people who maintain a diet high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains have lower rates of heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers than those who don't consume these products. He also points to studies showing that certain foods and spices, including turmeric and ginger, can inhibit key regulators of the immune system, reducing cytokine production. When I asked Weil about proof that these interventions work, based on randomized clinical trials, he told me that he believes such studies are not necessary when an intervention is unlikely to cause harm. “I grade evidence on a sliding scale,” he said.



Weil's anti-inflammatory message has germinated across the internet in tweets, podcasts, and YouTube Shorts. The result is a hodgepodge of myths and theories about how to address the issue that go well beyond advice to just eat well and meditate. Juice cleanses are fashionable in certain anti-inflammatory circles, even though they can cause electrolyte imbalances. A popular notion on TikTok is that hidden parasites are a common cause of chronic inflammation and that ingesting wormwood—a bitter herb that can lead to liver injury—will rid the body of this problem. Other videos encourage viewers to ingest water laced with borax, a powdery substance found in laundry detergent, in order to reduce inflammation and joint pain.



Most claims made by health gurus and social-media influencers are exaggerated. “If it sounds too good to be true, it is,” Richard Panush, a rheumatologist and emeritus professor at the University of Southern California, who has studied alternative therapies for autoimmune diseases, told me. Some of their recommendations are outright dangerous. Still, these ideas are clearly enticing to patients feeling beaten down by chronic disease. One recent study showed that, among people with an autoimmune condition, more than 80 percent have tried some form of complementary and alternative medicine. In my experience, most patients gravitate toward interventions on the milder end of the spectrum, such as acupuncture and herbal remedies, but even these can be problematic if taken to the extreme. One patient of mine told me that, at a certain point, he was consuming 60 supplements a day, putting him at risk of adverse interactions with his prescription medications.



In decades past, alternative therapies may not have seemed so outlandish compared with conventional therapies, which often had significant side effects and limited efficacy. Now, though, doctors like me can prescribe treatments that turn many debilitating diseases into manageable conditions. People with rheumatoid arthritis can be treated with one or two medications and expect to experience disability-free lives with few to no symptoms. Surgeons used to routinely remove the colons of individuals with ulcerative colitis, but an injection or infusion of medication every few weeks can put those patients in remission. The key to these advances has been the development of certain biologics that target key pathways in the immune system and selectively block the activity of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Dozens of FDA-approved biologics are now available to patients for diseases including psoriasis, Crohn's, and multiple sclerosis. The future is even more promising with therapies like CAR T cells, which are genetically modified “living drugs” that have had remarkable success in clinical trials, particularly for lupus.



This is not to say that conventional therapies come without costs. Using a medication meant to suppress the immune system has an inherent trade-off: Autoimmunity may be better controlled, but the risk of infection increases. The list price for some biologics can reach $7,000 a month, and patients receiving infusible medications must arrange travel plans around the timing of their therapy.



Alternative health might be appealing for another reason. Because doctors cannot give a simple explanation as to why most autoimmune conditions developed in the first place, patients may look elsewhere for insights and solutions. Some autoimmune diseases also can remit on their own for reasons that remain unclear, implying that not every patient may require lifelong therapy.



For doctors, though, taking the wait-and-watch approach feels risky when the stakes are high: Not treating a disease, in the hopes that it'll resolve naturally, could leave someone with, say, joint erosions or renal failure. “I frequently tell patients, ‘I'm overtreating you' because we can't predict if your disease will cause irreversible damage,” Philip Seo, a rheumatologist at Johns Hopkins University, told me. “We can't go back in time.”



Conversations with patients about if and when to start medication have always been complex, but online lore about inflammation, coupled with declining confidence in doctors since the coronavirus pandemic, have made such discussions more fraught. “It comes down to trust,” Panush, the rheumatologist who researches alternative therapies, told me, “which I'm afraid doctors are losing from patients who have adopted a different belief system than their own.”



I saw that happen with my own ICU patient, whose condition had been so dire. He and his family were willing to accept immune-suppressing therapy when he was critically ill, but his calculus changed once he was doing better. I tried to provide clear recommendations while making him and his wife feel heard, but it seemed like we were talking past each other. Eventually, he stopped showing up for appointments. I called multiple times to check in, but there was no answer. A year later, I learned that he had died. His obituary didn't mention his autoimmune disease, the most likely cause of his death. Instead, it said he had died from agricultural and industrial pollution.

Until Hamas is disarmed, Gaza has no future.

In a recent interview with the BBC, King Abdullah II of Jordan posed an uncomfortable question. “What is the mandate of security forces inside of Gaza?” he asked. Peacekeeping might be viable, but, he warned, “if it's peace-enforcing, nobody will want to touch that.”

His comments left me feeling deeply conflicted. On the one hand, they echoed an old pattern, in which Arab countries voice their support for the goals of the Palestinian people, such as gaining statehood or disarming Hamas, but show no inclination to do the heavy lifting themselves. On the other hand, King Abdullah is surely correct that no Arab or Muslim country will want to place its soldiers between Hamas and the Israel Defense Forces. Enforcing the cease-fire against Hamas would risk it being cast as the aggressor against the terror organization, which enjoys significant support within these countries' radicalized populations.

The cease-fire process seems to have stalled, especially with respect to Hamas's disarmament, which is a core component of Donald Trump's 20-point plan to end the conflict and transform Gaza. The terror group, which regularly speaks of its unwillingness to disarm, has made clear that it wants to maintain its security dominion over the Strip, even if it does not directly govern it. Hamas has retaken full control of the part of Gaza west of the “yellow line” that marks the extent of the Israeli withdrawal from the coastal enclave.

In fact, Hamas lost no time in taking the offensive against clans and any individuals it identified with opposition to its rule, real or perceived. It used obscene public executions and vile displays of violence to instill fear and trepidation among the population. With each passing day, Hamas further re-entrenches its control. The group is collecting unexploded munitions in order to rearm, reestablishing command and control across its different units, repairing damaged tunnels, and ensuring that its grip on power is never threatened from within by Gaza's exhausted and deeply traumatized population. Furthermore, the terror group is influencing the transitional process by insisting on having a say over appointments to the technocratic committee tasked with administering Gaza's affairs.

Hamas's intransigence is placing the cease-fire under untenable strain. If Israel becomes convinced that Gaza is headed back to the situation that prevailed on October 7, then no amount of “Bibi-sitting” by U.S. officials will prevent Israel from acting unilaterally. Even Trump himself has signaled that his commitment to the war's end is contingent on Hamas disarming and sticking to the agreed-upon framework.

Yet a return to war by the Israeli military would extend the unimaginable suffering inflicted on the people of Gaza, and the condemnation of the international community. The IDF's application of overwhelming firepower produces mass casualties, and any resumption of the fighting would endanger what little remains of Gaza's already heavily damaged infrastructure.

In my conversations with those engaged with the process, I've found two schools of thought about disarmament. Some countries believe that a political process must come first, establishing transitional governance to provide legitimacy and cover for disarmament. Other players, however, insist that disarmament must commence first, or else any political process will be subjected to Hamas's interference, and to arm-twisting by those who can exert influence with their guns and tunnels. The latter have the stronger case. A credible political process cannot be established without first sidelining Hamas's munitions and armaments, which are the only remaining source of leverage for the terror group and its rule in the Gaza Strip.

But if an international stabilization force is a political mirage that has no realistic chance of working as envisioned in Trump's plan, the Palestinian Authority is incapable of taking on Hamas, local Israeli-backed militias in Gaza are all too weak to prevail without direct Israeli support, and the war-battered population is too afraid and tired to revolt against Hamas, then who could possibly take on what remains of Hamas to disarm it and decommission its extensive tunnel network?

Private military contractors are likely the only viable option to make the stabilization force remotely feasible and capable of implementing the mandate everybody wants. They can form the strike component of the force that will be necessary in the initial deployment phase. PMCs can operate free from some political constraints. They can hire individuals with extensive experience in military, policing, and security, and can deploy without requiring a significant footprint. On the ground, they can focus on close-quarters combat without the overwhelming application of firepower by an air force, thereby minimizing civilian casualties.

PMCs have a problematic track record, including Blackwater in Iraq and those used in Gaza during the food and aid distribution of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. But PMCs have also been the backbone of numerous operations run by the United States, NATO, Arab and Muslim countries, and nations in the Global South.

Furthermore, PMCs that operate in close proximity to civilians typically require personnel to undergo extensive training in human rights, crowd management, anti-trafficking, and anti-exploitation measures, and to abide by a code of conduct. They also vet their operators, and monitor compliance, to ensure that these principles are actually implemented and followed. I saw this firsthand with one of the companies involved in securing the GHF's distribution sites, and heard how it had addressed some of its initial mistakes and challenges, and many of its operators worked to make it apparent that they were up to the task.

PMCs could enter zones still under Israeli control, clearing them of Hamas's weapons and tunnels, and then Arab and international forces could operate inside those zones to keep the peace once it is established. PMCs could also venture beyond the “yellow line” into areas of Gaza where Hamas is still in control, methodically clearing and then holding territory before handing control over to international forces. Bit by bit, they can clear the Strip. Once secured, these areas can commence clearing rubble, removing unexploded munitions, and restoring basic services. Other local, regional, and international providers can move in to bolster a gradual process of reconstruction.

The people of Gaza desperately need pragmatic solutions. PMCs offer the best chance to implement the “clear, hold, and build” strategy that can restore security to the Strip. Only when Hamas is disarmed, and the people of Gaza are freed from its dominion, can they begin to create the future they deserve.

Thirty years after Rabin's assassination, Israel is ignoring the lessons of the most honest statesman I've ever known.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

It is hard for me to believe that 30 years have passed since Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated.

On November 4, 1995, an Israeli far-right zealot fatally shot the prime minister at a peace rally in Tel Aviv. As the U.S. Middle East envoy at the time, I worked closely with Rabin, who remains the most intellectually honest leader I've known. He knew what his present-day successor fails to see: When Israel ignores the concerns of Palestinians, the country undermines its own security. He was the rare Israeli statesman who understood that Israel can advance its interests and address the Palestinian cause at the same time. Indeed, he was killed because of his efforts to broker peace, a prospect his killer couldn't tolerate.

Once Rabin had thought through a decision, you couldn't argue him out of it. But he had the courage to admit his mistakes. I remember when he came to Washington in December 1988 and said that Israel's military could quickly put down an emerging Palestinian uprising. I disagreed, warning that Palestinians' frustrations could not simply be suppressed. Rabin later told me I was right. (The uprising became the prolonged period of unrest known as the First Intifada.) He had come to understand that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict had no military solution—only a political one. Three decades later, too many Israeli leaders still reject that core insight.

Graeme Wood: One era ends in Gaza, and another begins

Although Rabin could be stubborn, he adjusted his thinking when the situation demanded it. He was deeply suspicious of the Palestine Liberation Organization and its head, Yasser Arafat, who had been responsible for much terror and Israeli bloodshed. But Rabin came to see that no one else could represent the Palestinian people. He authorized secret peace talks with the PLO and then negotiated the Oslo Accords, which resulted in mutual recognition between the Israeli government and the PLO, and turned over incremental parts of the West Bank and Gaza to Palestinian self-governance. The Oslo Accords had many flaws, but their critics—including Benjamin Netanyahu, who kept the framework in place as prime minister—have never offered a workable alternative. Instead, they continue to act under the illusion that Palestinians will simply accept permanent Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.

Rabin's ultimate goal was peaceful coexistence, yet he was not naive about how difficult it would be to achieve. In February 1995, he told me that negotiating a permanent peace agreement with Arafat might prove impossible. If the two sides couldn't agree, Rabin said, Israel would build a barrier to partition its land from Palestinian territory in order to meet Israeli security needs.

A few years earlier, Rabin had demonstrated how Israel could pursue its strategic interests in a Middle East that bears similarities to the region today. America's commanding victory in the Gulf War in 1991 had weakened Saddam Hussein and anti-Israeli forces, giving President George H. W. Bush extraordinary diplomatic leverage. Today, too, Israel's rejectionist enemies are in disarray: The country has pummeled Hezbollah and Hamas; Assad's regime in Syria has collapsed; and the 12-day Israeli and American war dealt a significant blow to Iran. As with Bush in 1991, few countries are willing to say no to President Donald Trump.

Rabin sought to take advantage of such circumstances by working with the United States to pursue peace with Syria, Jordan, and the Palestinians. His efforts built on the Madrid Peace Conference, which the U.S. had helped assemble shortly after the war. The conference broke the enduring taboo on direct talks between Arabs and Israelis—and Rabin took advantage. As he explained in a speech after becoming prime minister the following year, Israel had to foster peace with its neighbors in order to focus on the greater threat posed by Iran and its nuclear program.

The parallels between 1991 and 2025 are not perfect. Hamas's October 7 terrorist attack and Israel's devastating campaign in Gaza have produced a mutual animosity that won't soon disappear. But a more promising factor has also emerged: Arab states finally seem ready to assume some responsibility for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I hear this in my conversations with high-ranking Arab officials. And I saw it in July, when Arab states endorsed a declaration condemning Hamas for October 7 and calling for the group's disarmament.

If Rabin were alive, he would spot this strategic opening and try to seize it. He would see in Trump's 20-point peace plan an opportunity to rebuild a better Gaza and create a coalition with Arab states to oppose Iran and extremist forces in the region. Rabin would understand that Israel has to make some concessions to Palestinians in order to enhance the prospects of a regional coalition. But he would also require Palestinians to do their part by ensuring security and reforming the Palestinian Authority.

Einat Wilf: The fatal flaw that doomed the Oslo Accords

Rabin and I met for the last time three days before his assassination. Six weeks earlier, we had finalized the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement, which gave the PA control of the cities in the West Bank. It had generated substantial backlash from Israel's right wing, but Rabin was undaunted. He believed he could make more progress with Arafat, even though the PLO had begun allowing Hamas to build its presence in Gaza.

Rabin wanted me to raise the issue of Hamas with Arafat, though only in broad terms. But generalities never worked with Arafat, so I told Rabin, “Give me the details. That way I can hold Arafat accountable.” Rabin thought for a moment, then told me he could handle it himself. He was upbeat and energetic. As I was leaving, he said the last words I would ever hear from him: “Dennis, expect anything.”

Those words still haunt me. I expected many things, but not Rabin's assassination—much less that he would be killed because he sought peace. I did not expect that Israel would still have so far to go on the path he helped clear.

How artificial intelligence could be leading most humans into an inescapable trap.

Over the past year, I've had many disquieting realizations — that the American voter is more forgiving of insurrections than inflation, that being 37 means having one bad knee (and another not particularly good one), and that the New York Mets made a pact with Satan in the fall of 1986, for which subsequent generations of fans would eternally pay.

But my most unsettling epiphany may have been this: Robots can now do much of my job better than I can.

For a decade, I have made a living partly by synthesizing news articles and academic studies into accessible explainers, which white-collar workers could skim while pretending to do their jobs. The skills that this vocation requires — the capacity to rapidly digest text, craft clean copy, and sound like I know more about any given subject than I actually do — are ones that ChatGPT possesses in spades.

Worse, it can exercise these abilities far more efficiently than I can. ChatGPT requires five seconds and a speck of electricity to explain how President Donald Trump's tariffs have impacted the dollar. To perform the same task, I need about 48 hours, six meals, 37 Twitter breaks, and at least three medications. And unlike myself, the chatbot can instantly rewrite its analysis in the voice of a pirate.

But journalists are hardly alone in fearing our impending economic obsolescence (which is, admittedly, a longstanding pastime within the field). Knowledge-workers of all kinds — from software engineers to financial analysts to filmmakers — are sweating their robo-competition. And not without reason.

In investor calls, executives are touting plans to satisfy their labor needs with artificial intelligence at a historically high rate. Goldman Sachs is slowing hiring and speeding AI deployment. The fintech firm Klarna has used AI to slash its payroll by 40 percent. Salesforce says machines can now perform 50 percent of the firm's work.

AI-generated mass unemployment is still the stuff of science fiction. But the technology does appear to be slowing hiring in heavily exposed fields, particularly for junior positions. And labor market data indicates that something weird is afoot: Over the past 35 years, recent college graduates have almost always had a lower unemployment rate than American workers writ large. Now, a young college grad is more likely to be involuntarily jobless than the typical US worker.

Meanwhile, the major AI labs are promising to deliver an artificial general intelligence (AGI) — which is to say, a machine that can outperform humans at all cognitive tasks — in the near future. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei says AI is likely to wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs by 2030. Investors seem to be betting a lot of money on such outcomes. This year alone, companies are poised to sink $375 billion into AI infrastructure.

Among anxious laptop workers, these trends have fed half-ironic chatter about the coming of a “permanent underclass”: Once AI renders virtually all human labor commercially useless, most people will be condemned to eternal subjugation and precarity. No company will pay you for work that a robot can do better. And no market economy will let you climb the income ladder if your labor has no value. In Silicon Valley, such reasoning has generated a peculiarly dystopian variant of hustle culture: Make your fortune in the next five years, and you'll claim a place in the perpetual aristocracy of AI owners — fail, and you'll forever be at their mercy.

All these claims are wildly speculative. It's not certain that today's AI labs have functioning business models, much less the wherewithal to develop omnicompetent robots. Yet of all the nightmare scenarios spun by fatalistic futurists, AGI-induced neofeudalism strikes me as among the most plausible.

AGI may or may not decide to liquidate the human race. But it will tank the value of human labor, more or less by definition. We don't know how ordinary people will fare in a world where the wealthy can do without their talents and exertions. But it is reasonable to worry that the answer is “not too well.” After all, there are already societies in which workers enjoy relatively little economic leverage over elites. And they typically aren't nice places to be an ordinary person.

It's therefore worth examining precisely how AI could generate an immutable oligarchy —and what can be done to prevent that from happening.

Automation is the mother of all prosperity.

Without labor-saving machines, most of us would still spend our days coaxing calories from the Earth, forever a few unfriendly weather events shy of starvation. Robots are why most Americans can go to bed with a full stomach in a climate-controlled home, facing a flat screen that supplies infinite audiovisual entertainment on demand — all without ever needing to risk a sunburn or broken back.

Yet automation has also routinely ruined people's lives. True, robots tend to benefit most workers in the long run. But in the meantime, some displaced laborers die poor.

Nevertheless, in every past wave of automation, it was at least theoretically possible for the disemployed to secure better-paying jobs by updating their skills. Even as machines rendered humans uncompetitive at certain tasks, they facilitated the discovery of new economically useful endeavors. When the steel plow ran field hands off the farm, they could find new work in factories. When industrial robots shouldered manufacturing workers off the assembly line, they could — hypothetically, as the saying goes — “learn to code.” Far from exhausting a finite supply of occupations, technological progress generated more and better ones.

But there is no reason why this must always be the case. No physical law forbids silicon from facilitating reasoning as well as gray matter. Nor does any property of the universe guarantee that human hands will always be better at folding towels (or any other fine-grained activity) than robotic ones. And the number of tasks that machines can't do has, in fact, been rapidly shrinking.

Six years ago, the world's most sophisticated AI models struggled to write a snippet of Python or a coherent paragraph. Today, they can get an A+ in constitutional law and outperform 99.5 percent of humans on certain coding problems.

Progress in robotics has been less frenetic. Machines have an easier time acing calculus than assembling Ikea furniture. But the better robots get at processing information, the more comprehensively they'll be able to outperform humans in the physical world — a point underscored by recent advances in self-driving cars.

“Most of us are currently focused on machines being able to perform all the cognitive labor,” University of Virginia economist Anton Korinek told me. But in his view, one of the big lessons of the past two years is that “if we give our existing robots better brains, they can perform much better.” For this reason, Korinek thinks that machines may “soon” be able to outperform humans at most “cognitive and physical labor.”

None of this means that AGI is two years away, as some of the industry's boosters (and Cassandras) have been prophesying. But it does offer some cause for thinking that economically omnicompetent machines are possible.

And there are reasons to suspect that their advent may be inevitable over a sufficiently long time horizon.

After all, humans did not evolve to optimally create value in a modern market economy. We cannot perform tasks for any extended period of time without getting a bit hungry, tired, bored, or horny. We struggle to accept orders unless we're shown a modicum of respect. More fundamentally, barring cyborgification, the efficiency of our brains is bound by our biology, no less than the strength of our arms.

Machines' capabilities are less inherently constrained. Indeed, given sufficient advances in AI, hardware, and energy technology, it is conceivable that robots could perform a week's worth of any human's labor while consuming fewer resources than it would take to keep that person alive.

This has led some in the AI industry to predict that their technology will eventually push human wages below the subsistence level. In that scenario, after briefly freeing people from lives spent tilling soil and chasing squirrels for sustenance, technological progress would have restored most humans to that prehistoric fate.

Or, at least, it would do so — unless elites chose to share the fruits of AGI with the masses. But it's unclear whether we should expect such redistribution, in a world where an ordinary person's labor isn't worth the cost of their calories.

America today is a profoundly inequitable nation, in which the powerful exploit and neglect the weak in myriad ways.

It is also one of the most egalitarian civilizations to ever exist.

Since the advent of agriculture, most humans have lived in steeply hierarchical societies, where privileged castes hoarded both resources and legal rights. Typically, at the top of these social orders stood nobles, who collected income without working; at the bottom, enslaved people, who worked without pay. In some cases, the former could do most anything to the latter, up to and including killing them.

Ordinary people, meanwhile, boasted limited legal standing, exercised no political influence, and tended to pay higher effective tax rates than the rich, even as they received a piddling share of economic output and few public benefits beyond military protection.

Compared to ancient Rome or China, modern industrial democracies resemble socialistic utopias. Even in the infamously unequal United States, all citizens enjoy formal equality under the law and a minimum living standard within the economy: The working poor are entitled to food assistance and public health insurance, the old or disabled to a guaranteed income, and the young to 13 years of free education. Meanwhile, the typical middle-class family pays a lower tax rate than the typical rich one. Many employers feel economically compelled to provide their workers with paid family leave, healthcare, and other benefits — and all firms are legally required to pay a minimum wage, maintain safe working conditions, and tolerate union organizing

We can build a highly automated economy in which everyone can flourish. … We just need to develop healthy political and economic institutions.

What explains the relative humanity of so many modern societies? Some would point to the egalitarian ideas propagated by universalistic religions, Enlightenment philosophy, and social democratic thought. And such belief systems have surely played a role.

Yet the spread of egalitarian ideas in recent centuries doesn't merely reflect their intuitive moral appeal but also, their capacity to facilitate mutually beneficial cooperation. The abolition of slavery did not only make America more just; it also rendered the nation more economically productive. Labor markets comprised of autonomous workers are more efficient than those populated by serfs or enslaved people. As a result, the liberation of those bound to the land facilitated an increase in both wages for ordinary people and profits for elites.

Similarly, in a world of robust economic growth — where ordinary workers' time is becoming steadily more valuable — the wealthy have an interest in securing political stability and labor peace, even at the cost of forfeiting a bit of power. Acquiescing to mass enfranchisement may have loosened elites' grip on governments. But doing so also helped legitimize orders that provided capital owners with high and rising living standards. Tolerating unions may have forced business owners to accept a higher wage bill, but doing so also insulated them from the threat of strikes. Investing in public education may have required the well-heeled to pay more taxes, but it also cultivated a more productive labor force.

This isn't to say that material interests mechanically determine history or human behavior. People crave status, meaning, and self-esteem about as fiercely as they do wealth. The pursuit of these other goods can lead economically comfortable people to support progressive reforms, even if they have no crass material or political incentives to do so. In fact, as economic growth satiates many rich people's financial desires, we would expect them to start putting greater weight on postmaterial concerns — which, in many cases, will mean advocating for greater social and economic equality.

Still, elites' strong incentive to maintain the economic cooperation and political loyalty of ordinary workers surely made democratization easier. It is not a coincidence that the past two centuries of egalitarian progress has coincided with a sharp increase in the market value of human labor — and thus, the bargaining power of human workers.

AGI threatens to kick all these trends into reverse.

For a preview of fully automated neofeudalism, look to the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Or at least that's what the AI entrepreneurs Luke Drago and Rudolf Laine advised earlier this year in an essay titled “Defining the Intelligence Curse.”

As Drago and Laine note, Congo is rich in natural resources. The nation holds substantial oil reserves and about $24 trillion in mineral wealth. Yet Congo is among the five poorest nations on the planet, with more than 70 percent of its people living on less than $2.15 per day.

This dissonant combination of commodity wealth and mass poverty is not unusual. To the contrary, large resource endowments appear to correlate with slower economic growth and higher corruption — a phenomenon that economists and political scientists have dubbed “the resource curse.”

Scholars have attributed this paradox to many different factors. But Drago and Laine emphasize one in particular: Large commodity endowments can reduce elites' incentives to increase ordinary workers' productivity.

Vast energy or mineral deposits provide investors with a ready source of profits — and states, with an easy source of revenue. The former don't have to hazard capital on complex production processes to secure returns, while the latter need not bother with the headaches of forming competent tax collection services, the fiscal costs of developing a skilled labor force, or the political risks of cultivating an educated populace and diverse economy with competing power centers. Oligarchs and public officials can just feather their beds with commodity revenues instead.

According to Drago and Laine, AGI could fuel an even more extreme version of this dynamic. With the aid of superintelligent robots, the theory goes, capitalists won't need to curry favor with pesky workers in order to turn a profit. And states won't rely on ordinary people for tax revenue. To the contrary, as machines condemn most workers to perpetual unemployment, governments will have few funding sources beyond the windfall profits of corporations. The typical person's economic leverage over public and private powers will be kaput. And states and businesses will have little material incentive to invest in their education or well-being.

In autocratic petrostates, ordinary people can still exert some influence over elites through the tacit threat of revolt. According to some political scientists, fears of inciting a popular rebellion constrain the abuses of kleptocracies, compelling some to fund substantial social benefits.

But Drago and Laine argue that, after AGI, mass publics are liable to lose even this timeless check on oppression. In a world of super-intelligent drones and AI-powered surveillance, they worry, governments will need the consent of trivially few humans to maintain an effective monopoly on violence.

Perhaps, the sheer force of enlightenment ideals or humanitarian fellow feeling will lead the powerful to share the wealth in such a society, anyway. But the behavior of many American tech billionaires and public officials today — when they still depend on ordinary workers for their keep — doesn't inspire much confidence.

If we can't depend on the kindness of oligarchs, what can preserve ordinary people's power in the face of AI progress?

To economists like Erik Brynjolfsson and Daron Acemoglu, part of the answer is encouraging the development of artificial intelligence that augments labor rather than replacing it. AI tools could plausibly lift wages by making workers more productive. In theory, such innovations could safeguard laborers' economic leverage and promote a more equitable model of growth. Unfortunately, in this account, the tech industry's obsession with AGI has inclined it to focus overwhelmingly on labor-automating machines, rather than the labor-augmenting variety.

Brynjolfsson and Acemoglu contend that the government exacerbates this tendency by taxing capital at a lower rate than labor, thereby incentivizing automation. But they also see a role for entrepreneurs to develop the labor-augmenting technologies that large labs are neglecting. This is what Drago and Laine have sought to do with their own startup.

If AGI ever becomes technically feasible, however, the economic incentives to adopt it will be overwhelming; Well-intentioned entrepreneurs are unlikely to beat it back. In that scenario, our best bet for fending off techno-feudalism will be institutional reform.

The more equitably we distribute capital ownership before AGI devalues human labor, the less oligarchic a fully automated economy is liable to be. And the more democratically accountable we make our government, the better ordinary people's chances of constraining elites through the exercise of political power, even as their economic leverage erodes.

The “resource curse” is a common trap. But it isn't an inevitable one. Norway is an exceptionally oil-rich country, with fossil fuels generating a quarter of government revenues. Yet it is also among the most prosperous and equal nations on the planet.

The Norwegians' immunity from the resource curse has a simple explanation. By the time Norway discovered its major oil reserves in 1969, it had already established one of the world's most egalitarian social orders. When processed through the nation's social democratic institutions, the emergence of a vast new source of inanimate wealth didn't yield windfall rents for plutocrats but rather a sovereign wealth fund that bankrolls generous pensions for ordinary Norwegians.

If we can get our political economy in better shape, advanced AI could deliver similarly broad benefits to future Americans. “The very principle of technological progress is that the economy can do more with less,” Korinek said in our interview. “It means you can have more output, more wealth, more goods and services that people can consume. The big question is how will those goods and services be distributed. But the good thing is that, in principle, since we have more, everybody could actually be made better off.”

We can build a highly automated economy in which everyone can flourish — even the obsolete authors of sprawling, self-referential “explainer” journalism. We just need to develop healthy political and economic institutions.

Granted, at the moment, doing that looks about as hard as building a God out of silicon.

Malala Yousafzai and Greta Thunberg's unlikely stan war, explained.

You probably never thought you'd see Malala Yousafzai lip-syncing to a 4 Non Blondes/Nicki Minaj mash-up on TikTok with Jimmy Fallon. And yet the Nobel Peace Prize winner has spent the past couple of months churning out this sort of uncanny, “normie” content on social media. If anything, she's aware of the irony. “Not me becoming chronically online,” she captioned one of her latest Instagram posts.

Outside of making content, Yousafzai recently appeared at a New York Liberty game, talked to celebrity whisperer Jay Shetty, and has gone on a number of talk shows and podcasts. The Pakistani education activist is currently promoting her newly released memoir, Finding My Way, in which she grapples with her rise to prominence after surviving being shot in the head by a Taliban gunman at 11 years old while returning home from morning classes. But the 28-year-old has been evolving into a media impresario for some years now, producing films — one of which was Oscar-nominated — and a musical with Hillary Clinton.

Yousafzai is not the only icon of progressive girlhood whose image has gone through an evolution. There's also Greta Thunberg. On October 2, the 22-year-old Swedish climate activist, whose focus has recently shifted to the genocide in Gaza, was reportedly detained by Israeli forces, along with more than 400 people, while on a flotilla mission delivering aid to Palestinians. Thunberg and other witnesses allege that Israeli soldiers dragged her by her hair, barely gave her food and water, and forced her to kiss the Israeli flag while in captivity. Thunberg and other detainees were deported to Greece days later.

Seeing two of the biggest names in activism in two very different places in their careers — one on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and one on the front lines of a humanitarian crisis — has generated a lot of commentary online, resulting in something of a stan war between their respective supporters. To many, it seems like Yousafzai and Thunberg have come to represent two opposing activist tropes: the sellout and the true revolutionary, respectively.

Pitting a firmly liberal activist against an anti-establishment figure in a fake online beef may seem like a time-wasting and reductive exercise. Still, the response to Yousafzai and Thunberg's diverging second acts shows how expectations for young, progressive leaders have changed in our unsettled and increasingly authoritarian political age. Thunberg is the leftist action hero Gen Z seems to be clamoring for, while Yousafzai has become a cringy relic of the Obama years.

Yousafzai has faced plenty of scrutiny and questions lately about her integrity as an activist, especially when it comes to her affiliations with certain Western leaders.

She received backlash last April, after the announcement that she would be co-producing Suffs, a Broadway musical about the suffragette movement, with Clinton. After all, the former secretary of state oversaw drone strikes in Pakistan that killed civilians, and when Yousafzai visited the White House in 2013, she expressed her concerns over the attacks to President Barack Obama. More than a decade later, critics see Yousafzai's new partnership with Clinton as hypocritical.

The optics got worse for Yousafzai after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023. Clinton, a longtime and well-documented supporter of the Israeli government, pushed back against early calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, a position that directly contradicted progressives in the United States, European leaders, and Yousafzai herself, who demanded a ceasefire in the days after the attacks.

But because she highlighted the suffering of both Palestinian and Israeli children, Yousafzai was swiftly accused of “both siding” the issue by failing to directly acknowledge the power imbalance Palestinians faced after Israel's invasion and occupation.

Yousafzai's initial response to the October 7 attacks doesn't paint a complete picture of her posture toward Gaza, however. Her Malala Fund donated money to children in the war-torn region prior to 2023, and following the Suffs controversy, she reiterated her support of the people in Gaza and directly addressed the genocide.

“I have and will continue to condemn the Israeli government for its violations of international law and war crimes,” Yousafzai posted on X. In a May British GQ profile, she reflected on the backlash she's received over Gaza, arguing the limits of providing public statements on social issues and claiming that there's “a lot more you can do.”

At home in Pakistan, Yousafzai's reputation has been much more complicated since becoming a global icon. While she's been deified as a sort of girlboss hero in the West, in her home of Pakistan, she's been the target of antagonism, erasure, and even conspiracy theories, stemming from the notion that she's a puppet for Western imperial interests.

It's important to remember, too, that Yousafzai ended up on the global stage unwittingly. As she discusses in her book, she hasn't been in control of her own narrative since she was a child.

Criticism of Yousafzai happened to reach a boiling point — fueled by people seeing her on TikToks and reading about her weed use in college — at the same time that reports of Greta Thunberg's detainment in Gaza emerged. Over the past month, remarks like “Greta Thunberg is what Malala thinks she is” and comparisons of their recent endeavors have been all over X and TikTok.

“I went down a bunch of these accounts and what I found…was that many of them were what I would call stan accounts,” says Ryan Broderick, editor-in-chief of Garbage Day, an internet culture newsletter. “It looked to me like very young people without any real background in politics effectively treating Greta and Malala like you would Sabrina Carpenter or Taylor Swift.”

The juxtaposition is striking. In 2018, Thunberg gained worldwide attention for staging a strike, refusing to go to school for three weeks while sitting outside of the Swedish Parliament ahead of the country's general election in order to draw attention to the global climate crisis. Thunberg vowed to strike each Friday until Sweden agreed to follow the Paris climate agreement, inspiring other “Future for Fridays” protests around the globe.

World leaders and organizations, including the British Parliament and the United Nations, quickly recognized and celebrated Thunberg's demonstrations. In 2019, Time named her Person of the Year. But her rise to prominence wasn't uncomplicated. Some critics saw her as emblematic of white privilege in activist spaces — a daughter of two famous parents who got accolades that other activists, especially ones of color, were denied.

Over the years, Thunberg has seemingly proved her activist bonafides to the public, refraining from extracurricular activities and remaining a radical voice on the left. From the Saharawi refugee crisis to factory workers' rights to the Israeli government's recent war crimes, her causes have become a lot less palatable or easily co-opted by the liberal establishment.

At a time when radical ideas and leftist figures are becoming more mainstream, however, it makes sense that Thunberg would be the more appealing public figure at the moment, according to Broderick. After all, Yousafzai is working directly with the liberal, institutional figures who are, in many ways, responsible for pushing folks further to the left.

“I think that [Greta's activism] is a better fit for a more militant, radicalized political space,” Broderick says. “I'm not downplaying [Malala's work]. It is just activism of a very different kind, and ultimately, happened in a different world.”

There's a certain absurdity to the pitting of Yousafzai against Thunberg. After all, these two are not pop stars. They're not competing for a number one spot on the charts. While online fights over Yousafzai and Thunberg's second acts show how people on the left are demanding more from progressive leaders, this manufactured contest is also just another example of how stan culture has rotted our relationship with politics.

The president hates EVs. But his policies are making gas cars more expensive too.

As President Donald Trump sees it, environmental regulations that attempt to improve efficiency and address climate change only make products more expensive and perform worse. He has long blamed efficiency regulations for his frustrations with things like toilets and showerheads. He began his second term in office to “unleash prosperity through deregulation.”

But there's at least one big way that American companies and households may end up paying more, not less, for the president's anti-environment policy moves.

If you're in the market for a vehicle, you've probably noticed: cars are getting more expensive. Kelley Blue Book reported that the average sticker price for a new car topped $50,000 for the first time in September.

And they aren't just getting more expensive to buy; cars are getting more expensive to own. For most Americans, gasoline is their single-largest energy expenditure, around $2,930 per household each year on average.

While a more efficient dishwasher, light bulb, or faucet may have a higher sticker price up front — especially as manufacturers adjust to new rules — cars, appliances, solar panels, and electronics can more than pay for themselves with lower operating costs over their lifetimes. And Trump's agenda of suddenly rolling back efficiency rules has simultaneously made it harder for many industries to do business while raising costs for ordinary Americans.

No one knows this better than the US auto industry, which has whiplashed between competing environmental regulations for over a decade.

President Barack Obama tightened vehicle efficiency and pollution standards. In his first term, Trump loosened them. President Joe Biden reinstated and strengthened them. Now Trump is reversing course again — leaving the $1.6 trillion US auto industry unsure what turn to take next.



In July, the Environmental Protection Agency began undoing a foundational legal basis that lets the agency limit climate pollution from cars. Without it, the EPA has far less power to require automakers to manufacture cleaner vehicles, which hampers efforts to reduce one of the single biggest sources of carbon emissions.

Trump's deregulation push could cost drivers more. By weakening fuel efficiency and pollution rules, the administration is setting up consumers to spend more on gasoline and vehicle maintenance — the opposite of what Trump says he's aiming for.

Automakers hate the whiplash. Constantly shifting climate rules — from Obama to Trump to Biden and back — have made it nearly impossible for car companies to plan, adding costs that get passed on to buyers.

Rolling back standards means locking in pricier, dirtier cars for longer. Energy analysts estimate households could spend an extra $310 billion on fuel by 2050 as efficiency progress stalls.

The US is falling behind. While Europe and China double down on electric vehicles, Trump's policies discourage EV investment.

The big picture: Policies meant to “save money” are instead locking Americans into higher energy bills, costlier cars, and a slower transition to cleaner, cheaper technology.

Trump's Transportation secretary, Sean P. Duffy, said in a statement over the summer that these moves “will lower vehicle costs and ensure the American people can purchase the cars they want.”

But in reality, the shift may have the opposite effect.That's because when the rules change every few years, automakers struggle to meet existing benchmarks and can't plan ahead. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group representing companies like Ford, Toyota, and Volkswagen, sent a letter to the EPA in September saying that the administration's moves and the repeal of incentives for electric cars mean that the current car pollution rules established under Biden and stretching out to 2027 “are simply not achievable.” The Trump administration responded by zeroing out any penalties for violations — but the industry is already planning for a post-Trump world where rules could drastically change yet again.

Because it takes years and billions of dollars to develop new cars that comply with stricter rules, carmakers would prefer if regulations stayed put one way or the other. Every rule change adds time and expense to the development lifecycle, which ultimately gets baked into a car's price tag.

Changing rules are also vexing for electric car makers, whose models are gaining traction both in the US and around the world, even as the Trump administration has ended tax incentives for EVs. Trump is making things even more difficult by pulling support for domestic battery production that would help US car companies build electric cars.

It all adds up to a huge headache for the industry. “Particularly in the last six months, I think ‘chaos' is a good word because they're getting hit from every angle,” said David Cooke, senior associate director at the Center for Automotive Research at Ohio State University.

And all that uncertainty is making cars more expensive to buy and run, with even more expensive long-term consequences for people's health and the environment.

As the government relaxes efficiency targets, progress will stall and car buyers will get stuck with cars that cost more to operate.

Energy Innovation, a think tank, found that repealing tailpipe standards could cost households an extra $310 billion by 2050, mainly through more spending on gasoline. Undoing the standards would also increase air pollution and shrink the job market for US electric vehicle manufacturing due to lower demand.

Even the Trump administration's own analysis of the effects of undoing the EPA's greenhouse gas emissions regulations found that his moves would drive up gasoline prices due to more fuel consumption from less efficient vehicles.

“Repealing these standards in particular would set America back decades,” said Sara Baldwin, senior director for electrification at Energy Innovation.

While the Trump administration shifts gears, other countries are racing ahead. Automakers can design electric cars faster than conventional internal combustion-powered vehicles, since EVs generally have fewer components, and manufacturers don't have to worry about designing pollution controls to meet tightening restrictions. Since EVs are mechanically simpler, they also need less maintenance. Conventional cars, by contrast, typically take around five years to go from the drawing board to dealer lots, so the gasoline-powered cars being designed now won't come out until 2030 — when someone else will be in the White House.

The US auto industry also serves other countries. Markets like Europe are holding fast to their environmental regulations and are looking to ban the sales of internal combustion vehicles altogether. Meanwhile, China is making some of the cheapest and most popular EVs in the world.

That's why some American carmakers are setting their sights beyond US shores and are continuing to bet on more EVs. Earlier this year, Ford announced that it was developing a $30,000 electric pickup truck for the US and for export, a sign the company sees huge potential in cheap electric cars despite the Trump administration's efforts to pump the brakes on electrics.

Though car companies often grumble about the expenses and effort they have to expend when environmental regulations become stricter, regulatory uncertainty continues to be a much bigger nuisance. “These changes in regulations are really disruptive to the industry and are hurting our global economic competitiveness,” said Gregory Keoleian, co-director of the Center for Sustainable Systems at the University of Michigan. “It's not only hurting in terms of setting us back with regard to decarbonization of the transportation sector, but the cost to consumers in the United States.”

Creditors have a new obsession.

Next time you're turned down for a loan because of a low credit score, you might find that your rejection comes with a caveat. The lender is willing to reconsider — if you just let them see inside your bank account.

Across the country, financial companies are racing to get a look at your checking account, hoping it'll fill in the gaps left by credit scores, which only take into consideration certain debt and loan information, such as missed payments, credit card balances and limits, opened and closed accounts, bankruptcies, and collections.

In this new world of “open banking,” lenders no longer need to settle for just the data that appears on a credit report. They can now analyze all of your day-to-day transactions, your recurring payments and deposits, and the trajectory of your account balance. And they do it live — recalibrating your creditworthiness as your assets rise or fall.

Lenders, landlords, and credit bureaus insist that hoarding bank account data will help them expand access to credit. But the problem is that not everyone will benefit from turning over their bank accounts to creditors. And while open banking is optional for now — and you can opt out of live connection with your bank at any time — the technology is gaining traction, with major credit bureaus, mortgage companies, and smaller lenders embracing the trend. It isn't hard to imagine that one day lenders will view opting out as a sign you have something to hide.

When you apply for a loan, a lender pulls your credit report from one of the three major credit bureaus — Experian, Equifax, or TransUnion. These credit bureaus also typically sell your credit score, which is calculated by two other private companies, FICO and VantageScore, using that underlying credit bureau data. (VantageScore is jointly owned by the three credit bureaus; FICO is independent.)

It's a complicated system. Basically, what's important to know is that credit bureaus have immense amounts of data on you — but there are notable gaps. Credit bureaus only receive limited information from Buy Now, Pay Later companies, for instance, even though BNPL loans represent about 17 percent of all unsecured consumer debt. They often can't track multiple income streams, if someone is a gig worker or freelancer; they also can't see cases where workers are regularly getting wage advances. Most importantly, credit bureaus have no way of knowing how much money you have on hand.

To creditors, a checking account can therefore feel like a silver bullet. Suddenly, through your expense and deposit history, all of those hidden debts and payments become visible. Lenders will see if a borrower has thousands of dollars in wealth squared away, if they receive side income from a dog-walking app or a DJ career. Lenders particularly scrutinize your “recurring expenses,” like the size and frequency of your rent and utility payments, and your overall cash flow, said Kelly Thompson Cochran, deputy director of the research firm FinRegLab. Ashley Knight, a senior vice president at Experian, the largest credit bureau in America, told me that many lenders want to know how much money you bring in each month. “How much is it? How frequent is it? Stability of that is where lenders are looking.”

The quest to profitably lend to more Americans, including those with low credit scores, has pushed a wide swath of companies to embrace open banking. In the last three years, mortgage and auto lenders like Rocket Mortgage and Zillow have started requesting read-only access to the bank accounts of people they might otherwise reject because of low credit scores. AT&T has used bank data to make decisions about lease-to-own phone and other device installment plans, and so have credit unions like Pennsylvania's Inspire Federal Credit Union. Some fintech companies, like the credit card issuer Petal, are basing most of their credit decisions on the data pulled from an applicant's bank account; the lender Varo claims that 90 percent of its loans are granted or denied based on the same process.

In June, Experian announced that it was going to start selling lenders a “Cashflow Score,” based entirely on data from bank accounts. With a borrower's permission, Experian will analyze the overall account balance, expenses, and direct deposit income across a two-year period, and then generate a score measuring their creditworthiness. (The Cashflow Score program is new, but Experian told me that 17 million users have connected their bank accounts to similar Experian programs.)

Giving a lender or a landlord an automatic view of your bank account might improve your credit score, but it is also welcoming an ominous amount of surveillance into your daily financial life.

And in September, PayPal announced that bank data was helping it decide which customers to approve for Buy Now, Pay Later loans, making it one of the highest-profile companies yet to embrace the idea that your bank account can say as much about your likelihood to repay a loan as your credit score.

Over 100 million Americans have already granted permission to one of these third parties to access their checking accounts, according to a 2023 report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Most of those connections probably involve Venmo or Cash App; only a small portion of those 100 million people have likely greenlit use of their bank account for credit decisioning. Still, while it's hard to quantify how many lenders are giving up bank access for credit decisions, “we know it's going up,” said Cochran.

Bank data is even beginning to filter down into credit scores. While the Cashflow Score that Experian produces is not the same as a traditional credit score, both FICO and VantageScore, the two makers of credit scores in the US, now offer scoring algorithms that incorporate bank account data. You have to opt into these services, but if you do, your daily purchases and payments will start nudging your score up or down.

For Americans with thin (or poor) credit histories, turning over your bank account could be a way of, say, making a debt that went to collections look a little less bad. “Having cash flow data that is up to the moment can be a really helpful supplement,” Cochran said. “It's showing other parts of their finances beyond just how they repay their existing credit lines.

It's not far-fetched: A study from the Urban Institute suggested that a little under 20 percent of people who were originally denied mortgages might have been approved if bank account data, including rental payment history, were factored into their applications.

Giving a lender or a landlord an automatic view of your bank account might improve your credit score, but it is also welcoming an ominous amount of surveillance into your daily financial life. What will happen to your credit score if your income changes — say, you lose a freelance gig — and your cash flow is suddenly reduced? How will you think differently about a big purchase if you know that a lender will be scrutinizing your overall bank balance?

Let's say you lose a critical income stream or a freelance gig—allowing access to your bank account might actually make you look worse. “It is true that you might improve the outcome for individuals,” Raúl Carrillo, an assistant law professor at Boston College Law School, told me. But some of the claims of the industry, “like ‘we're going to solve the racial wealth gap,' seem pretty far-fetched to me.”

For now, lenders seem focused only on top-line data points, like monthly cash flow. Plaid, a fintech company that connects lenders to bank accounts, specifically estimates for lenders how much money you bring in (or lose) each month. But there are few hard limits on the data they can use to set interest rates or make loan decisions.

“Lenders are always looking for new sources,” Michelle Young, credit product lead at Plaid, told me. Recently, Young asked a group of customers what kind of alternative data they were most interested in for assessing creditworthiness. “They were like, ‘Everything,'” Young said. The industry is almost entirely unregulated, with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's open banking rule — devised during the Biden administration, then scrapped and quickly revived during the Trump administration — now undergoing public comment. The new rule might not set any limits on the types of information that creditors can use for underwriting.

Few lenders seem to be basing loan decisions on the specific items you purchase, but they could — and, historically, they have. In 2008, American Express cut customers' credit lines in part because of their shopping histories. Cardholders found that they had lost access to credit because, according to the credit card company, they had shopped at similar stores as people with “poor repayment history with American Express,” among other factors. Around the same time, the now-defunct credit card company CompuCredit cut credit lines when customers spent money on products it associated with credit risk, like “cash advances, marital or personal counseling, tire retreading and car repairs, pawn shops, direct marketing merchants, and certain types of entertainment.”

With live access to your bank account, your basic day-to-day behaviors could be used against you. With a lender overseeing their checking account, it isn't hard to imagine someone skipping over an important purchase for fear it will damage their credit. For lenders, everything is fair game. “The ethos is data maximization,” Carrillo said. “The model is, collect as much data as possible and sift through it on the back end.”

The debate over youth gender identity polling, explained.

Are young Americans becoming less likely to identify as trans?

This claim is getting a lot of attention on social media after two researchers published survey data appearing to show a shift in youth gender identity.

The first analysis came from Eric Kaufmann, a Canadian professor of politics at the University of Buckingham in the United Kingdom, and a longtime anti-PC and anti-”woke” crusader. In early October, Kaufmann published a report titled “The Decline of Trans and Queer Identity Among Young Americans.”

“The transgender share among university students peaked in 2023 and has almost halved since, from nearly 7 percent to under 4 percent,” Kaufmann writes in that report.

A few days later, Jean Twenge, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University, posted on X that “trans identification really is in free fall among the young,” citing data from the Cooperative Election Study, a long-running survey of voting behavior and public opinion. Unlike Kaufmann, Twenge is known most recently for relatively apolitical work on kids and smartphones.

Several scholars have raised significant methodological questions about Twenge's and Kaufmann's work, which has not been peer-reviewed or published in academic journals. The Williams Institute, a think tank at the UCLA School of Law that has studied the number of Americans identifying as transgender since 2011, has not seen a similar drop in its data.

The debate has bigger implications for trans rights. Social conservatives have already touted Kaufmann and Twenge's work as evidence that trans people have ceased to exist, or that trans identity has always been suspect. “Transgenderism is effectively over. We destroyed it,” right-wing podcaster Matt Walsh posted on X in response to Kaufmann's report.

At the same time, accurate data is important for representation, scholars and activists say. If trans people aren't counted in surveys, “it almost leads to a sense of isolation,” Marlin Xie, an 18-year-old activist with the nonprofit Advocates for Youth, told me. “It's almost like there are less of my community that I can go to for support.”

The entire conversation is happening at a time of enormous stigma against trans people, coming from the highest levels of government. Donald Trump made anti-trans messaging a core part of his second presidential campaign and, since taking office again, has taken swift action to restrict trans people's access to gender-affirming care and public facilities; meanwhile, prominent Democrats have walked back support for trans rights in an effort to win back Trump voters. Among their many other effects, these statements and policies could make it harder for researchers to get a clear picture of trans communities.

To understand current debates around youth gender identity and why they matter, it's helpful to understand a little more about Kaufmann and Twenge's work.

Let's start with Kaufmann. His new report draws from a few data sources, including Brown University student polling and surveys of undergraduates at major research universities conducted by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression over the past five years. In those data sets, Kaufmann finds that the share of young people “not identifying as male or female” has dropped significantly between 2023 and 2025. He also finds a corresponding drop in youth identifying with sexual orientations other than heterosexual.

“It appears that trans and queer are going out of fashion among young people, especially in elite settings,” Kaufmann writes.

Several journalists have raised questions about Kaufmann's statistical analysis, but probably the most basic criticism of his report concerns what he's measuring. The data sources he uses don't actually ask if people identify as trans; instead, they ask for gender identity, offering options like male, female, or nonbinary. Kaufmann appears to have grouped together respondents who selected options other than male or female and counted those respondents as trans.

This method leaves out the many trans people who identify as male or female; being trans and being nonbinary are not the same. Kaufmann told me in an email that “not identifying as male or female” was an appropriate proxy for trans identity because “trans includes non-binary (this is the position of trans movement organizations).” He argues that even if his method doesn't measure all trans people, it's an appropriate way to measure trends, because “non-binary is a gateway between identifying with birth sex and identifying with the opposite gender in a binary way.” If nonbinary identification decreases, he says, trans identification will decrease too.

However, other researchers have studied trans identity specifically, without relying on such proxy categories. In a 2025 report, the Williams Institute found that 3.3 percent of 13- to 17-year-olds in the US and 2.7 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds, identified as trans. In 2022, those figures were 1.4 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively.

“We have not seen a decline in identification as transgender among the youth or young adults, or adults overall,” Jody Herman, a senior scholar at the Williams Institute, told me.

It's also worth noting that Kaufmann's anti-”woke” stance could give his analyses an ideological bent. He launched the University of Buckingham's Center for Heterodox Social Science, which published his youth gender-identity report, specifically to counter what he saw as “woke” ideas around race and gender. In a Substack post in 2024, he wrote that “the social sciences and humanities have been skewed for decades because of the dominance of the left among the professoriate,” and that the center's goal was “to form the kernel of an alternative social science in Britain, the only non-progressive social sciences centre in the country.”

Kaufmann told me that he doesn't believe the center's mission biases his analyses, and that “ultimately with viewpoint diversity, academic freedom and a common and agreed set of scientific objective evidentiary rules, the best arguments win out.”

“The Centre is about rebalancing the social sciences,” Kaufmann said. “I wouldn't want an end to progressive social science, but the problem is we don't have the other side represented.”

Now let's look at Twenge's analysis, which uses data from the Cooperative Election Study, a large survey based at Tufts University that asks both demographic and policy questions. This study does include a question directly asking respondents whether they identify as trans, and Twenge reports a large drop among 18- to 22-year-olds, from over 5.5 percent identifying as trans in 2021 to just over 3 percent saying the same in 2024.

Twenge's conclusions have also come in for criticism, however. Brian Schaffner, a political science professor at Tufts who co-directs the Cooperative Election Study, posted on X that Twenge had neglected to include the margins for error in her results. Taking those into account, the 2021 share of youth identifying as trans could be anywhere from 3.8 percent to 8.3 percent, and the 2024 share could be anywhere from 2.1 percent to 4.8 percent. That means it's possible that trans identification fell between 2021 and 2024, but it may have held steady, or it may have even increased slightly.

Twenge told me in an email that when she calculated the margins of error, she got different numbers from Schaffner that still show a clear decline; Schaffner replied that she was using the wrong methods for her analysis.

“We need to have a little caution around these numbers,” Schaffner told me.

Beyond debates over proxies and margins of error, it's important to take a wider look at why these numbers matter. Social conservatives and critics of trans inclusion have taken Kaufmann and Twenge's analyses as evidence that trans identity is “over” or perhaps never existed in the first place. To them, the studies are proof of their prior opinions that trans identity is a fad or a form of leftist indoctrination. These arguments have been used to restrict trans people's medical care and access to schools and other facilities.

It is possible to study the demographics of gender identity in a rigorous way, and some trans rights activists support that study. At the same time, many caution that this research could become more difficult in an environment of deep stigma against trans people.

During the second Trump administration, trans Americans have seen a near-constant march of restrictions targeting their health care, education, military service, travel, and more. “It has been very challenging to maintain hope and have the capacity to support others through this back-to-back-to-back-to-back bad news,” Xie, the 18-year-old, told me.

Given all this, it is possible that analyses like Twenge's and Kaufmann's, despite their potential problems, are picking up on something real: a reluctance to identify as trans to researchers. Again, the Williams Institute has not seen the effects of such reluctance in their data. But it could be popping up in other surveys. After all, researchers may not even be able to measure gender identity directly — what they measure is “people's willingness to disclose their identity on a survey,” Herman said.

Young people in particular might be fearful of sharing their gender identity, since they are highly aware of government surveillance efforts and the potential of hacks that could expose private data, Xie said: “Why would you want to give someone that knowledge, that information, when you don't know how it will be used against you?”

With all that in mind, we may still see more fluctuations in surveys of gender identity over the coming years. Some of those surveys, depending on their quality, could tell us something about the language people are using to describe themselves, or about how comfortable they feel describing themselves at all. But they will not tell us that trans people, who have been part of societies around the world, likely for thousands of years, are “over.”

As Herman put it, “trans people have existed, they will exist, they have always existed.”

CEO of Palantir Technologies Alex Karp called the defense and data behemoth ""the first company to be completely anti-woke"" during an earnings call on Monday.

Karp lauded those who work for Palantir as supporting free speech and ""fighting for the right side of what should work in this country — meritocracy, lethal technology."" He said that these values have helped the company — which makes software for companies and the US government — ""give normal Americans venture-quality results.""

Palantir reported nearly $1.2 billion in revenue, a 63% bump since last year, for the period ended in September, the company said in a statement on Monday, citing ""accelerating and otherworldly growth."" Its US commercial revenue more than doubled in the last year, up 121% to $397 million, and US government revenue grew 52% to $486 million. (""These are arguably the best results that any software company has ever delivered,"" Karp said on the earnings call. ""That's not hyperbolic."")

Over the past year, Silicon Valley has come to embrace anti-wokeness and President Donald Trump. Tech leaders, including OpenAI's Sam Altman and Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, extolled the president at a White House dinner earlier this fall. In October, Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, a competitor of Palantir, called on Trump to deploy the National Guard to San Francisco, although he walked back the remarks days later.

""We power ICE,"" Karp said on Monday. ""We've supported Israel. Okay, these are very controversial. I don't know why this is all controversial, but many people find that controversial.""

On the earnings call, Karp said he makes ""sure Palantir stays as tribal and cultish and unique as it was 20 years ago"" by recruiting ""the right people.""

The cult of Palantir isn't without its fair share of discourse and discomfort: The company's communications chief, Lisa Gordon, a self-proclaimed Democrat, called Palantir's political shift toward Trump ""concerning"" in an interview at a summit hosted by tech news site The Information in late October. (The Information later removed videos of Gordon's interview from its social media accounts, CNBC reported.)

Karp didn't pull any punches on Monday's call, asking for more border scrutiny and a refocus on so-called ""average poor"" Americans.

""If Fentanyl was killing 60,000 Yale grads, instead of 60,000 working class people, we'd be dropping a nuclear bomb on whoever was sending it from South America,"" Karp said. ""At Palantir, we are on the side of the average American who sometimes gets screwed because all the empathy goes to elite people, and none of it goes to the people actually dying on our streets. And that's why, when you have an open border, it means that the average poor American earns less.""

Karp backed former Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign in 2024.

In his shareholder letter, Karp also preached a ""return to a shared national experience"" and an ""embrace of a common identity.""

""It is and was a mistake to casually proclaim the equality of all cultures and cultural values,"" he wrote, without expounding upon which cultures he was referring to. ""Some have proven to be wondrous and generative. Others destructive and deeply regressive. And an even greater mistake is to believe that we could or should convert the world to our way of living.""

""Big Short"" investor Michael Burry backed his market bubble warning with big money.

Burry's hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, made massive bearish wagers using put options — contracts that rise in value when share prices fall — on Nvidia and Palantir Technologies, according to a regulatory filing released Monday for the quarter ending September 30.

Scion disclosed puts on 1 million Nvidia shares and 5 million Palantir shares with notional values of $187 million and $912 million, respectively.

Scion didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider sent outside regular business hours. The filing shows trades from the last quarter, and Scion's current holdings may differ from the disclosure.

Burry's wagers came on the back of massive stock gains for Nvidia and Palantir, fueled by investor euphoria for artificial intelligence.

Nvidia, the AI chip giant and the world's first company to hit a $5 trillion market cap, has jumped 54% this year, extending a three-year surge fueled by demand for AI hardware. The stock closed 2.2% higher on Monday.

Meanwhile, Palantir, the AI-powered data analytics company, has skyrocketed 174% this year amid a boom in AI and defense spending. The stock closed 3.4% higher on Monday, then fell 4.3% in after-hours trading, after it reported earnings.

Scion held no positions in either company during the previous quarter, signaling a pivot in Burry's portfolio.

The filing came just days after Burry broke a long silence on X with a warning.

""Sometimes, we see bubbles,"" he wrote in a post. ""Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play.""

Burry rose to fame for predicting and profiting from the US housing market crash of 2008. His massive bet against the housing bubble at the time was featured in the book and movie ""The Big Short.""

Scion's latest disclosure lands amid intensifying debate over whether the AI boom has pushed stock valuations into bubble territory as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes surge to record highs.

While Burry placed bets against Nvidia and Palantir, he purchased call options on oilfield services company Halliburton and pharma giant Pfizer.

In the latest quarter, Scion also held shares in activewear maker Lululemon, scientific instruments maker Bruker, health insurer Molina Healthcare, and lender SLM Corp, also known as Sallie Mae.

Scion's US stock portfolio held eight positions as of the end of September, down from 15 at the end of June. The firm managed about $155 million as of March, per its latest regulatory filing.

The AI trade is taking a hit on Tuesday.

Fears that valuations in the tech sector have reached unsustainable levels ratcheted up on Tuesday after Palantir stock tumbled following its third-quarter earnings report, despite solid results and upbeat guidance. The AI software giant beat estimates for the last three-month period, pulling $1.18 billion in revenue, ahead of the expected $1.09 billion.

But shares were down as much as 9% in the morning, before paring their losses to trade around 7% lower. Other leaders in the AI trade sold off in tandem, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 was down more than 1%.

The S&P 500 dropped 1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 180 points. Bond yields dipped as traders shifted to risk-off mode. The 10-year Treasury yield was down one basis point to 4.09%.

Here were the other tech stocks that were selling off on Tuesday:

Doubts are swirling around whether some companies have seen valuations go too far too fast, and whether firms will be able to deliver on their AI ambitions after spending billions on the technology.

Palantir's forward price-to-earnings ratio hovered around 240x a Tuesday morning. That compares to Nvidia, which has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of around 29.

Also weighing on sentiment on Tuesday were comments from top banking executives, who said that the risk of a market correction is rising. Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon both pointed to risks that the market could see a correction of up to 20%. Pick, however, added that he didn't see this as a negative event necessarily.

""We should also welcome the possibility that there would be drawdowns, 10 to 15% drawdowns that are not driven by some sort of macro cliff effect,"" he said at the Global Financial Leaders Investment Summit in Hong Kong.

Markets have also been uneasy about the return on investment on AI so far, JPMorgan's Market Intelligence desk wrote in a note on Tuesday. Analyst said that clients have been concerned about narrow market breadth, adding that ""there is a global risk off tone.""

The endless hype around the technology itself might also be starting to wane.

""Some are doubting whether AI can possibly live up to the hype in terms of future returns,"" David Morrison, a senior market analyst at Trade Nation, wrote in a note about Tuesday's sell-off.

The AI trade has flashed other warning signs in recent weeks. Shares of Meta and Microsoft tumbled after the firms said they would boost capex spending plans, a sign investors are growing skeptical over the buckets of cash being poured into AI.

Meanwhile, ""The Big Short"" investor Michael Burry recently revealed a bet against Palantir and Nvidia on Monday, adding to the selling pressure in the tech sector.

It isn't the first round of volatility for Palantir, which plummeted around 40% from its early-year peak through April amid the broader market selloff. Shares declined another 18% from mid-August through their low in September after the short-seller Andrew Left said he was taking a bet against the company.

This all comes at a time when the market is also waking up to the reality that more rate cuts might not be a sure thing. Jerome Powell said exactly that at the Fed's October meeting last week, and the outlook has grown muddled, especially as the government shutdown forces markets to operate in a data blackout.

Palantir is proud of its ""disciplined"" hiring practices.

The defense tech company reported earnings that beat estimates on Monday, and CEO Alex Karp touted Palantir's approach to talent recruitment in his shareholder letter.

Karp notes that while the company has ""grown quite significantly,"" it has kept to its ""constraints.""

""Our head count is one manifestation of this disciplined approach,"" Karp wrote in the letter to shareholders. ""The casual expansion of our ranks would have diminished the need to lean even more heavily on the strength of our software and the Ontology and to ensure their continued maturation.

""The alternative would have been to rely on an army of bright minds to do work that would have obscured the platform's weaknesses and ultimately hindered its development,"" Karp added.

The message of maintaining a lean head count arrives at a moment when other companies are pivoting to leaner workforces. There have been significant layoffs at multiple large companies, particularly in middle-management roles.

Throughout the year, Microsoft has laid off around 15,000 employees in total with multiple rounds of cuts. In October, Amazon announced it is cutting about 14,000 corporate jobs, or roughly 4% of its white-collar workforce, as part of an effort to streamline operations and reduce bureaucracy. Target, the retail giant, also announced in the same month that it would lay off 1,000 corporate employees to eliminate what the company called ""overlapping work.""

During Amazon's latest earnings call, CEO Andy Jassy said that the company's rapid growth in recent years created ""a lot more layers"" that have slowed decision-making, and that the layoff is about ""culture"" instead of cost cutting or AI.

To make the job market picture more unclear, the government shutdown is preventing the release of job data from September onwards. Based on the most recent available data from August, the labor market missed expectations by a wide margin.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Michelle Lim, the founder and CEO of Flint, an AI startup based in San Francisco. The following has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified her employment and academic history.

Entrepreneurship wasn't on the top of my mind when I was a high schooler in Singapore.

It was only when I went to Yale that I told myself I needed to start exploring different things. That was when I started to seriously consider entrepreneurship as a career.

My entrepreneurial ambitions led me to major in computer science, which opened the door to internships at companies like Meta, Slack, and Robinhood.

My desire for more agency and autonomy over my work drove me to intern at progressively smaller companies.

My first internship was with Facebook, which at that time had about 12,000 employees. When I joined Slack, it was a 1,200-person company. And finally, when I got to Robinhood, it was a 300-person company.

When you work in a smaller company, you really feel you're making a difference.

After graduating, I joined Warp, a coding terminal startup, as its first hire.

To many people, joining a brand-new startup as a fresh graduate is a risk. Why take the road less traveled when you can stick to the tried-and-tested path of joining a big company?

But it felt right. I was starting my career in the summer of 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. I was living in New York, and people were dying every day. I could smell the ashes in the air from the cremations.

I realized then that life really is short. I could die at any time, and when that happens, I don't want to feel regret over not taking a risky but more exciting path.

I spent four years at Warp, where I cycled through a variety of roles. I started out as an engineer, switched to marketing, and then ran the company's product and sales. I presented at board meetings and jumped on calls with our investors, including Figma CEO Dylan Field, every quarter.

I learned a lot at Warp. That experience proved to be formative when I cofounded my own AI startup, Flint, in January.

As a founder, you are basically the startup's chief rejection officer. You are taking the brunt of rejections from sales prospects, recruits, and investors.

Flint is an AI tool that automates website building for companies, so it faced a lot of skepticism from investors who felt that the space was crowded.

What helped in the fundraising process was the track record I had built up as Warp's founding employee.

Growing Warp's product base from zero to half a million users made me a known quantity to investors even before I started Flint.

While there was some rejection, there were investors who approached me to invest, solely on the trust they had in my work.

Working at an early-stage startup isn't going to teach you everything. When I was at Warp, I never had to raise capital. All I had to do was decide whether to sign a term sheet.

I had a lot of help from my mentor, Ali Partovi, the CEO of Neo, a startup accelerator and VC fund. I met Ali when I joined the Neo Scholars program, which mentors college students keen on tech careers. He also got me my first job at Warp.

Ali and the folks at Neo guided me through the fundraising process and referred me to investors, including Meta's former chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg. Sheryl invested in the seed round via her family office, Sandberg Bernthal Venture Partners.

I practiced pitching with Neo and two of my founder friends, who helped me identify flaws in my presentation. Doing a lot of rehearsals meant that I didn't have to think on my feet at the actual meetings. I could rely on muscle memory when fielding questions.

I managed to secure funding from Neo and Accel, the VC fund that backed Facebook and Spotify. I also raised money from individual investors, including executives at tech companies like Linear and Atlassian.

All in all, I ended up raising nearly $5 million as part of Flint's seed round.

Looking back, I am glad that I started my career at an early-stage company. It is the single biggest reason for my success today. It gave me confidence to start a business from scratch because I had gone through the mess of it all.

I highly recommend joining a very small company if you want to become a founder in the future. Look for startups with good founders who are willing to bet on young talent and give them chances. That is the fastest way to grow your career and develop a strong track record.

Ukraine finally looks like it's about to build the interceptor drone arsenal it needs, shifting the world closer to a new type of air defense battle in which waves of drones fight each other.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Monday that his country should reach a daily production of 600 to 800 of the inexpensive but speedy quadcopters — designed to destroy Russian attack drones in flight — by the end of November.

The new estimate is under Zelenskyy's initial target of 1,000 a day, which he announced in July, but represents a more concrete gauge of what can be expected soon.

""I said that in the fall, there will be up to 1,000 interceptors produced per day. Of course, it's not an easy story,"" Zelenskyy told reporters. ""We believe that by the end of November, there will be 600 to 800 interceptor drones produced per day, if nothing goes wrong.""

That's as long as there aren't any disruptions from Russian attacks or sabotage, the Ukrainian leader added.

""Because sometimes, as you know, there are strikes — not only on our energy facilities,"" he said.

Interceptor drones are uncrewed aerial systems specifically made to be maneuverable and fast enough to chase and crash into an incoming attack drone, sometimes while carrying an explosive payload.

They're a far cheaper alternative to Western surface-to-air missiles, which can cost up to millions of dollars each, and that's why Kyiv wants more of the high-speed drones. Russia is increasingly trying to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses by launching hundreds of Shahed attack drones and Gerbera decoys in one night, often also firing advanced missiles in tandem.

Ukrainian and Western sources estimate that the Iranian-designed Shahed-136 costs between $20,000 and $70,000, so Ukraine needs a more cost-effective way to destroy them.

Drone manufacturers have been pushing the limits of their interceptors over the last year or so, making them faster and more responsive while trying to keep costs down. Meanwhile, Ukrainian cities suffered from repeated bombardment, with weekly reports of damaged energy infrastructure and residential buildings.

After months of development, Zelenskyy's new timeline and estimates indicate that local companies and Ukraine's military are now confident enough in their interceptors to move toward mass production.

Like with dozens of other systems used in the war, the heightened use of interceptors will likely be closely watched by militaries around the world that are developing or procuring their own interceptor drones.

Taras Tymochko, a project lead for interceptor drones at the Ukrainian crowdfunding organization ComeBackAlive, told Business Insider in late summer that local drone manufacturers charge roughly $3,000 to $6,000 per interceptor.

The price often depends on the systems received and the level and availability of technical support offered, Tymochko said.

It remains to be seen if increased interceptor production will provide the relief to air defenses that Ukraine has hoped for. Some interceptors are already reportedly finding success in battle.

The Sternenko Foundation, a crowdfunding organization that supports manufacturing for an interceptor called the Sting, said in a message to donors on October 26 that its funded interceptors destroyed nine out of 90 Russian drones detected in one night.

More broadly, Zelenskyy said in September that interceptor drones were responsible for 150 hits on Russian Shaheds and Gerberas in one night, out of a total of 810 drones.

Last fall, Salesforce debuted an AI agent so remarkably human-like it seemed like a vision from the future.

In a sleek demo, the company showed how luxury retailer Saks Fifth Avenue was using Salesforce's new flagship AI software Agentforce to create ""Sophie,"" a charming, patient customer service representative. A Salesforce executive dialed a Saks hotline, the chipper-voiced Sophie picked up, and then deftly recommended a sweater based on his order history and talked through shipping options.

Sophie reflected the promise of AI agents, which have had no bigger booster than Marc Benioff.

Soon after unveiling Agentforce, the Salesforce CEO wrote an essay in Time Magazine, which he owns, declaring that agents would unleash ""a revolution that will fundamentally redefine how humans work, live, and connect with one another from this point forward."" And he would lead this revolution, he boasted. In an interview with Business Insider around the same time, he said that Sophie was already live on Saks' website. ""That is what our customers are able to do"" with Salesforce's AI tools, he said, unlike those from one of his chief competitors. ""Microsoft doesn't have these examples, actually.""

In the weeks after Agentforce's debut, Salesforce's stock surged by more than 50%, peaking at an all-time high last December.

But a year later, shares are slumping as competitors' stocks keep climbing higher. Some Salesforce investors, analysts, clients, and even employees say Benioff may have placed too many chips on a bet that is yet to pay off.

Salesforce's public disclosures show that fewer than half of the company's 12,500 Agentforce customers are paying. Of its total customers, less than 2% were having more than 50 Agentforce conversations per week as of this summer, according to people with knowledge of internal reports. A Salesforce spokesperson said those numbers are just one cut of data that doesn't represent actual adoption or how the tool is being used.

Sophie is also not live as it debuted as. Today, when a customer calls Saks' hotline, a robotic voice answers, and responds to basic commands before transferring customers to a human representative — an experience virtually indistinguishable from the technology that banks and airlines have been using since the 1980s. In August, Saks announced it's partnering with Amazon and AI company NLX on a ""new AI-powered virtual voice assistant named 'Sophie.'""

Inside Business is today's must-read story on what the forces shaping business, tech, and innovation mean for you. Each piece delivers insights to help you make smarter career, money, and life decisions.

Adam Evans, an executive vice president at Salesforce who heads Agentforce, tells Business Insider he can't ""comment on exactly what's happening with Saks,"" but that ""actual tangible return on investment value is being created across thousands of our customers."" A company spokesperson adds that Salesforce customers have used Agentforce in more than 3 billion instances to date and that customers from Williams Sonoma to Singapore Airlines to the South American retailer Falabella ""are seeing value as they ramp up use cases."" PepsiCo transformation officer Athina Kanioura tells Business Insider that the company is using Agentforce to help 1.5 million retail stores manage their orders of its products and is targeting 5 million stores by the end of 2026.

The struggles with agents and generative AI in general aren't unique to Salesforce. An MIT report in July found that despite $30 billion to $40 billion in enterprise spending on generative AI, 95% of organizations report no return on investment. The management consultancy Gartner recently predicted more than 40% of agentic AI projects will be canceled by the end of 2027 due to ""escalating costs, unclear business value, or inadequate risk controls.""

It's not that Salesforce is necessarily behind competitors when it comes to agents, says Gil Luria, head of technology research at D.A. Davidson. It's that the company ""bet the farm"" on an early and unproven technology and neglected their core business. ""Salesforce became so focused on their AI product while the rest of their business … was decelerating very sharply,"" he says. ""They were paying too much attention to this new thing and not enough to what got them there."" A Salesforce spokesperson said Agentforce is part of its core business and ""enhances every Salesforce application by making it agentic.""

""Salesforce is uniquely vulnerable because we don't have a cloud business to fall back on,"" one senior employee says. ""Microsoft has plenty to fall back on, Amazon has plenty to fall back on.""

Agentforce is Salesforce's No. 1 priority, according to a draft of the company's annual strategic plan for its upcoming fiscal year. The annual plan is typically finalized by February. ""Win the enterprise agent wars"" is listed as the first method of success for Salesforce, dubbed ""the agentic enterprise"" in the internal document.

The company's stock is down more than 20% year to date, while peers like Oracle and Microsoft are up around 55% and 24%, respectively. Salesforce's revenue growth rate earlier this year slowed to single digits for the first time in its history as a public company. Another pressure point: An activist investor that pushed Salesforce into significant cost-cutting in 2022 (before selling many of its shares) increased its stake by nearly 50% this summer.

The stakes are high for every Big Tech company in the agent wars. For Salesforce, losing may be catastrophic.

Inside the company, some current and former employees say there's been constant struggle for the teams scrambling to deliver on Benioff's public promises of what their AI products can do.

Demos of software to customers or at Dreamforce, Salesforce's annual blowout conference, often showcase concepts that are months or years away, and the company sometimes shifts direction before these products are built.

""It's very, very difficult — even for people working on the products — to know the difference between what we say in a demo, what's on a road map, and what's actually in production,"" one senior employee said. ""It's a full-time job just figuring that out.""

Some insiders say the current version of Agentforce, requires significant technical skill from Salesforce's clients. Kristi Valente, a director of sales operation for a large appliance and electronics distributor, has been a Salesforce administrator helping companies use its software since 2008. She says the Agentforce demo her company received made it look like the technology was a lot easier to set up and less expensive to use. Her company purchased it in April and has yet to set it up.

""If you are a normal business with normal admins, you do not have the expertise to set this up,"" she said. ""We hired a consultant and even the consultant is confused. It's too new for anyone to be an expert.""

In a statement, a Salesforce spokesperson said that since launching Agentforce, ""we've learned a lot about the complexities of building agents,"" adding, ""We are committed to partnering with our customers as they embark on their technical journeys to becoming agentic enterprises.""

""We're learning not every agent or use case is the same,"" says Evans, the head of Agentforce. ""A lot of the agents haven't gone to scale because prompts alone are not enough. You need more."" For example, Salesforce has learned clients may not want an agent to be as creative as a chatbot when it comes to answering direct questions from customers, like how to process a return for an online order. For this reason, Salesforce has updated Agentforce with a ""reasoning engine"" to make sure the agent's answers and behaviors are more predictable and reliable.

Some of Salesforce's own salespeople said they struggled to grasp how the AI product they're selling works or what it can do.

Salesforce required Agentforce training for salespeople, asking them to build, for example, a concierge agent at a fictitious hotel chain that could help a patron with things like booking a restaurant or renting beach chairs. Agentforce in one of those trainings required a ""tremendous amount of work"" even to set up basic functions like dinner reservations, an employee who participated in the training said. ""Anyone who took that training knows Agentforce isn't ready for primetime.""

""We invest in comprehensive, hands-on Agentforce training for all 75,000+ of our employees because we recognize the significant shift that large language models represent,"" the Salesforce spokesperson said in response to the complaint. ""This new software environment is fundamentally different from traditional design, which is why change management and knowledge transfer have never been more important.""

Kash Rangan, Goldman Sachs' top software analyst, said at a briefing following the investment bank's technology conference in September that analysts in general are giving ""zero credibility"" to the optimistic comments from software companies like Salesforce and executives like Benioff when it comes to AI. ""They have a long way to go,"" Rangan said of Agentforce. ""It needs to scale.""

Rangan added that Benioff, prone to grandiose predictions and bullish forecasts, was more measured and not ""extremely optimistic"" at Goldman's conference. ""They are in the fight, and he's being realistic about where they are right now,"" Rangan said.

Despite that note of sobriety, and despite Agentforce's struggles, Benioff has leaned into his signature quality: Extravagance.

During that same Goldman talk, Benioff discussed an ambitious target for Salesforce: $100 billion in annual revenue, nearly three times the revenue for its most recent fiscal year.

The grandiosity continued a month later at Dreamforce — the greatest, and most surreal show in SaaS — a three-day jamboree sprawling across downtown San Francisco that's part Davos, part Disney World, part Radisson banquet hall, part Burning Man, and entirely Benioff.

The conference, which 50,000 people attended and which one executive once told BI costs Salesforce around $100 million per year, is studded with happy hours, concerts, celebrities, and even mascots. Signs heralded Gen Z-coded slogans like ""You have an agentic aura,"" and ""Dreamforce, it's a vibe."" Movie star Matthew McConnaughey, whom Salesforce pays a reported $10 million a year to be a ""creative director,"" held a session where he read poetry with journalist Maria Shriver. A ""special guest"" turned out to be Trump's AI czar David Sacks, who posted a photo with Benioff kissing him on the cheek. There was a gift shop where people lined up to buy plushies of one of Salesforce's mascots, ""Codey the Bear,"" and copies of Benioff's 2019 biography ""Trailblazer."" There was a Metallica concert. There was a Hawaiian conch-blowing ceremony. Gold sequined sweatshirts were handed out to at least one attendee in an annual tradition for achievements in the community of people who use Salesforce. ""I hate that I'm in a cult,"" one Salesforce customer said while describing this ""Golden Hoodie"" award.

""Dreamforce is a marketing event, it is a sales event, not an engineering event,"" one senior employee said. ""It is to create hype and invite big customers and take them out to parties.""

At Benioff's AI agent-focused keynote address, his salesmanship was on full display. He paused his speech several times to shake hands with celebrities like musician will.i.am and titans of business like Michael Dell. He talked about the death of his ""close personal friend,"" famed primatologist Jane Goodall, and quipped to a PepsiCo executive in attendance how much his friend ""Matthew"" (McConnaughey) loves Doritos.

He said his company has not been ""perfect"" in rolling out the Agentforce product. Later, at a briefing for reporters, Benioff shut down a question about the lack of adoption of Agentforce. ""It's the fastest-growing product in our history,"" he said. ""There's never been a faster-growing product. That we have that much already is way beyond anything we could have expected.""

At Dreamforce, the company also hosted its first investor day in three years. Benioff took the stage with the company's senior leadership team and cracked jokes while revealing new guidance — like a slightly more measured $60 billion revenue target by 2030, and returning to double-digit revenue growth. It won over some analysts. ""We came away feeling incrementally better after the investor day,"" William Blair analysts said in a note. ""Despite slow agentic AI adoption, we don't think Salesforce is a technology laggard,"" Macquarie analyst Steve Koenig wrote in a note after the session.

How much time can the Benioff show continue to buy Salesforce as it seeks to compete in the agent wars against companies like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon with seemingly unlimited resources and mammoth, diversified businesses to fall back on? Several Salesforce salespeople told Business Insider that in the days after Dreamforce, it's already getting easier to sell Agentforce. ""Hype needed to build,"" one said.

The US Army, long known for buttoned-up recruiting campaigns like ""Be All You Can Be"" and ""Army Strong,"" wants to experiment with an unfiltered approach: letting social media stars sell military life.

For decades, the task of finding new soldiers has rested on recruiters in dress uniforms visiting schools, career fairs, and community events. With young people living increasingly online — and with the Army mired in a yearslong recruiting slump — the service launched a trial program less than a year ago with eight vetted troops who already command attention on TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube.

One is a female bodybuilder. Another is a public affairs officer who preaches resilience. Some merge the latest social media trends with military peculiarities. The trial run's most popular influencer is a National Guard soldier who jokes about dad life as a farmer.

""We realized there were just pockets we could not pay to get into,"" Col. Kris Saling, who oversees experimentation and innovation in Army talent management, said of their reach online.

This is the second installment of a three-part series on the rise of military influencers. If you are serving or have served and want to share your experience with social media and the military, contact this reporter at kbaker@insider.com or on Signal at kelseybaker75.75.

Read the first installment: This soldier built a side hustle on TikTok and Instagram and says it's now paying better than the Army

The trial program aims to spark interest in enlistment among young people. The service doesn't pay fees to these influencers for their posts, but it spent about $22,000 on their travel and lodging around a marquee event in June. (The strategy worked, with their event-related posts reaching an impressive 40 million people online, internal documents show).

The service has wavered on fully embracing the program, recently pausing it for an ethics review. But as Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's Recruitment Task Force aims to find ""innovative strategies"" to boost interest in military service, there's growing recognition that these soldiers-turned-influencers connect with young people in ways traditional campaigns can't.

Their accounts are wildly popular with civilians and troops alike, delivering entertainment ranging from wholesome family content to cheeky irreverence. Many of these soldiers post from home or the gym, like any other influencer. Some appear in uniform, raising the stakes for the Army by tying its brand to unofficial content.

""They're relatable, they're people, they're human,"" Saling said. ""They're not the highly paid actor who's speaking on our behalf and probably has never served.""

Among the most visible of the Army's eight influencers is Austin von Letkemann, who goes by the handle ""mandatoryfunday,"" a wry reference to the ""fun"" unit events that troops must attend.

His typical posts might ponder the absurdities of military punishment and logic, or react to videos of people's poor judgment. Sometimes he's on base at Fort Hood, Texas, where he occasionally collaborates with two other influencers — Sgt. 1st Class Johnny Vargas, who goes by viva_la_vargas, and Staff Sgt. Roksolana Savyuk, known as quuen_baby. Last year, von Letkemann went viral for confronting observers who felt ""sorry"" that he was a father to four girls.

""I want to show people that you don't have to be like Captain America to join the United States military,"" von Letkemann said in an interview. In many videos, he looks like any ordinary civilian lounging at home, excluding flashes of gallows humor common among troops, such as the phrase ""live, laugh, lobotomize me"" displayed on the t-shirts and mugs he sells. Some videos touch on mental health issues or cultural challenges within the military.

Known for his deadpan delivery, von Letkemann, an enlisted soldier-turned-junior officer, has amassed more than 3.5 million followers across social media platforms. The Army's ability to communicate with two of its most important populations — the young civilians who might become recruits and the junior troops the military works to retain — is a matter of national security and an organizational gap influencers can help fill, he said. He fits that bill with a soft edge, ridiculing the oddities of military life.

In today's quasi-peacetime military, young service members are more likely to spend time entering data, navigating bureaucracy, or waiting for orders in a culture of hurry-up-and-wait, versus charging into a battlefield assault. Highlighting such frustrations doesn't diminish service; rather, it pulls back the curtain to help set realistic expectations. His inbox is often filled with messages from potential recruits.

One junior soldier, Specialist Dylan Ogle, told Business Insider he'd previously abandoned the idea of joining the Navy because of a medical issue. But a video from von Letkemann pushed him to try again — with the Army. In a 2024 Instagram message reviewed by Business Insider, Ogle told von Letkemann he ""inspired"" him to join and ""changed my life.""

A handful of his posts have drawn criticism from leaders for off-color content, he said. But only rarely — after all, it's that brazen irreverence and satire that resonate with troops and the public the most, he said.

As part of the trial program, the service gathered influencers in Washington, DC, in June to help drive awareness around the Army's 250th birthday.

The cost for the creators' lodging and travel was about $22,000, according to a post-parade communications analysis shared with Business Insider. Over five days, content from eight influencers garnered views from more than 40 million people and nearly 2 million engagements (comments and reactions), the analysis showed. That's a reach that traditional Army advertising rarely achieves, outside the largest and most expensive spots like Super Bowl ads.

During the parade, Army social media numbers ""increased by 72,000 followers across all platforms (3x greater than average),"" the internal analysis said, adding that there were 265,000 visits to the Army Birthday's website because of their reach.

While the Army-sanctioned influencers are connecting with young people in new ways, it's still too early to measure their impact on total recruiting, officials said. Housing talent like von Letkemann means the Army doesn't have to pay nonmilitary influencers for coverage, which can cost anywhere from $15,000 to $75,000 per post, Saling said.

The campaign, however, has rankled some troops, who observed influencers staying in hotel rooms while the rank-and-file slept in government buildings — a contrast that Saling said led to negative impressions. And while soldiers on social media are barred from explicitly endorsing products, many profit from advertising revenue or from selling personal merchandise. That presents an ethical quandary for all services, which lack a common framework for name, image, and likeness issues.

""It's a complete gray zone,"" Saling said. ""It's an area we really have to figure out.""

Asked about the rules, a Pentagon spokesperson referred Business Insider to existing DoD-level social media guidelines. The firmest guidelines cover operational security, partisan politics, and compliance with military law. Crude humor, edgy memes, and provocative posts aren't explicitly prohibited — and are often tolerated. The guidelines are generally left to unit commanders to interpret and enforce.

Von Letkemann said that the program succeeded this summer because the Army allowed sanctioned influencers to post whatever content they liked, unmuzzled by strict guidance usually seen in military communications. ""They basically told us, 'Go do what you do,'"" he said of their parade prep.

Such independence or freedom of expression isn't normally encouraged in the military.

""We can't have somebody who goes out and posts a TikTok rant,"" Saling said. But ""there's a little bit of a go-for-broke mentality in the Army,"" she said of the service's changing attitude toward influencers. ""We're behind, now let's throw a Hail Mary and see how this works.""

The Army, America's largest military branch with a force of around one million service members, has struggled with its marketing over the years. Slogans like ""Army of One"" and ""Army Strong"" (which cost $1.35 billion over five years) have been criticized as uninspiring or cringey. A 2021 marketing campaign known as ""The Calling"" fell flat, with troops and lawmakers deriding it as a ""woke"" attempt to attract more diverse young people. More recently, the service reintroduced a classic slogan from the 1980s in 2023, ""Be All You Can Be,"" which has earned a warmer reception.

Supporters of military influencers say that they're generally cheaper and more successful than traditional marketing. The Army this year requested a recruiting-related marketing and advertising budget of $1.1 billion, a 10% bump from the previous year.

The influencer program's success ultimately depends on its legal review and whether the Army can continue to support what makes influencers appealing — control over their own content.

The service met its recruiting goal of 61,000 enlistees early this year, thanks in part to the high cost of college tuition and a tight US job market. The military could face challenges sustaining that momentum, especially as it contends with a declining national birth rate.

""We have fewer and fewer people who are eligible for service,"" Saling said. ""And if we can't talk to as many of them as possible with an authentic voice, we are going to lose.""

YouTube did not hold back in its latest jab at Disney.

In a statement published on Monday, YouTube TV took a swipe at ABC News, outlining why it won't restore the news outlet's stations on its platform for 24 hours.

On Monday, Disney sought to thaw weekslong tensions with the Google-owned platform after the two companies failed to negotiate a new contract that would let YouTube TV subscribers watch Disney's television channels.

A Disney spokesperson said in a statement that the company asked YouTube to bring back ABC for Tuesday's US Election Day. Voters head to the polls for key local contests, including the New York City mayor's election and California's Proposition 50, which decides whether officials can redraw the state's congressional map.

""We believe in putting the public interest first and hope YouTube TV will take this small step for their customers while we continue to work toward a fair agreement,"" Disney said.

But YouTube was quick to decline the offer.

""Unfortunately, your proposal would permit us to return Disney's ABC stations only for a day and will cause customer confusion among those who may briefly see ABC on YouTube TV only to lose it again shortly after,"" YouTube said in a Monday blog post.

The company also made it clear that news viewers have alternatives.

""There are plenty of other options for customers — election news information is very widely available across other broadcast stations and news networks on YouTube TV, as well as on the main YouTube service, for free,"" the blog post read.

""In fact, on the last two US election days, the vast majority of tuned in YouTube TV subscribers chose not to watch ABC,"" it added.

Disney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

YouTube's statement is the latest in its standoff with the streaming giant.

Since October 30, Disney's networks, including the ABC and ESPN channels, have been unavailable on YouTube TV as part of a blackout. Disney has said YouTube TV isn't willing to pay the market rate.

Meanwhile, YouTube TV has said that Disney's proposal would force it to raise prices again, while helping Disney-controlled rivals like Fubo and Hulu + Live TV. YouTube TV promised to give its customers a $20 credit if the blackout drags on.

This high-profile carriage fight meant that YouTube TV subscribers couldn't watch ESPN's college football games this past weekend or its popular pregame show, ""College GameDay,"" through the platform. A carriage fight is a disagreement over the right to ""carry,"" or retransmit, a broadcaster's signal.

Disney and ESPN have tried to win over fans by stirring up outrage against YouTube TV. ESPN enlisted megastars like Stephen A. Smith, Scott Van Pelt, and Mike Greenberg — the three personalities posted short clips on social media informing viewers of the dispute and directing them to a Disney-owned website to petition YouTube TV.

The blackout and viewers switching over to competitor news or sports channels put Disney in a tough spot. Following ABC's decision to take Kimmel off the air, Disney has been recovering from a widely followed boycott that cost it millions of streaming subscribers.

We began dreaming of living on Washington's Olympic Peninsula while on vacation there in 2010.

I'd picked up a travel brochure about the city of Port Townsend and joyfully read it aloud as my partner, Carol, and I drove through the area.

It described a place great for kayaking, hiking, and biking with an active sailing community and emerald forests — all things my outdoorsy mate loves.

We were even more sold on the area when I learned about its charming Victorian homes, historical seaport, array of music and arts festivals, and thriving local writers' community.

This was the ideal destination for our second home. At the time, we were both working and living in Arizona, only returning to the Pacific Northwest for short trips.

But we didn't want to just vacation in the area; we wanted to establish a foothold and be a part of the community for several months each year.

Unfortunately, our dream seemed financially out of reach as housing prices in the area continued to climb. Many listings were priced over $500,000, which was well out of our budget.

Our prospects looked dismal until our real-estate agent sent us a listing for a wooded lot of trees and wildflowers about 30 minutes out of town.

It didn't have power, sewer, or water, and the only permanent structure was an outhouse. But the property did offer a developed road and easy access to Highway 101, as well as excellent cellphone service and WiFi connectivity.

And it was within our budget. 

In 2022, we purchased the 4.6-acre property, sight unseen, for $160,000 and ordered a rugged, 20-foot Airstream Basecamp for $65,000 to serve as our new abode.

Rather than developing the land, we decided to live off the grid. We purchased portable solar panels to augment the system on the Airstream's roof.

We capture rainwater and boil it for domestic needs (washing dishes and hands) and haul water from a facility about 5 miles away for drinking and cooking.

To make things a little easier, Carol even set up a small, battery-operated pump for delivering water into our trailer.

We've also created strategies for conserving energy, like charging our phones, computers, and battery-operated gardening tools when we drive into town.

Our cozy little Airstream can get a bit crowded, so we put up an outdoor tent with a propane stove, a foot-operated pump for washing dishes, and a table and chairs for outdoor dining.

Carol joined a local band, so the outdoor tent also serves as a rehearsal space.

Our property is landlocked, so Carol pays a monthly fee to store her kayak at a boat haven 18 miles from our property. This also gives us access to a marina 8 miles away.

At either location, we can use the coin-operated hot showers and garbage facilities to dispose of our trash. Though we are conservationists, we are not complete Luddites. 

One can only sacrifice so much.

Living off the grid has been an interesting adventure, but we don't regret our decision.

The Pacific Northwest is now our home for three to five months a year, just like we dreamed. We spend the rest of the year in our on-grid home in Arizona. 

Before we migrate south for the winter, though, we always prep our riding lawn mower for the cold, put additional gravel on the dirt roads, lubricate the hinges on our storage container, and trim our trees.

All in all, I'm grateful we've found a way to enjoy Washington without the hefty cost of homeownership.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Lindsay Mustain, a former Amazon recruiter in her 40s who lives in Washington. It has been edited for length and clarity.

Before I started my career coaching business in 2017, I was a recruiter. From 2016 to 2017, I worked at Amazon, where I sourced top talent and performers globally.

Anybody who tells you that the labor market is booming isn't telling the truth. I consider this the toughest job market I've ever seen for the average job seeker.

Companies aren't overhiring like they used to; they're doing precise hiring. That means candidates have a responsibility to clearly demonstrate how they'll either save or make a company money.

There are a lot of other things that are playing into what's causing the current job market crisis, too, like generative AI.

At Amazon, I recruited top talent — what I call ""top 1% talent."" They approached job searching in a very different way from the average job seeker. It's the same process that I teach my clients now; I call it intentional career design.

Many job seekers come with what they feel is a very well-prepared package, but they might not have a great résumé because it's telling, rather than showing, impact. It's not their fault, because they've been taught to present their skills in line with the job description.

To increase your chances of landing the job you want, there are three steps to follow.

For every $100,000 you want to make, you need to have at least seven figures of impact on your résumé. I say ""at least"" because right now, the more, the better.

This could include revenue growth, an increase in reputation, reach, or profit margins, or risk reduction.

It doesn't matter what job you do, whether it's a support role or if you're on the executive team. You need to demonstrate how you help a company save or make money. A company will hire someone when there is a reason for it — meaning a business case with an expected commercial benefit for the company.

Your seven-figure signature needs to be aligned with what's happening. The job market is in flux, so if you're marketing a skillset that's becoming antiquated, that's a problem; you're not competing in the current labor market.

The second step is then what I call ""Me Inc."" marketing materials. I run ""Lindsay Inc.,"" and you run ""You Inc."" That means the tools we use to market our business need to be on point. Your marketing materials need to show proof, impact, and quantifiable results — not just responsibilities.

When it comes to your résumé, you've got about six seconds to make an impression.

Recruiters often look at your LinkedIn profile before giving you an interview, so your profile needs to model the same story as your résumé, but with a few other features, like a profile picture.

People talk about the bias that it brings, but a profile photo on your LinkedIn page drives more views. Humans quickly interpret profile photos and make unconscious decisions, often influenced by some biases. You want to use that bias to frame yourself as warm, welcoming, competent, influential, or likable.

Another thing that really matters is your headline, both for your résumé and your LinkedIn. Make sure your headline classifies what you do — the level, the scope, the impact. It should also have some sort of secret sauce, something that you do that's uniquely you, as part of the candidate differentiation strategy. Just like a news headline should hook the reader's attention and make them want to read more, your LinkedIn headline should try to get them to go past the fold and scroll down on the page.

Your LinkedIn summary should show that seven-figure signature. It should help potential employers understand in just a few seconds that you're somebody worth spending at least 30 minutes with on the phone.

Next is the candidate choice framework, which is about visibility and understanding the hidden job market. How can you increase the visibility of your LinkedIn profile to recruiters and attract more views? You engage on LinkedIn. Engaging strategically with the right information is a key part of being a top 1% talent. You should be sharing, commenting, and building your network immediately.

It's so important to increase your influence, visibility, and perceived authority because recruiters aren't waiting for you to find our job openings and apply. When I was a recruiter, I went through the fair consideration process, but generally, before a job got approved for the budget, I was already sourcing candidates and talking to people to make my shortlist of who I wanted to interview first.

The truth is, the hidden job market is not as hidden as it seems. It lives in conversations and relationships. It could be a friend of a friend of a friend, your neighbor's cousin, or a LinkedIn connection you made after commenting something thoughtful.

Every person you meet is somebody you want to build a relationship with, because they're all ways into that hidden job market. Don't just come up and say, ""Hey, can you get me a job?"" Build a relationship and let that open doors because you're so clear about expressing what you do that people think, We'd be so lucky if we even got a chance to interview them.

I spent six weeks exploring New Zealand's North and South Islands, and all of my research kept pointing me toward the country's famous train rides — often described as some of the most scenic in the world.

Great Journeys New Zealand runs three routes: the Northern Explorer between Auckland and Wellington, the Coastal Pacific between Picton and Christchurch, and the TranzAlpine, which crosses the Southern Alps between Christchurch and Greymouth.

To fill a free day in Christchurch, I splurged on a $320 round-trip ticket for the TranzAlpine to see what all the hype was about.

Here's how the day went, and why I think the ride is best done one way, if at all.

An Uber picked me up from my hostel to take me to the train station at 7:30 a.m. The 10-minute ride to the Christchurch Railway Station only cost about $8.

Once I arrived, I was surrounded by people with suitcases.

I wondered if those checking bags were taking the train to Greymouth and then connecting to another mode of transportation down the South Island's west coast — a popular route I considered exploring, but ultimately decided against.

When I got to the counter, I inquired about upgrading one leg of my journey to the Scenic Plus Experience for a few hundred dollars.

It includes premium perks like access to a private outdoor viewing carriage, regionally inspired cuisine paired with local wines, and live commentary.

Unfortunately, the all-inclusive experience was completely sold out.

The seating arrangement felt cramped, gave me a bit of social anxiety, and I didn't like that I was facing away from the direction of travel.

We left the station at approximately 8:15 a.m.

The space is intended for dining passengers only, and since it was relatively empty for most of the journey, I kept ordering refreshments so I could stay there instead of returning to the seat I didn't like.

I'd read beforehand that when traveling from Christchurch to Greymouth, the best scenic highlights are on the right side of the tracks.

It wasn't possible to request a specific side when booking, but since passengers only had to remain in their assigned seats for departure and arrival, I was free to explore and enjoy the scenery from different angles.

Extras ranged from full meals with a drink to a cheese board with wine, and even a celebration cake or bubbles.

I chose breakfast with a non-alcoholic beverage for $13.48 and dinner with a beverage for $20.54, which seemed like a good deal.

At the time, I was following a keto diet, so I went with a low-carb breakfast option: black cherry, pear, and vanilla chia-seed compote and a large long black coffee.

Even after ordering a second coffee, buying those items separately would have been cheaper because I actually lost $0.36 by pre-booking the meal.

In hindsight, I wished I'd forgotten my diet and indulged in the ham-and-cheese croissant sandwich because it would have made the add-on feel more worthwhile.

At first, the tracks mostly passed through industrial and residential areas.

It felt the scenery only began to change once we reached Springfield — 40 miles outside of Christchurch — which is considered the gateway to New Zealand's Southern Alps.

I captured a few amazing shots that were essentially ruined by reflections on the glass.

At times, it felt easier to stop trying for photos and just take in the sights.

Though I expected it to be cold, I wasn't fully prepared for the chilly mountain air when I stepped outside.

I only stayed for a few minutes before retreating to the dining carriage for a hot tea ($2.34), which I brought back with me to help keep warm while enjoying the panoramas.

Screens showed everything from our position along the route and elevation changes to factoids about destinations we were passing.

There was also an onboard infotainment app, which I downloaded but didn't use since the screens provided the same details without draining my phone battery.

The train arrived just before 10:45 a.m., giving passengers a chance to hop off and snap a photo in front of the Arthur's Pass National Park sign.

With the wind picking up and a crowd of people all trying for the same shot, getting a decent picture wasn't easy.

The stop only lasted about 10 minutes, so there wasn't enough time to explore the area.

The cashier had a record of my pre-booked meals on file.

When I explained that I hadn't felt I'd gotten my money's worth at breakfast, they let me order another coffee to help make up the difference in price.

Still feeling peckish, I grabbed a keto-friendly snack: salted peanuts. These weren't included in my meal plan, so I paid $2.35 out of pocket.

The countryside continued to impress as we traveled west, with plenty of photo opportunities along the way.

We were instructed to disembark and that those of us returning to Christchurch would have an hour to explore the city.

Greymouth's Central Business District was quiet on this aptly gray Monday afternoon. As I stopped into a few shops and passed some street art, I wondered if the area might be livelier on a weekend.

Since I didn't want to risk being late for the return train, I stayed within a short walk of the station.

I waited on the platform with the intention of photographing the train as it came into the station, and I was pleased with the results.

Before boarding the train back to Christchurch, I was starting to regret buying a round-trip ticket.

Since we'd be following the same tracks, I doubted the scenery would have the same appeal without that initial wow factor of seeing it for the first time.

This time, I was in a two-seat row with an outlet and no one in the seat beside me. I was finally facing forward, which made the journey much smoother.

As a result, I spent far more time in this seat than the one I'd been assigned on the way to Greymouth.

Though I had worried the return journey might feel redundant, I hadn't considered how much the weather could transform the setting.

Having already seen the route clearly on the way there, I found myself appreciating the cozy, moodier atmosphere that a bit of rain created.

That said, if I had only traveled one way, this may have been disappointing because the weather did obscure some of the sightlines.

Unlike the breakfast deal, which only included a non-alcoholic beverage, the dinner package allowed me to order any drink except a full-size bottle of wine.

I chose the beef-cheek entrée ($14.71) because I figured it would reheat better than the lamb shank or roast chicken.

My drink pairing was a quarter-bottle of Brancott Estate sauvignon blanc ($7.65), which felt like the perfect portion for one person.

The late afternoon light cast everything in a softer glow, making it easier to capture photos than it had been during the first leg.

Maybe it was the wine, or perhaps it was simply that I took my favorite photos of the day during this stretch, but golden hour was the moment I briefly stopped regretting taking the same route back to Christchurch.

The sun set as we were riding along what I thought was the most scenic part of the entire train ride: the turquoise waters of the Waimakariri River Gorge.

I stayed for about 20 minutes, until a staff member corralled everyone back to their seats as a safety precaution since we were about to go through various tunnels.

I didn't mind the final stretch being in the dark, since we were passing through the same industrial and residential areas I'd found underwhelming that morning.

The train pulled back into Christchurch just after 7 p.m., and within half an hour I was back at my hostel, completing the nearly 12-hour excursion.

After returning to Christchurch, I couldn't help feeling like I'd wasted both time and money on the round-trip ticket.

Though there were memorable moments in each direction, I would've rather saved money by only taking the train one way.

Looking back, I wish I would've gotten off at Greymouth and continued down the west coast by bus or rental car, as I suspect many other passengers did.

And when comparing the train to a separate road trip I took from Canterbury to Arthur's Pass, I found renting a car not only more convenient but also more rewarding.

For travelers considering the famous rail route, I'd suggest taking the train one way — or skipping it in favor of driving yourself for more flexibility and discovery.

The bank behind the world's largest sovereign wealth fund has just dealt a blow to Elon Musk's $1 trillion payday.

Norges Bank Investment Management, which manages Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund, said on Tuesday it had voted against the Tesla CEO's proposed pay package ahead of the company's annual shareholder meeting on Thursday.

The bank said that while it appreciated the ""significant value"" created under the billionaire's leadership, it had concerns about the size of the package, dilution, and the lack of mitigation of Musk's ""key person risk"" for Tesla.

The fund, which is Tesla's sixth-largest institutional investor, also voted against Musk's previous pay package in 2024. In January, leaked messages revealed an icy text exchange between the Tesla boss and Norges' CEO Nicolai Tangen, with the billionaire telling Tangen that ""friends are as friends do.""

Norway's sovereign wealth fund is the largest institutional investor to publicly say how it has voted on the $1 trillion pay package. The fund has a 1.2% share in the EV giant.

Tesla's CEO compensation plan has come under fire from some investors, including the California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) and the New York State Retirement Fund.

Proxy firms Glass Lewis and ISS have also urged shareholders to vote against it, prompting Musk to label them ""corporate terrorists"" in a recent earnings call.

Several other big investors, including Florida's State Board of Administration and ARK Invest's Cathy Wood, have expressed support. Vanguard and BlackRock, Tesla's two largest institutional shareholders, have not yet said how they are voting.

The 2025 CEO compensation plan would award Musk around $1 trillion worth of Tesla shares, assuming he hits a series of ambitious goals over the next decade.

These include raising Tesla's market cap to $8.5 trillion, selling 1 million Optimus robots, boosting annual earnings way above those reported by tech giants Meta and Google, and planning his own succession.

Tesla could not immediately be reached for comment.

Healthcare stocks have been among the worst-performing sectors over the last year. But Dominic Pappalardo, the chief multi-asset strategist at Morningstar Wealth, thinks the sector is poised for a turnaround.

During a recent conversation we had, he shared a compelling chart showing that the sector has lagged despite that its earnings growth is soaring.

""Healthcare has been beaten down for a lot of reasons — mostly earlier in the year related to potential regulatory hurdles and new administration policies affecting healthcare sectors,"" Pappalardo said. And yet, ""healthcare earnings have grown faster than the rest of the US market from mid-2024 to mid-2025.""

He continued: ""You had a situation where the fundamentals were outpacing the broad market, but performance was dramatically lagging. We think that naturally sets up for some reversal to occur.""

Analysts at Morgan Stanley agree with him. They cited several factors that contribute to their bullish outlook, like impending drug price clarity, insulation from heightened tariffs, a growing number of mergers and acquisitions, cheap valuations, and AI opportunities.

Pappalardo threw in another reason: its defensive nature as the job market appears to weaken.

""Even if we get an economic pullback, downturn, or even a recession, healthcare revenues still tend to hold up pretty well,"" he said.

""If you look through the last 12 months of employment reports, 12 out of 12 times healthcare has been the sector that's added the most employees,"" he added. ""That tells us companies are investing in future growth because they think there's upside down the road, which bodes well for that sector.""

President Donald Trump on Tuesday suggested that the United States will not pay any SNAP benefits during the government shutdown, contradicting a court filing a day earlier by his administration.

Trump said that the benefits, which help feed 42 million Americans, will resume only after Democrats in Congress agree to pass a stopgap funding bill that would reopen the government.

The administration on Monday told a federal judge in Rhode Island federal judge that it would pay half of the costs of the SNAP benefits for November.

Trump on Tuesday said in a Truth Social post, wrote, ""SNAP BENEFITS, which increased by Billions and Billions of Dollars (MANY FOLD!) during Crooked Joe Biden's disastrous term in office (Due to the fact that they were haphazardly 'handed' to anyone for the asking, as opposed to just those in need, which is the purpose of SNAP!), will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!""

The White House, when asked by CNBC for clarification on Trump's statement given the court filing Monday, said, ""Refer you to the President's truth.""

The social media post came shortly after lawyers for plaintiffs in a court case challenging the administration's cessation of SNAP benefits told a federal judge in Rhode Island that the decision to pay partial benefits out of a contingency fund did not meet his prior order that any decision to make partial payments ""cannot be arbitrary and capricious.""

The judge, Jack McConnell, had told the administration on Friday that it needed to pay SNAP benefits as soon as possible out of a contingency fund, and that is also needed to investigate whether other federal funds could be used to keep the program fully funded in the absence of a new appropriation by Congress.

 

The Trump administration on Monday told McConnell that it would use all of the $4.65 billion remaining in the contingency fund, but said it had declined to use at least  $4 billion from the Child Nutrition Program to keep SNAP fully funded for November, at least.

Lawyers for plaintiffs in the case told McConnell on Tuesday, ""The Court should grant a temporary restraining order and preliminary stay on the ground that Defendants' decision not to provide full SNAP benefits—even though they have funds available to do so and even though switching to partial payments at this late date will cause devastating delay — is arbitrary and capricious.""

McConnell later told the Trump administration to respond to the request by Wednesday.

The dispute over the continuation of the SNAP benefits in the past week has become a major issue in the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, which began on Oct. 1.

Past presidential administrations have continued disbursing funds for SNAP during prior government shutdowns.

But the Trump administration recently said SNAP benefits would end this week because Congress had not approved funding needed to continue the program during the shutdown. The administration, in what is seen as an effort to pressure Democrats in Congress to vote to end the shutdown, also refused to use more than $4 billion in contingency funds that Congress had set aside explicitly for SNAP.

Separate groups of plaintiffs then sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture in different federal courts to compel the department to continue paying the benefits.

In this article

At South Korea's largest amusement park, crowds of people wait for hours to be a part of the ""KPop Demon Hunters"" craze.

U.S. streaming giant Netflix, the distributor of the Sony Pictures Animation film, has collaborated with the Everland park outside of the capital city Seoul to create a themed zone featuring whack-a-mole, dance games and snacks from the movie.

It's the latest iteration of the ""KPop Demon Hunters"" frenzy as the film takes Netflix by storm — and delivers a boost to the $10 billion K-pop music industry along with it.

Netflix said in August that ""KPop Demon Hunters"" had become the most popular Netflix film ever. In October, the streamer said ""KPop Demon Hunters"" had exceeded 325 million views. 

The company has sought to capitalize on the popularity, offering two limited-window theatrical screenings for the film and striking consumer product deals with Hasbro and Mattel to get ""KPop Demon Hunters"" toys and merch on shelves.

Agnes Lee helped cast the movie and scout locations from Seoul as an associate producer for the film. 

""K-pop and K-culture was such a huge and important part of this movie,"" Lee told CNBC in Seoul. ""We wanted to be authentic.""

Once popular mainly in Asia, K-pop music has become a global phenomenon. Artists like PSY, who shot to international stardom in 2012 with his viral music video ""Gangnam Style,"" put an international spotlight on K-pop. PSY's hit song became YouTube's most-watched video that year. 

Since then, other K-pop acts have run up impressive numbers, too. BTS' song ""Dynamite"" has exceeded 2 billion streams on Spotify. BLACKPINK's 2023 tour became the highest-grossing by a female group on record, according to stats at the time from Touring Data.

Now, even ""KPop Demon Hunters'"" fictional bands are topping the global music charts.

""I think people watched 'KPop Demon Hunters' in spite of that 'K-pop' in the title. And then, after watching it, they realized, 'Oh, wow. I'm a K-pop fan,'"" said Danny Chung, a K-pop producer and the voice of the film's character, Baby Saja. ""And now there's a whole back catalogue of three decades of K-pop music that they have to dive into.""

And there's plenty more to come: BLACKPINK is expected to release a new album. BTS is planning a comeback in 2026 after members of the band completed South Korea's mandatory military service. 

Enthusiastic investors have pumped up the stock prices of South Korea's ""Big Four"" K-pop companies. Shares of HYBE, JYP Entertainment, SM Entertainment and YG Entertainment are all up double-digits year to date. YG is up more than 100%.

The impact of the film's rise may not stop at music.

""The breakout success of 'KPop Demon Hunters,' which could become one of Netflix's most-watched content items, underscores K-content phenomenon in global market,"" Mirae Asset Global Investments said in an Oct. 19 report. ""We believe this cultural boom is a key catalyst driving increased international consumption of Korean cosmetics and food products such as noodles."" 

On the political front, speculation is high that China, which blocked K-pop and other South Korean cultural exports under President Xi Jinping's campaign to promote what Beijing considers proper socialist values, could soften its restrictions.

The countries' presidents had a positive meeting on the sidelines of the APEC summit in Gyeongju, South Korea.

""We continue to see K-pop as a direct beneficiary of thawing Korea-China relations,"" Mirae said.

In this article

Palantir CEO Alex Karp ranted against short sellers, calling out specifically Michael Burry after a filing revealed the investor of ""The Big Short"" fame had bets against the artificial intelligence software company, as well as Nvidia, at the end of the last quarter.

""The two companies he's shorting are the ones making all the money, which is super weird,"" Karp told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Tuesday. ""The idea that chips and ontology is what you want to short is bats--- crazy.""

""He's actually putting a short on AI. ... It was us and Nvidia,"" Karp added.

When reached via email by CNBC seeking comment on Karp's remarks, Burry declined to comment.

Palantir shares slid roughly 9% on Tuesday even after the software company beat Wall Street estimates for the third quarter and offered upbeat guidance. Investors have grown increasingly wary of lofty valuations in AI-linked names. Palantir's stock, which was up 173% for the year heading into Tuesday's trading, has a forward price-earnings ratio of 228. Nvidia fell more than 2% after gaining over 50% this year.

""I do think this behavior is egregious and I'm going to be dancing around when it's proven wrong,"" said Karp of short sellers.

Burry's hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, disclosed put options with a notional value of about $187 million against Nvidia and $912 million against Palantir as of Sept. 30. in a filing. The filing didn't specify the strike prices or expiration dates of the contracts.

It's unclear whether Burry is profiting from Tuesday's declines. The filing reflects his positions at the end of September, and he may have since adjusted his portfolio by now. Burry declined to comment on his positions.

""It's not even clear he's shorting us. It's probably just, 'How do I get my position out and not look like a fool?'"" Karp said.

The disclosure comes after Burry hinted at renewed caution in markets in a cryptic post on X last week.

""Sometimes, we see bubbles. Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play,"" he wrote to his 1.3 million followers on the platform.

Burry gained fame for his prescient bet against mortgage-backed securities before the 2008 financial crisis, a trade chronicled in Michael Lewis' book ""The Big Short"" and the Oscar-winning film of the same name.

""With the shorts it's very complex ... honestly I think what's going on here is market manipulation,"" Karp said. ""We delivered the best results anyone's ever seen. It's not even clear he's not doing this to get out of his position. I mean these people, they claim to be ethical, but they are actually shorting one of the great businesses of the world.""

In this article

Corporate America is getting rocked by historic rounds of white-collar layoffs, leading some to wonder: Has AI finally come for their jobs?

While the proliferation of generative and agentic artificial intelligence is playing a role, recent job cut announcements from companies like Amazon, UPS and Target are about a lot more than just the advance of new technology. 

The firms, which each announced layoffs in recent weeks totaling more than 60,000 roles eliminated this year, said they're trying to cut corporate bloat, streamline operations and adjust to new business models.

But in the absence of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' monthly jobs report, which has gone dark amid the government shutdown, the layoff announcements have raised questions about the strength of the labor market and if it's the start of an AI-driven, white-collar recession. 

Some companies have outright said they're replacing workers with AI. Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski said in May the company was able to shrink its head count by about 40%, in part because of AI. Duolingo said in April it'll stop using contractors for work that AI can handle. Salesforce laid off 4,000 customer support roles in September, saying that AI can do 50% of the work at the company.

But experts interviewed by CNBC said some companies could be ""AI-washing"" their job cuts, blaming layoffs on the new technology to cover up business fumbles and old-fashioned cost cutting.

""We spend a lot of time looking carefully at companies that are actually trying to implement AI, and there's very little evidence that it cuts jobs anywhere near like the level that we're talking about. In most cases, it doesn't cut head count at all,"" said Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at the Wharton School and director of its Center for Human Resources. ""Using AI and introducing it to save jobs turns out to be an enormously complicated and time-consuming exercise. … There's still a perception that it's simple and easy and cheap to do, and it's really not."" 

Still, the cuts, which come after a string of layoffs across the tech industry, have cast a dark cloud on a teetering economy that's been wracked by persistent inflation, rising delinquencies, falling consumer sentiment and an average effective tariff rate that's at its highest level in nearly a century, according to estimates from The Budget Lab at Yale University.

The growing pile of bad news has done little to shock the stock market, which is at near-record highs, but that's largely because it's been buoyed in part by AI megacaps.

Cappelli attributed the recent surge in layoff announcements to concerns about the state of the economy. He also noted a likely ""bandwagon"" effect in which companies see their competitors cutting so they too start making cuts. 

""If it looks like everybody is cutting, then you say, 'They must know something we don't know,'"" said Cappelli. He added investors often reward cutting: ""They want to hear that you're cutting because it looks like you're doing something good. It looks like becoming more efficient.""

To be sure, AI and automation are potentially enabling some of the cuts, and the emerging technology is poised to help all companies reduce costs and boost efficiency in the coming years. But the reasons behind each layoff and the role AI is playing are nuanced, and vary company by company.

Starbucks' decision to cut around 2,000 corporate jobs in two rounds this year is related to slowing sales at the company and a larger turnaround effort led by its new CEO, Brian Niccol. Layoffs at Meta's AI unit, which impacted around 600 jobs, came as the company said it wants to operate more nimbly and reduce layers. Intel's decision to lay off about 15% of its workforce came after it overinvested in chip manufacturing without adequate demand. 

Together, they represent what John Challenger, CEO of job placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, described as a turning point in the economy and job market.

""We were in this no-hire, no-fire, type of zone. Economy was moving ahead. The labor markets were feeling pressure, but certainly, unemployment had stayed relatively strong,"" he said. ""These job cuts do suggest that the dam may be breaking as the economy slows.""

The earliest signals, he said, could be coming from retail, shipping and distribution.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, Amazon went on a hiring spree in part to meet a surge in demand for e-commerce and cloud computing services, leading its corporate and front-line workforces to more than double to 1.3 million employees between 2019 and 2020. 

By 2021, the company had swelled to 1.6 million employees globally, the same year Andy Jassy succeeded Jeff Bezos as CEO. 

Since taking over, Jassy has been trying to undo some of that work.

Last week's layoff announcement, impacting 14,000 corporate jobs, is expected to be the largest in the company's history and to affect nearly every unit in the company. It marks Amazon's second round of layoffs in three years and amounts to more than 41,000 corporate job cuts since 2022, with more potentially on the way come 2026.

Though AI is part of the picture, there's more at work behind the reductions.

Jassy said in the days following the announcement that the changes were neither AI nor financially driven, but were instead to cut corporate fat so the company can operate as the world's largest startup.

Amazon said it's not replacing workers with AI, at least not yet, but it does need to cut employees so it can invest in the technology. As those costs come down, Amazon has earmarked hefty investments in cloud infrastructure to support AI workloads while simultaneously pushing out a flurry of AI services and tools across the company. 

It's contributed to a rise in capital expenditures, which are now expected to reach $125 billion this year, up from a prior forecast of $118 billion.

Jassy said previously that the company's workforce would shrink in the future as a result of its embrace of generative AI but it still plans to keep hiring in ""key strategic areas."" Over time, the company will need ""fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today"" but ""more people doing other types of jobs,"" Jassy said in June. 

The cuts are also part of a larger goal of Jassy's to make the company more nimble, reduce bureaucracy and remove layers so it can operate faster and smarter. 

""It's culture,"" Jassy said during Amazon's quarterly earnings call Thursday. ""If you grow as fast as we did for several years, you know, the size of the businesses, the number of people, the number of locations, the types of businesses you're in, you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers.""

In January, UPS announced a major change in its strategy.

The logistics firm said it was going to pare down its relationship with its largest customer, Amazon, in favor of higher-margin businesses that require fewer people to operate. 

In fiscal 2024, Amazon shipments represented nearly 12% of revenue for UPS. The logistics giant said it was planning to reduce that volume by more than half by June because of the relatively low margins.

""This was not their ask. This was us. This was UPS taking control of our destiny,"" CEO Carol Tomé told analysts in January. 

In turn, UPS said it was pivoting to more profitable businesses, like health care, returns and business-to-business services and as a result, would require fewer resources. 

""As we bring volume down, we will not only reduce the hours of miles associated with this volume, we will be able to take out fixed costs to match our capacity to our new expected volume levels,"" finance chief Brian Dykes said in January. ""We expect to close up to 10% of our building, cut back our vehicle and aircraft fleets and reduce labor."" 

Last week the company said it had deepened previously planned job cuts for a total of 48,000 roles eliminated so far this year across operational employees and office workers.

In the first half of 2025, parcel volumes were down 5.4% at UPS compared with the year-ago period, according to data from ShipMatrix, and the company has been changing its corporate structure to adjust to lower volume.

The bulk of its layoffs this year, representing 34,000 operational jobs, were related to its decision to close 93 buildings – not replace people with robotics, the company said. 

The 14,000 additional corporate roles it cut were partially related to AI, but the technology was not the primary driver, a spokesperson said. 

Where AI and automation are expected to hit UPS most is in its future hiring plans.

As the company plans to bring automation to more of its facilities, it won't need to hire as many people. Last week, UPS said 66% of its volume during the fourth quarter would come through automated facilities, up from 63% a year prior. That number is expected to move higher in the years ahead. 

Still, that doesn't necessarily mean those jobs are disappearing – some could be migrating from UPS to other companies, said Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University's business school.

Miller said there's a ""reallocation"" effect happening where one firm is losing business and shedding payroll — while another is gaining. The number of jobs may be the same, but the location, qualities and duties can differ, he said. 

BLS data on the number of people employed in ""courier"" positions, which covers roles at places like UPS and Amazon, reflects that trend. As of August, courier positions were only down about 2% from their all-time high, and they've been on the rise over the last three years, the data shows. 

Target's announcement last month that it would be cutting 1,800 jobs, representing about 8% of its corporate workforce, is a window into both consumer spending and the retailer's own specific challenges. 

It's Target's first major round of layoffs in a decade and comes after four years of roughly stagnant revenue. The retailer's incoming CEO, Michael Fiddelke, said the cuts are about reducing complexity at a company that's seen its workforce grow faster than sales. 

Unlike some of its competitors, the bulk of Target's revenue comes from the kinds of products that are nice to have, but not necessary, such as holiday mugs, trendy sweaters and home decor. 

That means when consumer spending starts to slow down, Target feels it more acutely than its rival Walmart, which earns the majority of its revenue from groceries. 

Slower consumer spending has been partially to blame for a decline in Target's performance in recent years, but the introduction of tariffs, which are pushing prices higher, could make that impact even worse. 

""Buyers' willingness to pay is staying flat, inflation is high, income isn't going very up so firms' ability to sort of increase price to maintain their margin is being squeezed,"" said Daniel Keum, an associate professor of management at Columbia Business School, who studies labor market dynamics. ""If you can't increase price, you have to reduce cost.

""How operationally do I manage cost?"" Keum added. ""I mean No. 1, like, let's lay off white-collar people."" 

Outside of macroeconomic conditions, Target's business has also suffered from a number of self-inflicted challenges. The quality of its merchandise has taken a dive, fewer staff and frequent out-of-stocks have made its stores less enjoyable to shop in, customers and insiders told CNBC earlier this year. The retailer has also struggled to manage its inventory, which has impacted its profitability. 

All of these issues combined have left Target with a workforce that has grown faster than sales and a complex corporate structure that has hampered decision-making and created needless red tape. 

Between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024, Target's global workforce grew 6% from 415,000 employees to 440,000, but in the same time period, sales declined 0.8%, according to company filings. 

""The truth is, the complexity we've created over time has been holding us back,"" Fiddelke told Target employees in a memo when announcing the job cuts. ""Too many layers and overlapping work have slowed decisions, making it harder to bring ideas to life.""

He didn't cite AI in his memo but did say the cuts will help the company execute faster so it can better ""accelerate technology.""

In this article

Amazon is building a subsea fiber-optic cable called Fastnet to connect Maryland's Eastern shore to County Cork, Ireland, in what will be the company's first wholly-owned subsea cable project.

Subsea fiber-optic communication cables carry over 95% of international data and voice traffic across the globe. These cables transmit hundreds of terabits of data per second including government communications, financial transactions, email, video calls and streaming.

Amazon has invested in several subsea cable projects in the past, including Jako, Bifrost and Havfrue as part of a consortium, but Fastnet is the first time that the tech company undertakes one of these projects alone.

""Subsea is really essential for for AWS and for any connectivity internationally across oceans,"" Matt Rehder, Amazon Web Services vice president of core networking, told CNBC in an interview about Amazon's subsea cable investments.

""Without subsea you'd have to rely on satellite connectivity which can work,"" he said. ""But satellite has higher latency, higher costs and you just can't get enough capacity or throughput to what our customers and the internet in general needs.""

Amazon says that Fastnet's capacity will exceed 320 terabits per second, which is equivalent to streaming 12.5 million HD movies simultaneously. The company is building this cable to meet rising demand for cloud computing, artificial intelligence and edge applications that use Amazon Web Services.

Fastnet will also strengthen Amazon's network resilience. Amazon did not say how much Fastnet would cost to construct, but the company said it expects it to be operational by 2028. Other technology giants including Google, Meta and Microsoft have also been investing in subsea cable infrastructure.

Instacart on Tuesday launched a suite of artificial intelligence tools for grocers to deliver more personalized shopping experiences and improve retail operations.

CEO Chris Rogers told CNBC that the announcement is a major step forward in the company's enterprise strategy, which has grown to power hundreds of digital storefronts.

""It's taking everything that we've been building for retailers over the last decade, and it's bringing it into the AI era,"" Rogers said. ""It's really about putting enterprise-grade AI tech in every grocer's hands, whether it's a small, local independent or a national chain.""

The collection of new AI Solutions includes an AI shopping assistant that grocers can provide to shoppers for personalized meal planning, budgeting, and product recommendations.

Dubbed Cart Assistant, the agent can be used across retailers' websites through Instacart's Storefront Pro or integrated into the company's AI-powered shopping carts in-store, according to a release.

Sprouts Farmers Market and Kroger will be the first to roll out Cart Assistant on its website and app.

""AI is transforming the way people shop and today's customers want the experience to be more personal and intuitive,"" said Sprouts President and Chief Operating Officer Nick Konat in a release.

The suite also offers Store View, which provides grocers a real-time view of store shelves and uses images and videos to identify which products are running low or out of stock. Store View is already live with McKeever's and Good Food Holdings.

The lineup additionally includes an AI-driven catalog system and agentic analysis of retail data to provide business insights.

The online delivery firm is also working with AI companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and others to ""define how grocery shopping is going to work across the next generation of digital agents,"" Rogers said.

Instacart's new products are just the latest examples of generative AI's rising popularity within the retail industry. Amazon debuted an AI agent for third-party sellers in September, and Walmart launched ""super agents"" that cater to shoppers, sellers, and suppliers earlier this year.

Instacart shares took a hit after Amazon rolled out its same-day delivery service in August and faces competition from brick-and-mortar retail giants like Walmart and Target, which have their own delivery services.

However, Rogers said that Instacart is working with other grocers to help them compete against industry heavyweights.

""Our retail partners already look at look at us as their technology partner in the grocery industry, and they want to participate in the AI revolution the same way the largest players in the industry do,"" Rogers said.

Yum Brands on Tuesday announced it will explore strategic options for Pizza Hut.

""The Pizza Hut team has been working hard to address business and category challenges; however, Pizza Hut's performance indicates the need to take additional action to help the brand realize its full value, which may be better executed outside of Yum! Brands,"" Yum CEO Chris Turner said in a statement.

The company has not set a deadline or definitive timetable for the review process. While Yum did not specify what the review's ""range of strategic options"" include, potential outcomes could be an outright divestiture, a joint venture or the sale of a stake in the chain.

""We do think the business can be positioned for even greater success in the future,"" Turner said on the company's earnings conference call. ""In some markets, there may be a multi-year effort that is required to reposition it as the leading pizza brand in those markets, and it's possible that those efforts may best be done under a different structure, potentially under outside ownership.""

Pizza Hut has been a part of a triumvirate with KFC and Taco Bell for decades, dating back to when PepsiCo still owned the fast-food chains. The beverage giant spun off the restaurants in 1997, christening the new company Tricon Global, later renamed to Yum.

Tuesday's announcement caps years of struggle for Pizza Hut.

On Tuesday, Yum reported that the chain's same-store sales fell 1% during the third quarter, fueled by a 6% drop in its home market. During the same quarter, Taco Bell and KFC reported same-store sales growth of 7% and 3%, respectively.

Before the pandemic, Pizza Hut tried to shrug off its reputation as a dine-in venue and reposition itself as an option for pizza delivery and carryout in the U.S. When Covid-19 lockdowns shuttered restaurants, the chain saw its sales skyrocket, like the rest of its pizza industry. But once restrictions loosened, so-called pizza fatigue settled in, leading to another sales slump.

And now, with consumers dining out less often, Pizza Hut is facing increased competition for a smaller set of diners. The chain's share of the U.S. pizza market has shrunk from 22.6% in 2019 to 18.7% in 2024, ceding customers to rival Domino's Pizza, according to Barclays.

In the wake of the pullback in consumer spending, other restaurant companies have recently shed challenged parts of their businesses in an effort to improve their balance sheets.

Starbucks on Monday announced it is selling a majority stake in its embattled China business and will form a joint venture with Boyu Capital. Last month, Jack in the Box divested Del Taco for $115 million, well short of the $575 million it paid for the chain less than four years ago. And Krispy Kreme sold its remaining stake in Insomnia Cookies this summer to focus on growing its U.S. business profitably.

Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund said it will vote against Elon Musk's trillion-dollar pay package at Tesla's annual shareholder meeting this week, rebelling against management guidance and threats from Musk to step down if the deal is rejected.

Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), which manages the fund — the largest of its kind in the world, and a major shareholder in Tesla — said on Tuesday that it had already cast its vote against Musk's remuneration package as CEO of the carmaker.

""While we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk's visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk- consistent with our views on executive compensation,"" NBIM said in a statement.

""We will continue to seek constructive dialogue with Tesla on this and other topics,"" the fund's managers added.

Norway's wealth fund holds a 1.14% stake in Tesla, according to its half-year filings in June. The value of that investment was last declared to be 118.3 billion Norwegian kroner ($11.6 billion).

Tesla shares were 2.5% lower in premarket trade.

Tesla's Board of Directors is asking shareholders to approve a pay plan for Musk that could see him granted almost $1 trillion in stock and expand his voting powers at the company. The full award would be contingent on Tesla hitting certain milestones over the next 10 years.

The proposals have raised eyebrows and been met with opposition from some company watchers. Last month, the Take Back Tesla campaign — a coalition of unions and corporate watchdogs — urged shareholders to reject the deal, while proxy advisories Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis have also recommended investors vote against the compensation package.

Musk has hit back at those recommendations, labeling ISS and Glass Lewis ""corporate terrorists"" on an analyst call.

""Tesla is worth more than all other automotive companies combined,"" Musk wrote in a post on X last month in response to a critic of the pay proposal. ""Which of those CEOs would you like to run Tesla? It won't be me.""

Representatives for Musk and Tesla were not immediately available to comment on NBIM's vote against the proposed CEO compensation package.

However, Musk has butted heads with NBIM over his pay in the past.

Last year, NBIM voted against reinstating Musk's $56 billion pay deal after it was rescinded by a U.S. judge. The package — the largest public executive compensation plan in U.S. history — was ultimately approved by Tesla's shareholders.

Following the vote, the Financial Times and Norwegian newspaper E24 published text messages exchanged between Musk and NBIM Chief Executive Nicolai Tangen, which showed the Tesla CEO declining an invitation to a dinner in Norwegian capital Oslo.

""When I ask you for a favor, which I very rarely do, and you decline, then you should not ask me for one until you've done something to make amends,"" Musk reportedly wrote. ""Friends are as friends do.""

Musk is the world's wealthiest person, according to Forbes, with a net worth of $504.1 billion.

In this article

New York City voters will elect a new mayor on Tuesday, as two well-known Big Apple names strive to beat a relative newcomer, Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist whose sudden political ascendance has drawn attention nationwide.

Mamdani, the Democratic Party nominee, is facing off against former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a longtime Democrat running as an independent, and Republican Curtis Sliwa, founder of Guardian Angels.

The winner will replace New York's scandal-plagued mayor, Eric Adams, who dropped out of the contest in late September.

Mamdani, a state Assemblyman now in his third term, defeated the 67-year-old Cuomo in a stunning upset in June's Democratic ranked-choice primary.

Polls for the general election have consistently shown Mamdani leading the race.

Mamdani, a native of Uganda who became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2018, has called for a freeze in the rent of rent-stabilized apartments in the city, free public buses and the creation of city-owned grocery stores.

His platform and political worldview have sparked a backlash from city billionaires and other business interests, with anti-Mamdani political action committees raising more than $40 million to oppose his candidacy and back Cuomo.

Cuomo, who previously was U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, as well as New York state attorney general, resigned as governor in August 2021 after being accused by multiple women of sexual harassment.

Cuomo, whose father, Mario Cuomo, served three terms as the state's governor, has denied wrongdoing.

His campaign platform calls for increasing the size of the city's police department, deploying more officers in the city's subways, building more affordable housing and reducing school class size.

The former radio host Sliwa, 71, in his second campaign for mayor, has leaned heavily on issues surrounding public safety, and called for hiring 7,000 additional police officers.

Adams also had been running as an independent after skipping his Democratic Party's primary.

Adams' public approval ratings had plummeted after his indictment in 2024 on federal corruption charges, which were later dismissed by a judge at the behest of the Department of Justice following the return of President Donald Trump to the White House.

Adams last month endorsed Cuomo, whom he had recently called a ""snake and a liar.""

Since Adams' withdrawal, Sliwa has faced intensifying pressure to quit the race to boost Cuomo's chances against Mamdani.

Among those calling for Sliwa to drop out has been his fellow Republican, Trump, who has repeatedly and inaccurately claimed that Mamdani is a ""communist.""

In this article

Binance CEO Richard Teng has dismissed claims that the cryptocurrency exchange helped boost a Trump-backed stablecoin before former CEO Changpeng Zhao received a presidential pardon.

The claims in question relate to a $2 billion investment Binance received from Abu Dhabi's state-owned investment firm MGX. The deal was settled using USD1, a stablecoin created by the Trump family's crypto venture, World Liberty Financial. 

MGX's investment and Binance's subsequent listing of USD1 on its exchange helped bolster the stablecoin's usage and credibility, with some lawmakers and reports suggesting this may have influenced the pardon of Zhao, commonly known as CZ.

However, in a CNBC interview on Monday, Teng rejected the notion that Binance — the world's largest cryptocurrency firm — had given USD1 any preferential treatment.

""First of all, the usage of USD1 [for the] transaction between MGX as a strategic investor into Binance, that was decided by MGX ... We didn't partake in that decision,"" Teng said. 

He noted that USD1 had already been listed on other exchanges before Binance, adding that, as the ""largest crypto ecosystem in the world,"" the company regularly engages with promising new projects.

""Sometimes it works out. Sometimes it doesn't. In the case of USD1, I'm glad that both parties worked it out."" 

Teng's denials come after the Wall Street Journal reported last week that Binance not only facilitated the settlement of MGX's investment using USD1, but also assisted in building the technology behind the stablecoin, citing anonymous sources familiar with the matter.

The Journal also previously noted that World Liberty Financial benefited greatly from the listing of its USD1 token on Binance and a partnership with PancakeSwap — an online marketplace for cryptocurrencies said to be associated with Binance. 

Meanwhile, scrutiny of CZ's pardon and Binance's ties to the Trump-linked World Liberty Financial has continued to mount from opposition leaders on Capitol Hill.

Among the most prominent voices has been Sen. Elizabeth Warren, ranking member of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, who has accused Binance and the Trump administration of corruption.

In a statement last month, the vocal critic of the crypto industry said: ""First, Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty to a criminal money laundering charge. Then he boosted one of Donald Trump's crypto ventures and lobbied for a pardon,"" with the President later doing ""his part.""

Binance did not respond immediately to a request for comment. CZ stepped down as Binance chief executive in 2023, but remains the major shareholder of the company, according to Teng.

Critics have long questioned World Liberty Financial's open connections to the Trump administration as it seeks new partnerships and investors overseas.

According to World Liberty Financial's website, a Trump-affiliated firm called DT Marks DEFI LLC, along with members of the Trump family, receives a major share of the platform's revenue and holds digital tokens backing the company, known as WLFI. The firm has reportedly netted the Trump family hundreds of millions to billions in profits.

However, it also states that Trump, his family or any members of the Trump Organization or DT Marks DEFI LLC are not an ""officer, director, founder, or employee of, or manager, owner or operator of World Liberty Financial or its affiliates.""

MGX's purchase of $2 billion in USD1 tokens has also raised eyebrows after a New York Times report in September noted that it occurred two weeks before the White House signed a major agreement with the U.A.E. on access to hundreds of thousands of American microchips.

In a conversation with CNBC last month, Donald Trump Jr., the U.S. president's eldest son and a co-founder of World Liberty Financial, dismissed the reports and broader concerns about potential conflicts of interest.

He was joined by the firm's CEO, Zach Witkoff, son of U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, who said their fathers were not focused on nor directly involved in the business. 

Zhao was forced to step down from his role at Binance in 2023 after pleading guilty to enabling money laundering through the cryptocurrency exchange.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement on Oct. 23 that Zhao had been prosecuted under the Biden administration ""despite no allegations of fraud or identifiable victims.""

Trump later said he pardoned Zhao ""at the request of a lot of very good people"" and that he knew nothing about him.

Since returning to office, Trump has embraced the crypto sector, proposing new crypto legislation while rolling back enforcement actions that targeted crypto exchanges such as Coinbase and Ripple during the prior administration.

Speaking Monday, Teng said that Binance and the crypto industry ""were very thankful"" to the president for CZ's pardon and for signaling that the U.S. will be the ""global crypto capital of the world.""

To join the CNBC Technology Executive Council, go to cnbccouncils.com/tec

The recent wave of white-collar layoffs may have employees and job seekers rattled, but according to New York University Stern School of Business professor Robert Seamans, his current class of MBA students isn't worried.

""I don't get a huge sense that they're dreading the job market or that they think there are going to be dramatic changes,"" Seamans told a gathering of technology executives at last week's CNBC Technology Executive Council Summit in New York City. ""These students have been in the job market already before coming back to school and they're used to the ups and downs of being in the workforce.""

Seamans said his focus in the classroom is making sure students have the skills they need when they graduate, and that includes generative AI and more generally, machine learning. Running experiments using AI in group settings is one way he gets students used to the technology, its advantages, and its limits.

For instance, he recently asked students to write a short paper on whether return-to-office mandates are good or bad for the workforce. He then had them select a large language model of their choosing to strengthen their argument. The second part of the assignment had students writing another paper, but this time asking the LLM to respond in an adversarial way with critical feedback — what Seamans calls a ""black sheep"" approach.

""I'm trying to get them to understand that they can interact with AI in a variety of ways,"" Seamans said. He added that in his experiment, many of his students preferred the more adversarial way, perhaps because it more closely modeled the variety of opinions and thoughts in an actual workplace. ""We don't know what all the best practices are yet, but that's why I want them to keep trying different things,"" he said.

Earlier in the day at the TEC Summit, a group of students in high school and college spoke to CNBC's Contessa Brewer about how they're being exposed to AI (or not) in the classroom. Their responses show that despite the enthusiasm for the technology in the workplace, students are being advised to go slow.

Aarnav Sathish, a high school senior, said his teachers strictly discourage AI in the classroom. Outside of school, however, the 17-year-old uses ChatGPT for help with assignment busywork, quickly adding that he wants to use AI ""as a tool and not a crutch.""

Ezinne Okonkwo, a 19-year-old undergraduate at Columbia University, said her professors also discourage students from using AI, instead preferring that they develop the subject matter skills needed for each class. However, like Sathish, she uses AI outside the classroom for tasks that feel repetitive or that she already knows how to do. ""If I have to write a bunch of emails that all feel the same, I'll use it to make them sound a little different,"" Okonkwo said. ""I won't use it for coding if I don't already know how to do it in that coding language.""

Siblings Carson and Andrew Boyer both attend Georgia Tech, yet are having different experiences with AI. Carson, 19, a freshman, is studying engineering and said his professors allow AI in moderation. He finds it most useful for his Mandarin classes when he can use ChatGPT to practice having a conversation. ""It's like having a Chinese tutor,"" he said.

Andrew, 21, a senior, says his professors encourage AI usage, but they ""don't want us to copy and paste in AI work."" He was recently surprised when during a midterm exam for an information security class the teacher allowed students to use the internet and AI. While at first that seemed like a good thing, he soon realized that his professors set up the exam so that AI couldn't complete a lot of the more nuanced and visual questions.

""I think the class average was like a 60,"" Andrew said. ""At Georgia Tech, they are evolving and upping the work to be more high-level concepts that we have to be able to understand and do on our own.""

If there was one thing that NYU's Seamans wanted the room of tech executives to take away about the young people coming into their organizations, it's that despite the focus on AI, ultimately employers are dealing with humans that require empathy and understanding.

""Everyone coming into your companies all have their own human skill set,"" he said. ""Some are good speakers or group leaders, others are great at finance. What they all want is a chance to work with this technology and become a contributing member to whatever team they're on. AI is going to change, so what you really want is a workforce made up of active and engaged minds and a workplace where this kind of thinking is encouraged.""

In this article

Global markets may be due for a reality check after this year's relentless rally, as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley on Tuesday cautioned investors to brace for a drawdown over the next two years.

Equities worldwide have been soaring, hitting record highs this year, driven by AI-linked gains and expectations of rate cuts. Over the past month, key U.S. indexes have scaled new peaks, Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi have hit fresh highs, while China's Shanghai Composite has notched its strongest level in a decade on easing U.S-China tensions and a softer dollar. 

""It's likely there'll be a 10 to 20% drawdown in equity markets sometime in the next 12 to 24 months,"" said Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon at the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit in Hong Kong. ""Things run, and then they pull back so people can reassess.""

However, Solomon noted that such reversals were a normal feature of long-term bull markets, noting that the investment bank's standing advice to clients remains to stay invested and review portfolio allocation, not attempt to time markets.

""A 10 to 15% drawdown happens often, even through positive market cycles,"" he said. ""It's not something that changes your fundamental, your structural belief as to how you want to allocate capital.""

Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick, speaking at the same panel, said investors should welcome periodic pullbacks, calling them healthy developments rather than signs of crisis.

""We should also welcome the possibility that there would be drawdowns, 10 to 15% drawdowns that are not driven by some sort of macro cliff effect,"" he said.

Solomon and Pick's views come on the back of recent warnings by the IMF of a possible sharp correction, while Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey have also cautioned about inflated stock valuations.

Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley pointed to Asia as a bright spot in the next few years on the back of recent developments including the trade pact between the U.S. and China. Goldman expects global capital allocators to continue to be interested in China, adding that it remains one of the ""largest and most important economies"" in the world.

Morgan Stanley remains bullish on Hong Kong, China, Japan and India due to their unique growth stories. Japan's corporate-governance reforms and India's infrastructure build-out were singled out as multi-year investment themes.

""It's hard not to be excited about Hong Kong, China, Japan and India — three vastly different narratives, but all part of a global Asia story,"" Ted said. He highlighted the AI, EV and biotech sectors in China particularly.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) extended declines on Tuesday as investor concerns over the government shutdown and slowing economic growth led to a sell-off of the world's largest cryptocurrency.

The token declined more than 5% to hover near $101,000 per token, nearly 20% off its all-time high reached in early October.

Fundstrat head of digital assets Sean Farrell pointed out that ""whale selling,"" or investors with large holdings, had risen over the past few weeks, paving the way for weakness in the market.

""Whales — they continue to hammer price,"" Farrell said on Monday evening, noting billions in bitcoin have recently been moved from private wallets to exchanges, presumably to be sold.

Net sales from long-term holders have exceeded 1 million bitcoin since the end of June as wealth shifts to new owners, according to Compass Point analyst Ed Engel.

""While selling from Long-term Holders is a common feature in bull markets, retail spot buyers have been less engaged than prior cycles,"" Engel said in a note on Tuesday morning. He added that bitcoin ETF inflows have slowed in recent weeks.

""While we see support for BTC above $95k, we also don't see many near-term catalysts,"" he added. ""'Uptober' failed to materialize for the first time since 2018, which was followed by a 37% decline in November 2018.""

Data showing that the manufacturing sector contracted in October for an eighth straight month and a lack of breath in the overall equity market could also be spooking investors, along with Fed Chair Powell's noncommittal tone to a December rate cut following the central bank's policy meeting last week.

Strategists point to concerns about tightening market liquidity due to the government shutdown as spending from the Treasury General Account, essentially the government's checking account, remains stalled.

""The government shutdown's likely extension into December delays expected TGA drawdowns and stalls liquidity tailwinds that were expected to support risk assets into year-end,"" said Fundstrat's Farrell.

The strategist noted that an end to the shutdown would be a positive catalyst expected to drive crypto prices higher into year-end.

""I'm still optimistic for year-end,"" Farrell said. ""For now I think this is just some volatility that we're going to have to manage.""

Fundstrat predicts a price target range of $150,000-$200,000 for bitcoin by the end of the year.

Pebble to landslide, Bitcoin is approaching agriculture and its impact will be seismic, echoing the benchmarks of farming history, including cotton gin, steel plow, mechanization, and biotech crops. Or will it?

Only 10 years back, on the turnrow or at the seed house, the mention of Bitcoin elicited mockery. Five years back, laughter. Now? The derision is replaced by inquiry.

Cryptocurrency, as a store of value to a medium of exchange, is on an economic collision course with agriculture, set to change American farms forever, contends a growing chorus of voices within the ag chain.

“Bitcoin is an absolute agriculture necessity going forward,” says producer Zack Smith. “People just don't realize it yet. Soon, they will.”

First Bird to FlyBitcoin was created in 2009. In the eyes of critics, it was a lie agreed upon, or a pyramid built to topple. However, 16 years beyond Bitcoin's birth, the online currency, thriving beyond the fat fingers of government, is among the fastest adopted technologies in world history.

In extreme northcentral Iowa's Winnebago County, a stone's throw below the Minnesota line, Smith works 1,200 acres of row crops and raises a small amount of livestock. He doesn't flinch at the “first bird to fly takes all the arrows” maxim, whether innovating via wide-row corn, strip intercropping, stock cropping, or Bitcoin.

“It's just a matter of time for Bitcoin in agriculture, and I don't mean far off. In 10 or 15 years, Bitcoin could be a normal part of a farm transaction. It's a question of when critical inertia hits, but Bitcoin will be utilized by folks in agriculture in the near future.”

“The people at the top of agriculture in power, the CEOs, big-time commodity traders, and agribusiness, are looking at Bitcoin as a hedge against dollar debasement,” he continues. “Again, it's coming fast.”

Out of the chute, Smith sees Bitcoin as a store of value. “Look what's happened to land. So many outside investors have entered the market, producing inflated land values that make no financial sense with the value of what is being produced.”

“That's where I see Bitcoin making its first impact. As investors discover there's something better than land and just as finite, something you don't pay property taxes on, something you don't have to maintain, something that is portable, I think land prices will drop closer to utility value, allowing young farmers better opportunities to compete in the market.”

At present, income surpluses are akin to snowflakes in hell, but Smith urges producers to prepare for change. “For those who put their fiat money into Bitcoin, and are patient, I believe they'll be able to buy two to three times the land in the near future they would have otherwise.”

“The money printer isn't stopping,” he adds. “Bitcoin is the offramp to the debasement problem.”

Jumping the TreadmillA lone voice a decade-plus in the past, Vance Crowe has long been a proponent of Bitcoin in agriculture. Host of Ag Tribes and founder of Legacy Interviews, Crowe is adamant: Bitcoin is transformative for farming.

“Just a few years ago, people reacted negatively when I talked about Bitcoin. That's been replaced with genuine questions and consideration. Bitcoin is going to become deeply embedded in how the business of agriculture functions, and people who've been trying to preserve the value of their dollars are going to move those dollars out of land and into Bitcoin. Guys who've gotten a 6-7% return on land are looking over at Bitcoin and seeing a 65 percent return every year for the last 15 years. The wake-up is happening in real time.”

In March 2025, President Trump signed an order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Three months later, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) ordered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to develop plans toward the use of cryptocurrency as a mortgage loan asset.

“It's only a matter of time before ag lending starts realizing it's a lot better to collateralize loans with Bitcoin, than to do so with cattle or maybe even land,” Crowe projects. “If you collateralize a loan with cattle or land, if that person doesn't meet their obligations, the lender must assess, load, or sell. Only then does a lender get the money. Bitcoin bundles all of that into a 10-minute fix. Ag lending will become heavily enmeshed in Bitcoin.”

Government maintains the exorbitant privilege of seigniorage, i.e., printing reams of bills with no backing. Need more, print more. Conversely, Bitcoin is limited to a 21-million cap. Finite.

No central issuer; no board of directors; no CEO; and no marketing department. Just a vehicle, according to Crowe, carrying unprecedented opportunity for agriculture. “Farmers have been put in a position where they spend as much of the money they have coming in as possible, both for tax reasons, but also because the value of their dollars always goes down.”

(For a basic primer, see What is Bitcoin? The Explanation That Clicks)

“Bitcoin provides an unprecedented option where a farmer can say, ‘I've made this money and I don't want to risk its value. I'm putting it in Bitcoin.' That provides a way to jump off the treadmill of constantly buying new tractors, building more sheds, or constantly growing.”

Fundamental change is knocking, Crowe contends: “Five, 10, or 15 years, it's going to completely change agriculture's game.”

Proverbial LightbulbRaised in hardscrabble 1980s row cropping in southcentral Nebraska's Adams County, Kevin Kimle watched his father barter. Side of beef for a farm repair; load of pigs for a used semi.

“It's in our agriculture muscle memory: a means to trade in a different currency,” says Kimle, now an Iowa-based entrepreneur and agriculture economist, and founder of BitCorn. He serves as Rastetter Chair of Agricultural Entrepreneurship and director of agricultural entrepreneurship programs at Iowa State University.

“We're at the beginning of a transition to a Bitcoin standard not only in the U.S., but globally, and I think agriculture is a natural first mover on the leading edge of that transition.”

Practically, what does that mean to a farmer? A seventh saved, according to Kimle. As in, annually turning a seventh of a crop to Bitcoin, generating at least two crops worth of Bitcoin by the end of seven years.

He still owns farmland in Nebraska and began researching Bitcoin in 2021. “I'm about four years into this. But my own simulation, if I had sold 10% of my grain for Bitcoin instead of dollars, I'd have four years of crop in Bitcoin today.”

In summer 2025, Kimle set up a business bridge between Bitcoin and traditional agriculture—BitCorn—intent on giving farmers tools, basics, and the means to make transactions.

“The proverbial light bulb went off. At BitCorn, we're providing a place where a farmer can learn Bitcoin. Agriculture is packed with incredibly innovative entrepreneurs, and their ideas are going to take us down the Bitcoin road.”

Bitcoin trades 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and 365 days a year. “I view Bitcoin as one of the most important inventions in human history,” Kimle explains, “in the ballpark with the wheel, plow, printing press, electricity, and anything else.”

Our Children's MoneyDennis Campbell is at the helm of Crystal Creek Enterprises, in east Iowa's Clinton County, working with corn, soybeans and some wheat acres. Crystal Creekmanages a portfolio of 10,000+ acres of owned, rented and custom farmed land.

Starting in 1854, Campbell's forefathers scratched dirt outside Grand Mound, within proximity of the Mississippi River. His farming bloodline reaches back to Antebellum America, but although Campbell shepherds past legacy, his eyes are locked on the horizon. Internationally renowned for emerging technology, Crystal Creek is a consistent mecca for visiting ag delegations from Africa, Australia, Europe, and South America since 2013. In 2025, Campbell opened a BitCorn node on his farm. He jumped in the Bitcoin pool in 2023.

At present, Campbell estimates 85% of U.S. farmers take zero notice of Bitcoin. “They are nose to the grindstone, trying to juggle work, debt, equipment, and family, all while things get worse financially. I don't know any more than anybody else, but I believe Bitcoin, at a minimum, is becoming a major tool in the toolbox to protect ourselves against an out-of-control government.”

“Just look at crop insurance, alone,” he continues. “You can spend $45 to $55 an acre insuring 250-bushel an acre APH corn. That's crazy. I sure as hell won't make 50 bucks an acre this year. Even if Bitcoin only gave some independence back on crop insurance, that by itself is enough for me.”

Does Campbell see growers investing a seventh of a crop in Bitcoin?

“We've got to put a portion of our proceeds in. If I could do that and have sufficient comfort to lower my 85% revenue harvest priced option insurance policy to 70% and lower my cost from $50 bucks to $20, that's quite a savings account. Every year, regardless of how tight our belts are, we need to allocate a percentage of proceeds above and beyond our principal payments for land and green or red paint into something that can't be debased and diluted by runaway government spending by 535 people in Washington, D.C.”

Debt and the next generation loom large in Campbell's view of Bitcoin.

“We're spending our children's money now and that's what debt is. That's what debt creates—a burden on future society and on future fruits of labor. It's madness and we all talk about land as the best store of financial resources, but land is difficult to accumulate at a fractional pace. It's not easy to wake up and say, ‘I'm gonna go buy 80 acres today,' but there's a way to wake up and say, ‘I can buy $500 worth of something that'll hold value as good as or better than land.' Bitcoin.”

Adios to the Rulebook“The smartest thing somebody in agriculture could do is go down and borrow a bunch of money against traditional collateral and use that money to buy Bitcoin.”

Bold words. However, Matt Gilbert maintains Bitcoin future for agriculture is inevitable and backs his contention with receipts. Raised in the vast fields of Texas cotton country, Gilbert is an esteemed entrepreneur with specialization in mergers and acquisitions. He calls balls and strikes.

“Modern farmers invest heavily in equipment, infrastructure, and resources, yet the real paradigm shift lies in leveraging advanced financial tools. Up and down the agriculture supply chain, whether you're manufacturing machinery or distributing fertilizer, nearly every participant depends on traditional lines of credit,” Gilbert explains.

“Financing in dollars is trapped in a cycle of diminishing returns—a negative loop. But using Bitcoin as a store of value creates an entirely positive feedback loop. If you've held Bitcoin during any four-year window since its inception, historically your purchasing power has multiplied, matching up to nearly 12 times what a dollar-based payment could achieve. This shift isn't incremental—it's transformational for agricultural economics.”

Adios to land or physical assets as necessary collateral? Yes, Gilbert says. “Choose any era in history: mass-market automobiles, television, the arrival of the Internet. Bitcoin's adoption curve is exponentially steeper than any previous innovation. It stands alone as an asset that appreciates with unrivaled velocity, fundamentally altering the financial landscape for growers and agribusinesses.”

Agriculture trade is conducted via the U.S. dollar, which loses at least 3-5% per year in value. Tack on the price of inflation, and farmers see 10%-plus of dollar value slip away, annually. “Those numbers are incredibly disheartening,” Gilbert details. “For example, if someone got paid for a crop in 2023, sat on a little of the money, and decided to spend it in 2026, they're going to have somewhere between 25-40% less purchasing power with the dollars they saved. That's a giant problem. Bitcoin solves that problem.”

“The implication for farmers and ag professionals is clear: Understand the currency paradigm shift, because the money you're using, the dollar, is undermining your business more than you realize,” he says.

“My advice to those in agriculture is to leverage the advantages of both systems; pay expenses in dollars, but demand income in Bitcoin—the most secure and robust cryptocurrency. Weak currencies burden, but robust currencies liberate. It's time for agriculture to pivot toward strength.”

What about buying farmland? Tokenization, Gilbert posits. “It's already happening. Commercial real estate has been tokenized in the last couple of years. Agriculture assets are going to follow. Tokenization is the future, not theory. It's reality. Commercial properties have already been fractionalized on the blockchain (the network Bitcoin runs on), and agriculture is next in line.”

Think apartment complex or condo in New York City. The building can be bought by tokenizing the real estate, meaning multiple people buy a portion. One buyer in Kansas; another in Indiana; more elsewhere, all purchasing 500 square feet apiece via the blockchain.

“Imagine democratizing rural assets. A family in Iowa, an investor in Mississippi, and stakeholders from across the nation jointly tokenizing a farm. The blockchain ledger transparently records every transaction, making ownership, lending, and risk radically clearer and more efficient than ever before. This will overhaul deed registries, middlemen, banking, and title services, drastically cutting costs and speeding processes.”

Markets also benefit, Gilbert believes. A futures contract is typically bundled in lots of 100, whether hedging crops, fuel, or fertilizer. Bitcoin splits the bundle into fractions of 1 million. “Instead of the current way things are primarily done, which is 100 units equals a contract, Bitcoin breaks that into a million pieces instead of 100 pieces, which means a far more level playing field for the person in agriculture versus the person in finance.”

The next 15 years will be telltale, Gilbert predicts. “Having studied the Bitcoin space since 2013, I've witnessed digital currency realize in a decade what it took the dollar more than a century to accomplish, without systemic debasement. Within the next fifteen years, financial rules governing agriculture will be rewritten, marking a generational inflection point. Before my lifetime ends, the old playbook will be obsolete, and those prepared today will lead the charge into tomorrow's agriculture economy.”

What is Money?Bitcoin naysayers abound. Ponzi party. Bernie Madoff special. Dot.com crash all over again. Sam Bankman-Fried unleashed. Cinderella at midnight.

Pitfalls? Certainly. Black swans. Always.

The Trump administration has generated strong support for Bitcoin, but the perspective of subsequent administrations is unknown. What about the Bitcoin blockchain—how secure will it be in years to come?

However, bolstered by steady gains and landmark promise, the past 16 years of Bitcoin have shown otherwise, contend Crowe, Kimle, Campbell, Gilbert, and Smith.

A handful of years in the past, Smith was a Bitcoin scoffer. Scam. Scheme. Trainwreck.

No more. He now sees Bitcoin as bell cow.

“Whether Bitcoin is a store of value or medium of exchange in farming, it'll be one or both,” Smith concludes. “Over the last 10 years, I've asked myself the hard question, ‘What is money?' The best answer is to make the effort to find out for yourself. Go to Amazon and buy a copy of The Bitcoin Standard. Might be the most valuable $20 you'll ever spend. Why? Because Bitcoin is the currency of the future, and that includes agriculture.”

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin Price News: After $1B BTC Whale Sale, Will Bitcoin Stabilize and Ethereum's Ecosystem Priorities Boost Confidence?

Bitcoin enters November after posting its first negative October in six years.

The drop has sparked debate among traders about whether the pullback signals a deeper decline or a normal pause before the next move.

According to CoinGecko, the Bitcoin price is down about -4.4% in the past day and trades near $107,000.

That slide has helped pull the broader crypto market lower, with total value down 2.2% to $3.64 trillion.

The retreat triggered more than $1.16Bn in long liquidations on November 3, showing how quickly leverage has unwound across major venues.

The weakness came as global markets adjusted to shifting policy signals. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell confirmed the end of quantitative tightening and said rate cuts were coming.

But later comments cooled hopes for a cut in December, adding uncertainty and weighing on risk assets.

A long-silent Bitcoin wallet has also moved after nearly 14 years. The address transferred 10,000 BTC, first purchased for around $1.54 each, a crypto investor named Ted said.

The holder is believed to have sold the full amount today for roughly $1Bn, marking one of the largest profit-taking events linked to an early Bitcoin address.

On the charts, Bitcoin is now retesting a key support zone after pulling back toward a long-term blue moving-average line on the weekly timeframe.

The analyst noted that every major upswing since March 2023 has originated from this area, with past touches resulting in strong rebounds.

Bitcoin is trading close to $103,000, sitting just above its key moving average band at the same level.

A weekly close below this zone could signal that the rally is losing strength and open the door to a deeper pullback, possibly toward the $40,000 area.

If the trendline holds, the broader uptrend remains in place. In that case, analysts see room for a move toward $150,000 if buyers regain control.

Traders are watching how the market closes this week to get a clearer signal.

Meanwhile, the Ethereum Foundation has introduced a revised grant program designed to take a more proactive approach to ecosystem support.

The group paused new applications in August under its previous ESP framework, saying it needed time to reassess funding priorities.

It now runs through two paths: a “Wishlist” and a “Requests for Proposals” track.

The Wishlist points to broad areas where the Ethereum Foundation sees gaps worth addressing. The RFP route outlines specific problems and asks applicants to present practical solutions.

On the market side, Ethereum's weekly chart against Bitcoin shows the pair pulling back into a key demand zone near 0.032–0.035 BTC.

Analyst Michaël van de Poppe said the area offers a reasonable window for accumulation.

The pair has been sliding since its late-summer peak, giving back a strong 145% rebound from April. Price action is still forming lower highs, though the current pullback is nearing an earlier support area.

The 50-week moving average remains above the market, showing weakness. Trading volume is also waning, suggesting that selling pressure may be easing.

If this support holds, a short-term bounce is possible. But if buyers fail to defend the zone, the chart leaves room for a drop toward 0.026 BTC, with deeper levels around 0.022–0.019 BTC.

Ranked by total crypto holdings, Bitmine and Sharplink control the world's largest Ethereum treasuries, with 4,172,922 ETH worth over $14.5 billion between them.

Both firms embarked on an investment spree in recent months, hiking the cost basis of their treasury assets above their current market value. 

On average, Bitmine paid $4,037 per token, while Sharplink paid $3,609 per unit.

Moreover, with a bearish mood hanging in the air, many of their peers could also be in trouble.

A survey of companies with the largest Ethereum treasuries reveals that many of them racked up significant acquisitions in recent months.

With an average purchase price of $4,228,  according to CoinGecko data , Fundamental Global is among the deepest underwater. 

The Ether Machine (Average purchase price: $3,788) and Quantum Solutions ($4,069) are also in the red.

Meanwhile, companies like Bit Digital and GameSquare, which secured tokens below $3,000 on average, have more room to breathe.

While unrealized losses are hardly something to celebrate, Ethereum treasury companies are sticking to the popular crypto investment strategy and buying the dip.

For instance, despite sitting on paper losses, Bitmine has recently doubled down on its Ethereum strategy.

In the week starting Nov. 3, the firm purchased ETH worth $300 million, Arkham Intelligence data shows . 

Sharplink has also continued to stock up amid the market downturn, with a steady stream  of small purchases.

Edited by Harsh Notariya

Bitcoin has slipped deep into red territory, trading near $103,600 after losing over 10% in the past week. With traders bracing for a possible drop below the $100,000 mark, attention is turning to a different set of movers — altcoins that can benefit from a Bitcoin crash. 

While most tokens move in the same direction as BTC, a few are showing negative correlation or minimal, meaning they tend to rise when Bitcoin weakens. Here are three altcoins that could gain if the slide deepens this month.

Tezos is one of the first altcoins that can benefit from a Bitcoin crash. The smart contract platform, known for its self-upgrading blockchain and on-chain governance, has moved differently from most large-cap tokens this year. While many coins continue to mirror Bitcoin's direction, Tezos has shown signs of independence.

Over the past year, Tezos has held a –0.07 Pearson correlation with Bitcoin. This means it slightly moves in the opposite direction. The Pearson correlation coefficient measures how two assets move together, with +1 meaning they move the same way and –1 meaning they move opposite. With Bitcoin now hovering near $103,600 and facing pressure to stay above $100,000, Tezos's negative correlation suggests it could surprise traders if BTC breaks lower.

On the 4-hour chart, whale and smart money activity are turning positive. The Smart Money Index (SMI) — which tracks how informed or institutional traders position themselves — has started to rise, signaling renewed confidence. Similarly, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), a measure of large wallet inflows, remains below zero but is curling upward, hinting that accumulation may already be underway.

For price action, Tezos faces its first key resistance at $0.53. A move above $0.55 would confirm growing momentum, while a break past $0.58 could open the door to $0.60 and beyond. On the flip side, a drop below $0.51 would weaken the setup and invalidate the short-term bullish view.

If Bitcoin does slide below $100,000, Tezos's low correlation history and early accumulation trends make it one of the few altcoins likely to benefit.

Pi Network is another altcoin that can benefit from a Bitcoin crash, especially given its clear divergence from Bitcoin's trend. While Bitcoin has fallen nearly 10% this week, Pi has slipped by just 1%, indicating early signs of potential independence.

Over the past year, Pi Coin has shown a –0.30 Pearson correlation with Bitcoin, a much stronger negative correlation than Tezos. This suggests Pi Coin often reacts differently to Bitcoin's price swings, potentially rising when BTC weakens. If Bitcoin fails to hold above the crucial $100,000 level, PI's opposite movement pattern could help it attract rebound traders.

On the daily chart, PI shows a constructive technical setup. The Smart Money Index (SMI) remains above the signal line, meaning informed buyers haven't abandoned their rebound thesis yet. This suggests that despite broader bearish sentiment, smart money still expects a potential upside.

For price levels, Pi Coin must first reclaim $0.26 to confirm renewed strength. A breakout above $0.29 could then open the way for further gains. However, if Pi slips below $0.22, it risks testing $0.19, which would weaken the correlation-based bullish case.

Given its strong negative link to Bitcoin and early accumulation signs, Pi Coin remains one of the altcoins best positioned to benefit if Bitcoin crashes below $100,000.

Zcash rounds out the list of altcoins that can benefit from a Bitcoin crash, especially given how sharply its correlation with Bitcoin has shifted.

ZEC has long been one of the leaders in the privacy coin segment, often seen as a potential alternative to Bitcoin, per experts. Over the past year, its Pearson correlation coefficient with Bitcoin has averaged +0.28, meaning it has mostly moved independently. 

However, over the past month, that number has dropped to –0.55, showing that Zcash is now moving almost completely opposite to Bitcoin.

This negative shift suggests that if Bitcoin falls below $100,000, Zcash could be among the first to benefit.

On the price chart, ZEC has shown strong momentum. The token is up nearly 200% in the past month, while Bitcoin has dropped about 15.8%. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) remains well above zero at 0.18, signaling steady inflows from whales. CMF has been making higher highs since October 27, indicating that more large holders are adding positions.

If CMF crosses above 0.33, a level last seen on October 1, it would confirm aggressive whale accumulation. That would likely support another leg higher.

From a technical view, the Fibonacci extension pattern shows that Zcash's next key resistance sits near $594. A move above that would represent about a 23% gain from current levels and could keep the rally intact.

However, if ZEC falls below $341 or $245, it would weaken this bullish setup. That might also mean that Bitcoin may have avoided a deeper crash.

For now, Zcash remains one of the few altcoins with a clear negative correlation to Bitcoin. And it's supported by both strong inflows and a momentum-backed chart.

The crypto market is down sharply today, but a few alts are defying the sell-off.

The crypto market is bleeding today, with Bitcoin (BTC) down 3% and Ethereum (ETH) sliding 5% over the past 24 hours, while many altcoins are posting double-digit losses. However, some altcoins are bucking the trend — ICP, ZEC, and DASH continue to ride strong uptrends, showing notable resilience amid the broader market downturn.

Internet Computer (ICP) price has blasted past the $4.45–$4.70 historical zone, which had been capping upside momentum before the October 10 flash crash. 

The breakout from this zone — though not yet confirmed on the daily timeframe as the current daily candle still needs to close above it — follows a volume-backed breakout from a descending triangle pattern, which coincided with a bullish crossover between the 21 EMA and the 55 EMA on November 1.

Typically, descending triangles resolve to the downside, especially in bearish market contexts. However, in this case, ICP's upside breakout defies the typical bearish expectation. On the 4H timeframe, the trend remains firmly bullish, with price action maintaining a clear sequence of higher highs and higher lows, with the latest major swing low forming around $3.60. 

For continuation, ICP price needs to flip the previous swing high at $4.30 into support. Even if price dips lower, as long as it remains above the $3.60 swing low, the bullish sequence of higher highs and higher lows stays intact. Holding the 21 EMA as dynamic support would further strengthen the bullish case.

Zcash (ZEC) price has been trading within a well-defined ascending channel and the price is currently edging closer to the upper boundary of this channel, consolidating just below it on the 4H timeframe. The trend is supported by the 55 EMA, which continues to act as a reliable dynamic support currently near $375. 

However, volatility is weakening, with the BBWP indicator currently around 60% — noticeably lower than during the previous tests of the channel's upper boundary. 

As long as ZEC continues to trade within the ascending channel and holds above the 55 EMA, the broader trend remains firmly bullish. However, the sustained drop in volatility suggests that the trend may be maturing, with price action becoming more measured rather than impulsive.

Oops, something went wrong

An updated edition of the Sept. 10, 2025 article.Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, Dogecoin, XRP, stablecoins and other altcoins operate on blockchain networks, decentralized systems that leverage advanced cryptography to ensure secure, transparent and immutable record keeping. This tamper-resistant infrastructure continues to fuel widespread adoption and investor confidence.The regulatory environment is shifting in favor of digital assets. The GENIUS Act, passed on July 17, establishes a legislative foundation for stablecoins, which benefits the likes of Circle Internet Group CRCL that offers USDC. Pending measures — including the CLARITY Act and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act — suggest continued progress. In August, Wyoming announced its plan to issue its own stablecoin, the Frontier Stable Token. Illinois enacted the Digital Assets and Consumer Protection Act, which allows the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation to regulate and supervise digital asset exchanges and other digital asset businesses.U.S. policy direction under President Donald Trump has further supported the market. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Spring 2025 Regulatory Agenda introduces potential rules, including amendments to Exchange Act Rules to account for the trading of crypto assets on Alternative Trading Systems and national securities exchanges, as well as rules relating to the offer and sale of crypto assets. In September, the Nasdaq filed a Form 19b-4 with the SEC, proposing rule changes that would allow trading of equity securities and exchange-traded products (ETPs) in “tokenized form” (utilizing blockchain technology) on Nasdaq. This bodes well for major exchanges like Coinbase COIN, Robinhood HOOD and CME Group CME.Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, has been soaring due to increasing acceptance as a non-sovereign asset, as well as higher institutional and corporate adoption. However, volatility remains a headwind. Over the trailing 12 months, bitcoin has traded between a low of $67,839.67 and a high of $124,714.85. Over the past seven days, bitcoin has decreased 9%.

Circle Internet Group offers USDC stablecoin, which is redeemable on a one-for-one basis for U.S. dollars and is backed by reserves consisting of highly liquid, price-stable cash and cash equivalents. As of Oct. 30, $75.85 billion USDCs were in circulation, rising from $61.3 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2025. An expanding partner base, which includes the likes of Kraken, Binance, Corpay, FIS, Fiserv, OKX, Finastra and Fireblocks, is noteworthy. Circle's focus on developing USDC-based payment infrastructure is expected to boost growth prospects over the long term. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has now made Arc, its new open Layer-1 blockchain purpose-built for onchain financial applications and enterprise adoption, available for public testnet. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Circle has been taking initiatives to boost stablecoin adoption for payments. Arc supports programmable capital markets, global payments, and tokenized assets with predictable dollar-based fees, sub-second finality, optional privacy, and native integration with Circle's platform products, including USDC. Circle Payments Network is a platform for financial institutions to use stablecoins for payments, with more than 100 institutions in the pipeline. Circle Gateway, introduced in July, enables seamless cross-chain USDC usage and is currently supported by eight new blockchain partners. Coinbase provides financial infrastructure and technology for the crypto economy in the United States and internationally. This Zacks Rank #3 company is America's largest registered crypto exchange. Everything Exchange, a one-stop shop to trade every asset class, has been a key offering from Coinbase. In the third quarter of 2025, the company expanded spot coverage under the Everything Exchange platform. The integration of decentralized exchange has expanded access to tradable assets from about 300 to more than 40,000 in the U.S.In the third quarter of 2025, Coinbase expanded its derivative product portfolio with the launch of CFTC-regulated 24/7 perpetual style futures in the United States. The Deribit acquisition is noteworthy in this regard, as total derivatives volume is expected to jump manifold. Derivatives account for about 80% of all COIN's crypto trading volume. Stablecoin adoption also bodes well for Coinbase's prospects. In the third quarter of 2025, Coinbase customers held, on average, $15 billion of USDC on the platform. Coinbase expects fourth-quarter 2025 subscription and services revenues to be in the range of $710-$790 million, reflecting higher average crypto prices and the Coinbase One subscriber base.CME Group, the largest futures exchange in the world in terms of trading volume and notional value traded, is riding on record volume growth. CME Group leads with about 90% market share of the global futures trading and clearing services.In the third quarter of 2025, average daily volume of 25.3 million contracts represented the second-highest third-quarter average daily volume in CME's history. Strong customer base, reflected by quarter and year-end open interest of 126 million contracts, the highest open interest at the end of September in the past five years, reflects growing interest.CME Group's crypto complex traded a record 340,000 contracts per day in the third quarter of 2025 and jumped more than 225% year over year, driven by successful offerings of Solana and XRP futures. The company plans to offer 24/7 trading of cryptocurrency futures and options beginning early 2026.

For more than a decade, the world of digital currency has been built on a single foundation: the blockchain.

This complex, code-based system of distributed ledgers was a revolutionary approach to creating digital scarcity and preventing counterfeiting.

But now, researchers at Google are exploring a concept that could bypass it entirely, securing money not through a chain of code but through the fundamental laws of physics.

This new research into ""quantum money"" offers an alternative to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and targets the very problem a blockchain was designed to solve.

If successful—a big if, since it presumes advanced quantum computers—it would effectively obviate the need for a blockchain's core technology, representing a fundamentally different path toward a secure digital future.

In a new study, dubbed ""Anonymous Quantum Tokens with Classical Verification,"" researchers from Google Quantum AI, the University of Texas at Austin, and the Czech Academy of Sciences have advanced a decades-old idea for a theoretical currency secured by the unalterable laws of quantum mechanics.

The paper outlines a system where money is not just data on a ledger, but a unique quantum object whose integrity is guaranteed by the fabric of reality itself.

The concept hinges on one of the strangest and most powerful principles in physics: the “no-cloning theorem.”

This law states that it is impossible to create a perfect, independent copy of an unknown quantum state. While a string of data on a computer can be copied endlessly, a quantum state cannot.

“If you had a $1 bill that was actually a quantum state, you could prove, based on the properties of quantum mechanics, that copying such a state is impossible,” Dar Gilboa, a Google Quantum AI researcher and co-author of the study, told Decrypt. “You could only succeed with very small probability.”

In this system, counterfeiting isn't just computationally difficult, as in Bitcoin; it is physically forbidden.

This is where the technology becomes a direct threat to the blockchain model.

A blockchain's primary function is to prevent ""double-spend"" without a central authority. It does this by creating a massive, public, and unchangeable accounting book—the distributed ledger—that everyone watches.

Quantum money solves the same problem far more directly. You don't need a global ledger to track ownership history if the token itself is physically uncopyable and can only be spent once.

If each digital dollar has its own inherent physical security, the entire energy-intensive apparatus of a proof-of-work blockchain becomes redundant. Verification is a direct physical process, not a global consensus event.

While quantum money could replace blockchain's technology, it does not share its decentralized philosophy. Gilboa is quick to draw this distinction.

“We're not solving the same problem,” he emphasized. “What we're doing isn't decentralized, so it's not really an analog of cryptocurrencies in any strong sense.”

The Google model assumes a trusted central issuer, such as a bank, to create quantum tokens. However, it brilliantly uses physics to keep that issue honest.

The system is designed to provide a powerful privacy guarantee, preventing the bank from tracking its own currency. Users can team up to perform a ""swap test"" on their quantum tokens.

""If they're not... identical, that means the bank could be tracking you,” Gilboa said. Any attempt by the bank to secretly tag its money would be instantly revealed.

This financial revolution will not happen tomorrow.

Gilboa stresses that the research is entirely theoretical and far beyond current capabilities.

“It assumes not only that you have a large, fault-tolerant quantum computer, but also the ability to do quantum communication... a whole other set of very difficult engineering challenges,” he said.

Even so, the research is profoundly important.

It shows that the defining technological solution of the last decade—the blockchain—is not the only answer to securing digital value. The brute-force accounting of a distributed ledger could one day be replaced by the elegant and absolute laws of the quantum realm.

“It's this crazy tool,” Gilboa concluded. “You can do all these wild things. It's high risk, high reward—but that's what makes it exciting.”

                Delta, BC
            

VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Nov.  04, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DMG Blockchain Solutions Inc. (TSX-V: DMGI) (OTCQB US: DMGGF) (FRANKFURT: 6AX) (""DMG""), a leading vertically integrated blockchain and data center technology company, announces it has signed a letter agreement (the “Letter Agreement”) and paid a deposit to purchase a 27,600 square foot building situated on 8 acres of leased land with an option to lease an additional adjacent lot of 10 acres. The building is currently connected to 3.75 megawatts of power, while DMG is having ongoing expansion discussion with the local utility. Closing of the transaction is subject to the parties executing definitive agreements. DMG expects to close this transaction in the coming weeks.

The property is located in Boardman, Oregon, which is the site of at least five large scale fully operational Amazon Web Services (AWS) facilities with a similar number of AWS data center facilities under construction. As such, DMG is situating itself in a data center hub that offers access to ample connectivity and power, as affirmed by the Company's discussions with the local utility, which supports the Company's longer-term data center expansion strategy over the next several years.

Expansion to the US complements strategy to lead development of Canadian sovereign AI infrastructure

While DMG is focused on building out AI infrastructure in Canada, having just recently announced that it has formed a utility joint venture with the Malahat Nation pursuant to the previously announced MOU to power its future 15-megawatt data center on Vancouver Island, the Company recognizes it has a much larger opportunity to its immediate south. While DMG may initially set up a limited amount of Bitcoin mining at the site subsequent to deal closing so that it can utilize its power allocation as soon as possible, it intends to expand its available power over time while upgrading its infrastructure so that the facility can become one of its major high-performance computing (HPC) data centers.

The existing building may be retrofitted to support development of an HPC data center, or new HPC data center facilities may be built on the 18-acre site. As power density for the silicon to run the most advanced HPC applications is expected to exceed 1 megawatt per rack by the end of the decade, DMG expects that power availability, not land, will be its primary constraint to expand for the foreseeable future.

Sheldon Bennett, CEO of DMG Blockchain Solutions, commented, “This intended purchase marks a major milestone in the development of DMG, as it would be our first owned facility outside of Canada. Our focus in Canada is initially to serve the Canadian government's goal to build AI data centers that keep the models and data within Canadian sovereign borders. In parallel, DMG intends to service the enterprise data center market, initially in Canada but over time to service the larger opportunity in the US. In order to be able to capitalize on that larger opportunity, DMG needs to start building now.”

October 2025 Preliminary Operational Results

DMG also announces its preliminary operational results for October 2025:

In October 2025, DMG's hashrate was 1.75 EH/s, compared to 1.65 EH/s in September, as the Company benefited from seasonally cooler temperatures. At the end of October, DMG held 359 BTC, as it continued to limit its bitcoin liquidations to rebuild its bitcoin balance.

Key Takeaways

Miami-based non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea is launching its own token, $SEA, which will go live in Q1 2026. 

Announced by CEO Devin Finzer, the token appears to be far more than a hype airdrop, rather OpenSea's pivot from an NFT platform to a fully featured avenue for token trading. 

The timing of the launch also reflects broader shifts in the crypto landscape. As NFT trading volumes have fluctuated, OpenSea has sought to diversify beyond art and collectibles, expanding into multi-chain token trading, staking mechanisms, and utility integrations that could rival decentralized exchanges. 

The introduction of $SEA will serve  as both a governance and utility token, offering holders a stake in OpenSea's ecosystem and a say in future development decisions.

2021's NFT boom made OpenSea the place to be when it comes to tokenized art, though January 2022, when it cleared $5 billion across Ethereum and Polygon, solidified OpenSea's appeal.

However, this popularity didn't last. OpenSea reached peak traffic in December 2022, yet those numbers have slowly dropped since. But that's not OpenSea's fault. Competition with other token platforms and a broader NFT market downturn led to traffic and trading volumes far below such highs. And either way, page views don't pay the bills when you're running a marketplace. Sales do. 

Essentially, these drops highlight a key issue: OpenSea needs more than NFTs to thrive. SEA, after all of its rumors, is the answer.

While Finzer's post  doesn't detail everything about SEA, it outlines a token embedded in the marketplace experience, providing the following features: 

It allows users to stake SEA behind NFTs and collections, earning returns on successful projects. It's also a method of signaling support for projects one believes in, and can bring awareness to meaningful collections, snowballing support.

The OpenSea Foundation will allocate 50% of SEA's total supply to the community, with a significant amount rewarded right at launch. Early OpenSea adopters and OpenSea rewards participants will earn more at a later date.

On its surface, this approach ensures legacy collectors and modern traders both benefit. It mirrors successful models like Uniswap's UNI airdrop.

If you were trading NFTs on OpenSea in 2021 or 2022, your wallet may qualify for an initial SEA claim, but if you only started using the platform in 2024, you can still earn SEA later through continued participation or via staking.

Finzer also claims that 50% of OpenSea's revenue at launch will be used for SEA buybacks.  

Imagine OpenSea generates $20 million in trading fees during SEA's first month. Under its buyback model, $10 million of those fees would go toward purchasing SEA for the platform's treasury. This will reduce SEA's circulating supply and potentially cause its price to jump, similar to how Binance and MakerDAO held periodical buybacks and token burns to support long-term value.

OpenSea's approach appears counter to that of competitor NFT marketplace, Blur, and its handling of tokens. Blur's token launch approach rewarded trading activity with points and airdrops. It's an effective approach, but it also encourages wash trading. Because traders earn through volume, they may invest in projects solely to earn rewards, rather than to support the collection. As you can probably imagine, rewards farming isn't a reliable success indicator.

Of course, much is still unknown about OpenSea's long-term approach. Most of what one can derive is from Finzer's X post. Here's what we don't know:

OpenSea dominated the first NFT cycle, and SEA is its bid to enter the on-chain trading era. If OpenSea executes staking as a genuine curation signal and reports buybacks transparently so users can verify its claims, SEA may very well be the solution OpenSea is looking for. But for now, keep your expectations in check until more details arrive.

If OpenSea can deliver on its promises, implementing staking as a genuine curation and discovery tool rather than just a yield mechanic, and conducting transparent, verifiable buybacks tied to real platform revenue, $SEA could become the linchpin that redefines how marketplaces reward participation and build community trust.

Still, much remains speculative. Tokenomics, buyback structure, and regulatory clarity are all unanswered questions. Until those details surface, it's wise to temper expectations. The vision is ambitious and potentially transformative, but as with every new chapter in crypto, execution will determine whether $SEA becomes OpenSea's rebirth or just another token in the tide.

What chains will SEA launch on?


Not announced. OpenSea has only said that SEA is coming in Q1 2026 and will be “deeply integrated” in OpenSea.




Will OpenSea publish a real-time buyback dashboard with transaction hashes and totals?


OpenSea hasn't promised a dashboard, only that 50% of platform revenue at launch will be set for buybacks. This is a key item to watch.




How will SEA governance work?


There will likely be some form of governance for token holders, but what that means isn't public. Watch for a governance section in the whitepaper or OpenSea documentation.




Will SEA require a know-your-customer (KYC) opt-in?


This is unknown, but OpenSea does not require KYC to browse, list, or trade NFTs as of now. It's a self-custodial exchange.

Pudgy Penguins, originally a popular NFT collection, has taken significant steps in its expansion by partnering with Dreamworks Animation, specifically leveraging the beloved “Kung Fu Panda” franchise. This collaboration is part of Pudgy Penguins' strategic effort to integrate further into the broader culture through various media connections and partnerships.

Over the past year, Pudgy Penguins has effectively ventured into the gaming industry. The brand collaborated on the Roblox game “Steal A Brainrot” and engaged with NASCAR, marking its entry into mainstream gaming. Additionally, August witnessed the launch of their mobile game “Pudgy Party,” developed with Mythical Games. The game rapidly achieved widespread recognition, garnering one million downloads in less than a month post-launch, demonstrating the brand's growing influence in the gaming community.

Since its inception as an 8,888 NFT collection on the Ethereum blockchain in 2021, Pudgy Penguins has evolved significantly, especially after its acquisition by Luca Netz in 2022. The brand's portfolio now includes physical toys, games in both web2 and web3 formats, and its latest venture into major film animation through the collaboration with Dreamworks.

Amid these developments, the PENGU token, introduced at the end of 2024 to support the evolving Pudgy Penguins ecosystem, has encountered market volatility. Despite the significant partnership announcement with “Kung Fu Panda,” the token's value has declined by 25% over the previous week. Since its launch, PENGU has fallen by 76% from its initial price. However, it has seen a remarkable recovery of 340% from its all-time low, highlighting the volatile nature of cryptocurrency investments tied to popular culture and media projects.

The crypto market has seen its share of hyped launches, but only a few have the numbers and utility to back them up. BlockchainFX has already crossed the $10 million presale milestone, and traders are beginning to notice something different about this one.

The project promises what so many have been waiting for – one platform that connects crypto with global financial markets.

BlockchainFX was built to simplify how people trade across multiple assets without juggling five different apps. The team behind it calls it the first “crypto trading super app”, where users can trade everything from Bitcoin to oil to stocks – and earn rewards in return.

BlockchainFX brings more than 500 assets together in one platform. Traders can move between crypto, stocks, forex, ETFs, and even bonds without jumping from app to app. It makes trading across different markets simple and open to everyone, even beginners.

Every trade on the platform helps fuel the ecosystem. Traders earn daily staking rewards in both BFX and USDT, taken from up to 70% of the trading fees shared with the community. That means every transaction benefits active traders and holders alike.

Security is also a major focus. BlockchainFX uses advanced protection systems and institutional-grade encryption to keep funds safe. The platform has been independently verified for security, ensuring both transparency and trust. The team's experience in fintech adds another layer of credibility – this is not an anonymous or experimental project.

Visit BlockchainFX Presale

The main idea behind BlockchainFX is simple: unify global markets through crypto. In today's trading world, crypto and traditional markets are more connected than ever. Stocks react to Bitcoin news, and oil prices often influence crypto trends.

Yet, traders still struggle to move between these markets smoothly. BlockchainFX solves this problem with a single system that connects them all.



Users can swap instantly between asset classes. For example, a trader can exchange gold for Bitcoin, then switch to a tech stock or a trending token within seconds. This flexibility is what gives BlockchainFX its edge – it allows traders to move where the opportunity is, without delay.

Unlike most tokens that rely only on hype, BFX has real utility. The token fuels trading rewards, supports governance, and drives liquidity on the platform. Holders can stake BFX for passive income and participate in shaping new listings, features, and reward systems.

This structure turns active traders into long-term stakeholders, building a loyal and engaged community around the platform.

The presale phase has already become one of the year's fastest-growing token events. BlockchainFX reached the $10 million mark with thousands of registered investors worldwide. The token price remains in its early stage, creating a rare opportunity before the listing phase begins.

Each presale round increases slightly in price, rewarding early participants with better entry positions. The funds raised are being used to expand global operations, improve trading infrastructure, and enhance liquidity partnerships.

As per the project's roadmap, 2025 will bring new listings, influencer collaborations, and mobile app releases aimed at millions of users.

The platform's referral and staking systems have also played a role in the presale's momentum. Users can invite others to join and earn bonuses in both BFX and USDT, boosting the community's growth naturally. This model creates a cycle where the more people trade, the more rewards everyone earns.

As part of an ongoing promotion, the “EXTRA30” code gives an additional 30% in BFX tokens.



BlockchainFX aims to connect every major market under one system that values speed, fairness, and shared growth. BlockchainFX combines real use cases, community-driven rewards, and a team with solid experience – qualities that many new ICOs still lack.

The whitepaper outlines bold goals: revenue reaching $1.8 billion and a user base of 25 million by 2030. These targets fit with the direction crypto is taking, where traders prefer platforms that offer real earning potential and greater control.

For now, all eyes are on the end of the presale and the first exchange listing, which will mark the project's next big step. Early holders could see strong demand once the token goes public. As BlockchainFX continues to expand into new markets and add more assets, it could become one of the most practical trading platforms of the decade.

BlockchainFX represents a simple idea done right: trade anything, earn daily, and stay connected to every market from one platform. With $10 million already raised and growing momentum, this ICO might just be the one to watch before prices move higher.

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) is calling for views on new guidance setting out how it approaches investigations and takes enforcement action.

The guidance aims to increase transparency about the process the ICO follows when it suspects an organisation has failed to comply with its legal obligations to protect people's personal information under the UK General Data Protection Regulation and Data Protection Act 2018.

Tim Capel, ICO executive director, regulatory supervision, said: “The new guidance is significantly more detailed than the previous guidance on our approach to investigations and enforcement.

“It clearly sets out the processes we follow and the factors we consider when using our powers. We hope that this additional clarity and transparency is welcome. We're keen to hear from law firms, data protection officers, privacy professionals and anyone else with an interest on what they think about the draft guidance.”

Among other things, the guidance explains:

While there remain some differences, the ICO proposes to generally take the same approach to the use of its powers in relation to PECR as set out in the draft guidance in relation to the data protection legislation.

The consultation will run for 12 weeks until Friday 23 January 2026, and can be accessed here.

Recently, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) team celebrated a milestone: the token was formally listed under the Consumer and Culture sector of the joint Grayscale Investments/FTSE Russell crypto index framework. In essence, what began as a playful meme coin is now acknowledged, at least in classification terms, as part of the institutional landscape of digital assets. That doesn't guarantee money will flood in overnight, but it does shift how the project is framed in investor minds.

However, as SHIB earns its stripes, Remittix (RTX), a fast-rising payments project, is quietly approaching a massive $28 million ICO milestone, suggesting investors may already be positioning for the next big trend beyond hype tokens.

For a project born out of meme culture, Shiba Inu's inclusion in FTSE Russell's Digital Asset Index and Grayscale's revised portfolio baskets is no small feat. The validation effectively places SHIB in the same analytical space as blue-chip cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum; a major leap for a token once dismissed as speculative fluff.

Institutional tracking doesn't mean mass inflows overnight, but it does shift perception. SHIB's addition to indices allows ETF issuers, funds, and portfolio managers to justify exposure, opening doors to new capital in the long term. 

On the price front, SHIB remains in a consolidation phase: recently trading at around $0.000010–$0.000011, according to on-chain trackers. Sentiment appears cautiously better; team publications note that September and October saw upticks in network action, such as learning-node deployments on the Shibarium layer-2. 

While SHIB is being celebrated for its legitimacy, Remittix is carving out recognition through fundamentals. Designed as a next-generation remittance and cross-border payment solution, Remittix has been steadily raising funds, nearing $28 million in its ICO, a milestone that signals significant investor confidence.

Where Shiba Inu thrives on community energy, Remittix's growth story is rooted in purpose. Its framework integrates instant fiat-to-crypto transfers, low-cost global settlements, and partnership pathways with fintech operators; a rare combination in a space often dominated by speculation. In parallel, the Remittix campaign has hit noteworthy milestones, raising over $27.9 million and selling more than 683 million tokens. 

Its backers appear to be a blend of savvy retail and early institutional participants, drawn less by hype and more by its payment-rails narrative. Many analysts now regard RTX as a rare crypto project aiming for everyday use cases (crypto-to-bank transfers in 30 + countries) rather than viral momentum. And with crypto sentiment improving into 2025, payment-focused projects like this are finding strong traction.

Shiba Inu's institutional recognition is a symbolic win; proof that the meme era can coexist with mainstream adoption. However, real-world use cases still matter, and that's where Remittix stands out. As global payments move toward decentralized rails, RTX's focus on real economic value may give it the edge in long-term sustainability.

The proposal is contained in the draft Enforcement Procedural Guidance which is out for consultation, and also reflects the changes to the regulators powers in the data protection legislation following the Data (Use & Access Act), which have either come into force or are expected to come into force in the coming months.
The move is designed to bring the ICO in line with other UK regulators like the Financial Conduct Authority, Prudential Regulatory Authority and the Competition & Markets Authority.
Discounts will be structured by stage: up to 40% before notices of intent, 30% after notices but before written arguments, and 20% after written arguments are submitted.
The settlement procedure aims to streamline investigations, which will save resources and allow the ICO to resolve cases faster. It will also save mounting costs of potentially lengthy appeals.
According to the ICO's 2024/25 annual report, the regulator spent £1.3m on legal fees, although this was substantially down on the previous year when the bill came in at £3.5m.
To receive the discount, companies would need to admit the full nature, scope, and duration of their data protection infringements and waive their right to appeal the decision to the First-tier Tribunal.
The ICO has, in practice, already entered into settlements in the past, with recent cases like those involving Capita and Advanced Computer Software Group receiving significant effective discounts for cooperation.
However, the proposed changes would make this standard practice.
ICO executive director of regulatory supervision Tim Capel said: “The new guidance is significantly more detailed than the previous guidance on our approach to investigations and enforcement.
“It clearly sets out the processes we follow and the factors we consider when using our powers. We hope that this additional clarity and transparency is welcome. We're keen to hear from law firms, data protection officers, privacy professionals and anyone else with an interest on what they think about the draft guidance.”
The consultation runs until January 23 2026.

Hong Kong is preparing to issue its third digital bond this month, a green bond denominated in USD, EUR, RMB and HKD. The RMB and HKD legs can be settled using tokenized central bank money. Yesterday the Hong Kong Monetary Authority confirmed that Project Ensemble, which includes a wholesale CBDC, will start live pilots.

A few other countries have conducted similar transactions. The Swiss National Bank has a long term pilot wholesale CBDC which is issued on the SIX Digital Exchange platform and has been used to settle several bond issuances. During last year's Eurosystem DLT settlement trials, a wholesale CBDC from the Banque de France was used to settle several transactions, including the first digital bond issuance by an EU state, Slovenia.

Beyond the central bank money aspect, the three major ratings agencies have rated the digital native note as equivalent to other conventional bonds issued by Hong Kong SAR. But they had different rationales.

The experiment demonstrates how distributed ledger technology can streamline cross-border settlement processes.

Brazilian digital bank Banco Inter has completed a blockchain-based international trade finance pilot with Chainlink, the Central Bank of Brazil, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. The experiment demonstrates how distributed ledger technology can streamline cross-border settlement processes.

The pilot operated under Phase 2 of Brazil's Drex central bank digital currency project, simulating export transaction settlements between Brazil's Drex network and Hong Kong's Ensemble platform. The Ensemble platform represents a blockchain system developed through the HKMA's Project Ensemble initiative.

Chainlink provided the interoperability infrastructure that connected the two networks, according to Banco Inter. The bank has previously collaborated with Chainlink, including participation in an earlier Phase 2 pilot of Brazil's Drex digital currency project.

Banco Inter stated that the platform supports tokenized payments and automates title transfers through smart contracts, reducing costs and risk while opening international market opportunities to small- and medium-sized businesses. Financial institution Standard Chartered also participated in the pilot.

Trade finance encompasses the credit and payment arrangements enabling importers and exporters to conduct international business, representing one of the more complex segments of global commerce. The pilot indicates such processes could be automated through blockchain technology to synchronize goods movement, payments, and title transfers.

Brazil's central bank has accelerated its digital currency pilot over the past year as it develops a synthetic digital real combining programmability, privacy, and decentralization. The initiative emerges amid a rapid shift toward digital payments and growing stablecoin adoption in Brazil.

Central Bank of Brazil President Gabriel Galípolo said at a conference in February that approximately 90% of crypto transactions in the country involve stablecoins. Brazil ranks fifth globally in crypto adoption, supported by stablecoin transactions and access to retail and DeFi services, according to Chainalysis.

Although Drex is commonly described as a central bank digital currency, Galípolo characterized it as an infrastructure project designed to expand credit access and modernize Brazil's financial system, according to Reuters.

President Donald Trump recently remarked that “China is getting into it very big right now,” referencing the country's deepening involvement in bitcoin and digital assets, despite a mainland ban on trading and mining since 2021.

The People's Bank of China enforced a sweeping prohibition on all bitcoin transactions and mining operations in September 2021, driving exchanges offshore and curtailing domestic activity.

However, this ban did not eliminate the underlying demand for capital mobility and alternative settlement methods.

Many of these activities have shifted to Hong Kong's more permissive environment or into gray market stablecoin channels.

Hong Kong has taken a contrasting approach by launching a licensing framework for virtual asset trading platforms and approving spot bitcoin ETFs in 2024.

The city's Securities and Futures Commission recently expanded access, allowing platforms to tap global liquidity pools, making Hong Kong a regulated gateway for institutional and retail investors.

These developments blur the lines between Hong Kong and mainland policy, fueling perceptions of unified Chinese advancement in bitcoin markets.

Beijing's e-CNY pilot has become the world's largest central bank digital currency project, surpassing ¥7 trillion in cumulative transactions by mid-2024. Hong Kong now accepts e-CNY, further integrating Chinese digital currency infrastructure with global finance.

At the same time, Chinese exporters are increasingly using stablecoins like USDT for cross-border payments, taking advantage of enforcement gaps and necessity, even as such activity remains officially unsanctioned.

Although the 2021 crackdown slashed domestic bitcoin hash rate, China's influence persists through its dominance in mining hardware production, with firms like Bitmain supplying global networks.

Cambridge data indicates some mining operations continue in remote Chinese provinces or via relocated hardware overseas.

Trump's comments, while simplifying, reflect a multi-jurisdictional Chinese presence in digital assets: a mainland ban, Hong Kong's regulatory carve-out, a massive CBDC rollout, and ongoing commercial stablecoin and mining activity.

As stablecoins reshape global payment infrastructure, three leading voices explore the critical decisions facing financial institutions today.

Anthony Yeung, Chief Commercial Officer at CoinCover, Retno Widuri, Head of Crypto at Unlimit, and Jeremy McDougall, Strategic Solution Consulting Director at ACI Worldwide, examine whether traditional banks should compete with or integrate this emerging technology.

The discussion addresses the industry's pivotal shift from cost reduction to speed prioritisation, the implications of divergent US and EU regulatory frameworks and the geopolitical significance of stablecoins in maintaining dollar dominance.

As customers increasingly retain funds in digital assets rather than local currency, our panellists debate the new business models required for banks to remain relevant while balancing innovation opportunities against compliance and reputational risks.

Anthony Yeung, CCO at CoinCover

Traditional banks are already likely to be fully integrated with existing payment rails and networks. Stablecoins provide an opportunity to add to those rails, whether for the bank's own benefit or for their customers. The question is perhaps not whether to integrate, but rather what form that integration would take and how it would surface in the bank's product suite.

Retno Widuri, Head of Crypto, at Unlimit

It's clear that banks can no longer sit on the sidelines. Stablecoins are already becoming a backbone of global payment infrastructure. Standing still is the most dangerous strategy of all. 

The priority is for banks to innovate and find where they can add value - from turning stablecoins into yield-bearing treasury products to offering custody, compliance, and instant settlement services. 

Working with fintech partners will hold the key. This will enable banks to adapt and stay at the heart of this transformation rather than risk being left behind. 

Jeremy McDougall, Strategic Solution Consulting Director at ACI Worldwide 

Traditional banks should not view stablecoins as competition, but as infrastructure to be integrated. They are already moving from fringe potential to mainstream usage, and their programmability and low-cost settlement offer clear advantages. 

Stablecoins shouldn't be seen as an ‘either-or' proposition. The real question isn't which payment type will “win”, but how they can co-exist to deliver reliability, stability and choice for consumers. 

Financial institutions must step away from a single-rail mindset and instead build strategies that treat the likes of stablecoins, tokenised bank deposits and real-time payments as complementary tools. Integrating stablecoin infrastructure now will help banks remain competitive and resilient as the payments landscape evolves.

Retno Widuri, Head of Crypto, at Unlimit

For decades, cross-border payments were about cutting fees. Now speed has become the new currency in global transactions. Faster speeds mean greater working capital. This in turn enables businesses to maintain smoother daily operations and affords them the liquidity to remain flexible to new opportunities. 

But speed is only as good as the infrastructure behind it. For stablecoins to deliver on their promise, businesses need rails that offer instant conversion, robust custody, and built-in compliance. When these pieces come together, businesses can keep funds productive - even holding them in yield-bearing form right up to the moment of payment. 

Jeremy McDougall, Strategic Solution Consulting Director at ACI Worldwide 

Stablecoins are reshaping cross-border payment strategies by shifting the focus from cost-efficiency to speed, flexibility, and reliability. This change means financial institutions must move beyond traditional corridors and embrace real-time orchestration across multiple payment rails.

The reason is clear: the programmability functionality that stablecoins enable, allows for the pain points seen in traditional correspondent banking to be identified and addressed prior to settlement. In addition, stablecoins enable settlement in minutes and can reduce transaction costs by up to 80% compared to legacy systems. 

But more importantly, they bypass fragile local banking infrastructure, as seen in Africa where private firms are using stablecoins to pay foreign suppliers quickly and reliably.

Anthony Yeung, CCO at CoinCover

Universal legislation would be ideal, but is unlikely, and stark differences are already emerging in how jurisdictions view and attempt to control stablecoins.

Traditionally, multinationals have operated under the rules of the most stringent regulator, on the basis that if that regulator is satisfied, jurisdictions with less stringent requirements would also be likely to be satisfied, a form of universal compliance framework.

Given the differences in how regulators are approaching stablecoins, however, this approach is not likely to work. Certain elements, such as KYC and AML provisions, are well established, well understood, and readily applied universally across jurisdictions.

Retno Widuri, Head of Crypto, at Unlimit

Regulatory arbitrage is short-term thinking. While the US has significantly advanced stablecoin legislation this year, and MiCA has created the first licensed players in Europe, businesses need to make sure that they think long-term. 

Multinationals can't afford to navigate a patchwork of regulatory frameworks - they want clarity and certainty. Universal compliance is the foundation for scale, giving businesses confidence to expand across borders without constantly reworking their approach for each market. 

Trust is a global asset – it's a language everyone understands. Regulatory arbitrage may win you a quarter, but only a universal compliance standard will win you a decade. 

Jeremy McDougall, Strategic Solution Consulting Director at ACI Worldwide 

Rather than pursuing regulatory arbitrage, multinationals should focus on building universal compliance frameworks that enable interoperability and future-proof their operations. If we look at AI, which quickly moved from unregulated uncertainty to mainstream adoption, stablecoins are likely to follow a similar trajectory as safeguards catch up.

Institutions that build flexible infrastructure and orchestration capabilities now will be better positioned to adapt to evolving regulations across jurisdictions. The goal should be to integrate new forms of digital money seamlessly, ensuring payments remain inclusive, accessible, and compliant globally.

Retno Widuri, Head of Crypto, at Unlimit

Stablecoins have rewired the geopolitics of money – if issuers start buying more and more US debt while powering dollar dominance via USD denominated stablecoins on digital rails, the old correspondent banking model will eventually become hollowed out. Transactions won't need long chains of intermediaries anymore if they are happening almost instantly peer to peer on blockchains.  

Clearly, banks will need to evolve. It's not going to be enough for them to just be intermediaries anymore. Instead of controlling cross-border flows through their own networks, banks will need to become owners of stablecoin infrastructure and orchestrators and custodians of digital assets. The future of finance will be on-chain, programmable, and, most likely, dollar-backed.

Anthony Yeung, CCO at CoinCover

If customers retain funds in stablecoins, banks are likely to want to keep those assets on their own platforms. That would mean being able to offer digital asset services, wallets and exchanges, seamlessly integrated with their fiat propositions. The exchange element, in particular, presents new revenue-generation opportunities.

Retno Widuri, Head of Crypto, at Unlimit

If customers aren't depositing cash into banks anymore, then banks won't be able to rely on the stickiness of customer deposits– at least not without offering business and consumers additional value for holding their digital assets. 

They must innovate, or they will get left behind. They should offer yield on tokenised treasuries or support yield-bearing stablecoins, deliver custody solutions for digital assets, and even further monetise transaction flows by embedding themselves more firmly into digital asset ecosystems.

Offering instant FX conversion at the point of payment will be another way that banks can stay relevant in a tokenised economy. The smartest move will be to work together with fintech partners to build digital asset trading products. Banks will need to become platforms for digital asset custody and flows – otherwise they will start to disappear.  

Anthony Yeung, CCO at CoinCover

Between 0.14% and 0.2% of stablecoin transactions are flagged as potentially illicit. Stablecoins therefore still have some way to go to reach the levels of cash, 30% of which some sources estimate to consist of illicit transactions, or the 2.7% of global GDP estimated to be involved in money laundering.

Nonetheless, regulatory-compliant stablecoin adoption comes with the same AML and KYC considerations as fiat currency and, indeed, cash – in order to mitigate regulatory and reputational risk.

Retno Widuri, Head of Crypto, at Unlimit

Yes, stablecoins have facilitated illicit flows - but so have cash and wire transfers. £30bn (US$40.3bn) is not insignificant, but this represents a fraction of global illicit finance. The solution isn't sitting out of the market, it's building compliance-grade custody and real-time KYC into crypto rails. 

The opportunity that digital finance presents, for B2B payments in particular, is far too large to ignore. This is the moment for licensed, regulated players to lead in setting the standard for safe, scalable on- and off-ramp infrastructure. 

The balance lies in transparency and monitoring – as stablecoins move on public ledgers, financial institutions can use advanced on-chain analytics to trace flows, flag suspicious activity, and see risks in real-time. When implemented correctly, this can transform on-chain rails into a regulatory and reputational advantage. 

Ignore stablecoins, and you risk irrelevance as customers and corporates migrate to faster, tokenised rails. Adopt them blindly, and you open yourself to compliance failures and brand damage. The winners will be those who combine adoption with discipline. 

Jeremy McDougall, Strategic Solution Consulting Director at ACI Worldwide 

A cautious, balanced approach is essential. Stablecoins remain in a regulatory grey zone and pose systemic risks, including potential destabilisation of local currencies and economic liquidity. However, innovation should not be stifled by fear.

Reputational risk is not just about exposure to illicit activity; it's about public trust. Financial institutions adopting stablecoin-related technologies must demonstrate proactive risk management, ethical alignment, and a commitment to financial integrity. Innovation without trust is unsustainable.

From the mainland ban to Hong Kong's pro-crypto pivot and Beijing's CBDC push, here's the reality behind the sound bite.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

President Donald Trump told 60 Minutes on November 2 that China poses a competitive threat in crypto, warning that “China is getting into it very big right now.”

The claim surfaces a paradox. Beijing banned crypto trading and mining in 2021, yet Trump frames the country as America's principal rival in digital assets.

The disconnect likely isn't about secret intelligence or a policy reversal that went unnoticed, but rather about conflating Hong Kong's licensed market, Beijing's central bank digital currency ambitions, and gray market stablecoin flows into a single “China” narrative.

The timing matters because Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission announced, during Hong Kong FinTech Week, that it will relax rules allowing licensed virtual asset platforms to tap into global order books and liquidity pools, one day later.

The move deepens Hong Kong's integration with international crypto markets while the mainland maintains its prohibition.

Trump's statement, whether intentional or not, captures a real dynamic: “China” operates across multiple crypto fronts simultaneously, just not the ones most people assume.

The People's Bank of China declared all cryptocurrency transactions illegal on September 24, 2021, targeting both peer-to-peer trading and mining operations.

The ban prohibits domestic exchanges, criminalizes facilitation services, and blocks foreign platforms from serving users on the mainland. No major outlet or legal tracker reports a reversal of that framework as of press time.

The ban achieved its immediate goals, which were to drive exchanges offshore, collapse domestic mining operations, and restrict retail access to speculative tokens.

What it didn't eliminate were the reasons people wanted crypto in the first place: capital mobility, cross-border settlement speed, and distrust of intermediaries.

Those forces relocated to Hong Kong's licensed regime, moved into over-the-counter stablecoin channels, or found expression in Beijing's own digital currency project.

Hong Kong's regulatory approach runs in the opposite direction. The SFC launched a licensing framework for virtual asset trading platforms in June 2023, granting retail access to approved tokens on compliant exchanges.

By April 2024, Hong Kong had approved spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, products previously unavailable on the mainland, providing institutional investors with a regulated on-ramp.

The November 3 announcement extends that permissive stance further. Licensed platforms can now link to global liquidity sources rather than operating isolated Hong Kong-only order books.

The change erases a structural disadvantage, namely that Hong Kong's domestic market alone cannot generate the depth or spreads competitive with Binance or Coinbase.

Connecting to international liquidity transforms licensed Hong Kong platforms into viable alternatives for sophisticated traders seeking regulatory cover without compromising execution quality.

This is the mechanism that makes Trump's framing coherent even if technically imprecise. When he says “China,” he's likely bundling a Special Administrative Region with de facto policy autonomy into the same mental category as the mainland.

Hong Kong's moves, retail access, ETFs, and now global liquidity, create the appearance of “China” advancing in crypto, while Beijing's trading ban remains in place.

Beijing's e-CNY pilot represents the world's largest central bank digital currency deployment by transaction volume.

Cumulative transactions exceeded ¥7 trillion by mid-2024, according to reports, spanning retail payments, government disbursements, and corporate settlements.

Hong Kong began accepting e-CNY at local merchants in May 2024, linking the mainland's digital currency infrastructure to an international financial hub.

The e-CNY functions as programmable state money, centralized, surveilled, and designed to strengthen rather than challenge Beijing's monetary control.

It shares no philosophical DNA with Bitcoin or decentralized finance. Yet its scale and cross-border extension into Hong Kong contribute to the perception that “China” operates at the frontier of digital assets.

Trump's remarks conflate this state-issued digital money with permissionless crypto, but the confusion tracks a genuine reality. China commands the most advanced retail CBDC in production, giving it credibility when claiming leadership in digital finance even as it bans decentralized alternatives.

Chinese regulators are studying offshore yuan-backed stablecoins issued through Hong Kong, aiming to capture cross-border settlement flows currently dominated by dollar-pegged tokens, according to reports from last year.

The proposal would let Beijing maintain capital controls on the mainland while offering exporters a compliant digital settlement tool abroad.

Enforcement gaps and economic incentives created a parallel system. Chinese exporters are increasingly accepting USDT for cross-border payments, thereby bypassing the slow process of bank transfers and capital controls.

The adoption isn't centrally coordinated, but it's widespread enough that Beijing can't ignore it.

Stablecoin flows also increased in Russia-China trade channels as Western sanctions complicated traditional banking rails, making digital dollars a settlement layer for transactions that the formal financial system struggles to process.

This over-the-counter activity explains why the statement “China is big into crypto” feels true to traders and businesses, even when mainland retail trading remains banned.

The distinction between prohibited speculation and tolerated commercial usage creates space for stablecoins to function as infrastructure rather than investment assets.

Beijing hasn't legalized this activity, but it hasn't stamped it out either, creating a calculated ambiguity that allows cross-border commerce to continue. At the same time, the state studies how to channel those flows into manageable instruments.

Additionally, China's hashrate didn't fall to zero after the 2021 mining crackdown. Cambridge's mining map indicates ongoing activity, likely stemming from operations that relocated to remote provinces or transferred hardware abroad while maintaining Chinese ownership.

More importantly, Chinese firms continue to manufacture the equipment that secures global cryptocurrency networks.

Bitmain, the dominant ASIC producer, operates out of Beijing and continues to expand its manufacturing capacity in Southeast Asia and North America.

Even if no Bitcoin mining were to occur in China, the country would remain deeply embedded in crypto infrastructure through its hardware supply chains.

Trump's statement (probably) doesn't reflect a mainland policy reversal or undisclosed intelligence. It reflects a strategic reality more complex than binary narratives allow.

The “China is big into crypto” remark collapses several distinct phenomena. Hong Kong's licensed market is now linked to global liquidity, as Beijing's over ¥7 trillion CBDC program extends into Hong Kong.

Exporters are settling trade in USDT despite capital controls, and Chinese hardware manufacturers are supplying global mining infrastructure.

The Hong Kong liquidity announcement is significant because it expands the channel through which Chinese capital can access crypto markets legally.

Licensed platforms connecting to Binance or Kraken order books provide mainland investors with offshore pathways that appear less like evasion and more like regulatory arbitrage.

The perception that “China” competes in crypto intensifies not because Beijing lifted its ban but because Hong Kong built a compliant alternative that achieves similar market access through a different legal architecture.

Trump campaigned on making America the crypto capital, framing the issue as a binary competition for primacy.

His remarks treat China as a unitary actor, when in reality, the country involves jurisdictional splits, state versus private initiatives, and retail bans coexisting with institutional access.

Yet the core concern holds: China maintains multiple positions in crypto despite its domestic prohibition.

The competitive landscape Trump describes exists, but it doesn't take the form most assume.

The mainland ban remains intact. The threat originates from Hong Kong's licensed alternative, Beijing's CBDC infrastructure, and exporters utilizing stablecoins, rather than from a sudden Chinese adoption of decentralized finance.

What Trump called “getting into it very big” is less a policy shift than a recognition that China found ways to participate in crypto markets without legalizing the activity its regulators fear most, which is uncontrolled retail speculation in permissionless assets.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","This Soaring ETF Touches Many Crypto Bases","https://etfdb.com/innovative-etfs-channel/sato-etf-touches-many-crypto-bases/","Tue, 04 Nov 2025 14:59:24 GMT","



Bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies are soaring this year. And there are clear trickle-down effects in the world of equities where some crypto-correlated stocks are surging, too. In some cases, crypto-linked stocks have outperformed digital currencies themselves.

However, it's often not any easier to picking rewarding crypto stocks than it is to identify the digital currencies best-positioned for upside. In other words, forget the stock-picking. Consider an ETF such as the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO B+). The fund turned four years old earlier this month. And it's proving there are rewards in broad approaches to crypto equities. The ETF is higher by more than 48% year-to-date.

Alone, that's an impressive showing. But it's even more impressive when considering SATO is easily outpacing traditional technology ETFs. That's a fairly relevant comparison when considering SATO allocates almost 61% to that sector. Even more noteworthy is that SATO is accomplishing that feat without massive exposure to the Magnificent Seven or any individual stock. None of the ETF's 54 holdings exceed a weight of 2.96%.

As noted above, SATO has significant technology exposure. The average market capitalization of the ETF's components is $147.51 billion. But the fund isn't dependent on the largest, most familiar tech stocks as drivers of returns.

Perhaps surprisingly to some investors, that's a positive, because the tech stocks dotting the SATO roster are delivering their own noteworthy performances in 2025. Take the cases of cryptocurrency miners. For years, those were, not surprisingly, the most crypto-correlated stocks investors could find. But those leopards are changing their spots.

Miners of digital currencies, including SATO member firms, are actually decoupling from bitcoin prices. That's because they're leveraging their technological competencies for success in the fast-growing realms of AI infrastructure and hyper-computing.

“Mining stocks once moved closely in line with bitcoin and were often viewed as proxies for exposure to the asset before the launch of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Now, with major bitcoin miners pivoting their business toward artificial intelligence infrastructure, their stocks are more driven by the AI theme rather than the bitcoin price,” The Block reported, citing JPMorgan analysts.

Bottom line: SATO has tailwinds, and they don't necessarily consist of rising bitcoin prices.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","Google's ‘Quantum Money' stands to make blockchain obsolete","https://www.cryptopolitan.com/googles-quantum-money-blockchain-obsolete/","Tue, 04 Nov 2025 10:50:00 GMT","

Google AI researchers and academics from the University of Texas at Austin and the Czech Academy of Sciences are working on a system labelled “quantum money,” a form of currency secured by the unalterable laws of physics.

Google's Quantum AI division has revived a decades-old concept that could upend the foundations of digital currency, embedded in ledger-based blockchain technology. 

According to the work detailed in a new study titled “Anonymous Quantum Tokens with Classical Verification,” digital money can exist securely without relying on the technology that Bitcoin and most cryptocurrencies currently use.

Since Bitcoin's whitepaper was released more than ten years ago, blockchain technology has provided the architecture for the global digital currency ecosystem. Its distributed ledger records every transaction permanently and transparently, preventing counterfeiting and double-spending automatically, out of control of any central entity. 

However, Google's new quantum framework could render that complex infrastructure unnecessary. “Quantum money” reportedly solves the same fundamental problem of making sure digital tokens cannot be duplicated or forged, but does so through quantum mechanics. 

The concept rests on a quantum theory known as the no-cloning theorem, which states that it is physically impossible to make an exact copy of an unknown quantum state. If a unit of currency were represented as a quantum state, any attempt to duplicate it would fail.

“If you had a $1 bill that was actually a quantum state, you could prove, based on the properties of quantum mechanics, that copying such a state is impossible. You could only succeed with very small probability,” said Dar Gilboa, a Google Quantum AI researcher and co-author of the study.

The idea of quantum security was first proposed in 1969 by physicist Stephen Wiesner, who broadly explained a method for minting “private-key quantum money” that could not be counterfeited. 

Wiesner's paper, published in 1983, imagined each banknote as a unique quantum state paired with a serial number, which only the issuing mint could verify. He kick-started an interest that led to more developments, which studied the possibility of public-key quantum money, or tokens that anyone could verify without consulting the issuer. 

However, models, including those proposed by theoretical computer scientist Scott Aaronson, were less actionable and largely insecure. Researchers have since diverted to “collision-free” schemes where each quantum bill has a unique serial number that not even the mint could duplicate, preventing over-issuance of currency.

“We're not solving the same problem,” Gilboa said. “What we're doing isn't decentralized, so it's not really an analog of cryptocurrencies in any strong sense. The no-cloning theorem gives us hope that quantum information could be used as the basis of a better kind of money.

The Google proposal discusses having a trusted central issuer, such as a bank or government institution, responsible for creating and validating quantum tokens. Much different from today's fiat systems, the issuer would have no ability to track how the money circulates. 

Users can perform a “swap test” on their tokens to detect if the issuer is secretly tagging or tracing them. “If they're not identical, that means the bank could be tracking you. Any attempt by the bank to secretly tag its money would be instantly revealed,” Gilboa explained.

In late October, Google's quantum research team announced that its latest quantum computer had achieved a computational breakthrough, executing a task beyond the capabilities of classical machines.

The algorithm computed the structure of a molecule and ran 13,000 times faster than conventional computers, demonstrating what scientists call “quantum advantage.” 

According to Winfried Hensinger, professor of quantum technologies at the University of Sussex, the experiment achieved a task that is clearly impossible for classical machines, but it is not quite there yet when it comes to real-world applications.

Even Google admitted that practical quantum computers, capable of performing large-scale computations and supporting technologies like quantum money, are still years away. Fully fault-tolerant machines would need hundreds of thousands of quantum bits, far beyond what the experimental systems can endure.

Bitcoin BTC$101,014.40 continued to slide on Tuesday U.S. hours, falling below $102,000 and taking out the lows of the October 10 crash.

The largest crypto plunged 4.5% over the past 24 hours and 11.8% over the past seven days to near $101,900, its weakest since late June.

Ethereum's ether ETH$3,361.64 also fell below the crash lows at around $3,410, the lowest in three months and down nearly 6% today. XRP$2.2241, BNB BNB$922.82, Solana's SOL SOL$155.55, DOGE$0.1584 and Cardano's ADA ADA$0.5212 declined 5%-7% during the same period. The whole group is down by 15%-20% over the past week.

Crypto-related stocks weren't spared either. Strategy (MSTR), the largest corporate BTC owner, tumbled another 5% to its weakest price since April. Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) and digital asset investment firm Galaxy (GLXY) declined by similar amounts.

Investor sentiment deteriorated alongside the price action. The well-followed sentiment indicator, the Fear & Greed Index, fell to 21, indicating ""extreme fear"" on the market. That's the metric's most depressed reading since early April, when BTC fell below $75,000 during the tariff tantrum.

The collapse of the bitcoin treasury company bubble continues to reverberate, with those previous accumulators of BTC having begun turning sellers. Paris-based Sequans early Tuesday announced the sale of 970 BTC in order to help pay down previously accumulated debt.

As bitcoin has fallen almost 20% from its record high above $126,000 less than a month ago, the market is at a crucial inflection point, Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33, said in a Tuesday note.

""BTC has closed above $100,000 for 180 consecutive trading days, but is now dangerously close to this material psychological price level,"" he wrote.

He argued that the current price action is typical of consolidations that followed major liquidation events of the past few years — ""slow, heavy, and frustratingly choppy."" However, the research firm's proprietary derivatives signals resemble both prior bottoming patterns and early bear market regimes from late April and mid-December in 2021, he added.

Amid mixed signals, Lunde suggested that it's too early to call October 6 the market top. Positive catalysts — such as expected monetary easing, retirement accounts potentially opening for crypto, growing institutional participation and regulatory softening — don't support the idea of a cyclical peak yet, he said.

""Our outlook remains bullish, but we will hold a nimble approach should the structure materialize further to the downside."" he said.

In what may be the start to putting in a bottom in the crypto sell-off or the harbinger of more brutality to come, or both, Paris-based Sequans (SQNS) became the first of this year's hastily-formed bitcoin treasury companies to unload some its BTC stack.

Alongside its third-quarter earnings report, Sequans Tuesday said it redeemed 50% of its July 2025 convertible debt by selling 970 bitcoin BTC$101,014.40, cutting total debt from $189 million to $94.5 million. 

Its bitcoin reserves now stand at 2,264 BTC, worth roughly $240 million, lowering the debt-to-net asset value (NAV) ratio from 55% to 39%. 

CEO Georges Karam described the decision as tactical and market-driven, emphasizing that the company's long-term bitcoin strategy remains intact. With less leverage and fewer debt covenants, Sequans plans to expand its capital market options, including its ADR buyback program, potential preferred share issuance, and yield-generating strategies using bitcoin.

Sequans ADRs are lower by another 9% on Tuesday and 82% year-to-date. The microcap semiconductor company pivoted to a bitcoin treasury strategy in July, joining a rush of other firms attempting to mimic the success of Michael Saylor's Strategy.

The stock prices of nearly all have collapsed even as the price of bitcoin — though down sizably of late — remains just 20% below its record high.

Sequans finds itself part of a growing list of BTC treasury names seeing their market capitalizations trading well beneath the value of their bitcoin holdings. This not only makes it difficult to impossible to raise capital for further accumulation, but also might leave managements no choice but to sell BTC to either pay down debt or return money to shareholders.

Wall Street continues to try and stay ahead of the hot-handed IREN (IREN) after yesterday's $9.7 billion agreement with Microsoft (MSFT) to supply 200 megawatts (MW) of AI data center capacity.

The company's biggest sell-side fan is Cantor Fitzgerald's Brett Knoblauch. Bullish on the stock this past summer when it was trading for $10 and continually hiking his price target since, Knoblauch yesterday raised again, this time to $142 from $100. That implies more than a 100% upside from yesterday's close of $67.75.

Bernstein's Gautam Chhugani, meanwhile, said the deal with MSFT cements IREN's position as one of the few infrastructure players owning its own power assets. He hiked his IREN price target to $125 from $75 and reiterated its outperform rating.

The pact could generate $2 billion in annual recurring AI cloud revenue for IREN by 2027, on top of roughly $500 million from existing operations, Chhugani said.

Unlike competitors such as CoreWeave (CRWV) and Nebius (NBIS), IREN's 2.9 gigawatt (GW) portfolio allows it to expand in line with demand without relying on co-location partners, a structure which will boost profitability, Chhugani continued.

Chhugani now forecasts $2.5 billion in AI cloud revenue by 2027, up from $1.1 billion previously, and values IREN's Sweetwater site at $5 million per megawatt, based on recent M&A multiples. 

Further, the Microsoft deal taps only about 10% of IREN's total power capacity across British Columbia and Texas, leaving scope to scale further with Microsoft or other hyperscalers.

Roth Capital has also lifted its price target to $94 from $82.

Shares are lower by nearly 5% early Tuesday alongside a general swoon in markets, with Nasdaq futures down 1.5% and bitcoin threatening to tumble below $100,000 level.

Gene Editing Helped One Baby—Could It Help Thousands?

In a world first, a bespoke gene-editing therapy benefited one child. Now researchers plan to launch a clinical trial of the approach

Late last year, dozens of researchers spanning thousands of miles banded together in a race to save one baby boy's life. The result was a world first: a cutting-edge, gene-editing therapy fashioned for a single person, and produced in a record-breaking six months.

Now, baby KJ Muldoon's doctors are gearing up to do it all over again, at least five times over. And faster.

The groundbreaking clinical trial, described on 31 October in the American Journal of Human Genetics, will deploy an offshoot of the CRISPR–Cas9 gene-editing technique called base editing, which allows scientists to make precise, single-letter changes to DNA sequences. The study is expected to begin next year, after its organizers spent months negotiating with US regulators over ways to simplify the convoluted path a gene-editing therapy normally has to take before it can enter trials.

Developing KJ's treatment was “a pretty hectic and intense six months”, says Kiran Musunuru, a cardiologist at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, and one of KJ's doctors. “But I think we can get it shorter.”

The trial is also the next step towards answering a question that has hung over many families of children with rare diseases since the news broke of KJ's successful treatment: when will it be our turn? “There is no ‘one size fits all' in this space,” says Ryan Maple, executive director of the Global Foundation for Peroxisomal Disorders in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Momentum seems to be building. In addition to the planned clinical trial in Philadelphia, the Center for Pediatric CRISPR Cures, which launched in July at the University of California, Berkeley and the University of California, San Francisco, also aims to develop personalized gene-editing therapies. And in September, the US government's Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health announced two programmes to fund research into the development and manufacturing of “precision genetic medicine”.

“I'm more optimistic now than I have been in the past,” says Joseph Hacia, a medical geneticist at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.

In August last year, soon after KJ Muldoon was born, doctors realized that he had a genetic mutation that meant he was unable to produce the normal form of a crucial liver enzyme called carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1). CPS1 detoxifies ammonia, a natural waste product formed when the body breaks down protein. Ammonia can damage the brain if it is not removed from the bloodstream, and many children with CPS1 deficiency do not live long enough to receive the only known cure: a liver transplant.

But one of KJ's doctors, Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, had been working with Musunuru to develop a base-editing therapy that could be deployed rapidly to treat children with metabolic disorders. KJ would become their first case.

In late February, KJ received a base-editing therapy designed for him, and him alone. CPS1 deficiency occurs in around one in a million births. The therapy KJ received was designed to find one of the incorrect letters in the DNA sequence of his CPS1 gene and replace it with a different letter that would allow the full CPS1 protein to be produced.

After the therapy, KJ's ammonia levels dropped, and he was able to reduce his medications. Since then, he's been hard at work, learning to stand on his own, eating solid foods and working towards taking his first steps. “We celebrate each milestone that KJ accomplishes,” says his mother, Nicole Aaron. “He has a radiance about him that really brightens up every room he enters.”

Musunuru and Ahrens-Nicklas, meanwhile, have been busy working out how to treat more children. Their trial will focus on kids with mutations in one of seven genes, including CPS1, that compromise the ability to process ammonia. They plan to use almost entirely the same base-editing components that were used to treat KJ.

But the researchers will swap out one key component of the base editor: its snippet of guide RNA, which directs the base editor to the DNA letter to be replaced. The sequence of the RNA guide must be tailored to match each child's specific mutation.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would normally require each new formulation to undergo a separate clinical trial, with safety tests to ensure that the gene-editing components are not toxic. But in this case, the FDA has indicated that it will accept some of the safety data from KJ's treatment.

With these changes, Musunuru predicts that the team will be able to shrink the time needed to produce a therapy from six months to three or four.

The scientists are also publishing much of the written correspondence they had with the FDA, to serve as a model for other researchers. The team in Pennsylvania will be “a textbook example of a ‘rising tide that lifts all boats'”, says Fyodor Urnov, who studies genome editing at the University of California, Berkeley's Innovative Genomics Institute (IGI), and helped to create KJ's treatment. “We at the IGI will gratefully ride on that tide,” he says.

How far that tide can carry everyone is an open question. Musunuru is hopeful that the FDA will consider approving the treatment once another 5 to 15 children have been treated. But the researchers would need to find a company to sponsor the application.

“Personalized treatments are definitely the direction we need to steer towards,” says Maple. “This technology could be more than a game-changer. It could be revolutionary.”

Dark energy, the mysterious force thought to drive the universe's accelerating expansion, remains one of the deepest puzzles in modern physics. For years, the leading explanation has been that this energy is constant -- an unchanging property of empty space responsible for cosmic acceleration. But recent evidence has scientists rethinking that assumption.

Last year, results from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) caught the attention of cosmologists by suggesting that dark energy might not be fixed after all. ""This would be our first indication that dark energy is not the cosmological constant introduced by Einstein over 100 years ago but a new, dynamical phenomenon,"" explained Josh Frieman, Professor Emeritus of Astronomy and Astrophysics.

New Analysis Points to an Evolving Force

In a study published in Physical Review D in September, Frieman and Anowar Shajib, a NASA Hubble Fellowship Program Einstein Fellow in Astronomy and Astrophysics, analyzed a broad range of existing cosmological data. Their findings indicate that dynamic, time-varying models of dark energy provide a better fit to current observations than the long-standing cosmological constant model.

Shajib specializes in observational cosmology and galaxy evolution, applying strong gravitational lensing to measure the Hubble constant and narrow down dark energy parameters. Frieman's work also centers on observational cosmology, making use of massive sky surveys like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the DES to study the universe's origin, structure, and fate while probing the mysterious force driving its accelerated expansion.

The University of Chicago spoke with Shajib and Frieman about their findings, what these new models could mean for our understanding of cosmic evolution, and how future observations might reveal whether dark energy truly changes over time.

Why is dark energy significant in the study of the universe?

Frieman: We now know precisely how much dark energy there is in the universe, but we have no physical understanding of what it is. The simplest hypothesis is that it is the energy of empty space itself, in which case it would be unchanging in time, a notion that goes back to Einstein, Lemaitre, de Sitter, and others in the early part of the last century. It's a bit embarrassing that we have little to no clue what 70 percent of the universe is. And whatever it is, it will determine the future evolution of the universe.

What recent findings led cosmologists to consider that dark energy may be evolving?

Shajib: Although there has been interest in the dynamical nature of dark energy since its discovery in the '90s to resolve some observational discrepancies, until recently, most of the major and robust datasets were consistent with a non-evolving dark energy model, which is accepted as the standard cosmology. However, interest in evolving dark energy was vigorously rekindled last year from the combination of supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillation, and cosmic microwave background data from the DES, DESI, and Planck experiments. This combination of datasets indicated a strong discrepancy with the standard, non-evolving model of dark energy. The interesting feature of non-evolving dark energy is that its density stays constant through time even though space is expanding. However, for the evolving dark energy model, dark energy density will change with time.

Frieman: The data from these surveys allow us to infer the history of cosmic expansion -- how fast the universe has been expanding at different epochs in the past. If dark energy evolves in time, that history will be different than if dark energy is constant. The cosmic expansion history results suggest that over the last several billion years or so, the density of dark energy has decreased by about 10 percent -- not much, and much less than the densities of other matter and energy, but still significant.

What was the goal of this study, and what were the overall findings?

Shajib and Frieman: The goal of this study is to compare the predictions of a physical model for evolving dark energy with the latest data sets and to infer the physical properties of dark energy from this comparison. The evolving dark energy ""model"" used in most previous data analyses is just a mathematical formula that isn't constrained to behave as physical models do. In our paper, we directly compare physics-based models for evolving dark energy to the data and find that these models describe the current data better than the standard, non-evolving dark energy model. We also show that near-future surveys such as DESI and the Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will be able to definitively tell us whether these models are correct or if, instead, dark energy really is constant.

Describe the models presented and why they better explain the behavior of dark energy compared to existing models.

Frieman: These models are based on particle physics theories of hypothetical particles called axions. Axions were first predicted by physicists in the 1970s, who sought to explain certain observed features of strong interactions. Today, axions are considered plausible candidates for dark matter, and experiments worldwide are actively searching for them, including physicists at Fermilab and the University of Chicago.

The models in our paper are based on a different, ultra-light version of the axion that would act as dark energy, not dark matter. In these models, dark energy would, in fact, be constant for the first several billion years of cosmic history, but the axion would then start to evolve -- like a ball on a sloping field that's released from rest and starts to roll -- and its density would slowly decrease, which is what the data appear to prefer. So the data suggest the existence of a new particle in nature that's about 38 orders of magnitude lighter than the electron.

What are the implications of these findings for understanding cosmic expansion?

Shajib: In these models, the dark energy density decreases with time. Dark energy is the reason for the universe's accelerated expansion, so if its density decreases, the acceleration will also decrease with time. If we consider the very far future of the universe, different characteristics of dark energy can lead to different outcomes. Two extremes of these outcomes are a Big Rip, where the accelerated expansion itself accelerates to the point that it rips everything apart, even atoms, and a Big Crunch, where the universe stops expanding at some point and recollapses, which will look like a reverse Big Bang. Our models suggest that the universe will avoid both of these extremes: it will undergo accelerated expansion for many billions of years, yielding a cold, dark universe -- a Big Freeze.

Could these results have other, less apparent implications?

Frieman: The only practical implications I can imagine are the technologies we need to develop to explore these ideas further -- building new telescopes, launching new satellites, or developing novel detectors, for example. Such developments are likely to have much more of an impact on our lives than events happening trillions of years in the future.

What excites you the most about these results?

Shajib: For this paper, we gathered all the major data sets -- from the DES, DESI, SDSS, Time-Delay COSMOgraphy, Planck, and Atacama Cosmology Telescope -- and combined them to get the most constraining measurement of dark energy to date. All these measurements come from extensive experiments, so in a way, they represent the collective knowledge that the cosmological community has gathered as a whole.

Frieman: When we began working on the DES in 2003, our goal was to constrain the properties of dark energy to determine whether it was constant or changing. For two decades, the data indicated that it was constant. We almost gave up on that question because the data consistently supported the assumption. However, we now have the first hint in over 20 years that dark energy might be changing, and if it is evolving, it must be something new, which would change our understanding of fundamental physics. That feeling is reminiscent of where we were at the beginning. It could still turn out that these hints are incorrect, but we may be on the cusp of answering that question, and that's quite exciting.

A research team at the Institute for Neurosciences (IN), led by Juan Lerma, has uncovered how a distinct group of neurons in the amygdala -- a region of the brain involved in processing emotions -- contributes to anxiety, depression, and changes in social behavior. The discovery, published in iScience, shows that restoring the balance of neuronal excitability within a precise part of the amygdala can reverse these behavioral changes in mice.

Restoring Brain Balance to Reverse Anxiety

""We already knew the amygdala was involved in anxiety and fear, but now we've identified a specific population of neurons whose imbalanced activity alone is sufficient to trigger pathological behaviors,"" explains Lerma. His team used a genetically modified mouse model that overexpresses the Grik4 gene, which increases the production of GluK4-type glutamate receptors and heightens neuronal excitability. These mice, developed by the same laboratory in 2015, displayed anxiety and social withdrawal similar to symptoms seen in people with conditions such as autism or schizophrenia.

The researchers were able to normalize Grik4 expression specifically in neurons located in the basolateral amygdala. This adjustment reestablished normal communication with a group of inhibitory neurons in the centrolateral amygdala known as ""regular firing neurons."" ""That simple adjustment was enough to reverse anxiety-related and social deficit behaviors, which is remarkable,"" says Álvaro García, the study's first author.

The team assessed the animals using electrophysiological recordings and behavioral tests designed to measure anxiety, depression, and social interaction. These tests evaluate traits such as the preference for open or enclosed spaces and interest in unfamiliar mice. Using genetic engineering tools and modified viruses, the scientists precisely corrected the dysfunction in the basolateral amygdala and tracked changes in both neuronal activity and overall behavior.

Widespread Effects Beyond Genetic Models

The researchers then applied the same approach to normal (wild-type) mice that naturally showed higher anxiety levels. The treatment also reduced their anxiety. ""This validates our findings and gives us confidence that the mechanism we identified is not exclusive to a specific genetic model, but may represent a general principle for how these emotions are regulated in the brain,"" Lerma notes.

Some cognitive deficits, such as problems with object recognition memory, were not corrected, suggesting that other regions like the hippocampus may also play a role in these disorders. Even so, the results open promising new avenues for therapy. ""Targeting these specific neural circuits could become an effective and more localized strategy to treat affective disorders,"" Lerma concludes.

This research was supported by the Spanish State Research Agency (AEI) -- Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities, the Severo Ochoa Excellence Program for Research Centers at the Institute for Neurosciences CSIC-UMH, the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), and the Generalitat Valenciana through the PROMETEO and CIPROM programs.

A new study suggests that briefly changing the way people see their own bodies can make it easier to recall autobiographical memories, including some from early childhood.

Published in Scientific Reports, part of the Nature journal group, the research is the first to show that adults can access early memories more effectively after temporarily viewing themselves with a childlike version of their own face.

How the ""Enfacement Illusion"" Reconnects Mind and Body

Neuroscientists at Anglia Ruskin University (ARU) in Cambridge led the study, which involved 50 adult volunteers. The experiment used what is known as an ""enfacement illusion,"" a technique that helps people feel as though another face they see on a screen is actually their own reflection.

Each participant watched a live video of their own face that was digitally modified with an image filter to resemble how they might have looked as a child. As participants moved their heads, the on-screen image mirrored their movements, creating the sensation that the childlike face was truly theirs. A control group experienced the same setup but viewed their unaltered adult faces.

After completing the illusion, participants were asked to take part in an autobiographical memory interview designed to prompt recollections from both their early life and the previous year.

A Clear Boost in Childhood Memory Recall

Researchers measured how much detail participants included when describing their episodic autobiographical memories. These are the kinds of memories that allow a person to mentally relive past experiences and ""travel back in time"" within their own mind.

The findings revealed that people who saw the younger version of themselves remembered significantly more detailed events from childhood than those who saw their regular adult face. The results provide the first evidence that subtle changes in bodily self-perception can influence how deeply we access distant memories.

Unlocking the Brain-Body Connection in Memory

According to the researchers, this discovery sheds new light on how our perception of the body interacts with memory. It could eventually lead to new methods for accessing forgotten or hard-to-reach memories, including those from the period known as ""childhood amnesia,"" which typically covers the first few years of life.

Lead author Dr. Utkarsh Gupta, who conducted the study during his PhD at Anglia Ruskin University and now serves as a Cognitive Neuroscience Research Fellow at the University of North Dakota, explained: ""All the events that we remember are not just experiences of the external world, but are also experiences of our body, which is always present.

""We discovered that temporary changes to the bodily self, specifically, embodying a childlike version of one's own face, can significantly enhance access to childhood memories. This might be because the brain encodes bodily information as part of the details of an event. Reintroducing similar bodily cues may help us retrieve those memories, even decades later.""

Reimagining the Self to Revisit the Past

Senior author Professor Jane Aspell, head of the Self & Body Lab at Anglia Ruskin University, added: ""When our childhood memories were formed, we had a different body. So we wondered: if we could help people experience aspects of that body again, could we help them recall their memories from that time?

""Our findings suggest that the bodily self and autobiographical memory are linked, as temporary changes to bodily experience can facilitate access to remote autobiographical memories.

""These results are really exciting and suggest that further, more sophisticated body illusions could be used to unlock memories from different stages of our lives -- perhaps even from early infancy. In the future it may even be possible to adapt the illusion to create interventions that might aid memory recall in people with memory impairments.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Your eyes could reveal how fast you're aging, scientists say","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251103093018.htm","Tue, 04 Nov 2025 04:44:47 GMT","

The network of tiny blood vessels within the eyes may offer powerful clues about a person's risk of heart disease and how quickly their body is aging, according to new research from McMaster University and the Population Health Research Institute (PHRI), a joint institute of Hamilton Health Sciences and McMaster.

Published in Science Advances on October 24, 2025, the study suggests that simple retinal scans could eventually serve as a non-invasive tool to evaluate both cardiovascular health and biological aging. Such scans may one day help doctors detect problems early and guide preventive care before symptoms appear.

Linking the Eyes, Genes, and Blood

""By connecting retinal scans, genetics, and blood biomarkers, we have uncovered molecular pathways that help explain how aging affects the vascular system,"" says Marie Pigeyre, senior author of the study and an associate professor in McMaster's Department of Medicine.

According to Pigeyre, the eye provides an accessible and unique view into the body's circulatory system. ""Changes in the retinal blood vessels often mirror changes occurring throughout the body's small vessels,"" she explains.

To explore these relationships, the researchers analyzed retinal images, genetic profiles, and blood samples from more than 74,000 participants drawn from four large-scale studies: the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA), the Genetics of Diabetes Audit and Research Tayside Study (GoDARTS), the UK Biobank (UKBB), and the PHRI Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiological (PURE) study.

Their analysis revealed that individuals with simpler and less branched retinal vessels tended to have a higher likelihood of cardiovascular disease. These same individuals also showed biological signs of accelerated aging, including increased inflammation and a reduced lifespan.

Today, evaluating conditions related to aging such as heart disease, stroke, and dementia usually requires multiple, complex tests. Researchers hope that retinal imaging could one day simplify this process, providing a fast and accessible measure of both aging and cardiovascular risk. However, they note that for now, such scans are just one part of a broader clinical picture that still requires comprehensive testing.

Discovering Molecular Clues Behind Aging

A deeper look at blood biomarkers and genetic data revealed more than simple associations -- it pointed to biological mechanisms that may drive these changes. Researchers identified several key proteins linked to inflammation and vascular aging, suggesting new avenues for drug development.

Among the most notable proteins were MMP12 and IgG-Fc receptor IIb, both associated with age-related damage in blood vessels. According to Pigeyre, these molecules could represent promising therapeutic targets.

""Our findings point to potential drug targets for slowing vascular aging, reducing the burden of cardiovascular diseases, and ultimately improving lifespan,"" Pigeyre says.

The study drew on blood protein biomarker data from the PHRI-led Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiological study, an international research initiative.

Funding for the project came from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the E.J. Moran Campbell Internal Career Research Award from McMaster University, and the Early Career Research Award from Hamilton Health Sciences (HHS). Retinal image analyses conducted through the CLSA were additionally supported by an HHS New Investigator Fund.

Imagine a frog inside a box with an opening partway up one side. Whether it can escape depends on how much energy it has: if it can jump high enough, it could, in theory, reach the opening. But success requires more than just a high jump -- it also needs to pass through that opening.

Electrons inside solid materials behave in a surprisingly similar way. When they gain extra energy (for instance, when the material is struck by other electrons), they can sometimes break free from the solid. This process has been known for decades and forms the basis of many technologies. However, until recently, scientists had been unable to calculate it with precision. Researchers from several groups at TU Wien have now found the solution. Just as the frog must find the right opening, an electron also needs to locate a specific ""exit,"" known as a ""doorway state.""

A Simple Setup, Unexpected Results

""Solids from which relatively slow electrons emerge play a key role in physics. From the energies of these electrons, we can extract valuable information about the material,"" explains Anna Niggas from the Institute of Applied Physics at TU Wien, the study's first author.

Inside any material, electrons can exist with a range of energies. As long as they stay below a certain energy limit, they remain trapped. When the material is supplied with extra energy, some electrons can surpass this boundary.

""One might assume that all these electrons, once they have enough energy, simply leave the material,"" says Prof. Richard Wilhelm, head of the Atomic and Plasma Physics group at TU Wien. ""If that were true, things would be simple: we would just look at the electrons' energies inside the material and directly infer which electrons should appear outside. But, as it turns out, that's not what happens.""

Theoretical models and experimental findings often failed to match. This mismatch was especially puzzling because ""different materials -- such as graphene structures with different amounts of layers -- can have very similar electron energy levels, yet show completely different behaviors in the emitted electrons,"" says Anna Niggas.

No Exit Without a Doorway

The key discovery is that energy alone cannot determine whether an electron escapes. There are quantum states above the energy threshold that still fail to lead out of the material, a fact missing from earlier models. ""From an energetic point of view, the electron is no longer bound to the solid. It has the energy of a free electron, yet it still remains spatially located where the solid is,"" says Richard Wilhelm. The electron behaves like the frog that jumps high enough but fails to find the exit.

""The electrons must occupy very specific states -- so-called doorway states,"" explains Prof. Florian Libisch from the Institute for Theoretical Physics. ""These states couple strongly to those that actually lead out of the solid. Not every state with sufficient energy is such a doorway state -- only those that represent an 'open door' to the outside.""

""For the first time, we've shown that the shape of the electron spectrum depends not only on the material itself, but crucially on whether and where such resonant doorway states exist,"" says Anna Niggas. Interestingly, some of these states appear only when more than five layers of a material are stacked. This insight offers new opportunities for precisely designing and applying layered materials in both research and advanced technologies.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Entangled atoms found to supercharge light emission","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251103093009.htm","Tue, 04 Nov 2025 02:22:17 GMT","

Researchers from the Faculty of Physics at the University of Warsaw, the Centre for New Technologies at the University of Warsaw, and Emory University (Atlanta, USA) have explored how atoms influence one another when interacting with light. Their study, published in Physical Review Letters, expands on existing models of this effect. By demonstrating that direct atom-to-atom interactions can enhance a powerful collective burst of light known as superradiance, the team opens new possibilities for developing advanced quantum technologies.

In light-matter systems, many emitters (e.g., atoms) share the same optical mode within a cavity. This mode represents a pattern of light confined between mirrors, enabling collective behaviors that isolated atoms cannot exhibit. A key example is superradiance, a quantum effect in which atoms emit light in perfect synchronization, creating a brightness far greater than the sum of their individual emissions.

Most earlier studies of superradiance assumed that light-matter coupling dominates, modeling the entire atomic group as one large ""giant dipole"" connected to the cavity's electromagnetic field. ""Photons act as mediators that couple each emitter to all others inside the cavity,"" explains Dr. João Pedro Mendonça, the study's first author, who earned his PhD at the University of Warsaw and now conducts research at its Centre for New Technologies. In real materials, however, nearby atoms also interact through short-range dipole-dipole forces, which are often overlooked. The new study examines what happens when these intrinsic atom-atom interactions are considered. The findings show that such interactions can either compete with or reinforce the photon-mediated coupling responsible for superradiance. Understanding this balance is vital for interpreting experiments where light and matter strongly influence one another.

The Role of Entanglement in Light-Matter Interactions

At the heart of this behavior lies quantum entanglement, the deep connection between particles that share quantum states. Yet many common theoretical methods treat light and matter as separate entities, erasing this crucial link. ""Semiclassical models greatly simplify the quantum problem but at the cost of losing crucial information; they eﬀectively ignore possible entanglement between photons and atoms, and we found that in some cases this is not a good approximation,"" the authors note.

To address this, the team developed a computational method that keeps entanglement explicitly represented, allowing them to track correlations both within and between the atomic and photonic subsystems. Their results show that direct interactions between neighboring atoms can lower the threshold for superradiance and even reveal a previously unknown ordered phase that shares its key properties. Overall, the work demonstrates that including entanglement is essential for accurately describing the full range of light-matter behaviors.

Implications for Quantum Technologies

Beyond deepening fundamental understanding, this discovery has practical significance for future quantum technologies. Cavity-based light-matter systems are central to many emerging devices, including quantum batteries -- conceptual energy storage units that could charge and discharge much faster by exploiting collective quantum effects. Superradiance can speed up both processes, enhancing overall efficiency.

The new findings clarify how microscopic atomic interactions influence these processes. By adjusting the strength and nature of atom-atom interactions, scientists can tune the conditions needed for superradiance and control how energy moves through the system. ""Once you keep light-matter entanglement in the model, you can predict when a device will charge quickly and when it won't. That turns a many-body eﬀect into a practical design rule,"" said João Pedro Mendonça. Similar principles could also advance quantum communication networks and high-precision sensors.

The research grew from an international partnership that brought together expertise from several institutions. João Pedro Mendonça conducted multiple research stays in the United States, supported by the University of Warsaw's ""Excellence Initiative -- Research University"" (IDUB) program and the Polish National Agency for Academic Exchange (NAWA). The researchers emphasize that collaboration and mobility were key to their success. ""This is a great example of how international mobility and collaboration can open the door to breakthroughs,"" the team concludes.

Since their discovery more than 60 years ago, accreting supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been recognized as highly variable sources, requiring an extremely compact, dynamic environment. Their variability is related to several phenomena, including changing accretion rates, temperature changes, foreground absorbers and structural changes to the accretion disk. Spurred by a new generation of time-domain surveys, the extremes of black hole variability are now being probed. Here we describe the discovery of an extreme flare by the AGN J224554.84+374326.5, which brightened by more than a factor of 40 in 2018. The source has slowly faded since then. The total emitted ultraviolet and optical energy to date is ~1054 erg, which represents the complete conversion of approximately one solar mass into electromagnetic radiation. This flare is 30 times more powerful than the previous most powerful AGN transient. Very few physical events in the Universe can liberate this much electromagnetic energy. We discuss potential mechanisms, including the tidal disruption of a high-mass star (>30 M⊙), gravitational lensing of an AGN flare or supernova, or a supermassive (pair-instability) supernova in the accretion disk of an AGN. We favour the tidal disruption of a massive star in a prograde orbit in an AGN disk.

Approximately 2.75 million years ago, the Turkana Basin in Kenya experienced environmental changes, including increased aridity and environmental variability. Namorotukunan is a newly discovered archaeological site which provides a window into hominin behavioral adaptations. This site lies within the upper Tulu Bor and lower Burgi members of the Koobi Fora Formation (Marsabit District, Kenya), presently a poorly understood time interval due to large-scale erosional events. Moreover, this locale represents the earliest known evidence of Oldowan technology within the Koobi Fora Formation. Oldowan sites, older than 2.6 million years ago, are rare, and these typically represent insights from narrow windows of time. In contrast, Namorotukunan provides evidence of tool-making behaviors spanning hundreds of thousands of years, offering a unique temporal perspective on technological stability. The site comprises three distinct archaeological horizons spanning approximately 300,000 years (2.75 − 2.44 Ma). Our findings suggest continuity in tool-making practices over time, with evidence of systematic selection of rock types. Geological descriptions and chronological data, provide robust age control and contextualize the archaeological finds. We employ multiple paleoenvironmental proxies, to reconstruct past ecological conditions. Our study highlights the interplay between environmental shifts and technological innovations, shedding light on pivotal factors in the trajectory of human evolution.

The remarkable ability of humans to inhabit nearly every terrestrial ecosystem is a result of the synergy between biological and technological evolution1. The long term significance of our evolutionary relationship with technology arises from the discovery of stone artifacts within Plio-Pleistocene sediments2,3. This study provides new evidence from the Turkana Basin for the relationship between climatic and environmental shifts and the development of stone tool technologies by hominins. The earliest known assemblages of Oldowan artifacts ( ~ 2.9-2.6 Ma) are confined to four localities in eastern Africa4,5 (Fig. 1). The earliest known localities provide insights into technological behaviors at single time horizons in the deep past. Despite advances in our understanding of early human technology, the specific mechanisms through which environmental changes influenced technological evolution in the earliest Oldowan remain poorly understood. Demonstrating how early hominins adapted their tool-making practices in response to changing environments would provide new insights into the evolutionary pressures that shaped these innovations. Here, we describe multiple assemblages of stone artifacts from well-constrained horizon, with age estimates at 2.75, 2.58, and 2.44 Ma, from the Koobi Fora Formation in the northeastern portion of the Turkana Basin (Paleontological Collection Area 40, archeological site Namorotukunan, National Museums of Kenya ID: FwJj 52). Detailed knowledge of environmental patterns within this region allows us to explore the interplay between periods of environmental change and the presence of an early Oldowan techno-complex that first evolved in the late Pliocene, and emphasizes temporal continuity throughout the Early Pleistocene, in eastern Africa.

Finestone; images of Lomekwi and BD1 based on 3D models; artifact images are for representation and not to scale) and the investigations at Namorotukunan: red arrows represent the artifact levels in the archeological excavations (photos DRB), and colored circles (lettered A-G) represent geologic sections investigated to develop a synthetic stratigraphic column (presented in Figs. 2 and 3).

The earliest phases of tool manufacture, dating back to over 3.0 million years ago6 (although see Archer7), highlight percussive technology, which is ubiquitous in hominin records and shared with other primates8,9. Tool use, associated with extractive foraging, is a recurring trait in some extant primates10. The oldest systematic production of sharp-edged stone artifacts, known as the Oldowan, is found in the hominin behavioral record at eastern African sites: Ledi-Geraru and Gona in the Afar Basin (2.6 Ma), Ethiopia, and Nyayanga in western Kenya (2.6-2.9 Ma)3,11,12,13.

In this study, we describe the earliest known Oldowan technologies and their paleoenvironmental context in the Koobi Fora Formation (Fig. 1). The presence of butchery marks on bones within the Namorotukunan assemblage underscores the role of sharp-edged tools in the foraging behavior of these hominins and suggests that the development of Oldowan technology was associated with the exploitation of resources mediated by tool use14. Open habitats such as savannas and grasslands expand at the end of the Pliocene and may have facilitated an adaptive shift in hominins towards a regular exploitation of foods requiring the use of tools (e.g., USOs, bone marrow, meat)15,16. Here we examine three distinct temporal horizons containing evidence of sharp-edged tool technology spanning ~300,000 years. The consistent technological approaches across this interval suggest an enduring technological adaptation in the hominin lineage throughout the late Pliocene and earliest Pleistocene.

The Koobi Fora Formation (KF Fm.) refers to the sedimentary strata of the Omo Group on the eastern side of Lake Turkana and lies unconformably on Miocene and Pliocene volcanic rocks and associated sediments17,18. The Omo Group encompasses these and other Plio-Pleistocene lacustrine and fluvial deposits that fill a series of alternating half-grabens of the Omo-Turkana Basin, which in turn is part of the larger East African Rift System (EARS19,). Excellent age control throughout the Omo Group (4.02 to ~0.75 Ma) is provided by 40Ar/39Ar dates on volcanic ash layers, K/Ar ages on intercalated basalts and paleomagnetic stratigraphy20. The KF Fm. is divided into eight members (see Fig. 1), each delineated by a dated volcaniclastic tephra marker bed at the base of the member (except the basal Lonyumon Mbr19.). In Area 40, where Namorotukunan is located, sedimentary strata are estimated to range roughly between 4.3 to 1.6 Ma21,22, with a gap between 3.0 −2.5 Ma represented by the Burgi Unconformity21,23,24. Above this unconformity, a series of lake clays indicate a local change in tectono-sedimentary patterns and the Paleo-Lake Lorenyang transgression in the Turkana basin21,24. To the west of Namorotukunan, across the North Gele Fault19, a younger sedimentary succession is exposed that includes at least the Upper Burgi and KBS Members, as evidenced by the presence of the KBS Tuff within that sequence21.

Geological investigations focused on a 46-meter-thick stratigraphic interval examined in seven sections (Fig. 2). These sections are assigned to local geological units used for mapping around Namorotukunan (Supplementary Fig. 1). The lowermost unit in this framework is a tephra level (TB), identified as the Tulu Bor Tuff21 (Supplementary Table 1). The uppermost level is a sequence of lake clays associated with the hill locally known as Namorotukunan, from which the archeological site name is derived (L2b). This lithological succession comprises three distinctly different sediment packages separated by discrete boundaries (Supplementary Table 2).

The beds are slightly tilted towards NE, exposing older rocks towards the southwest and younger rocks in the Namorotukunan Hill in the north. Several linear horizons are characterized by coarse clastic sediments (e.g., cobbles, pebbles, and sands) with distinct bedding features (e.g., cross-through bedding) representing paleo-channels belonging to paleo-river systems whose flow direction is marked as light blue arrows. A series of geological sections (A-G) (lower part of the figure) were used to develop a synthetic log and the magnetostratigraphic context. The main lithologies include red paleosols (R1–R4), sands and poorly cemented sandstones (S1–S3), gray to gray-brown paleosols (P1–P6), conglomerates and gravels (C1–C7), lacustrine clays (L1–L2b), lacustrine sands with ripple marks (LS1), and diatomite-rich lacustrine clays (LD). These lithologies reflect a variety of depositional environments, from fluvial and alluvial systems to lacustrine settings. Green bars reflect straight line distances between stratigraphic sections. Image derived from UAV imagery collected on site.

The oldest sediment package is characterized by red silts, paleosols, and sands overlying the Tulu Bor Tuff (TB). It consists of poorly developed paleosols with root traces and carbonate-rich silts intercalated with sands and fine gravels. This package is interpreted as a fluvial floodplain (R1 to R4, Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2; Supplementary Table 2).

The second package is composed of gravels and paleosols, indicating paleochannels and swamp clays associated with a fluvial system (C1-2, C3, C6), characterized by alternating channel and overbank with intervals of paleosols, interpreted as belonging to a floodplain (S3 to C7). All three artifact-bearing horizons are situated within this sedimentary package. The lower part of this interval contains darker paleosols (P0-P3) rich in carbonate concretions and rhizomes, which alternate with sandy gravel deposits that preserve sand casts of plant roots and rhizomes (Supplementary Fig. 2). Brownish-red, poorly developed paleosols characterize the upper part (P4-P6). Some of the upper paleosol levels (e.g., P5) feature large irregular desiccation cracks (Supplementary Fig. 2), filled with well-cemented sands from the overlying bed (e.g., C6). Cut and fill sequences are limited to three local paleo-rivers corresponding to levels C1-2, C3, and C6. The uppermost cut (C6) is the most laterally extensive and shows characteristics of a meandering river. In some areas, this channel eroded underlying sediments down to the paleosol level P3. These cut and fill structures, representing larger paleoriver features, are highly localized and transition laterally into sandy-silty beds interpreted as overbank deposits.

The artifact-bearing horizons occur in the paleoriver system, where currents in the main channel of the ancient, braided river systems were robust enough to transport cobbles and pebble-sized clasts that served as the source materials for the stone tools. The paleoriver system included low-energy environments, where slack water and point-bar deposits as well as floodplain soil surfaces provided the geological context for the preservation of artifacts and faunal remains.

The uppermost and third sedimentary package lies above paleosol level P6 and consists of lake clays (L1 to L2b, see Fig. 2, and Supplementary Fig. 2), occasionally featuring sandy units (e.g., LS1) or diatom-rich sediments (e.g., LD) and a single level containing frequent catfish fossil remains (LS1-L2a transition). Previous investigations conducted on the slopes of Namorotukunan Hill (see Fig. 7C in Baldes et al.24) identified the Burgi Unconformity at the base of the L1 bed. However, no age constraints were provided to determine the extent of the time gap represented by this unconformity, leaving its duration, if any, unresolved.

Within the investigated Area 40 sedimentary sequence, four age markers were identified that allowed development of a comprehensive age model for the entire sequence (Fig. 3). The oldest of these markers is a tephra marker bed, which represents the base of the interval. This layer has been identified as Tulu Bor Tuff β21 and is dated by a 40Ar/39Ar feldspar age of 3.44 ± 0.02 million years22,25,26,27. Geochemical analyses (Supplementary Table 1) also confirm this as the Tulu Bor Tuff β.

obtained by correlating the depth axis, represented by the polarity pattern obtained from Namorotukunan (vertical axis) with the age axis, represented by the Geomagnetic Polarity Timescale99 combined with additional geochronological data (horizontal axis), represented by paleomagnetic data represented by magnetic chrons, subchrons and excursions31 and lake phases described from the Turkana Basin28,47,100,101. Two scenarios are considered: a. scenario a assumes continuous sedimentation between gravel levels C7 and lake clays L1; b., represents the second scenario which places the Burgi Unconformity at the C7/L1 lithologic boundary, as previously suggested by Kidney21 and Baldes et al.24, providing slightly older estimates for sites NMT2 and NMT3. The scenario with the Burgi Unconformity provides two correlation options for the NZ2-RZ2 polarity interval, either with the Feni excursion (PL) or the Olduvai subchron (L). We favor the first option due to the absence of the KBS tuff in the lacustrine sediments corresponding with the NZ2 polarity zone. For lithological column and paleomagnetic polarity zone legend, see Fig. 2.

Paleomagnetic investigations of all the lithologies present, except for the unconsolidated coarse sands (R1-R4), revealed four distinct magnetic polarity intervals (Supplementary Fig. 3). The lowest part of the section, with a thickness of 16.5 meters, corresponds to a normal polarity zone (NZ1). Subsequently, there is a section ~20 meters thick (RZ1) that features reverse polarities. This is followed by a shorter normal polarity segment (NZ2), around 9 meters thick. The top of the Namorotukunan Hill, less than 1 meter thick, is characterized again by the beginning of another reversed polarity zone (RZ2). In most of Area 40 this unit has been removed by modern erosion.

The Tulu Bor Tuff forms the lower boundary of the sequence at 3.44 Ma, and the Paleo-Lake Lorenyang transgression28,29 marks its upper boundary at around 2.2 Ma. These two markers allow us to correlate the local magnetic polarity sequence observed at Namorotukunan with the established Geomagnetic Polarity Timescale (Supplementary Data 1, Supplementary Data 2 GPTS30). Specifically, NZ1 corresponds with the Gauss (C2An) Chron, RZ1, and RZ2 represent parts of the Matuyama (C2r) Chron, and NZ2 correlates with the Feni excursion (Formerly Réunion excursion)31 or, alternatively, with the Olduvai sub-chron. The Mammoth (C2An.2r) and Kaena (C2An.1r) reverse polarity subchrons from the lower part of the Gauss Chron were not found. These are either located in the sandy intervals S1 and S2, (incompatible with paleomagnetic analysis) or these sandy intervals are associated with disconformities. This limitation impacts our estimations of sedimentation rates in the lower interval but critically, does not significantly affect the age estimation of the artifact levels investigated here.

The studied interval includes the Upper Burgi Unconformity (UBU), a surface interpreted in parts of the Koobi Fora Formation as marking a depositional hiatus of several hundred thousand years24. However, the UBU is not clearly expressed in Area 40, where the transition from fluvial to lacustrine facies is conformable and no field evidence for an erosional surface is present. The overlying lake clays match Upper Burgi lithologies described by Baldes24 and the absence of the KBS Tuff in these well-preserved sediments—despite its occurrence ~600 m west of Namorotukunan across the North Gele Fault21—suggests that the Namorotukunan section does not reach the KBS Member. If a hiatus is present, it must be confined to a narrow interval within RZ1, implying a much shorter duration than has been proposed for central Koobi Fora. We thus consider two possibilities: Scenario A, in which sedimentation is continuous, and Scenario B, in which the UBU represents a brief interruption. Both scenarios securely place the archeological levels in the late Pliocene–early Pleistocene and do not alter our behavioral or chronological interpretations.

Considering the correlation of R1 with the Matuyama chron, we are presented with two correlation options for the NZ2 polarity interval: either aligning it with the Feni excursion or the Olduvai subchron. We favor the first option—the correlation with the Feni excursion—due to the absence of the KBS Tuff in the lacustrine sediments corresponding to the NZ2 polarity zone. The KBS Tuff is an important and geographically expansive stratigraphic marker that, if present, would support a correlation with the Olduvai subchron. KBS has been described ~600 west of Namorotukunan, across the North Gele fault21, overlaying a thick succesion of lake clays, inconsistent with the section at Namorotukunan. Its absence in Namorotukunan suggests that the NZ2–RZ2 interval more likely corresponds to the Feni excursion.

In addition to the level of the Tulu Bor Tuff β (3.44 ± 0.02 Ma), paleomagnetic data provide three new chronological points for developing the age model for the studied section and obtaining an age estimate for the artifact-bearing horizons at Namorotukunan (Fig. 3). These points are the Gauss-Matuyama reversal (NZ1/RZ1) at 2.610 million years30, the onset of the Feni subchron (RZ1/NZ2) at 2.137 million years, and the termination of the Feni subchron (NZ2/RZ2) at 2.116 million years32.

We present two alternative age models based on the different correlations described above. These age models reflect two possible scenarios: the first scenario (Fig. 3a) assumes continuous sedimentation between gravel levels C7 and lake clays L1, while the second scenario (Fig. 3b) incorporates the Burgi Unconformity at the C7/L1 lithologic boundary, as previously suggested by Kidney21 and Baldes et al.24. This second scenario results in slightly older age estimates for sites Namorotukunan-3 (NMT3) and Namorotukunan-2 (NMT2).

In this paper, we use the first scenario, which provides more conservative (younger) age estimates. It is important to note that these scenarios do not affect the age estimation of the oldest archeological levels presented in this paper.

Archeological research was carried out within the paleontological collection Area 40 at the Namorotukunan site (36.329 E, 4.399 N). Three excavations (in a ~ 5000m2 area), named Namorotukunan-1 (NMT1), Namorotukunan-2 (NMT2), and Namorotukunan-3(NMT3), corresponding to discrete lithological units S3-C1 (for NMT1), C2-P2 (for NMT2), and C3 (for NMT3) yielded a total of 1290 artifacts: NMT1 (n = 198), NMT2 (n = 775), and NMT3 (n = 317), along with associated fossils (Supplementary Table 3). Artifact-bearing horizons are concentrated in sands and fine gravels (Fig. 4). Artifacts associated with the C3 horizon, (NMT3) appear to have undergone minor post-depositional disturbance as indicated by the absence of the smaller fraction of artifacts and linear orientation for this 2.44 Ma archeological horizon (NMT3; see Supplementary Figs. 4, 5, 6,7). Abrasion on artifacts is present in some of the artifacts, yet thin sharp edges are preserved in the assemblages (% of assemblage exhibiting abrasion ranges from 18-22%). Geochemical and mechanical damage to the surfaces of many of the fossil bone specimens prevents a detailed taphonomic analysis of bone modification in the faunal assemblage. However, some specimens within the 2.58 Ma assemblage include well-preserved surfaces that possess butchery marks indicating that hominins used tools to extract high-quality dietary resources from large mammalian remains (see Supplementary Fig. 8).

The three archeological horizons (NMT3 dated to 2.44 Ma; NMT2 attributed to 2.60 Ma; and NMT1 attributed to 2.75 Ma). These archeological horizons are correlated to the composite stratigraphy for the Area 40 region. Wall sections depict the distribution of artifacts in these stratigraphic units. The right diagrams reflect the proportion of artifacts in major typological categories102 and the major rock types present in these archeological assemblages (see Supplementary Data 3). A high prevalence of chalcedony is evident in all the archeological horizons. Yellow circles represent individual stone artifacts greater than 2 cm, white-blue stars represent faunal specimens recovered in situ during excavations (see Supplementary Fig. 6), and the red diamond represents the cut-mark bone described in Supplementary Fig. 8. Note that fauna was poorly preserved in the older and younger time horizons.

Artifacts from Namorotukunan exhibit many features that are diagnostic of anthropogenic conchoidal fracture (e.g., prominent bulbs of percussion, clear striking platforms, contiguous flake scars; although see Proffitt et al.9,33) and are dominated by smaller flakes and simple cores. High proportions of sharp-edged flakes and fragments, comprising 94.2 to 79.4% of the assemblages, indicate sharp edges were the likely focus of this technology. Early Oldowan assemblages tend to have flakes that are of similar dimension to their cores (as opposed to Acheulean sites where cores are much larger) and have fewer flake scars on cores (as compared to younger Oldowan assemblages3,12 (Fig. 5). Various technological attributes indicate that the Namorotukunan assemblages are more similar to other early Oldowan assemblages (e.g., Bokol Dora 1; Nyayanga) than assemblages younger than 1.8 Ma (Fig. 5; and Supplementary Fig. 10,11). Evidence of an understanding of fracture mechanics (e.g., relationship between platform angles and other technological features) is similar between hominins that produced the assemblages at Namorotukunan and older Oldowan assemblages (Supplementary Fig. 11). Cores from the Namorotukunan assemblages also show similar patterns to those seen at other early Oldowan assemblages ( > 2.3 Ma) where cores are rarely rotated during production (% Cores that are Unifacial; Fig. 5). Although percussive tools are infrequent in the Namorotukunan assemblage, the appearance of heavily battered artifacts ( < 1% of assemblage; NMT2) confirms the presence of percussive activities (Supplementary Fig. 12). Comparisons of raw material selectivity demonstrate fine grained chalcedony at proportions that are significantly greater than its presence in nearby conglomerates (Supplementary Fig. 13). We note that although hominins at Namorotukunan appear to be selective in their selection of specific rock types, there is little evidence of transport of stone. Gravels (braided river system deposits) that carried cobbles suitable for artifact manufacture were present in coarser grained sediments directly adjacent to all archeological sites. This level of selectivity is evident in all three assemblages and suggests a persistent preference for materials that fracture consistently (Supplementary Fig. 14).

A Principal components analysis of major technological features of several of the earliest stone tool industries currently known (Supplementary Data 6, 7). PCA scores were used to calculate a K-means cluster analysis. The shaded polygons (convex hulls) are the results of this K-means cluster analysis. In addition to early archeological assemblages, we include here assemblages made unintentionally by both Capuchins (SCNP33) and long-tailed macaques (Lobi Bay9). B The analysis of eigenvectors indicates that most Oldowan (and primate) assemblages are distinguished from Lomekwi by their smaller size and relative infrequency of cores. Most early Oldowan assemblages cluster together based on the relative size of flakes compared to cores. C Technological variables describing core forms analyzed from 3D models of cores (See “Methods”). Boxplots represent the interquartile range of data. Whiskers represent the upper and lower quartile.; In numerous variables the Namorotukunan assemblage is similar to early Oldowan ( > 2.0 Ma) assemblages but significantly different from the Lomekwi 3 assemblage as well as the later Oldowan and early Acheulean assemblages (Supplementary Figs. 9, 10, 11).

The stratigraphic sequence in Area 40 of the KF Fm provides a framework for examining the paleoecological conditions from ~3.44 to ~2.0 million years ago. The existence of paleosols, along with accompanying sediments and fauna, facilitates a multiproxy reconstruction of the fluctuating environmental conditions within this period. Pedogenic carbonates, plant wax biomarkers, and phytoliths provide detailed information (Fig. 6, and Supplementary Fig 15 and Supplementary Data 4) on the physiognomic structure of the ecosystems across the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene in the region. The range of values from some paleoenvironmental proxies indicate the presence of diverse habitats within some temporal intervals (e.g., δ13C values of pedogenic carbonates −10 to −2 ‰). However, when fitting linear estimates through the data, there are coincident changes that suggest an increase in C4 vegetation and a decrease in water availability in the gravel and paleosol interval (2.7-2.2 Ma; Supplementary Fig. 16). This is supported by increases in the δ13C values of C31 and C33 n-alkanes that indicate an increase in C4 vegetation and likely, open habitats, in the gravel and paleosol interval.

Phytolith analysis indicates an overall decrease in grass phytoliths that characterize the gravel and paleosol interval (Fig. 6). High incidences of palm and sedge phytoliths before these red silts, paleosols, and sands interval, indicate the presence of substantial standing water in these habitats (3.4 – 2.6 Ma) that is notably absent in the younger sediments, the gravel and paleosol interval (2.6-2.2 Ma). Significant increases in microcharcoals, associated with landscape-scale wildfires, point to a more seasonally arid habitat beginning around the onset of the gravel and paleosol interval (2.7-2.6 Ma; Fig. 6). Seasonality probably played a key role, as shown by investigations of paleo-fire frequency on more recent timescales in Africa34. Phytoliths from the 2.7-2.2 Ma time interval (Fig. 6) show increased shrub-derived morphotypes and decreased grass phytoliths, further suggesting a shift towards more seasonally arid habitats. This is further supported by the presence of phytoliths of C4 Chloridoideae grasses suggesting xerophytic habitats consistent with arid conditions at this time.

Chemical index of alteration (CIA) and mean annual precipitation (MAP) was calculated based on bulk geochemistry of paleosol samples (see “Methods” and Supplementary Note 2). High CIA values indicate removal of labile cations (Ca2+, Na+ and K+) relative to Al3+ during the chemical weathering of silicate minerals under wet climatic conditions and low values indicate absence of the chemical weathering under dry climate35,36. CIA values (51 to 64) indicate incipient to moderately weathered paleosols. Low CIA values (<55) between 2.9 and 2.7 Ma indicates dry climate (Fig. 6). MAP calculated using geochemical climofunctions for paleosols varies between 231 and 855 mm/year, broadly classifying the climate as semi-arid to semi-humid. MAP follows a similar trend as of CIA and lowest MAP is recorded between 2.7 and 2.6 Ma indicating an increased aridity at this time interval. The time frame between 2.7 and 2.2 Ma is associated with the relatively low MAP estimates. This pattern is reversed at the return of lacustrine environments (i.e., Paleo-Lake Lorenyang) at the top of the sequence (2.2-2.0 Ma) (Fig. 6).

Environmental magnetic analysis of bulk sediments confirms the reliability of our paleomagnetic approach. The analysis indicates that magnetite is the primary iron oxide, carrying magnetic properties in nearly all samples. However, at the onset of the gravel and paleosol interval (Supplementary Fig. 17), we detected a notable exception: evidence of a second iron mineral, hematite.

There are relatively few identifiable faunal specimens from the entire sedimentary sequence in Area 40 (Supplementary Data 5). However, those species that are present in the gravel and paleosol interval indicate relatively open habitats. Antilopin and alcelaphin bovids as well as equids are the most abundant taxa. Several suids are also present, but most notably those associated with grass dominated habitats (e.g., Metridiochoerus37,38).

The archeological sites examined in this study were recovered from sediments that range between 2.75 and 2.44 Ma. Deposits representing this time interval, which includes the Burgi Unconformity, were previously thought to be absent in most of the northern portion of the KF Fm21,24,39. However, sediments of this age have been documented in various locations within the northern Koobi Fora Formation40. The presence of dated horizons confirms active sedimentation on the east side of Lake Turkana in the terminal Pliocene [(e.g., Aberegaiye Tuff (2.7 Ma) in Area 11640 and Area 13021; Tuff D-5-2 of the Shungura Fm. ( ~ 2.44 Ma) in Area 13921]. The oldest archeological horizon (NMT1) is situated in unit C1-S3 and lies 2.3 meters below the Gauss-Matuyama boundary (C2An-C2r), with an attributed age of 2.75 million years. Excavations in unit P2/C2 (NMT2) directly overlie the Gauss-Matuyama boundary and are estimated at 2.60 million years. The uppermost archeological excavation is located in unit C3 and is positioned stratigraphically ~2 meters above the Gauss-Matuyama boundary (C2An-C2r), with an attributed age of 2.44 million years. This aligns with previously reported known Oldowan assemblages which also appear in the upper Gauss Chron (Bokol Dora 112; Nyayanga 33).

Hominins at Namorotukunan appear to have had an acute understanding of the mechanical properties of rocks used for artifact manufacture. Numerous lithologies were available to make stone artifacts (including basalt, which was overwhelmingly favored for tool production later in the Koobi Fora Formation sequence [Supplementary Fig. 1341], yet the degree of selection for fine-grained raw materials at the assemblages at Namorotukunan is similar to or exceeds levels of selectivity in younger assemblages (Supplementary Fig. 13). Fine-grained crypto-crystalline rocks, (e.g., chalcedony, jasper) available in conglomerates in the Koobi Fora Formation, have mechanical properties that result in predictable fracture patterns (Supplementary Fig. 1442). This selection for fine-grained raw materials is a characteristic feature of Oldowan assemblages (Supplementary Fig. 13). Artifacts from Namorotukunan indicate that hominin toolmakers had a clear understanding of some components of stone knapping as indicated by the interaction between flaking angles and where they struck cores (Supplementary Fig. 11). This is a substantial departure from flakes produced by percussive activities (Supplementary Fig 18). Whole flakes produced in each assemblage from Namorotukunan indicate morphological overlap with individual flakes produced during percussive tool use by modern non-human primates. However, at an assemblage scale, flakes from Namorotukunan are distinguished from those produced by percussive activities by their shapes and technological attributes (Supplementary Fig. 189, Supplementary Data 8). Analysis of the relationships between flaking surfaces indicates that Namorotukunan hominins rotated cores less frequently than those found in later Oldowan assemblages43 (Fig. 5), suggesting that hominins had not mastered some of the features associated with advanced flintknapping skills44.

In many respects the overall technological pattern of all the Namorotukunan assemblages most closely aligns with the known Oldowan sites (Fig. 5, and Supplementary Figs. 9, 19). The older, 3.3 Ma Lomekwi 3 assemblage represents a distinctive technology compared to Namorotukunan and other early Oldowan sites (Fig. 5). Lomekwi 3 includes extraordinarily large cores, with relatively few flaking surfaces and extensive evidence of battering associated with percussive activities6. The data from Namorotukunan further supports previous analysis that indicate that the earliest Oldowan represents a distinct technological strategy from that which is seen in the earlier Lomekwian technology3,12. Previous analyses of the timing of the Oldowan record suggest the temporal gap between the Lomekwian and Oldowan is expected to narrow with further discoveries. This assertion is supported by the expansion of Oldowan assemblages earlier in time45.

Paleoecological information from the northeastern portion of the Koobi Fora Formation, from the Tulu Bor Tuff β (3.44 ± 0.02 Ma) through the Paleo-Lake Lorenyang transgression in the Turkana basin ~2.2 million years ago28,29, indicates major ecological shifts associated with the earliest appearance of stone tool-using hominins. Paleoenvironmental reconstructions from older records46, in the vicinity of Namorotukunan (~25 km. to the south in Area 129) suggest high variability between C4 and C3-dominated ecosystems ~3.60-3.44 million years ago. Directly after the Tulu Bor volcanic eruption, ~3.44 million years ago, the paleo landscape around Namorotukunan exhibited characteristics of a humid floodplain situated near a permanent body of water. High occurrences of palms and sedges before 2.8 million years ago suggest the existence of significant standing water or a high water table in these environments (Fig. 6). MAP is estimated to have reached around 855 mm per year in the older sediments (Fig. 6), marking one of the highest rainfall values documented within the Area 40 sequence. Around 2.8 to 2.7 million years ago, the landscape underwent a profound transformation, transitioning into alternating channel and floodplain deposits (lithofacies) of a paleo-river system. This change likely resulted from a retreat of the paleo-lake shoreline due to the onset of a drier climate, as indicated by the decrease in MAP to under 300 mm per year (Fig. 6), as reflected in paleosol geochemistry at Namorotukunan after 2.75 million years ago. Paleo-vegetation studies (e.g., phytoliths, plant-wax biomarkers) provide further support for the hypothesis of a vegetation reorganization after 2.75 million years.

The older part of the stratigraphic sequence ( > 2.75 Ma) is characterized by a higher occurrence of C3 vegetation (Fig. 6). An increase in C4 vegetation occurs after 2.75 million years. The general increase in δ13C values observed in the n-alkanes reflects a period of perturbation, with significant fluctuations, likely triggered by changes in vegetation and adaptation to drier climates (Fig. 6). Phytolith analysis indicates an overall reduction in grass phytoliths around 2.9 million years ago (Supplementary Fig. 15). The presence of phytoliths indicating shrubs and a notable increase in microcharcoals (evidence of landscape-scale wildfires) point to a more arid environment around 2.7–2.8 million years ago. This is further reinforced by the presence of C4 Chloridoideae grasses, suggesting xerophytic habitats consistent with arid conditions after 2.8 million years ago.

~2.2 million years ago, evidence from facies changes at Namorotukunan and in the nearby ( < 200 m laterally) sediments suggest that the landscape experienced yet another transformation to a lacustrine domain28. At this time much of Area 40 was flooded by the Paleo-Lake Lorenyang, a precursor to the modern-day Lake Turkana28. Following an initial inundation, that left the Namorotukunan area completely submerged, the lake receded, and the area around Namorotukunan evolved into a shallow-water nearshore depositional environment. However, this regression was short-lived, and the lake expanded once again. The base of this subsequent lake transgression is characterized by rich catfish bone beds that may be indicative of an environmental catastrophe within the lake. This has previously been documented in West Turkana, resulting from a shift to an endorheic regime following the closure of the lake's outflow47. During the late Pliocene, the EARS witnessed significant landscape and climate transformations such as lake regression and aridification (Fig. 6; e.g15,48,49,50,51,52,53,54.) that significantly transformed vegetation communities, expanded grasslands, reduced woody cover, and altered the physiognomic composition as well as available resources to hominin and non-hominin species55. These changes were instrumental in shaping the evolution and adaptations of both flora and fauna in eastern Africa as we show locally in this study15,46,51,56,57. There is a connection between local and regional environmental shifts and the appearance of the Oldowan tool technology on the eastern side of the Turkana Basin. Artifact levels represent records of localized paleolandscapes shaped by a unique convergence of conditions. Geological factors ensured the availability of large cobbles that can be used to make stone artifacts, while features of paleoriver systems (e.g., point bars) facilitated the rapid burial of artifacts in archeological deposits. Paleoecological conditions provided foraging resources that encouraged tool use (i.e., open habitats had higher frequencies of resources that required tool use58). The co-occurrence of hominins as well as local ecological conditions that favored tool manufacture and burial resulted in the presence of these concentrations of artifacts. These conditions were met during a relatively dry climate episodes in the Namorotukunan area between 2.75 and 2.44 Ma. Factors that favored the production and burial of artifacts likely shifted within the basin in concert with global and regional environmental factors.

Orbital variability has played a major role in shaping the climate and landscapes in eastern Africa, including during the late Pliocene and Pleistocene interval studied here, primarily through its influence on the intensity of the East African monsoon59,60. A pivotal event during this period was the closure of the Panama Seaway roughly between 2.8 to 2.5 million years ago, which had profound implications for Earth's climate and ecosystems61. This closure disrupted ocean circulation patterns and contributed to the formation of the Atlantic Ocean Gulf Stream, exerting a substantial influence on North America and Northwestern Europe62. The reconfiguration of the paleogeography brought about changes in sea surface temperatures in the Pacific, affecting both the Western Pacific and the Americas63. This led to a cascade of climatic effects, including the rapid strengthening of the Westerlies at around 2.75 million years ago64 and a similar strengthening of the NE trade winds at about 2.7 million years ago, as documented through various records offshore of western Africa65. This shift in wind directions and their overall influence on aridification in various parts of Africa likely influenced the overall drying trend, the increase in C4 vegetation, and possibly increased wildfires based on microcharcoal data presented here.

In the context of human evolution, the late Pliocene climate and ecosystem changes in eastern Africa likely exerted selective pressures on all fauna, including hominins. It influenced their dietary adaptations and behavioral strategies as they adapted to shifting ecological pressures66. As these shifts impacted different parts of Africa separately, it is likely that such selective pressures on tool use impacted different populations at different times54. This period of aridification played a role in shaping the ecological context in which the behaviors of our human ancestors evolved67.

Presently the early Oldowan technology is assigned to the Late Pliocene and coincides with substantial environmental transformations documented across eastern Africa at the close of the Pliocene15,48,51,68. The significant climatic shifts seen throughout eastern Africa ~2.75 Ma, highlighted in the sequence at Namorotukunan, may have heightened the need for hominins to expand their dietary niche by incorporating high-quality dietary resources (i.e., animal tissues) into their diet14,66,69. This shift in the dietary niche resulted in a subsequent release of selective pressures on the various hominins living on this landscape, including the earliest known members of the genus Homo70 and occurs concurrently with environmental shifts in Ethiopia15,55. Elsewhere in eastern Africa these changes are associated with the appearance of early Homo11,15,55. The hominin fossil record in the KF Formation at this time is limited. Further south in the Koobi Fora Formation, KNM-ER 5431 has been attributed to early Homo71; but also shares affinities with Australopithecus72) and may be older than Namorotukunan73. Currently, detailed chronostratigraphic information for these specimens is not well resolved74.

The development of consistent production of sharp-edged tools likely improved the foraging energetic return of hominins in the Pliocene16, similar to the increased foraging efficiency seen in various extant primates75. Controversial evidence of the earliest technology elsewhere in eastern Africa at Lomekwi6 (although see Archer et al.7), along with the butchered bones from Dikika, Ethiopia76 (although see Dominguez-Rodrigo77), indicate that tool use could be a shared ancestral trait (i.e., plesiomorphic), already present in the last common ancestor with Pan, and may reflect a more generalized primate pattern of tool use9,78.

The prevalence of the Namorotukunan artifacts in multiple stratigraphic levels is linked to the frequency of particular paleogeographic features that record the presence of paleo-river systems. Importantly, even though the different stratigraphic horizons are separated by hundreds of thousands of years, the regular association between such river systems and stone artifacts is ubiquitous in the sedimentary record at Namorotukunan. As with similar localities in eastern Africa the presence of rivers that transported and provided raw material appears to structure the frequency of stone artifact production41,79. In the northeastern portion of the Turkana Basin, large rivers transporting raw material are intermittent in the sedimentary sequence between 3.4 and 2.1 Ma (Fig. 2). River systems that carry cobbles only appear ~2.7 Ma, in Area 40, coincident with the oldest archeological levels. This suggests that this technology in the Namorotukunan area was likely both limited and facilitated by raw material availability5. Therefore, the absence of stone tools earlier in the record of this region could indicate fluvial source area and drainage paleogeography that result in a paucity of rocks available to make stone artifacts.

Our paleoenvironmental data reveal climate-driven dynamic landscape evolution in East Turkana during the late Pliocene. This period witnessed the disappearance of lake-proximal environments after 3.44 Ma, which were replaced by a semi-arid alluvial landscape with episodes of paleoriver activity including channel and floodplain (paleosol) deposition28,39,52 until the region experienced a re-inundation by the Paleo-Lake Lorenyang around 2.2 million years ago. These paleo landscape transformations likely mirror fluctuations at regional and global scales. Increased aridity from ~2.75 million years ago was followed by a transition to more humid conditions around 2.1 million years ago (Supplementary Fig. 22). The large assemblage of flaked stone artifacts from Namorotukunan indicates that the onset of the production of sharp edges in the Namorotukunan region is associated with these environmental changes in the Koobi Fora Formation. Evidence for similar shifts near the Plio-Pleistocene boundary has been documented in multiple parts of the EARS15,55,68.

Comparable to other early Oldowan sites (e.g., Bokol Dora, Gona: Ethiopia and Nyayanga: Kenya), the emergence of regular production of sharp flakes at the Namorotukunan site represents a derived trait complex, possibly connected to innovative foraging behaviors3,12. The presence of butchery marks on one specimen (Supplementary Fig. 8; NMT2) confirms that a portion of this adaptation was associated with access to some large mammal tissues from carcasses14. A possible focus on meat from carcasses is further supported by the prevalent use of crypto-crystalline silica in the artifact assemblages. This type of rock, known for its uniformity and high silica content, is excellent for the production of numerous smaller sharp-edged tools80, but its appearance in mostly smaller, brittle cobbles makes it unsuitable for percussive tools. The use of sharp-edged tools significantly enhances the extraction of nutritionally rich food sources from mammal tissues16. This change in behavior may not align with the appearance of the genus Homo, however variability in the available sedimentary record limits our ability to resolve the co-occurrence of biological and behavioral shifts81.

Oldowan technology in the Turkana Basin appeared during periods of dynamic climate and ecological change. However, the persistent nature of stone tool technology from 2.75 throughout to 2.44 Ma is consistent with the hypothesis that it reflects an enduring adaptation. The extent to which this technology connects to earlier industries or to a more generalized tool use remains uncertain9,78,82. The technological innovations that distinguish our lineage, particularly those that emerged in the later stages of the Pleistocene83, could represent a distinct development that originated independently from the array of varied tool-based behaviors that began in the Pliocene6,76.

Excavations at Namorotukunan were conducted in Area 40 (East Turkana Basin, Northern Kenya) between 2013 and 2022. The objective was to excavate known Early Pleistocene localities19 to provide a multi-disciplinary context for the Oldowan lithic assemblage found at the site (Fig. 1). All material was excavated according to discrete stratigraphic horizons. Archeological material was mapped to the nearest mm using a total station Leica Builder 505 with a TDS Nomad 900 LE using EDM Mobile 5.1bt84. Detailed stratigraphic information for many artifacts was captured using three-dimensional photogrammetric models of artifacts in their in situ context. Excavations were conducted under the auspices of a permit provided by the National Council for Science and Technology of Kenya. Excavations and collections were carried out under the auspices of an Exploration and Excavation Permit provided by the Kenyan Ministry of Heritage, Tourism and Culture. This research was carried out with permissions granted by the National Museums of Kenya and the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology of the Republic of Kenya (MOEST 13/001/31 C 216 and NACOSTI/P/23/31328).

All artifacts were measured using standard caliper and goniometer measures at the Archeology Division of the National Museums of Kenya in Nairobi. Comparisons of technological variables were compiled from the literature following recent reviews3. Analysis of core forms (Fig. 5) included 275 three dimensional models. These models were captured using a structured light scanner (Einscan). Three dimensional models were captured at the National Museums of Kenya (with the exception of the Lomekwi 3 collection which was captured from models available at http:africanfossils.org). Three dimensional models were analyzed using morphometric packages in the R statistical computer language (Morpho, bezier, Rvcg, rgl). Placement of landmarks on three dimensional models was conducted using MeshLab software (2022.10). Variables (e.g., rotation angle between flake scars) were calculated from three dimensional models. Data in this analysis deviate significantly from a normal distribution. As such we calculated differences between groups using a permutation test that compared differences between groups to 10000 resampled simulated assemblages of similar size samples from the entire data set. Significance values are estimated based on the probability of finding similar differences in resampled data sets. Faunal specimens were analyzed in the Archeology Division of the National Museums of Kenya. Modifications to bone surfaces were identified using a 5X hand lens. Further imaging of modifications took place on a Sensofar Nanofocus spinning disk microscope at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology.

Lithological characterization was conducted in situ across various studied sections, where each section was thoroughly examined to identify and describe the rock types present. Observations focused on key characteristics including texture, color, mineral composition, and structural features (Supplementary Table 2). Systematic sampling was performed, with rock samples collected for detailed laboratory analyses.

To synthesize the geological attributes of the area, seven distinct sections (A-G) were logged, sampled, and measured using a combination of geological field techniques and geochemical methods as well as site fabric analysis. Bedding planes and fault planes were measured using a Brunton compass. The overlapping seven sections were combined in a composite section (Supplementary Fig. 3). These descriptions were then integrated to construct a composite synthetic section that represents the overall geological framework and variability across the study area, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the geological context and its spatial heterogeneity.

Lateral geological features were documented to assess the horizontal continuity and distribution of rock formations. These observations were crucial for understanding the lateral extent of geological phenomena and their implications on the regional geological setting. High-detail examination of cut and fill features was undertaken to interpret the processes of erosion and deposition that have influenced the landscape. This included detailed logging of stratigraphic sections to identify sequences of deposition, erosional unconformities, and associated geological processes.

We used paleomagnetism and geochemistry to refine age markers in the section. 160 oriented samples were specifically collected for paleomagnetic studies. Paleomagnetic studies were mainly focused on magnetostratigraphy, aimed at identifying magnetic polarity reversals. Geochemical methods were employed to verify if the signatures of the tephra correspond to well dated tephra in the region. Additionally, 222 unoriented samples were taken for paleoenvironmental reconstruction analyses. We used a multiproxy approach (including Rock-Magnetism, Geochemistry, Phytoliths, etc.) from well dated stratigraphic levels, to describe the paleoenvironmental shifts in the East Turkana environments.

Paleomagnetic samples from the Namorotukunan site were collected across seven trench sections (A–G) (Supplementary Fig. S16; Supplementary Note 1) during six field campaigns conducted between 2012-2022. Using a 2.5 cm-diameter diamond-coated bit powered by hand operated air pump (necessary because water cooling would destroy unconsolidated samples) samples were oriented with a geological compass and inclinometer. After extraction, the samples underwent progressive demagnetization in the laboratory. In the Utrecht paleomagnetic facility 160 samples (Supplementary Fig. S18) underwent dual demagnetization techniques: stepwise alternating-field (AF) demagnetization (0–80 mT) and thermal demagnetization (20–600 °C). These methods were employed to isolate primary magnetic components and minimize overprinting.

Samples were measured at the Fort Hoofddijk Paleomagnetic Laboratory (Utrecht University) and at the CENIEH (Centro Nacional de Investigación sobre la Evolución Humana), demagnetization utilized a 2 G Enterprises DC SQUID cryogenic magnetometer with an in-line, triaxial, AF demagnetizer for the AF samples, and an ASC thermal demagnetizer (residual field <20 nT) for the Th samples. The demagnetization results were interpreted using Paleomagnetism.org85, Characteristic Remanent Magnetization (ChRM) directions were typically isolated between 15–45 mT or 150–600 °C. Paleomagnetic directions were calculated using principal component analysis86 based on a minimum of four consecutive steps, ensuring the reliability and robustness of the outcomes (refer to Supplementary Data 1).

For rock magnetic insights, a separate sample set underwent Isothermal Remanent Magnetization (IRM) acquisition curve measurements (up to 1.5 T) using a MicroMag Model 3900 Series VSM vibrating sample magnetometer (Lake Shore Measurements). These rock magnetic analyses complemented the paleomagnetic investigations, providing a comprehensive understanding of the magnetic properties within the sampled materials.

Samples of the Tulu Bor Tuff were collected at (4.399161 N / 36. 326657 E WGS 84) and were based on previous descriptions of the Tulu Bor Tuff in Area 4021. Samples of the Tulu Bor Tuff were analyzed for geochemistry by electron microprobe (EMP) on a JEOL 8900 Superprobe instrument housed at the Carnegie Institution for Science's Geophysical Laboratory. Samples were measured using wavelength-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (WDS) using the following analytical setup: accelerating voltage = 12 keV, beam current = 10 nA, and a beam diameter = 10 μm, conditions ideal for reducing alkali loss while obtaining reliable counts for elements such as Fe.

Pedogenic carbonates were collected from a 3 km2 region within paleontological Area 40. Samples were collected from paleosols with evidence of pedogenesis such as dish structures and root casts. Samples were collected from trenches that were at least 40 cm beneath the estimated top of the pedogenic horizon. Samples were limited to paleosols with discrete nodules. 47 pedogenic carbonates were collected from this region and results are presented in Fig. 6.

Carbonate nodules were isolated from the surrounding sediment using a rotary diamond bit to remove debris, after which they were manually homogenized in a mortar and pestle. The homogenized carbonate reacted with 100% H3PO4 at 90 °C. A dual inlet Thermo MAT253 isotope ratio mass spectrometer analyzed the resulting CO2 gasses for 13C/12C. Sample results were calibrated using an internal Hagit Carrara marble standard and an NBS-19 calcite standard. The average standard precision over multiple runs was 0.5–0.04 ‰ for 13C at Johns Hopkins University.

Sediment samples were collected in the field directly onto Al foil. Samples came from at least 40 cm below modern surfaces and were screened to ensure modern plant material (e.g., roots) was absent. In the lab, samples were rinsed with an organic solvent, dichloromethane (DCM), to remove possible surface contaminants. Samples were then wrapped in foil, placed on a steel plate, and gently disaggregated with a hammer into 1–4 cm size pieces. About 200 g of sample was further crushed into a powder using a solvent-rinsed mortar and pestle. An average of 190.8 g (min: 172.6; max: 198.7 g) of sample was extracted using a Dionex Accelerated Solvent Extractor 350 over three consecutive aliquots ( ~ 64 g each) of sample packed into 66 ml cells. Soluble lipids were extracted at 100 °C and 1600 psi (110.3 bar) over four 10-min static cycles with 9:1 DCM:methanol. A recovery standard was added to the total lipid extract (TLE) after extraction. The TLE was dried down under purified nitrogen and compounds were separated into aliphatic, ketone and ester, polar fractions via silica gel flash column chromatography using hexanes, DCM, and methanol, respectively. The aliphatic fraction contained the n-alkanes.

n-Alkanes were characterized and quantified on an Agilent gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890 A GC) equipped with both a mass selective detector (5975 C MSD) and flame ionization detector (FID). One microliter of sample dissolved in 100 ml hexane was injected into a multi-mode inlet injector at 60 °C (0.1 min hold), which was then ramped to 320 °C at 900 °C/min and held for the duration of the analysis. Initial GC (gas chromatograph) oven temperature was set at 60 °C (1.5 min hold) and ramped to 150 °C at 15 °C/min, then to 320 °C at 48 C/min. A helium-purged microfluidics device downstream of a DB-5 column (30 m length, 250 mm ID) quantitatively split the GC flow to the MSD and FID detectors. Compound identification was done with comparison of mass spectra and retention times to authentic standards, and quantification was done using MSD peak areas using a response factor correction based upon the peak area of known concentrations of internal standards added to the TLE. The carbon preference index (CPI) was calculated using the equation of Marzi et al.87 and average chain length (ACL) was calculated as ∑bi=aiCi/∑bi=aCi, where Ci is the concentration of the molecule with chain length i and i = 27, 29, 31, 33, 35 for n-alkanes.

Carbon isotope ratios of n-alkanes were analyzed using a GC coupled to a Thermo Delta V isotope ratio mass spectrometer through a combustion interface at the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory Stable Isotope Laboratory. All sample injections were interspersed with injections of molecular mixtures with known isotopic values (mixes A4 and A5 supplied by Arndt Schimmelmann, Univ. of Indiana) that were used for correction of carbon isotope values. Samples were injected in duplicate or triplicate when feasible.

To extract phytoliths from sediment, ~1 g of sediment was treated with 10% hydrochloric acid (HCL) to remove the carbonates. Samples were then washed using distilled water and sieved at 250 µm to remove larger particles ( > 250 µm) and then treated with nitric acid (HNO3) to remove organic matter through an oxidation process. The remaining material was gently sieved through a 53 µm sieve to loosen clay particles adhered to phytoliths for clarity during microscopy analyses. Samples noted to have stubborn clays were further cleaned by repeated sedimentation process and, when necessary, sodium hexametaphosphate was added to deflocculate clays, followed by multiple washing, decanting and centrifuging processes. To float the phytoliths/bio-silica, we added 10 ml of sodium polytungstate with specific gravity of 2.4 g/cm3. Phytoliths were pipetted out to another set of centrifuge tubes for final distilled water washing and recovery.

The recovered residue was dried, and 0.002 g of this was mounted using “Entellen New” mounting media (refractive index 1.53) on a slide and viewed under Carl Zeiss Scope A1 light microscope. Observation, counting and classification was done at 400x magnification. Where necessary, oil immersion was done for Grass Short Silica Cells (GSSCs) morphotypes and photography. Microphotographs were taken by USB 3.0 Digital Camera, THORLABS. Phytolith classification largely followed International Code for Phytolith Nomenclature (ICPN) 1.0 and 2.088 for both non-GSSCs and GSSCs phytoliths. Other classification systems were also consulted89. Only well preserved phytoliths were counted and classified to taxon; weathered phytoliths were classified as indeterminate. Except for one sample, all yielded statistically reliable phytolith counts averaging above 300 morphotypes.

Each sample (2 ml) was mixed with 3% sodium hexametaphosphate (NaPO3)6 in a water bath (90 °C) for 30 min and mechanically agitated over several days. Lycopodium spore tables were added to calculate pollen and microcharcoal concentrations. Samples settled and decanted ( < 2 µm), followed by sieving ( > 125 µm). Separation of pollen and charcoal was done using gentle mechanical agitation over several days followed by heavy liquid separation using lithium heteropolytungstate at specific gravity 2.0. Acetolysis was achieved through a 9:1 mixture of C4H6O3 to H2SO4 and 10% HCl. The samples were mounted on a microscope slide with glycerol (cover: 22 × 40 mm = inspected area). System microscopy was done at 25x, 40x, 63x. A minimum of 350 pollen grains and 200 microcharcoal were counted.

Bulk paleosols (n = 22) underwent major oxide concentration analysis using the XRF fusion bead method on a Zetium model spectrometer at Laboratório de Caracterização Tecnológica (LCT), Universidade de São Paulo (USP), Brazil. Samples ( < 200 mesh) were agate-milled to minimize metal contamination. About 1 g of finely powdered samples was fused with lithium tetraborate (Li2B4O7) to form glass beads, eliminating particle size and matrix effects. Measurement accuracy, assessed with physical and analysis replicates and reference materials (GBW 07401, GBW 07404, Feldspar LCT-05, and Granite LCT-07), surpassed 5% for major oxides and ~7% for minor oxide P2O5. Precision, reflected by relative standard deviation (RSD), was 1% for major oxides and ~2.8% for minor oxide P2O5.

Loss on Ignition (LOI) estimation involved heating ~1 g of finely powdered samples at 1020 °C for 2 h using a muffle furnace, presenting LOI (wt%) = 100 × (ash weight1020 °C/sample weight).

ICP OES analysis on selected pedogenic carbonate-free paleosols (n = 8) determined CaO* in silicates. Pedogenic carbonate removal involved treatment with 1 N HCl, followed by washing, drying, and multi-acid digestion (HF: HNO3: HClO4: HCl). A 300 mg powdered ( < 200 mesh) sample underwent digestion with 2.4 ml of HCl-HF-HNO3 mixture (2:2:1). Accuracy and precision for CaO* were 2.3% and 0.5% (RSD), respectively. The analysis was performed on an iCap 6300 Duo model Thermo Scientific spectrometer at LCT, USP, using standards GBW 07401 and GBW 07404 for quality control within the same digestion conditions.

SARS-CoV-2 infections have been rising in the past month — global cases increased by more than 19,000 last month compared with the previous month, according to data posted on the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 dashboard.

But the real number of infections is much higher than that, researchers say, because countries are less focused on collecting data on the infection now than they were during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Surveillance is happening but it's at a much lower level than it used to be. We don't have a complete picture of virus circulation of the variants that are out there,” says Maria Van Kerkhove, interim director of the department of epidemic and pandemic management at the WHO in Geneva, Switzerland. “I think there's a collective amnesia right now about COVID-19,” she adds.

Even if people do test positive after using a home antibody test, there is no way to report a positive result in the community, says Antonia Ho, a clinical epidemiologist at the University of Glasgow, UK.

Without high-quality surveillance data, Ho warns that health organizations are not well-prepared to recommend corresponding vaccine formulations and time their roll-out. “Surveillance is critical to really understand what's circulating,” she says.

Although surveillance data that are used to track the absolute number of SARS-CoV-2 infections are less robust than during the pandemic, researchers are tracking information about the number of people with severe COVID-19 who require hospitalization. “Hospital-based surveillance is what we're mostly doing. But we also have wastewater surveillance, which is quite a useful indicator of what's happening in the community,” Ho says.

Genomic analysis of samples containing the SARS‑CoV‑2 virus shows that the most common variants currently circulating globally are XFG, also known as Stratus or the 'Frankenstein variant', and NB.1.8.1, known as Nimbus. Stratus accounts for 76% of reported cases and is dominant in Europe and the Americas, whereas Nimbus is dominant in the Western Pacific region, accounting for 15% of cases, says Van Kerkhove.

Researchers overlooked airborne diseases for centuries — then COVID-19 changed everything

Researchers overlooked airborne diseases for centuries — then COVID-19 changed everything

Stratus and Nimbus have similar symptoms to previous variants including a fever, cough and runny nose, but the Nimbus variant has one distinct symptom: a ‘razor blade' sore throat. These two variants are currently on the WHO's list of ‘currently circulating COVID-19 variants under monitoring' as of 4 September.

Van Kerkhove says the latest information about SARS‑CoV‑2 strains is far from the complete picture of viral circulation. Even hospitalization data aren't as complete as they were during the pandemic — fewer than 35 countries still report COVID-19 data. “That's why we're trying to make sure that countries are still doing sequencing,” says Van Kerkhove.

However, she adds that the surveillance data currently available are sufficient to “provide information to governments related to the effectiveness of vaccines”.

Vaccination campaigns are focused on people over the age of 65 in the US, or 75 in the UK and parts of Europe, and those with a weakened immune system who are older than 6 months. Michael Head, an epidemiologist at the University of Southampton, UK, says he would prefer a wider vaccine roll-out for younger populations as well. “It's still not a pleasant infection, and vaccines do still have a significant public-health benefit, so they are a vital tool in addressing the threat posed by COVID-19”.

Educational field choices shape careers, wellbeing and the societal skill distribution, yet genetic influences on what people study remain poorly understood. Here we show that genetic factors are associated with educational field specializations using genome-wide association studies (GWASs) across 463,134 individuals from Finland, Norway and the Netherlands (effective n between 40,072 and 317,209). We identified 17 independent genome-wide significant variants linked to 7 of 10 educational fields, with average heritability of 7%. The genetic signal is specific to field choice rather than educational level, persisting after controlling for years of schooling and confounding factors. By examining genetic clustering across specializations, we uncovered two key dimensions: technical versus social and practical versus abstract. We performed GWASs of these components and demonstrated distinct genetic correlations with personality, behavior and socioeconomic status. Our findings demonstrate that genomic research can illuminate ‘horizontal' stratification, revealing insights into vocational interests and social sorting beyond traditional attainment measures.

Education is fundamental to the economies, cultures and social stratification systems of modern societies1,2,3. Extensive research has linked education to a myriad outcomes, including occupational4, culture5 and health6 domains.

Although we often focus on years of schooling, the type of education matters just as much. Fields of education, ranging from fine arts to finance, are extremely diverse and involve varying degrees of cultural, economic, technical and communicative skills7. Engineering students typically earn more than humanities graduates, even with similar educational levels8, and field specializations influence everything from attitudes and fertility to social networks and marriage markets across generations9,10,11. This ‘horizontal' stratification—differences in educational pathways despite similar years of schooling—tells a crucial part of the story that vertical measures miss. The mass expansion of educational systems has made field choice increasingly salient12,13. The importance of one's field of study has increased as the signaling value of educational level has weakened8.

Educational choices follow social patterns. Women are overrepresented in caring fields such as nursing and social work, whereas men are overrepresented in technical fields such as engineering and finance14,15. Generally, male-dominated occupations provide higher wages16,17,18. It has been suggested that these patterns are maintained due to socialization, priming, status, gendered norms and cultural stereotypes19,20,21. Parents' educational backgrounds strongly predict their children's field choices22,23, with students from more educated backgrounds choosing more financially risky careers24. Geographical factors such as urban–rural disparities also affect choice norms and access to certain fields25.

Beyond social factors, individual psychology shapes sorting into fields, through systematic behavioral tendencies, vocational interests and beliefs about future prospects26,27. For example, more extraverted people sort into fields that provide opportunities for social contact like healthcare and higher levels of openness to experience are observed among students of the arts, humanities and psychology28.

Previous studies have tried to identify choice mechanisms by measuring preferences for intrinsic versus extrinsic rewards or entrepreneurial versus bureaucratic characteristics29. However, these preference measures are typically available only in small sample sizes, explain little variance and rarely include actual field choices. A holistic data-driven approach to understand the structure of educational fields would be to apply dimension-reducing multivariate techniques to actual field choices. However, this is difficult because an individual usually studies only one field.

Given that various traits linked to educational fields are heritable30, fields of study likely are too. Genetic variants may be associated with field choices in several ways. There may be active gene–environment correlations (rGEs), where people choose their experiences in line with their heritable traits31. Evocative rGEs arise when individuals are encouraged into certain fields due to their heritable traits. Genetic influence has been demonstrated in twin studies of vocational interests and choices, such as in creative professions32,33, and of school subject choices, where heritability estimates are around 50% for humanities and 60% for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)34. However, population-level genetic associations with diverse educational fields remain unstudied using modern genomic methods.

Genomic approaches offer unique advantages for studying educational fields. First, they can identify common dimensions underlying field choices by estimating genetic covariance structures using genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics. It can be done even when study samples for each outcome do not overlap, such as when individuals are observed in only one field35. This allows identification of a smaller number of components explaining the covariance structure of educational field choices. Second, genomic data are valuable for causal inference when studied within the social context. Naive associations between genetic variants and educational outcomes include not only direct genetic effects (effects of an individual's own DNA on their field choice, operating via active and evocative rGEs) but also confounding due to correlations with environmental influences (passive rGEs31). Possible confounders include indirect genetic effects of relatives' genomes on the focal individual's field choice, geographical and social stratification, for example, due to regional educational policies and population stratification (as a result of allele frequency differences across subpopulations)36,37,38. By placing individuals' genetic data within their family and geographical contexts, these mechanisms can be disentangled38,39,40. The relative contributions of direct versus nondirect genetic associations with field choices have yet to be established.

In addition, the study of educational fields can enrich genomic research on social stratification. Genomic research on conventional vertical position in educational attainment, income and occupational status41,42,43 ignores the diversity of interests and skills that educational pathways entail and the important constraints on and consequences of these pathways. Genetic associations with various fields of study are unlikely to be completely accounted for by the known genetic correlates of socioeconomic status, and thus may lead to new insights on how individual and contextual factors combine to influence life chances.

Here we studied genetic associations with ten broad fields of education using population-wide data from Finland, Norway and the Netherlands. First, we explored whether genetic factors were associated with fields of education independent of level of education. Second, we separated direct genetic associations from confounding ones using within-family and geographical data. Third, we provided an empirical description of genetically associated clustering across educational fields and summarized key patterns (principal components (PCs)) of sorting into fields. Fourth, we expanded the scope of research on the role of educational fields within the social and life sciences through phenome-wide genetic correlation analyses.

Educational qualifications are complex outcomes influenced not only by individual traits, interests and skills, but also by numerous social barriers and supports. Our analyses focus on Nordic countries where education is free and social security high44. Results therefore likely reflect individual interests and preferences rather than family resources or monetary constraints, although social barriers persist even in these egalitarian settings.

We analyzed population-wide administrative data from Norwegian and Finnish education registers for adults aged 25+ years, capturing ten broad fields defined by the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED). We extracted data on individuals' highest completed qualification by the year 2018, including qualifications at all levels. After linking the register data to genotype data in the Norwegian Mother Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa)45,46 and FinnGen47 and performing GWASs, we performed sample-size-weighted meta-analyses with METAL48. The sum of the effective sample sizes was 317,209 for engineering, manufacturing and construction, 292,929 for health and welfare, 261,182 for business, administration and law, 168,157 for services (including transport, security and personal services), 102,970 for education, 97,262 for arts and humanities, 69,123 for social sciences, journalism and information, 63,834 for agriculture, forestry, fisheries and veterinary, 50,819 for information and communication technologies (ICTs) and 40,072 for natural sciences, mathematics and statistics. Population and cohort sample sizes, plus effective sample sizes for GWASs, are shown in Supplementary Table 1.

We identified 17 independent genome-wide significant SNPs across 7 fields, with health and welfare showing the most associations (4 loci) and several fields showing 1–3 loci each (Supplementary Table 2a). All significant loci were field specific. Manhattan plots and quantile–quantile plots are shown in Supplementary Figs. 1–20. SNP associations identified for the fields with lower sample sizes (such as natural sciences, mathematics and statistics) are more likely to be false positives.

Liability-scale genome-wide SNP heritability estimates, calculated using linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression35, were 7% on average (median 5%) and ranged from 3% (health and welfare) to 14% (natural sciences, mathematics and statistics) (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 3). SNP heritability estimates were consistent across cohorts, with genetic correlations generally >0.75 (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5).

Two approaches confirmed that genetic associations reflect the field choice itself, not just the educational level. Figure 1 shows that, after controlling for educational attainment (EA) as a covariate, mean SNP heritability dropped from 7% to 4%. GWAS-by-subtraction analyses49 in Genomic Structural Equation Modeling (SEM; using the largest external GWAS of EA to date43) yielded similar results with a median SNP heritability of 3% (Supplementary Table 6). Five SNP associations remained significant after EA adjustment (Supplementary Table 2,b), and Genomic SEMs confirmed significant field-specific variance (Supplementary Table 7). Genetic correlations between EA and fields indicated that the adjustment procedure was successful for most fields, although some EA variance remained for natural sciences and social sciences (both with ~0.3 genetic correlation with EA; Supplementary Table 8). Unless otherwise stated, we focused on unadjusted GWAS results. Detailed discussion of causal interrelationships and adjustment methods appears in Supplementary Notes and Supplementary Fig. 21, with field-specific EA distributions shown in Supplementary Figs. 22 and 23 and Supplementary Table 9.

Data are presented as a point estimate ± s.e. Statistical analysis used LD score regression with two-sided tests. The total sample size was 463,134, with the number of ‘cases' ranging from 10,252 for natural sciences, mathematics and statistics to 102,874 for engineering, manufacturing and construction. The sum of effective sample sizes was 317,209 for engineering, manufacturing and construction, 292,929 for health and welfare, 261,182 for business, administration and law, 168,157 for services, 102,970 for education, 97,262 for arts and humanities, 69,123 for social sciences, journalism and information, 63,834 for agriculture, forestry, fisheries and veterinary, 50,819 for ICTs and 40,072 for natural sciences, mathematics and statistics. Educational attainment was adjusted for as a covariate.

Population-level genetic associations with field choices might reflect not only direct genetic effects but also indirect genetic effects, geographical influences and population stratification. Although these include causal environmental effects, they are confounders when estimating direct genetic effects. We used two different approaches to understand the relative contributions of nondirect genetic effects to our main findings.

In the independent Lifelines cohort (n = 36,501), 8 of 10 polygenic indices (PGIs) associated with their respective fields at P < 0.005 (Supplementary Table 10), although effect sizes were small to negligible. The largest associations were for arts and humanities (change in log(odds) = 0.22, s.e. = 0.03 and \({R}^{2}=0.00529\), where R2 is the pseudo-coefficient of determination for the logistic model) and natural sciences, mathematics and statistics (change in log(odds) = 0.17, s.e. = 0.04, \({R}^{2}=0.00283\)). Next, in a subsample of 17,705 individuals, we included the imputed sum of the PGIs of their parents as a control variable. This exploited random within-family genetic variation to estimate direct genetic effects without confounding. Direct genetic effects did not differ significantly from population estimates, suggesting no evidence for nondirect genetic effects on population associations (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 11; see the bootstrapping results in Supplementary Table 12). However, power for within-family analyses in the subsample was lower and only two PGI–field associations remained statistically significant at P < 0.005. Results were similar when employing linear rather than logistic models (Supplementary Tables 13 and 14).

Data are presented as effect estimates with 99.5% confidence intervals (CIs). The statistical analysis used logistic regression with two-sided tests. Multiple comparisons were adjusted using Bonferroni's correction (α = 0.005 for 10 hypotheses; * denotes statistical significance at the 0.005 level) (n = 36,501 for estimating population effects and 17,705 for estimating direct genetic effects and parental indirect genetic effects). Direct genetic effects are causal within-family estimates, whereas parental indirect genetic effects could be biased by population stratification and other gene–environment correlations. Significant within-family PGI associations were observed for arts and humanities (change in log(odds) = 0.245, P = 0.0008) and engineering, manufacturing and construction (change in log(odds) = 0.15, P = 0.0002).

Furthermore, we explored assortative mating involving educational fields. We tested whether the same PGIs predicted the educational field of one's spouse or partner (n = 28,581). For education, arts and humanities and services, the PGI is associated with the educational field of one's spouse or partner at P < 0.005 (Supplementary Table 15).

We performed GWASs of educational fields in MoBa controlling for (1) birthplace municipality and (2) birthplace and parents' educational fields. We then calculated SNP heritabilities using the resulting summary statistics to approximate the within-region and within-region-and-family genetic variance. Figure 3 shows that there was little evidence for confounding: heritability estimates were not substantially lower after geographical and parental controls had been added. Modeling heritability ratios in Genomic SEM after ref. 38 showed that none of the adjusted estimates was significantly different from the original estimates, apart from for social sciences, journalism and information. For this field, SNP heritability dropped from 11% to 7% (P = 0.03; see Supplementary Tables 16 and 17 for heritability results and ratios and P values, respectively).

Data are presented as point estimates with 95% CIs. Statistical analysis used LD score regression with two-sided tests. The sum of effective sample sizes ranged from 40,072 for natural sciences, mathematics and statistics to 317,209 for engineering, manufacturing and construction.

Even after environmental confounding has been considered, direct genetic effects are mediated through the environment (see Supplementary Fig. 24 for an explanation of how gene–environment correlation mechanisms apply here).

We summarized the genetic sorting into educational fields through genetic correlation and principal component analysis (PCA). First, we estimated pairwise genetic correlations between fields, using the GWAS-by-subtraction results to identify the key components of field qualifications beyond attainment. Figure 4 shows that STEM subjects correlated positively (for example, ICTs and natural sciences (Spearman's rank-order correlation (rg) = 0.51, s.e. = 0.11)), as did arts and humanities with social sciences (see Supplementary Table 18 for genetic correlations among fields). Second, to make the interrelationships more interpretable and identify key patterns of sorting into fields, we applied PCA. The first two axes of variation (PCs) collectively explain 64% of the variance (see Supplementary Table 19 for PCA results). Although parallel analysis indicated that three PCs could be extracted (Supplementary Fig. 25), we focused on the first two PCs for simplicity and interpretability.

Data are presented as genetic correlation coefficients. Statistical analysis used LD score regression with two-sided tests.

Figure 5 plots the contributions of the genetic associations for each field to the two first PCs. The correlation between an educational field and a PC is used as the coordinates of the variable on the PC. PC1 (horizontal axis in Fig. 3b), which we term ‘technical versus social', reflects genetic variation correlated with qualifications in engineering, manufacturing and construction and natural sciences, mathematics and statistics versus education and health and welfare. PC2 (vertical axis in Fig. 3b), which we term ‘practical versus abstract', reflects genetic-variation-correlated qualifications in services and health and welfare rather than social sciences, journalism and information and arts and humanities. The structure of genetic correlations between fields without controlling for EA is shown in Supplementary Fig. 26.

Data are presented as PC loadings. Statistical analysis used PCA. Positively correlated variables are grouped together and negatively correlated variables are positioned on opposite sides of the plot origin; variables away from the origin are well represented. The sum of the effective sample sizes is as follows: for PC1 = 10,413 and for PC2 = 7,353.

We performed GWASs of the PCs (following ref. 50). PC1 showed six genome-wide significant SNP associations and PC2 showed none (see Supplementary Table 2c for the lead SNPs, Supplementary Figs. 27 and 28 for Manhattan plots and Supplementary Table 18 for genetic correlations between the PCs and individual educational fields).

Figure 6 presents the genetic correlations with these two PCs and 96 phenome-wide human phenotypes spanning domains, including personality, mental health, substance use, health and fertility (Supplementary Table 20).

Data are presented as correlation coefficients with 95% CIs. Statistical analysis used LD score regression with two-sided tests. FDR correction was applied for multiple comparisons across 96 phenotypes. Educational field GWASs were adjusted for educational attainment. ADHD, attention-deficit and/or hyperactivity disorder; ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; BMI, body mass index; cog, cognitive; FDR, false discovery rate; HDL, high-density lipoprotein; LDL, low-density lipoprotein; MDD, major depressive disorder; OCD, obsessive–compulsive disorder; PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder; ISEI, International Socio-Economic Index of Occupational Status; SIOPS, Standard International Occupational Prestige Scale; CAMSIS, Cambridge Social Interaction and Stratification Scale.

A positive genetic correlation with PC1 indicates a link with technical fields, whereas a negative correlation with PC1 indicates a link with social fields. PC1 was negatively genetically correlated with extraversion and agreeableness (rg = −0.42 and −0.37, respectively). Significant negative genetic correlations were also observed with trying cannabis (rg = −0.23), alcohol dependence (rg = −0.20) and six psychiatric diagnoses (average rg = −0.18), whereas the genetic correlation with cigarettes per day was positive (rg = 0.14). PC1 was positively genetically correlated with memory and childhood and adulthood IQ (rg = 0.37 and 0.19, respectively), but negatively genetically correlated with income and noncognitive skills (rg = −0.13 and −0.10, respectively).

A positive genetic correlation with PC2 indicates a link with practical fields, whereas a negative correlation with PC2 indicates a link with abstract fields of study. PC2 was negatively genetically correlated with open personality, autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and trying cannabis (rg = −0.31, −0.27, −0.16, −0.12 and −0.13, respectively). Negative genetic correlations were also observed with two fertility indicators: age at first birth and age at first intercourse (rg = −0.19 and −0.15). PC2 was positively genetically correlated with visiting friends or family and family relationship satisfaction (rg = 0.24 and 0.23) and with higher body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio (rg = 0.19 and 0.17).

Although the PC summary statistics were adjusted for educational attainment using GWASs by subtraction, PC2 remains significantly (negatively) genetically correlated with occupational status, educational attainment and childhood IQ (rg = −0.26, −0.21, −0.29), as well as occupational creativity (rg = −0.35). Notably, PC2 was positively genetically correlated with a latent factor capturing social and economic stability in the UK Biobank (rg = 0.18; this so-called factor 15 relates to social support networks, loneliness, home ownership, household income and never having been divorced), but negatively correlated with two other factors representing occupation or workplace environment (F5) and educational attainment (F10) (rg = −0.18 for both).

The social–technical component (PC1) shows strong sex segregation: 84% of engineering qualifications and 88% of health and welfare qualifications go to men and women, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 29). To investigate the role of sex in the structure of genetic associations with educational fields, we performed two analyses. First, we repeated PCA excluding heavily sex-skewed fields (≥70% one sex: engineering, health and education). Second, we conducted sex-stratified GWASs and repeated PCA. Both analyses showed consistent genetic structure across sexes (Supplementary Figs. 30–32). SNP heritability estimates were similar between men and women, but cross-sex genetic correlations varied widely from 0.17 (engineering) to 0.72 (natural sciences) (Supplementary Table 21). However, several factors limit strong conclusions about sex differences. Sample sizes were low for sex-specific analyses (minimum of 952 ICT cases for women) and broad fields contain heterogeneous subfields with different sex distributions. Low genetic correlations may reflect different heritable traits for choosing subfields (for example, construction versus engineering) rather than fundamental sex differences in genetic associations.

Being sorted into fields of education is important for both individuals and society: it influences health, wellbeing and success, as well as the knowledge and skills available in the labor supply. Using population-wide data from Finland and Norway, we demonstrated genetic associations with field specializations independent of the educational level. Within-family analyses in an independent Dutch cohort suggested that these reflect direct genetic effects rather than confounding. We discovered two key dimensions describing sorting into fields: technical versus social and practical versus abstract. Extensive genetic correlations between these components and personality, fertility, mental health, substance use and socioeconomic status provide a wealth of hypotheses for downstream analysis on vocational interests and horizontal stratification.

We found that SNP heritability estimates for educational field choices were 7%, on average. These are lower bound estimates of the role of genetic factors because our methodology captures only additive effects of common variants tagged by genotyping arrays, rather than the full broad-sense heritability (the missing heritability problem51). Across two different approaches, namely within-family PGI associations and GWASs controlling for birthplace and parents' fields, we did not observe evidence for confounding of genetic effects. However, lack of statistical power for within-family analyses precluded us from making strong conclusions and genetic correlation results indicated substantial interplay with socioeconomic factors. Future large-scale, family-based studies should quantify these effects43,52. Given our own results and prior sociological evidence that the familial reproduction of field choices is an independent channel of transmission to that of attainment53, indirect genetic effects on educational field choices may be smaller than those on educational attainment. Nevertheless, parental environmental factors are likely to be key mediators of direct genetic effects.

Genetic analysis revealed relationships that are difficult to study phenotypically, such as overlap between social sciences and arts and humanities. Through dimension reduction of the genetic correlations, we provided new evidence on patterns of sorting into fields. We found two important dimensions: technical versus social (PC1) and practical versus abstract (PC2). PC1 reflects differentiation into fields involving things versus people (for example, engineering versus education), whereas PC2 captures differentiation into hands-on, pragmatic versus theoretical and exploratory activities (for example, services versus social sciences). The PCs corresponded well with major theories in the social sciences. The Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising and Conventional model of vocational interests, widely used by careers advisers54, includes social and realistic interests (like PC1) and investigative or artistic and realistic or conventional interests (like PC2). The PCs also match sociological theory delineating the major educational resources in which individuals invest (communicative, technical, cultural and economic)9,55. This convergence between hypothesis-free genetic analysis and social science theory provides new validation of existing frameworks. Identifying patterns of social sorting without the need for theory or direct measurement of preferences demonstrates how genetic approaches may complement social–scientific enquiry (for corresponding results on social and health inequalities, see ref. 56).

In showing how technical–social and practical–abstract qualifications correlate on the genetic level with 96 human phenotypes, we expanded the scope of social science research on educational fields. Although studies have investigated the causes and consequences of interests and qualifications, such as personality57, earnings11 and fertility58, these studies have been limited by the difficulty of measuring phenome-wide outcomes at scale in the same sample. We therefore incorporated new domains such as mental health, substance use, relationship satisfaction and body size.

Many of the genetic correlation results are consistent with the interpretation that the PCs capture individuals' heritable vocational interests. The technical–social component is genetically correlated with early developing social traits such as extraversion, agreeableness and frequency of social visits. The practical–abstract component captures individual tendencies toward open personality and creativity. The positive genetic relationships with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder align with evidence that relatives of affected individuals are more likely to have creative jobs59. Vocational interests and the fit between one's work and interests play a critical role in career choices, productivity and finding meaning in life60. Capturing genome-wide associations with interests has not been possible due to insufficiently powered genotyped samples. We provided a new GWAS on a proxy of interest through educational field choice.

Results also capture wider social stratification patterns. The abstract–practical component (PC2) relates to traditional ‘vertical' socioeconomic indicators including occupational status. This may partly reflect incomplete removal of educational attainment variance, although the genetic correlation between PC2 and EA remains small and abstract–practical fields are not clearly patterned by educational level (~40% of services and agriculture graduates have undergraduate degrees versus 76% for health and welfare). These findings may therefore reflect how social and economic resources hold greater importance in abstract educational trajectories. Unlike practical fields like education and healthcare oriented toward welfare state jobs, abstract qualifications often lead to elite professions in media, politics, research, law and the arts, which are typically more accessible to advantaged families61. It is interesting that our genetic results paint a more nuanced picture than conventional status markers, potentially identifying disadvantages of elite educational paths: propensity toward abstract rather than practical fields relates to socioeconomic instability, including loneliness, divorce, lower relationship satisfaction and higher risks of psychiatric disorders.

Why are genetic variants associated with field of study? In Nordic contexts with free education and strong safety nets, genetic effects are likely to operate through individual preferences and skills rather than resource constraints. However, mechanisms remain fundamentally social—genetic tendencies interact with environments through gene–environment correlations beginning early in life. Gender norms are a key social mediator, with stereotypes that influence choice of field of study beginning early. For instance, both girls and boys tend to be steered away from female-type educational tracks21 and the gender gap in STEM degrees is partly because boys benefit from teacher biases62. Results could also capture downstream effects of educational program prerequisites and pick up dropout due to poor person–environment fit or discrimination. Results reflect probabilistic influences mediated through social contexts, not genetic determinism.

As discussed in our frequently asked questions document, determinist interpretations of genetic associations with complex outcomes like fields of study are wrong. Genetic factors do not determine field specializations but probabilistically influence individuals' tendencies, which, via interaction and mediation through the social and structural context, become correlated with educational outcomes. If the social context were to change, genetic associations might change. Genetic factors correlated with field choices may look different if people were encouraged to explore a wider range of subjects, if the skills involved in certain fields were different or the gender norms or economic returns to fields changed. In countries where social inequality is higher and the socioeconomic consequences of some field choices are riskier than in Nordic countries, the heritability of field choices might be lower and links with individual interests and preferences might be less prominent.

Our study has several limitations. First, broad field categories may obscure specific genetic signals—for example, engineering and construction differ substantially despite grouping together. By increasing sample sizes in the future, it will become possible to study more homogeneous groups within narrow field categories using GWAS methods. Second, although it is an advantage of the study that we used two strict approaches to control for confounding due to passive gene–environment correlation and population stratification, these analyses were underpowered. Moreover, the SNP heritability estimates adjusted for birthplace and parental fields could still be confounded if parental fields did not have a perfect genetic correlation with offspring fields (for example, cohort differences) or by social influences of other relatives such as aunts, uncles and cousins63. Third, results from European populations in egalitarian societies may not generalize to diverse backgrounds or different welfare systems. Fourth, if a SNP is positively associated with being in one field, then it is mechanically negatively associated with being in other fields. Future work should investigate how this issue of seemingly unrelated regression64 affects the genetic structure of fields, for instance, through multinomial regression.

These findings open new research directions in vocational interests and horizontal stratification. We introduced qualitative educational dimensions to complement quantitative GWAS literature on educational and financial attainments. Our summary statistics enable studies of early interest development, gene–environment interactions and causal effects of field choice on health and income9. Progress requires large-scale, family-based methods integrating interdisciplinary perspectives on individual preferences and social norms.

This study complies with all relevant ethical regulations. The Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) was approved by the Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics (protocol no. 2017/2205) and operates under the Norwegian Health Registry Act, with data handling managed by the University of Oslo under agreements with Statistics Norway. FinnGen received approval from the Coordinating Ethics Committee of the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa (protocol no. HUS/990/2017), with participants providing informed consent under the Finnish Biobank Act and multiple institutional permits from Finnish health authorities. Lifelines was approved by the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) Medical Ethical Committee (2007/152). All participants provided informed consent and data were processed in secure facilities compliant with national data protection regulations. See Supplementary Note for full details of ethical approvals.

Our main analyses were based on data from Finland and Norway, which are both social democratic welfare states65 that fit the ‘Scandinavian model' of education for all66. Compared to other high-income countries, economic inequality is low and access to education is less restricted by economic barriers. For example, Norway and Finland have free tuition, affordable loans and generous public subsidies for students. However, despite the reversal of the gender gap in educational attainment, gender-typical segregation into fields of study persists44,67. Correspondingly, Nordic labor markets are among the most gender segregated.

We also analyzed a Dutch sample. The Netherlands has been defined as a conservative welfare state68. Relative to the social democratic welfare states, social stratification in education is greater, partly due to early educational tracking and tuition fees69.

FinnGen (https://www.finngen.fi/en), launched in 2017, is a public–private research project, combining genome and digital healthcare data on about 500,000 Finns. The nationwide research project aims to provide new medically and therapeutically relevant insight into human diseases. FinnGen is a pre-competitive partnership of Finnish biobanks and their background organizations (universities and university hospitals) and international pharmaceutical industry partners and the Finnish Biobank Cooperative (FINBB). All FinnGen partners are listed at https://www.finngen.fi/en/partners. The project utilizes data from the nationwide longitudinal health register collected since 1969 from every resident in Finland. Analyses were conducted on individuals aged >25 years with complete data for genome-wide genotyping and complete educational records.

We studied adults who participated in MoBa, a prospective population-based pregnancy cohort study conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health46. Pregnant women were recruited from across Norway from 1999 to 2009. In 41% of the pregnancies, the women consented to initial participation. Of fathers invited to participate, 82.9% consented. The total cohort includes approximately 114,500 children, 95,200 mothers and 75,200 fathers. Analyses were conducted on MoBa parents aged >25 years with complete data for genome-wide genotyping and complete administrative records linked to MoBa through the Norwegian national ID number system (n = 125,016).

Lifelines is a multidisciplinary, prospective, population-based cohort study examining, in a unique three-generation design, the health and health-related behaviors of 167,729 people living in the north of the Netherlands70. It employs a broad range of investigative procedures in assessing the biomedical, sociodemographic, behavioral, physical and psychological factors that contribute to the health and disease of the general population, with a special focus on multimorbidity and complex genetics. Participants were sampled from the northern population of the Netherlands and the final sample encompasses about 10% of the region's population. Between 2006 and 2013, randomly selected general practitioners invited all their listed patients aged 25–49 years to participate in the study. We restricted our sample to genotyped Lifelines respondents who were ≥25 years (n = 63,927). PGIs and the first ten PCs of the genetic data were linked to an administrative data file containing educational fields (‘HOOGSTEOPLTAB 2022, v1'), housed by Statistics Netherlands. Due to missingness in educational fields, in particular for the older generations, the total final sample was n = 36,501.

FinnGen release 11 contains genotype data for 473,681 individuals after quality control (QC). A total of 387,601 individuals were genotyped with a FinnGen Thermo Fisher Axiom customized array v2. Data on 86,080 additional individuals were derived from legacy collections47. Further information is available at https://finngen.gitbook.io/finngen-handbook/finngen-data-specifics/red-library-data-individual-level-data/genotype-data/affymetrix-chip-and-its-design.

Blood samples were obtained from both parents during pregnancy and from mothers and children (umbilical cord) at birth. Quality-controlled genotyping array data for the full 207,569 unique MoBa participants were recently generated45. Phasing and imputation were performed with IMPUTE4.1.2_r300.3, using the publicly available Haplotype Reference Consortium release 1.1 panel as a reference. To identify a subpopulation of European-associated ancestry, PCA was performed with 1,000 Genomes phase 1 after LD pruning. During post-imputation QC, the following thresholds were used for SNP removal: imputation quality (INFO) score ≤0.8; minor allele frequency (MAF) <1%; call rate <95%.

Blood samples were collected from Lifelines participants at the first assessment visit. Genotypes were released as part of two separate cohorts. The CytoSNP cohort was measured on the Illumina CytoSNP-12v2 array, measuring ~300,000 SNPs. The UMCG Genetics Lifelines Initiative (UGLI) cohort was measured on the Infinium Global Screening Array MultiEthnic Disease version, measuring ~700,000 SNPs. Quality-controlled data for both cohorts were released. The QC reports for CytoSNP and UGLI are available at http://wiki.lifelines.nl/doku.php?id=gwas and http://wiki.lifelines.nl/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=qc_report_ugli_r1.pdf, respectively. Before PGI construction, and in each cohort, we dropped multiallelic SNPs, SNPs with MAF < 1%, SNPs with an INFO score <0.8 or SNPs that were not in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (P < 10−6). We also dropped individuals with homozygosity rates of ±3 s.d. values (removing 655 respondents). We further dropped 1,289 respondents from the CytoSNP cohort who were also available in the UGLI cohort. After all these QC steps were completed, we merged the CytoSNP and UGLI cohorts into a single data file, using only SNPs that both cohorts had in common after QC (~6.4 million SNPs in total).

In all three cohorts, we extracted register data on broad educational field codes representing the field of education of each person's highest qualification completed by the year 2018. We extracted field codes at all highest qualification levels (that is, not just at university level).

To harmonize the data and facilitate future replication studies in other cohorts, we converted broad field codes from national-level coding systems to broad field codes as defined by the ISCED 2013 (https://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/international-standard-classification-of-education-fields-of-education-and-training-2013-detailed-field-descriptions-2015-en.pdf).

In FinnGen, we used linked administrative data from Statistics Finland to define individuals' educational qualifications. The Finnish educational field records are described at https://www2.stat.fi/fi/luokitukset/koulutusala/. In MoBa, we used linked administrative data from the Norwegian Standard Classification of Education (NUS2000). The administrative data were of high quality and did not suffer from attrition. More information on the NUS coding and the conversion to ISCED is available at http://www.ssb.no/en/utdanning/norwegian-standard-classification-of-education. In the present study, missing data occur only for individuals whose fields do not map exactly on to the ISCED system, for instance because they are interdisciplinary (for example, 16,000 genotyped individuals in MoBa with qualifications termed ‘interdisciplinary programs' and ‘qualifications involving health and welfare'). Note that Dutch administrative records on education are incomplete, such that we had educational field measures available only for 56% of the original Lifelines sample (n = 36,373).

We created a binary variable for each of the ISCED broad field specialization codes, scoring individuals as 1 if they chose the field and 0 otherwise. The 0 category included people studying generic programs (not a specialization as such). This includes a wide range of qualifications, for example, unspecialized high school diploma and professional development skills training.

We also created harmonized educational attainment variables in all datasets. We took educational level information from the exact variable containing the field code and converted it to the ISCED EduYears (years of completed education) categories, as per international GWAS meta-analyses.

To test whether genetic associations reflected direct effects rather than confounding from familial and geographical factors, we created covariates from Norwegian population and education registers. We generated dummy variables for birthplace municipalities (216 codes representing Norway's lowest administrative level) to control for shared local environments and for parents' educational fields to control for familial transmission of education-specific skills, resources and networks. The genetic–geographical data linkage and structure has been described previously71. Although Norway's free tuition and dispersed population with geographical variation in educational opportunities25 provide a useful context for these analyses, our approach may not fully capture temporally unstable or more localized influences.

To validate our GWA analysis results, we tested associations between PGIs for educational field choices and those for actual educational field choices in an independent cohort. PGIs were constructed using the GWAS summary statistics for each respective field (not corrected for EA), using SBayesR within GCTB software v2.05beta_Linux72. SBayesR uses Bayesian shrinkage and explicitly models LD to estimate SNP effect sizes in the presence of correlated markers, using LD scores of individuals with European-associated ancestry estimated by the UK Biobank. To test for the direct effect of the PGI, we added the mid-parental PGI as a control variable. The parental PGI was constructed using a combination of observed and imputed genotypes (from parents and siblings), constructed using snipar. Snipar uses sibling data or the data of available parents to impute genotypes for unobserved parents73. The parental PGI could be imputed for individuals who had at least one sibling or at least one parent who was also genotyped in Lifelines (n = 17,705).

We performed GWA analyses (GWASs) for ten dichotomous broad educational field phenotypes in MoBa and FinnGen, using models developed for resource-efficient analysis of case–control phenotypes in biobank-scale datasets. In MoBa, the FastGWA-GLMM approach (a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) method for large-scale (GWASs) in GCTA software v1.91.7beta (--fastGWA-mlm-binary))74 was used. This is a logistic regression model with the added complexity of using a sparse matrix to account for the dense genetic relatedness in MoBa without removing relatives. FastGWA-GLMM also uses the saddle point approximation method to account for inflation in test statistics due to case–control imbalance. In FinnGen, the binary option in REGENIE75 software was used (v2.2.4). REGENIE is a machine learning method that implements whole-genome ridge regression and uses Firth's logistic regression test to account for case–control imbalance. The two methods are similarly effective in terms of false-positive rates and statistical power.

To enable meta-analysis of MoBa and FinnGen GWAS summary statistics, we performed QC and harmonization. We removed variants with low MAF < 1%, poor imputation quality (INFO < 0.8), multiallelic variants and variants with ambiguous alleles (for example, alleles other than A, C, G or T) and we resolved strand and sign flips. The datasets were harmonized based on chr:pos from genome build 37 as an SNP identifier. Sample-size-weighted meta-analyses of MoBa and FinnGen were then performed using METAL software48. We used the SCHEME SAMPLESIZE setting to convert effect sizes to z-scores before meta-analysis.

To identify independent genome-wide significant associations in the meta-analytical results, we performed clumping using standard parameters in FUMA software76: leadP = 5 × 10−8, gwasP = 0.05, r2 = 0.6, r2_2 = 0.1, refpanel = 1KG/Phase3.

We calculated cohort-specific effective sample sizes following ref. 77 and then summed these to obtain the sum of effective sample sizes for each field-of-study GWAS.

In MoBa, we also used FastGWA-GLMM for the following additional analyses: GWASs of ten fields with controls for educational attainment; GWASs of ten fields controlling for geographical and parental variables; and GWASs of ten fields in men and women separately.

In all GWAS (except sex-stratified) analyses, we controlled for sex, age, PCs of genetic ancestry (20 in MoBa, 10 in FinnGen) and batch identifiers.

To identify genetic signals associated with educational fields net of educational level, we used GWASs by subtraction49 in Genomic SEM78 (package within R-4.3.2) using GWAS summary statistics for educational fields and educational attainment43. This genomic Cholesky's decomposition approach was first applied to create a GWAS of noncognitive skills by ‘subtracting' the genetic component of cognitive performance from the association of each SNP with educational attainment. Here we ‘subtracted' the genetic component of educational attainment from the association of each SNP with a given educational field. For each of the ten fields, we fitted an SNP-level Cholesky's model regressing two observed variables (the field, and educational attainment) on two latent variables (a field-specific factor and an educational attainment factor). The covariances between the latent variables were fixed to 0 so that all variance is explained by the latent factors. See Supplementary Fig. 21 and accompanying Supplementary Notes for full model specification details and a model illustration.

The overall contribution of common SNPs to field choices was estimated from GWAS summary statistics by LD score regression, via Genomic SEM v0.0.3f in R-4.3.235,78. On average, SNPs with higher LD scores (more correlations with other SNPs) are more likely to be correlated with a true causal variant. As such, when GWA test statistics (χ²) are regressed on LD scores, the slope provides an estimate of the heritability that can be explained by common SNPs. Heritability represents the percentage of variance explained by common genetic variants.

We estimated SNP-based heritabilities of educational fields after controlling for EA in two ways: through GWASs by subtraction and phenotypic adjustment. We note that it is not recommended to base heritability estimates on the former approach, because environmental variance is undefined. Nevertheless, we reported SNP heritability estimates based on GWASs by subtraction because they are relevant to interpreting downstream PCs and genetic correlation analyses.

To study how much the genetic associations with broad field choices are mediated through unobserved social factors in the geographical area in which individuals were born, we repeated the GWAS analyses in MoBa only, controlling for municipality codes and parental field codes as dummy variables and testing for attenuated heritability with LD score regression. We did this in an iterative fashion, first controlling for the most distal factor (birthplace municipality), then adding parental fields. Following previous methods applied in UK Biobank38, we used Genomic SEM to compare the SNP heritability estimates with and without controls while accounting for dependence between estimates. We used the p.adjust function in R with the method ‘fdr' to control the false discovery rate (the expected proportion of false discoveries among the rejected hypotheses)79 and considered results with an adjusted P < 0.05 as significant.

In Dutch Lifelines, we tested PGI associations with educational fields using logistic regression, controlling for ten PCs, age polynomials, sex and their interactions. We quantified variance explained using incremental McFadden's pseudo-R². This is defined as \(1-{L}_{1}/{L}_{0}\), where \({L}_{1}\) is the likelihood of the model and \({L}_{0}\) the likelihood of the model with only a fitted intercept. To estimate direct genetic effects, we added controls for imputed parental PGIs and compared within-family versus population-level effect sizes80, with CIs from 1,000 bootstrap replications and Bonferroni's correction (P < 0.005) to correct for testing 10 hypotheses. We also tested PGI associations with spouse's or partner's educational field (n = 28,581; logit regression), defining spouses or partners as the first co-parent identified through Dutch population linkage, although these associations likely reflect broader assortative mating patterns rather than direct genetic effects on partner choice.

We explored the structure of the field GWASs (meta-analytic results) by calculating genetic correlations using LD score regression within Genomic SEM v0.0.3f in R-4.3.278. For pairs of traits, the product of the GWA z-scores at each SNP can be regressed on the LD score, providing an estimate of the genetic correlation between the two traits.

We explored the dimensionality of the genetic associations with the ten educational fields by applying PCA (using eigen() in R-4.3.2) to the standardized matrix of genetic correlations between fields (after GWAS by subtraction to remove EA genetic variance). To obtain GWAS summary statistics for PC1 and PC2, we then performed PCA GWASs following ref. 50 (more details at https://annafurtjes.github.io/genomicPCA/). This approach adapts a GWA meta-analysis function designed for meta-analysis across multiple traits81. Instead of weighting by SNP heritability when averaging across SNP effects, the standardized loadings on the PC of interest provide the weights. The function allows for sample overlap in the GWAS summary statistics by adjusting for the LD score regression intercept. The resulting GWAS summary statistics for the two independent educational field components had effective sample sizes of 10,413 and 7,353, respectively (following ref. 82).

We chose to use PCA rather than confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) for studying the dimensionality of educational fields for several reasons. First, PCA involves fewer assumptions than CFA. Although CFA models latent factors assumed to represent real traits measured by field choices, PCA simply reduces the dimensionality of the data by finding axes that explain maximum variation. In addition, CFA might require the somewhat ad-hoc addition of crossloadings based on modification indices to achieve a good fit, whereas PCA does not involve model-fit considerations. Second, the limited number of possible fields (ten indicators) makes PCA more suitable. CFA is ideally designed for studying latent factors that can be measured by an extensive, potentially infinite, number of indicators, which is not the case here.

We estimated genetic correlations between latent educational fields factors and 96 human phenotypes using LD score regression. We used publicly available GWAS summary statistics that were well powered and covered a comprehensive range of domains of human variation. See Supplementary Table 21 for the GWAS study reference list with sample sizes.

Ionic transport within porous carbon electrodes is crucial for optimizing charge and discharge rates in supercapacitors, yet the material properties governing ion dynamics remain poorly understood. Unlike the traditional viewpoint, here we find that mesoporosity does not necessarily correlate with a high supercapacitor rate capability. We employed pulsed-field-gradient nuclear magnetic resonance to directly measure the anionic effective diffusivities in the carbon pores. This technique probes ionic transport in supercapacitors. Our findings reveal a major discrepancy between short-range and long-range diffusivities, which captures the tortuosity of the pore network. Short-range diffusivities lack correlation with supercapacitor rate capability, whereas long-range diffusivities correlate strongly. Low-tortuosity nanoporous carbon exhibited superior rate capability, which highlights the importance of well-interconnected pore networks for efficient ion transport. Our study reveals that the pore network tortuosity is a key factor governing charging rates in amorphous nanoporous carbon and that it can be used to guide the design of electrodes with optimized transport channels to enhance supercapacitor performance.

Electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) are high-performance energy-storage devices known for their rapid charge and discharge capabilities and long cycle lives. These devices typically consist of nanoporous electrodes immersed in electrolyte solutions1,2, with carbon-based materials being the most widely used due to their high surface area and chemical stability1,3. This nanoporous carbon is composed of defective graphene-like fragments that form the pore walls of a three-dimensional porous network with a range of pore sizes4.

Although much of the current research is focused on increasing the energy density of EDLCs, either by maximizing the cell voltage or by improving the specific capacitance of the electrodes5, the role of electrode material and electrolyte in the rate capability, an advantage of EDLCs, is sometimes overlooked. Efficient ionic transport is crucial for maintaining performance at high charge and discharge rates6,7,8, particularly in thick electrodes that can be used to increase the supercapacitor energy density9,10,11.

Electrode mesoporosity (having pores with diameters of 2–50 nm) is often mentioned as a critical component for efficient ionic transport. The mesopores serve as a bridge between micropores (where charge storage occurs) and the bulk electrolyte12,13,14,15,16,17. However, the relation between mesoporosity, ionic transport and performance remains insufficiently understood. Although some studies have demonstrated improved performance in materials with engineered mesoporous architectures (such as elongated channels designed to facilitate rapid ion transport8,9,10,11,18 or electrodes with etched microporous patterns19,20), others indicate that mesopores do not necessarily enhance ionic transport in carbon materials21,22. Disentangling the relative contributions of pore architecture, meso- and macroporous specific surface area (SSA), and ionic diffusion to supercapacitor performance remains a substantial challenge, and existing studies have been, in part, limited by the lack of characterization of ionic transport in such complex porous structures, particularly in commercial nanoporous carbon.

Several techniques have been employed in attempts to analyse the pore structures of nanoporous carbon materials, each with inherent limitations. Gas physisorption, the standard method for evaluating the pore size distribution, relies on small gas molecules, so that it can overestimate the surface area and transport pathways accessible to larger electrolyte ions23. A pair distribution function analysis is effective for probing short-range atomic structures but is less well suited for investigating long-range pore connectivity or network organization24. Crystallographic techniques, like X-ray diffraction, are similarly limited by the lack of long-range order in amorphous carbon, whereas advanced tomographic methods, such as focused-ion-beam nanotomography, are restricted in resolution and cannot resolve micropores (<2 nm)25,26.

One approach for relating the porosity of a material to its ability to transport ions or charge is the Bruggeman equation, which has been widely used to link porosity to transport properties in materials such as the graphite electrodes of a lithium-ion battery27,28. However, its assumptions of uniform particle distribution and isotropic pores are inadequate for nanoporous carbon, which features irregular shapes, broad size distributions and highly disordered, hollow structures. Consequently, studies investigating the role of mesoporosity in ionic transport often rely on transmission electron microscopy, which tends to emphasize and more readily characterize ordered regions of the structure, potentially overlooking the transport behaviour in disordered regions of amorphous carbon12,14,16. These limitations underscore the need for experimental approaches that directly probe electrolyte transport within the pore network. Such approaches are critical for understanding the role of mesoporosity in facilitating ion movement and optimizing supercapacitor performance at high current densities.

Diffusion pulsed-field gradient (PFG) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a powerful technique for measuring transport in porous media and for investigating pore structure29,30. PFG NMR can measure the self-diffusion coefficients of molecules confined in the porosity, and it can characterize diffusion restrictions due to pore size, interconnectivity or surface interactions31,32. Tortuosity measurements obtained from PFG NMR have proven to be valuable for probing transport phenomena, and PFG NMR has been widely applied to the transport of hydrocarbon and shale gas in porous rocks33,34 and transport in ion-exchange membranes35,36. Tortuosity characterizes transport within a material. It describes the winding and indirect pathways for diffusion by highlighting the presence of dead ends, pore interconnectivity and multiscale diffusion properties35,36. In carbon-based EDLCs, in situ PFG NMR has been used to show that the ion diffusion coefficients are substantially reduced in nanoporous electrodes compared with the bulk, as the coefficients are modulated by changes in the ion population at the electrode–electrolyte interface during charging. Thus, PFG NMR has provided insights into the charging mechanism37. Other studies have used PFG NMR to investigate electrolyte diffusion in the hierarchical structures of nanoporous carbon, highlighting the interplay between diffusion, microporosity, mesoporosity and hierarchical pore architectures21,22. Although these template-assisted materials have provided initial insights into ion transport within complex structures, questions remain regarding diffusion across various length scales, pore connectivity and the characterization of pore architecture in more disordered, template-free materials, which are more commonly used for industrial production. Addressing these aspects is crucial for evaluating charge and discharge rates and large-scale ion transport.

In this study, we discover a connection between the fast-charging performance of supercapacitors and the ionic effective diffusion coefficient in the electrode nanopores. We assess the fast-charging capabilities of nanoporous carbon supercapacitors with electrochemistry experiments and employ PFG NMR to investigate the underlying mechanisms affecting performance. We hypothesize that increasing the tortuosity of the pore network impedes the transport of electrolyte ions to charge storage sites. By probing diffusion at >3 µm length scales (D∞), our results reveal a positive correlation between effective long-range diffusion and the rapid charge and discharge behaviour of supercapacitors. This relation is primarily influenced by material tortuosity. Building on previous NMR studies of supercapacitors37,38,39, our work identifies the pore network tortuosity as a critical factor linking electrode structure to charge and discharge rates, and it demonstrates how NMR can provide unique insights into the mechanisms driving supercapacitor efficiency.

Electrochemical measurements on a group of activated carbon cloths (ACCs) showed similar capacitances at a low current density (50 mA g−1) in 1 M tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TEABF4) in acetonitrile (ACN) (Fig. 1a), indicating that a similar amount of energy can be stored and released upon slow charging and discharging. However, the capacitance decreases with increasing current density at rates that can vary notably between the different carbon materials, highlighting the necessity of characterizing and reporting electrode capacitance at a range of current densities to fully capture the performance of an electrode material (Fig. 1a).

Source data

To quantify the rate performance of electrode materials, we fitted the capacitance versus current density data with a decaying exponential function to obtain the rate capability J0, which represents the current density at which 63% of the initial capacitance is lost (Fig. 1). Higher values of J0 indicate better supercapacitor rate performance. We found J0 values ranging from 1.6 A g−1 for ACC-10 up to 91.1 A g−1 for ACC-20 electrodes in 1 M TEABF4 electrolyte in ACN (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). As ACC-20 has larger pores than ACC-10 (Supplementary Fig. 2), we hypothesized that this would reduce the restrictions on ionic transport during charging, leading to better rate performance. To test this hypothesis, we systematically varied the electrolyte cation size using a fixed electrode material (ACC-15), with TEABF4, tetrapropylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TPABF4) and tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TBABF4) electrolytes (1 M in ACN). Increasing the cation size reduced the fast-charging performance (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1) owing to the more restricted porosity accessible to the electrolyte40,41.

Mesoporosity (pore sizes >2 nm) is often associated with providing transport channels for rapid electrolyte movement, whereas microporosity (pore sizes <2 nm) is linked to enhancing performance at low current densities due to its charge-storing surface interactions13,15,17,42. To examine the role of mesoporosity on rate capability, we performed rate capability measurements of nanoporous carbon with various combinations of micro- and mesopores (Supplementary Fig. 2) and analysed the correlations between rate capability and mesopore and micropore SSAs (Fig. 2a,b). We did not observe a strong correlation between rate capability with microporosity or mesoporosity measured for carbon and films (Fig. 2a,b). This indicates that mesoporosity is not the primary determinant of rate capability21,22. SSA measurements obtained from N2 adsorption can overestimate the surface area accessible to electrolyte molecules, as the narrow micropores accessible to N2 molecules might be inaccessible to the larger electrolyte ions. As a result, the SSA derived from N2 adsorption may not accurately represent the active surface area involved in electrochemical processes. Importantly, supercapacitor performance is not driven solely by surface area but by the efficient transport of ions through the pore network21,22, which is expected to depend on pore interconnectivity. Therefore, we hypothesized that directly studying electrolyte transport over longer length scales within the porous network using PFG NMR would provide a more accurate depiction of the factors determining good performance at high current densities.

PFG NMR probes ionic effective diffusion and tortuosity in the carbon nanopore network. It is a relevant approach because it characterizes how electrolyte ions navigate the meso- and microporous structure of the electrode under conditions like those in actual supercapacitor operation. To measure diffusion within the porosity of nanoporous carbon, here defined as the effective diffusion coefficient over a timescale (and, therefore, length scale) set by the experimental parameters, nanoporous carbon was loaded into an NMR tube, which was then filled with an excess of electrolyte to saturate the carbon pores in the absence of any external potential (Fig. 3a). In the 19F NMR spectra of ACC electrode materials soaked in 1 M TEABF4 electrolyte in ACN, we resolved in-pore and ex-pore anionic environments43,44,45 (Fig. 3a). In this context, ex-pore environments are where anions occupy the interstitial spaces between nanoporous particles and in-pore environments are where ions are confined within the carbon nanopores. PFG NMR measurements use gradient pulses to encode and decode the position of nuclear spins. If the positions of nuclei change during the experiment, for example, because of self-diffusion, the signal measured at the end of the experiment decreases, allowing the diffusion coefficient to be determined46.

Source data

Initially, ACC-15 saturated with 1 M TEABF4 (ACN) was studied using an intermediate diffusion time (85 ms). Diffusion 19F PFG NMR measurements reveal two components in the in-pore anionic environment (Fig. 3b,c). The dominant slow-diffusing component (Fig. 3b,c, blue component) corresponds to ionic diffusion within the porosity, which is influenced by electrolyte/surface interactions, pore connectivity and geometry. This component reflects the intrinsic transport properties of the electrode material. By contrast, the faster-diffusing component (Fig. 3b,c, magenta component) is driven by in-pore to ex-pore anion exchange, that is anions leaving a particle to enter another one during the diffusion time, leading to a greatly increased effective diffusion coefficient. This is expected to vary with particle packing and particle size22,37,47 but does not represent the intrinsic electrode properties and is, therefore, not analysed further. Unlike previous work37, no external potential was applied, so the effective diffusion coefficients reflect the ease of ionic transport in the porosity without contributions from electrostatic interactions during charging and discharging.

For ACC-15 soaked with 1 M TEABF4 (ACN), the effective anionic in-pore diffusion coefficient decreases with increasing diffusion time (Fig. 3d). This contrasts with the neat electrolyte (Supplementary Fig. 3), in which the diffusion coefficient stays constant. Here we consider in-pore diffusion in two limiting cases: (1) D0, at a low diffusion time and (2) D∞, at long diffusion times. Because of their finite strength, the PFGs cannot capture slow diffusion processes at very low diffusion times, so D0 and D∞ were obtained by fitting the data. The fitting equation was adapted from the Taylor expansion introduced by Mitra et al.48, which is valid only in the limit of short diffusion times.By contrast, our generalized equation (equation (2)) satisfyingly captures the diffusion behaviour across both short and long diffusion times. The effective diffusion coefficient of anions at short diffusion time D0 (1.5 × 10−10 m2 s−1; Fig. 3d) was found to be one order of magnitude below that of anions in bulk electrolyte (1.5 × 10−9 m2 s−1; Supplementary Fig. 3). This is due to the anionic adsorption of anions and solvent molecules within the pores, which slows down anionic diffusion. Over long diffusion times, ionic transport occurs across a larger pore network, which is measured by the effective long-range diffusion coefficient D∞ and is expected to be hindered by the size of the constrictions connecting the pores and the degree of interconnectivity between them, both of which determine whether the porosity is accessible to the electrolyte and contribute to the long-range diffusion coefficient at long diffusion times. Indeed, we found D∞ =5.8 × 10−12 m2 s−1 for BF4− ions diffusing in the pores of ACC-15, which is much lower than D0 (1.5 × 10−10 m2 s−1).

The observed dependence of the effective diffusion coefficient on the diffusion times is a way to probe diffusion at different length scales49. The root-mean-square (r.m.s.) displacement in the gradient direction \(\sqrt{\langle {z}^{2}\rangle} =\sqrt{2D\Delta }\), where Δ is the diffusion time and D the diffusion coefficient, provides an estimate of the transportation distance in the gradient direction z (ref. 50). In this study, we were able to probe diffusion at the ~0.2–3 µm length scale (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 4). For the diffusion measurements made in this work, contributions from in-pore to ex-pore anionic exchange have been filtered out, and therefore, the measurements are limited when the r.m.s. displacement exceeds the particle size at longer diffusion times. Furthermore, note that the anionic r.m.s. displacements from self-diffusion are expected to be much smaller than those attained during charging when an electric field gradient driving ionic transport is applied. Therefore, the scope of this work is to characterize material properties rather than ionic transport across the electrode during charging.

The discrepancy between the diffusion coefficient found at short diffusion times (D0) and long diffusion times (D∞) represents the diffusion coefficients in the two limiting cases of short-range diffusion (<0.2 µm) and long-range diffusion (>3 µm) (Fig. 3e). This discrepancy can be quantified using tortuosity values34, which are here defined as τ = D0/D∞, where the diffusion coefficients at short (D0) and long (D∞) diffusion times are obtained from PFG NMR. Tortuosity describes the extent to which the pathways within a porous material deviate from a straight line. It reflects the structural complexity of the material and is commonly quantified by comparing the effective distance travelled by diffusing particles with the shortest possible distance between two points (Fig. 3c, bottom). Given the large tortuosity values measured in our work, it was essential to extrapolate the short-range diffusion coefficient to values not limited by the finite gradient strengths imposed by the instrumentation, which set a lower bound on the diffusion times suitable for accurate diffusion measurements.

To investigate the link between ionic transport and rate capability, we conducted PFG NMR measurements on various carbon powders and cloths saturated with 1 M TEABF4 (ACN), which was chosen to exhibit resolved in-pore and ex-pore environments in 19F spectra. These measurements were critical for separating the dominant bulk electrolyte signal from the much weaker in-pore contribution (Supplementary Figs. 5–8). The selected carbon materials represent a broad range of rate capabilities (Supplementary Fig. 1), graphene-like domain sizes39 and pore size distributions (Supplementary Fig. 2). Scanning electron microscopy images of powders and films (Supplementary Fig. 9) show that all samples contained particles (>3 µm) larger than the in-pore r.m.s. displacement.

Nanoporous carbon electrodes traditionally require polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) binder to transform loose powders into self-standing films. However, this binder can obstruct pores and diminish electrochemical performance, and the film fabrication process considerably reduces the experimental throughput. We compared PFGs measurements between powders and films immersed in electrolyte to quantify these effects. Films containing 5 wt% PTFE exhibited an approximately 1.5-fold higher tortuosity and a corresponding 1.5-fold decrease in long-range diffusivity compared with unbound powders, directly demonstrating the restrictive effect of PTFE on electrolyte transport pathways (Supplementary Fig. 10). Notably, these differences were modest relative to the variations in tortuosity and diffusivity across our different systems. Together, these findings indicate that, although film preparation can slightly reduce transport, powder-based measurements still provide valid insights into pore accessibility and transport phenomena. Using powders also streamlines sample handling and enables more rapid screening of carbon materials.

The short-range (<0.2 µm) effective diffusion coefficient D0 did not show any clear correlation with the rate capability (Fig. 4a), SSA or capacitance (Supplementary Fig. 11). By contrast, the long-range effective diffusion (>3 µm) D∞ showed a clear correlation with the measured rate capability (Fig. 4b). Carbon and electrolyte combinations with slower long-range anionic diffusivity D∞ typically have a lower rate performance, which indicates that long-range in-pore ionic transport (for example, ionic transport through the electrode) is much more important than short-range transport (for example, ions moving to form the electric double layer) in determining supercapacitor charging rates. The discrepancy between long-range and short-range ionic transport is further illustrated by the anionic r.m.s. displacements along the gradient axis (Supplementary Fig. 4), which indicate that typically much longer-range anionic transport is possible in samples with lower tortuosity. r.m.s. displacements from self-diffusion are typically much smaller than those attained during charging when an electric field gradient is applied. Consequently, D∞ does not grow linearly with the rate capability and plateaus at values above 100 A g−1. This indicates that power performance is not always limited by the approximately 3-µm ionic transport range observed in our experiments and that larger-scale structural features may play a role in enhancing performance.

Interestingly, \({D}_{\infty }\) does not correlate with the mesoporous SSA (Fig. 4c), which further supports the idea that other factors beyond SSA play a role in determining ionic transport and performance. These factors could include pore interconnectivity or the relative size of electrolyte molecules to the pore and pore constriction sizes. This result is consistent with previous reports of increased performance in samples containing large transport channels19,51.

To evaluate the contribution of pore interconnectivity, we measured the tortuosity of our samples (Fig. 4d). For the carbon–electrolyte systems studied, we found pore network tortuosity values ranging from approximately 8 to 105 (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 12), which highlights the diversity in the long-range electrolyte transport in the different samples. The particularly high tortuosity values in some samples demonstrate that ionic transport can be limiting in some electrode materials, as the diffusion path length was more than two orders of magnitude longer than diffusion in a straight line in some samples. Excitingly, we found a good correlation between the tortuosity parameter plotted against rate capability (Fig. 4d) and, overall, that higher tortuosity was associated with lower electrode performance at high current densities owing to the more indirect ionic transport pathways. The tortuosity values did not correlate with the microporous or mesoporous SSA (Supplementary Fig. 11), indicating that, in addition to the pore sizes, the pore arrangements and how pores are connected are important considerations for fast-charging performance. Both D∞ and tortuosity plateau at rate capabilities above 100 A g−¹, indicating that other factors may also limit supercapacitor performance at high current densities.

To elucidate the mechanistic origin of the tortuosity–rate capability relation, we considered the ion transport processes underlying supercapacitor charging. Charge storage proceeds through ion migration to electrode surfaces, where counter-ion adsorption and co-ion desorption form electric double layers. Two mechanisms may limit this process: ohmic polarization, arising from resistive losses along tortuous pathways, and concentration polarization, which develops when ion transport cannot match the applied current, generating concentration gradients that restrict pore accessibility. As the measured cell resistance shows no correlation with tortuosity (Supplementary Fig. 14), ohmic losses are probably masked by other resistive contributions, indicating that concentration polarization dominates the rate limitation.

The relation between tortuosity and rate capability can be described using the Nernst–Planck equation for ion transport52 (Supplementary Information Section 1). Here electrolyte transport constraints manifest as a decline in galvanostatic charge–discharge-measured capacitance at high current densities, which isolates transport-limited pore accessibility rather than RC time constants that convolve resistive and capacitive effects53,54. In the regime where anionic electromigration becomes rate-limiting, the critical current density J0 marks the onset of capacitance loss and scales inversely with tortuosity (J0 ∝ 1/\(\tau\)). Experimentally, a linear correlation between J0 and 1/\(\tau\) (Supplementary Fig. 15) confirms that tortuosity directly governs the transport-limited rate capability of porous electrodes.

Interestingly, increasing the electrolyte cation size leads to lower measured long-range effective anionic diffusion coefficients and tortuosities (navy points in Fig. 4b,d and Supplementary Table 1). These variations reflect how cation size and solvation shells affect the accessibility of porosity to electrolyte ions, markedly influencing their ability to enter pores and modulate the available volume for anionic transport. Because electroneutrality must be preserved, if a cation cannot access a given pore, anions are also excluded from that space to maintain the charge balance. This effect becomes more pronounced in closed or poorly connected pores. As a result, cation size indirectly impacts anion mobility by restricting the fraction of the pore space that is functionally accessible. It is important to note that the observed diffusion coefficients reflect ion motion across the entire porous network, which spans micrometre-scale distances, but they are strongly governed by nanoscale effects such as pore accessibility, crowding and local confinement. The tortuosity metric helps to disentangle these geometric and structural effects from purely molecular-scale mobility (for example, as predicted by the Stokes–Einstein relation), thus allowing us to focus on how the material architecture modulates transport. These findings highlight the value of anionic diffusion as a sensitive probe of supercapacitor rate performance and demonstrate that 19F PFG NMR remains an effective tool for characterizing transport and pore connectivity, even when the cation properties are varied.

Using PFG NMR, we have shown that long-range ionic transport determines the rate performance of nanoporous carbon electrodes. Tortuosity measurements at the micrometre scale revealed that well-connected pore networks enable faster ion access, directly enhancing high-rate charging and discharging. These results establish tortuosity as a key structural descriptor linking pore architecture to electrochemical behaviour and show that PFG NMR is a robust and quantitative tool for its characterization.

Our findings indicate that the design of electrode materials should go beyond maximizing charge storage by focusing on engineering the pore connectivity to minimize transport limitations. By combining low-tortuosity networks with materials that efficiently store charge, future supercapacitors and potentially other electrochemical energy-storage devices could achieve faster and more energy-efficient operation under demanding current densities.

More broadly, this framework bridges microscopic transport measurements and macroscopic device performance and offers a route to rational design principles for porous materials. Approaches that integrate structural control across several length scales, from atomic-level ordering to micrometre-scale connectivity, are probably most effective in overcoming diffusion bottlenecks. Such strategies could inform the development of next-generation electrodes that deliver both high energy and high power, thus accelerating progress towards sustainable, high-performance, energy-storage technologies.

YP50F and YP80F activated carbon powders were sourced from Kuraray, and PW-400 carbon powders came from Carbon Activated Corp. ACCs (ACC-5092-10, ACC-5092-15 and ACC-5092-20) were obtained from Kynol. PowerSorb EL-106 and EL-104 were obtained from Jacobi Carbons Group. TEABF4, TPABF4 and TBABF4 salts (Acros Organics) were dried at 100 °C for 7 days and made into a 1 M solution with N2-purged (3 h) anhydrous ACN from Sigma-Aldrich. Activated 3-Å molecular sieves were used to dry the electrolyte solution further.

Nanoporous carbon powers were dried for at least 2 days in a vacuum oven at 100 °C and transferred to an N2-filled glovebox where enough material was loaded in a 5-mm tube to fill the NMR coil. The carbon was covered with an excess of dry 1 M TEABF4, TPABF4 or TBABF4 electrolyte in dry ACN (≥99.0%, Sigma-Aldrich). NMR tubes were sealed with PTFE tape, and the electrolyte was left overnight at room temperature to fill the sample porosity.

Electrochemical measurements were performed as in our previous studies39,55. ACCs were directly used as electrodes, whereas powdered carbon was made into free-standing carbon electrode films by mixing carbon powder (95 wt%) with PTFE binder (5 wt%) in ethanol, rolling it to ~0.25 mm thickness and drying at 100 °C for 24 h to remove residual solvents. All electrochemical cells were symmetric two-electrode coin cells assembled in a N2-filled glovebox. Electrodes were cut with a stainless-steel manual punch (6.4 mm diameter), while ensuring that the electrodes in each cell had the same mass within 0.2 mg, which ranged from 3.5 mg to 5.2 mg for carbon films and from 5.5 mg to 8.5 mg for ACCs due to their increased thickness. The mass loading ranged from 10.9 mg cm−2 to 16.3 mg cm−2 for films and 17.2 mg cm−2 to 26.6 mg cm−2 for ACCs. Electrodes were separated with a Whatman GF/A glass fibre separator, and approximately 150 µl of electrolyte was added. Stainless-steel (SS316) spacer discs and a spring were used as current collectors, and cells were sealed with a hydraulic crimper (Cambridge Energy Solutions) under a pressure of 80 kg cm−3 for approximately 40 s. All components were stainless steel and supplied by Cambridge Energy Solutions.

Electrochemical measurements were performed with a Biologic BCS-805 potentiostat. Constant current charge and discharge measurements were conducted for various current densities (from 0.05 A g−1 to 2 A g−1) with the same voltage window (0–2.5 V) for at least three cycles per condition. The capacitance was calculated from the slope of the second half of the discharge curve, with results averaged across at least two cells (standard deviation <5 F g−1). Error bars reflect standard deviations across two cells. Sufficient cell precycling was verified by repeating charge and discharge tests at 50 mA g−1 to ensure stable capacitance after pore wetting. The data are plotted in Supplementary Fig. 13.

To assess the rate capability across various nanoporous carbon materials and electrolytes, the capacitance C(J) was fitted against current density J using the expression \(C(J)={C}_{0}\exp (J/{J}_{0})\), where J0 represents the rate capability (Supplementary Fig. 1). To remove the contribution from the cell design, data points corresponding to less than 80% capacitance retention were excluded.

PFG NMR experiments were carried out using a Bruker Avance Neo spectrometer and a 5 mm H/F-BB diffusion probe at a magnetic field strength of 9.4 T (1H Larmor frequency at 400 MHz) and 25 °C sample temperature. The diffusion experiments used stimulated echo and longitudinal eddy-current delay bipolar gradient pulses for diffusion and two spoil gradients that yielded high-resolution, distortion-free NMR spectra46 (ledpbgp2s Topspin pulse sequence). The pulse durations of the diffusion gradients δ were each 1 ms long with pre-emphasis. The gradient strengths were varied from 17.1 mT m−1 to 16.7 T m−1 in 32 increments on an exponential scale. The gradients were calibrated using the self-diffusion coefficient of dry ethylene glycol56 at 25 °C (8.87 × 10−11 m2 s−1). Diffusion delays Δ ranged from approximately 3.5 ms up to 500 ms in 16 increments on a logarithmic scale. The sequence used two 8.5 mT m−1 spoil pulses of 100 µs and 100-µs gradient recovery times. The optimized 19F 90° pulses on resonance was about 20 µs, which is approximately 12.5 kHz. The recycling delay was set to 5 s.

The in-pore environment was integrated in MATLAB, and the diffusion decay was fitted with the sum of two components46:

where Di is the diffusion coefficient in m2 s−1, γ is the gyromagnetic ratio in rad s−1 T−1, δ is the summed duration of the two gradient pulses during the encoding or decoding, g is the strength in T m−1 and Δ is the diffusion time in seconds.

The tortuosity \(\tau\) and diffusion coefficient D0 were obtained by fitting the diffusion coefficient D(Δ) versus the diffusion time, with the equation generalized from the Taylor equation in the limit of short diffusion times developed by Mitra et al.31,48:

Error bars show the 95% confidence interval.

N2 gas physisorption experiments were carried out using a high-vacuum physisorption and chemisorption analyser (Autosorb iQ from Anton Paar) at 77 K. For each carbon sample, around 25 mg of powder was placed into a glass bulb gas cell and degassed at 120 °C in vacuo for 16 h before the measurement57. Pore size distributions were calculated with quenched-solid density functional theory (slit-pore model) based on a slit-pore model. The microporous and mesoporous SSAs were determined by integrating the pore size distribution plots for pores <20 Å and >20 Å, respectively.

Scanning electron microscopy was performed using a Tescan CLARA 2 scanning electron microscope. Samples were imaged in ultrahigh resolution scan mode using an Everhart-Thornley secondary electron detector. The accelerating voltage was set to 5 keV, with a working distance of approximately 6 mm and a beam current of 61 pA. Uncoated samples were mounted on standard aluminium stubs using carbon tape and imaged under high vacuum.

Aging biomarkers are essential tools for quantifying biological aging, but systematic validation has been hindered by methodological inconsistencies and fragmented datasets. Here we show that the ability of traditional aging clocks to predict chronological age does not correlate with mortality prediction capacity (R = 0.12, P = 0.67), suggesting that these metrics capture distinct biological processes. We developed Biolearn, an open-source framework enabling standardized evaluation of 39 biomarkers across over 20,000 individuals from diverse cohorts. The Horvath skin and blood clock achieved the highest chronological age accuracy (R2 = 0.88), while GrimAge2 demonstrated the strongest mortality association (hazard ratio = 2.57) and healthspan prediction (hazard ratio = 2.00). Our systematic evaluation reveals considerable heterogeneity in biomarker performance across different clinical outcomes, with optimal biomarkers varying according to specific application. Biolearn provides unified data processing pipelines with quality control and cell-type deconvolution capabilities, establishing a foundation for reproducible aging research and facilitating development of robust aging biomarkers.

Achieving the efficient integration and synergy of multi-component polymers is an effective approach for the development of new polymer materials and breakthroughs in performance. However, there are still considerable challenges in achieving molecular-level integration of multi-component polymers. Here we report polymer chain entanglement through asymmetric entangled nodes, inspired by macroscopic woven materials with different warp and weft strands, achieving the integration of polyurethane and epoxy resin chains at the molecular level. The abundant dynamic entanglements within the polymer network, reminiscent of woven topologies, enable the flexible polyurethane chains and rigid epoxy chains to work synergistically under external stress, thereby imparting excellent mechanical and adhesive properties to the final network. This study demonstrates the potential of weaving-inspired molecular-level entanglement in polymer integration and performance modulation, while also providing an important reference for the design of novel multi-component polymeric materials through weaving-inspired strategies.

The advent of polymers, particularly synthetic polymers, has profoundly advanced human civilization by providing materials with unparalleled versatility and functionality1,2,3,4. However, the limitations inherent in single-type polymers often restrict their applicability in emerging application scenarios. To overcome these challenges, it is essential to merge multiple types of polymer, achieving efficient integration that combines the advantages and functions of diverse types of polymer5,6,7,8,9. Current polymer integration methods, such as blending and copolymerization, have been used to merge different polymers10,11,12,13,14,15, but they often fall short of achieving effective synergy owing to issues such as incompatibility and limited control over polymer chain distribution16,17,18. Consequently, these methods may not fully realize the potential of multi-component polymeric materials. This underscores the pressing need for innovative approaches to polymer integration that can seamlessly merge different polymer chains at the molecular level, unlocking new possibilities in polymeric material design.

Weaving has been proven to be an efficient and versatile technique, where simple linear materials are entangled through the induction of numerous entangled nodes, achieving a high degree of integration and synergy between warp and weft segments, forming intricate and refined topological structures and imparting exceptional mechanical properties to the fabric materials19,20,21,22,23. Drawn by the fascinating structures and interesting properties of macroscopic weaving, chemists have been striving to incorporate weaving at the molecular level, with the goal of developing novel polymeric materials through bottom-up weaving control24. Since the Yaghi group reported the first example of woven covalent organic frameworks in 2016 (ref. 25), molecularly woven polymers have garnered widespread attention26,27,28,29. These pioneering efforts demonstrated that entanglement at the molecular level can effectively regulate the topological structures and mechanical properties of polymeric materials. It is noteworthy that macroscopic weaving not only regulates the structures and properties of materials but also integrates various types of functional fibre through entangled nodes, creating woven materials with diverse warp and weft threads that achieve a high degree of synergy among different materials30,31,32,33 (Fig. 1a). Inspired by this approach, we envisaged interlacing different polymer chains through molecularly entangled nodes, utilizing their dynamic synergistic effects akin to woven topologies to achieve effective integration of the polymer chains, thereby creating functional polymeric materials with enhanced performance. However, current research on woven polymer networks mainly focuses on molecular chains with identical components, leaving the challenge of leveraging weaving-inspired strategies to achieve efficient integration and synergy of different polymer chains at the molecular level unresolved.

a, A schematic representation of woven networks with the same (left) and different (right) warps and wefts. b, A schematic representation of the formation of polymer network WPU-EP crosslinked by weaving-inspired asymmetric entangled nodes. The asymmetric entangled nodes facilitate the efficient entanglement of flexible (PU) and rigid (EP) polymers, enabling molecular-level integration of their respective advantages and functions.

In the present work, we have achieved efficient integration and synergy of two types of polymer chain at the molecular level by utilizing the weaving-inspired asymmetric entangled nodes, resulting in a polymer network with exceptional performance. Specifically, we synthesized a bis-hydroxylated tridentate ligand (TL)34,35,36,37,38 and copolymerized it with polytetramethylene ether glycol (PTMG) and hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) to form a linear polyurethane (PU) containing tridentate binding sites (PUT). Subsequently, the coordinative binding between the tridentate binding sites in PUT and monodentate ligand (ML) was realized by the addition of palladium acetate, resulting in the highly efficient formation of asymmetric entangled nodes in the polymer chains (PUW). Finally, by copolymerizing the epoxy resin (EP) fragment E51 and the chain extender diamine (N,N′-dimethylethane-1,2-diamine, DMEDA) at the nodes of the PUW chains, the chain entanglements induced by the asymmetric entangled nodes facilitate the integration between the PU and EP chains, forming a polymer network (WPU-EP). The core of this approach involves using palladium (II) to create weaving-inspired asymmetric entangled nodes through coordination between tridentate and monodentate ligands, enabling the stepwise polymerization of PU and EP into a synergistic polymer network with the entanglements. In this network, the flexible PU segments and rigid EP segments are highly integrated through the mediation of the numerous entangled nodes (Fig. 1b). The movement and deformation of the flexible segments, along with dynamic entangled node dissociation and polymer segment slippage, provide the material with dynamic properties that effectively absorb and dissipate energy while dispersing stress under external forces. Meanwhile, both the rigid EP segments and the intricate entanglement topology serve as a skeleton to maintain the integrity of the topological network. Consequently, the efficient integration and synergy of flexible and rigid polymer chains at the entangled nodes impart excellent mechanical properties to the resulting network.

PU and EP are among the most commonly used polymeric materials in industrial production. PU polymers are typically known for their excellent elasticity and flexibility39,40. Conversely, EP, while exhibiting high strength and modulus after curing, has high brittleness and limited flexibility41,42. Therefore, in industrial applications, it is common to blend these two materials to enhance their overall performance and meet the demands of various harsh environments43,44,45. In this work, we selected PU and EP as examples to explore the synergy of topological entanglement in facilitating the integration of different polymers and enhancing their performance. We synthesized the WPU-EP network and, for comparison, also created CPU-EP and SPU-EP networks (Fig. 2f), with their primary distinction being the topological structures formed through entangled, covalent and supramolecular crosslinks, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 1–23 and Supplementary Tables 1–3).

The construction of WPU-EP hinges on inducing entanglement through weaving-inspired asymmetric entangled nodes. To validate the feasibility of interlaced coordination at the asymmetric entangled node, we successfully used model ligands to construct an asymmetric entangled node and analysed its crystal structure (Fig. 2a) using X-ray diffraction (Supplementary Table 6). The crystal structure presented in Fig. 2a demonstrates that, as expected, interlaced asymmetric coordination occurred in the presence of palladium(II), suggesting that this class of molecular entangled nodes can effectively induce the entanglement of different polymer chains. On this basis, the entangled crosslinked polymer network WPU-EP was obtained by stepwise polymerization of PU and EP chains via the polar functional groups at the end of the nodes. This polymeric material exhibits a transparent pale yellow colour and, due to the entanglement of the nodes, maintains structural stability. It does not dissolve after being immersed in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) for 24 h (Fig. 2b). The changes in characteristic functional group signals of the three polymer networks were also investigated in the condensed state by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 2c, the peaks around 2,120 cm−1 corresponding to the NCO groups and 912 cm−1 corresponding to the epoxy groups disappeared completely in the all three polymer networks, indicating that both HDI and E51 in the systems have been completely reacted to construct polymeric networks. The peaks at 3,300–3,600 cm−1, 1,660–1,720 cm−1 and 1,010–1,250 cm−1 were assigned as the characteristic absorptions of N–H and O–H, C=O, and C–O–C, respectively, which demonstrates the formation of urethane groups and the introduction of a large number of hydroxyl groups in the EP chains. The peaks at 2,850–2,960 cm−1, 1,490–1,550 cm−1 and 810–830 cm−1 were ascribed as the stretching vibrations of CH2 and benzene rings and the bending vibrations of para-disubstituted benzene rings, indicating the successful integration of PU and EP segments in the networks. Moreover, the peak at 1,450 cm−1 ascribed to the pyridine groups of the nodes was found only in the spectra of WPU-EP and SPU-EP, demonstrating the presence of crosslinks in the networks.

The segmental mobility within a polymer network is constrained by its crosslinking structure; therefore, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on the three polymer networks to investigate their thermal transition behaviours. The endothermic peak formed by the melting of crystalline PTMG in the PU chains is located around 23 °C. The glass transition temperatures (Tg) of CPU-EP, WPU-EP and SPU-EP are −69.8 °C, −70.1 °C and −78.2 °C, respectively (Fig. 2d). These low Tg values are mainly attributed to the PU soft segments in the networks (Supplementary Fig. 29). At a higher temperature (65.6 °C), the SPU-EP sample exhibited another Tg, attributed to the EP polymer segments within the network. Due to the weaker constraints imposed by supramolecular crosslinking, the polymer chains in SPU-EP exhibit enhanced chain mobility, which facilitates partial phase separation resulting from the limited compatibility between PU and EP segments. A similar situation can also be observed in the PU/EP blend sample (Supplementary Fig. 30). However, this phenomenon was not observed in the WPU-EP sample with the same composition, implying that the induced entanglement of the entangled nodes enhances the integration of these two distinct polymers. The swelling curves of the three networks (Fig. 2e) also indicate that the more interchain entanglements within WPU-EP contributes to maintaining network stability, even though DMF partially disrupts the coordination bonds during the swelling process46. In general, the introduction of topological entanglements brings the two polymer chains closer together while preserving the dynamics of the structure, thereby creating favourable conditions for their synergistic effects (Fig. 2f).

To explore the effect of the entangled structure on the strength and toughness of integrated polymer networks of PU and EP, a series of mechanical property tests were carried out on a WPU-EP sample, a CPU-EP sample and an SPU-EP sample. As shown in Fig. 3a, the CPU-EP sample possesses the highest Young's modulus (76.1 MPa) among the three samples (SPU-EP is 66.3 MPa and WPU-EP is 67.8 MPa) due to covalent crosslinking, while its stretchability is the lowest at 771% due to the lack of dynamic properties of the crosslinks, with a maximum stress of 25.8 MPa. The SPU-EP sample, through supramolecular crosslinking, exhibited a maximum stress of 25.4 MPa and a stretchability of 1937%. However, despite a remarkable improvement over CPU-EP, its stretchability value remains considerably lower than that (3105%) of WPU-EP, probably due to insufficient integration of the PU and EP components under supramolecular crosslinking, which leads to progressive fracture of both crosslinking points and the network structure. When the polymer network was crosslinked by entangled nodes, WPU-EP achieved an ultrahigh strain at break of 3,105% with a maximum stress of 63.3 MPa. This may be attributed to the entangled nodes based on metal coordination, which improve structural dynamics under external forces and enhance the entanglement of polymer chains, facilitating the integration of two originally incompatible polymers and achieving their synergistic effect (Supplementary Fig. 38). Benefitting from its excellent tensile and structural strengths, WPU-EP achieved an exceptionally high toughness of 989 MJ m−3, substantially higher than CPU-EP (142 MJ m−3) and SPU-EP (308 MJ m−3). Combined with the results of the cyclic stress–strain tests (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Figs. 41–55), WPU-EP showed better performance in terms of toughness, maximum stress, elongation at break, fatigue resistance and recoverability (Fig. 3b), suggesting that weaving-inspired entangled nodes have a unique advantage in constructing multi-component polymer networks.

Exploring the stress relaxation behaviour of a polymer network can be an effective indicator of the characteristics of changes in the network structure under stress conditions. As shown in Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 56, WPU-EP retained most of the stress below 110 °C, but the stress relaxation was gradually evident as the temperature continued to increase. This relaxation, however, did not completely release the stress in the network, quite different from SPU-EP, which relaxed almost completely within 10 s at 130 °C, and CPU-EP, which did not change appreciably with temperature (Supplementary Figs. 57 and 58). This difference is mainly attributed to the variation in the crosslinking mode, which consequently leads to the difference in the connectivity state of the polymer chains in the networks. We attempted to quantitatively evaluate the differences in the stability of the three networks by calculating their network activation capacities, derived from Arrhenius fitting of their stress relaxation data. As shown in Fig. 3d, the activation energies of WPU-EP, CPU-EP and SPU-EP were 32.4 kJ mol−1, 59.0 kJ mol−1 and 19.5 kJ mol−1, respectively, suggesting that the covalently crosslinked network is the most stable, whereas the topologically entangled network is superior to the supramolecular crosslinked network as indicated in other experiments (Supplementary Figs. 31–37).

To understand the role of the entangled nodes in the polymer network, we performed a temperature scan on all three polymer networks using a tensile mode of dynamic mechanical analysis. In Fig. 3e, the storage modulus E′ of WPU-EP showed a steady and continuous decrease after a plateau as the temperature increased from −100 °C to 150 °C. Meanwhile, the loss modulus E″ also exhibited a decreasing trend with increasing temperature after a small increase. As a result, the loss factor tan δ formed a broad peak around −45 °C, which is mainly attributed to the PU soft segments in the network. A similar phenomenon was also observed in the result of CPU-EP (Supplementary Fig. 60). Moreover, the subsequent rapid decline in E′ of all samples within the temperature range of −10 °C to 30 °C is mainly attributed to the melting of crystalline PTMG. However, a unique notable difference was observed in SPU-EP (Fig. 3f), that is, a peculiar rising interval in its E″ curve around 50 °C, causing tan δ to gain a new peak around 50 °C, which should be attributed to the EP segments within the network. This finding confirms the results of the DSC analysis, indicating that the entanglement of polymer chains induced by the nodes can effectively integrate the immiscible PU and EP segments, thereby suppressing phase separation within the network.

To further investigate the practical behaviour of topological entanglements within the network, we conducted large-amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) experiments (Fig. 3g). The moduli of oscillatory shear against the step time for WPU-EP and SPU-EP are shown in Fig. 3h and Supplementary Fig. 64, respectively. It could be found that WPU-EP and SPU-EP showed different trends in the variation of the modulus with time during a single LAOS stage (as indicated by the red arrows). Using the modulus at a strain of 600% as an example, the storage modulus G′ of WPU-EP exhibited an increasing trend over time, while that of SPU-EP showed a gradual decrease. This difference primarily stems from the distinct deformation behaviours of the two polymer networks under tensile stress. In WPU-EP, the presence of topological entanglements allows the entangled polymer chains to tighten and slip under stress while maintaining the overall network integrity. Moreover, the entangled topology enables efficient stress transfer throughout the network, thereby contributing to an increase in modulus. By contrast, the polymer chains in the SPU-EP network are crosslinked through relatively weak supramolecular nodes, which dissociate under applied stress, thereby triggering plastic deformation of the polymer. Therefore, as shown in Supplementary Figs. 62 and 65, when correlating the network moduli with the applied strains, the modulus of WPU-EP exhibits an initial decrease with increasing strain, followed by a plateau at approximately 150%. This indicates that the entangled nodes in the WPU-EP network endowed the structure with dynamics, and the presence of the high-density chain entanglements induced by these nodes hindered the further deformation of the network, thus maintaining the stability of the network structure. On the contrary, without the restraining effect of chain entanglements, the moduli of SPU-EP continuously decreased with the increase of applied strains, indicating the continuous deformation of the network. The frequency sweep results (Fig. 3i and Supplementary Figs. 63 and 66) indicate that the deformed network of WPU-EP has a faster recovery rate. Moreover, the continuous cyclic shear tests of WPU-EP and SPU-EP also demonstrated the crucial role of the polymer chain entanglements induced by the cross nodes in the structural stability of the network (Supplementary Figs. 67 and 68).

Subsequently, the demetallized WPU-EP and SPU-EP samples were prepared to further explore the influence of polymer chain entanglements on the properties of the polymer networks (Supplementary Figs. 24–28 and Supplementary Table 4). As shown in Fig. 3j, after the removal of metal ions, both the maximum stress (from 25.4 MPa to 15.5 MPa) and the elongation at break (from 1,937% to 1,092%) of SPU-EP dramatically decreased. Moreover, the demetallized SPU-EP shares similarities with the PU/EP blend sample in many aspects, including the swelling ratio, mechanical properties, phase separation state and so on (Supplementary Figs. 30, 31, 39, 40 and 61). By contrast, for WPU-EP, only the maximum stress decreased (from 63.3 MPa to 39.9 MPa), while the stretchability showed little change (from 3,105% to 2,989%). The primary reason for this phenomenon lies in the fact that, after the removal of metal ions, the polymer network can no longer dissipate energy through the breaking of coordination bonds under stress, resulting in a noticeable decrease in maximum stress (Supplementary Figs. 69‒74). However, despite the removal of metal ions, numerous chain entanglements remain within the polymer network, which help maintain the structural integrity during stretching and thereby preserve its excellent tensile performance. As indicated by the frequency sweep results after oscillatory shear at different strains, the demetallized WPU-EP maintained a stable modulus even at a strain of 300%, whereas the demetallized SPU-EP showed a marked reduction in modulus at strains as low as 50% (Fig. 3k and Supplementary Figs. 75–78).

Collectively, the weaving-inspired asymmetric entangled nodes formed via metal coordination play multiple critical roles in the polymer network. The metal–ligand coordination within these nodes strengthens intermolecular interactions across the network and provides effective energy dissipation pathways through the reversible dissociation of coordination bonds under stress. More importantly, the presence of these entangled nodes induces additional topological entanglements between polymer chains, which not only enhance the compatibility between otherwise immiscible polymer segments, but also promote their synergistic interactions through the mediating role of the entangled nodes. These synergistic mechanisms enable the polymer network to effectively avoid brittle failure and reduce plastic deformation under stress, resulting in a remarkable enhancement in its mechanical performance.

To further investigate the impact of entangled nodes on the properties of the polymers, we first prepared a series of WPU-EP samples with varying node proportions of 1%, 5% and 10%. As shown in Fig. 4a,b, the maximum stress and break strain of these samples experienced a huge undulation from 8.7 MPa and 276%, to 63.3 MPa and 3,105%, to 21.7 MPa and 966% as the proportion of nodes increased from 1% to 5% and to 10%. This behaviour is primarily due to the influence of the node content on the crosslinking density of the polymer network. Specifically, insufficient entangled nodes result in inadequate confinement of polymer chain entanglement, leading to a loosely structured network and a more pronounced tendency for phase separation (Supplementary Fig. 82). Conversely, excessive crosslinking creates a tightly crosslinked network that restricts a wide range of dynamic behaviours. The result of the cyclic tensile tests (Supplementary Figs. 79–81) also indicates that the increase in metal-coordinated entangled nodes enhances energy dissipation due to dynamic dissociation under extra stress.

Subsequently, we further investigated the impact of the EP content on the network performance by preparing a series of WPU-EP samples with varying EP contents of 15%, 20%, 30%, 50% and 70%. We initially conducted stress–strain tests on these samples. In Fig. 4c,d, we found that the elongation at break, maximum stress and toughness of the samples exhibited a continuous decrease with increasing the EP content in the network; for example, the maximum stress decreased from 63.3 MPa to 7.91 MPa. In the cyclic tensile tests, the damping capacity, residual strain and recovery capacity of these samples gradually increased with increasing EP content (Fig. 4e–g and Supplementary Figs. 83–97). This finding suggests that the performance of the polymeric network constructed from asymmetric nodes can be effectively tuned by controlling the contents of different polymer components, enabling adaptation to various application needs. To investigate the cause of this effect, we measured and analysed the loss factors of the samples. In Fig. 4h, as the EP content in the network increases, the peak of tan δ gradually intensifies within the temperature range of 50 °C to 80 °C. This indicates that, as the EP content continues to increase, the phenomenon of phase separation within the polymer network becomes more pronounced (Supplementary Fig. 98). Moreover, increasing the content of rigid EP segments in the network led to greater overall rigidity and a higher activation energy barrier (Fig. 4i). Based on the above experimental results, we preferred the WPU-EP sample with a 5% node proportion and 15% EP content, which has the highest tensile strength and toughness, for the dumbbell lifting experiment. In Fig. 4j and Supplementary Movie 1, a WPU-EP sheet of only 46 mg was used to easily lift a 3-kg dumbbell, whose weight is more than 65,200 times higher than its own mass, reflecting the great potential of asymmetric entangled nodes in the construction of multi-component polymeric networks.

EP is widely used in the bonding field because of its excellent adhesion, but its excessive rigidity is prone to brittle fracture under stress, necessitating the addition of flexible polymers to enhance its toughness. Encouraged by the above-discussed experimental results, we formulated an adhesive based on WPU-EP and compared it with a control adhesive that uses EP toughened by a marketed PU-based toughener, with the specific preparation steps of the adhesives shown in the Supplementary Information. The tensile strength was tested using aluminium as the substrate (Fig. 5a). The tensile strength of the WPU-EP-based adhesive was slightly higher than that of the control adhesive, and the stiffness was lower (Fig. 5b,c and Supplementary Table 5). Overall, the WPU-EP-based samples exhibited adhesive properties comparable to those of commercially available, traditional covalently crosslinked networks.

Unlike tensile strength, which primarily depends on the intrinsic bonding ability of the material, shear strength is more influenced by the toughness of the adhesive's internal structure. This is due to the uneven and localized stress concentrations within the sample, resulting from changes in the direction of the applied external force (Fig. 5d). Therefore, we tried to evaluate the state of the samples under different force modes to verify the stability of the bonding. In Supplementary Fig. 99, a 5-kg dumbbell was easily lifted by two aluminium plates bonded over an area of just 2.5 cm × 1.3 cm. Remarkably, with the same bonding area, a car weighing up to 2.1 tons was successfully towed using two aluminium pieces joined by the WPU-EP adhesive. The traction remained stable, unaffected by rapid stress fluctuations caused by road undulations (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Movie 2). Moreover, after the traction was completed, the braking of the trailing vehicle caused a sudden increase in tensile force, resulting in the breakage of the traction rope, while the bonded area showed no abnormalities (Supplementary Fig. 100), indicating that the bonding performance of the WPU-EP adhesive is excellent and of great practical value. The shear strength, 15.1 MPa, of WPU-EP is much higher than that, 6.82 MPa, of the control (Fig. 5f,g), but with lower stiffness. From the bonding areas after the break (Supplementary Fig. 101), we can conclude that the bond is strong and efficient, and its rupture should also be attributed to the cohesive destruction of the polymer itself. Overall, the induced entanglement from asymmetric nodes enables the efficient integration of PU and EP, leading to the development of an excellent adhesive that combines high tensile and shear strength47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55 (Fig. 5h).

In this study, we achieved the efficient integration of two polymers—PU and epoxy resin—through crosslinked entanglement induced by weaving-inspired asymmetric entangled nodes. The flexible PU segments and rigid epoxy segments work synergistically under the influence of the entangled nodes, resulting in a polymeric network with excellent mechanical properties and adhesion performance. More importantly, we advanced the concept of weaving-inspired polymer networks from single-component systems to multi-component systems. This progression allows the entanglement and integration of different types or functionalities of polymeric material through entangled nodes, enabling multi-component and multi-functional synergy, and providing insights and references for the development of novel polymeric materials. We believe that the integration of polyurethane and epoxy resin, enabled by weaving-inspired asymmetric entangled nodes, marks only the beginning. We look forward to exploring further combinations of diverse polymers to fully realize the vast potential of molecular weaving in the design of novel polymeric materials.

All reagents used in this research were commercially available and used as supplied by the manufacturer without further purification. Organic solvents were evaporated under reduced pressure on an Eyela rotary evaporator using a water bath (50 °C). All reactions were performed at ambient laboratory conditions, and no precautions were taken to exclude atmospheric moisture unless otherwise specified. 4-{[N-(Boc)methylamino]methyl}phenol was prepared according to literature procedures56.

The mechanical properties of the polymers were measured using an Instron 34SC-1 instrument in standard stress–strain experiments. Toughness values (total toughness) were obtained by integrating the area under the corresponding stress–strain curves. Energy dissipation (dissipated toughness) was calculated by integrating the area encompassed by the cyclic tensile curves. Damping capacity was defined as the ratio of the dissipated energy (the area encompassed by the loading and unloading curves) to the loading energy (the area encompassed by the loading curve). Fatigue resistance was defined as the ratio of the maximum stress after multiple stretches to the initial maximum stress. Recovery ratio was defined as the ratio of the difference between the set deformation and the residual deformation after unloading to the set deformation.

For WPU-EP, all the reactants were fed in certain ratios as shown in Supplementary Table 3. First, E51 was added to a solution of PUW in a CH2Cl2/MeCN mixture (3:1, about 20 ml). After the contents were well mixed (about 3 h) and the solution was concentrated to around 2 ml, DMEDA was added and the mixture was stirred well again. After stirring for 3 h, the mixture was poured into a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) plate, which was subsequently put in an oven at 80 °C for 12 h to allow the reaction to complete. Thus, a WPU-EP film was obtained.

For SPU-EP, P1 (5% node proportion, about 920 mg) was added to a solution of P2 (186 mg) in dry CH2Cl2 (10 ml). The solution was stirred vigorously for 2 h. The volatiles were removed under reduced pressure, and the mixture was poured into a PTFE plate. Then, the plate was put in an oven at 80 °C for 12 h to allow the reaction to complete. Thus, a SPU-EP film was obtained.

For CPU-EP, E51 (140 mg, 357 μmol) was added to a glue solution of P3 (all the resulting P3 product, about 0.91 g) in dry CH2Cl2 (10 ml). To avoid the occurrence of side reactions between the residual isocyanate groups and DMEDA, the mixture was thoroughly stirred for 6 h to ensure a complete reaction between P3 and E51. Then, after the solution was concentrated to around 2 ml, DMEDA (31.0 mg, 352 μmol) was added and the mixture was stirred well again. After 3 h, the mixture was poured into a PTFE plate, which was subsequently put in an oven at 80 °C for 12 h to allow the reaction to complete. Thus, a CPU-EP film was obtained.

For the PU/EP blend sample, PUT (about 910 mg) was added to a solution of P2 (186 mg) in dry CH2Cl2 (10 ml). The solution was stirred vigorously for 2 h. The volatiles were removed under reduced pressure, and the mixture was poured into a PTFE plate. Then, the plate was put in an oven at 80 °C for 12 h to allow the reaction to complete. Thus, the PU/EP blend samples were obtained.

For the demetallized samples, the films of WPU-EP and SPU-EP were immersed in 5 ml of a tetrabutylammonium cyanide solution (1 M solution in MeOH) for 24 h at room temperature, followed by sequential washing with 20 ml of MeOH three times. Then, the films were dried in an oven at 50 °C for 12 h to obtain the demetallized samples.

Initially, a frequency sweep from 300 to 1.2 rad s−1 within the linear viscoelastic regime (strain 0.2%) was performed to record the sample's baseline viscoelastic response. Subsequently, the following procedure was cyclically applied: (1) an oscillatory shear (preshear) with a defined strain amplitude (γ) was applied for 300 s to induce mechanical motion of the network nodes and deformation of the polymer matrix, and (2) immediately after the preshear, a frequency sweep (300 to 1.2 rad s−1, strain 0.2%) was conducted to capture the altered viscoelastic state of the network. This cycle was repeated 16 times with increasing strain amplitudes ranging from 0.2% to 700%, without any interval between successive cycles.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The GOP Civil War Over Nick Fuentes Has Just Begun","https://www.wired.com/story/gop-civil-war-over-nick-fuentes-antisemitism/","Tue, 04 Nov 2025 14:36:00 GMT","

Nick Fuentes, a white nationalist known for his deeply antisemitic, racist, and misogynist worldview, just might be tearing the Republican party apart.

The schism was triggered last Tuesday when former Fox News host Tucker Carlson released an in-depth interview with Fuentes, the leader of the so-called America First movement who has denied the Holocaust, praised Hitler, and shared deeply misogynistic views.

During the interview, Fuentes waxed antisemitic about the threat apparently posed by “organized Jewry” in America, while Carlson slammed figures like Senator Ted Cruz and former president George W. Bush as being “Christian Zionists” who have been ”seized by this brain virus.” Carlson was criticized by, among others, US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee for giving Fuentes a platform, and the argument kicked into overdrive after Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation, a high-profile conservative think tank, condemned those attacking Carlson as a ""venomous coalition.”

“Tucker Carlson remains and always will be a close friend of the Heritage Foundation,” Roberts said in a video posted to X on Thursday.

Roberts' comments, which were viewed by many as a tacit approval of Fuentes' antisemitic worldview, triggered a massive split on the right, with everyone from prominent podcasters and influencers to senators and other lawmakers weighing in to attack or defend Roberts and Carlson.

The debate continued to rage over the weekend as many claimed the situation was a reflection of a broader concern about a perceived rise in antisemitism within the MAGA movement.

“In the last six months, I've seen more antisemitism on the right than I have in my entire life,” Cruz told the Republican Jewish Coalition conference in Las Vegas last Thursday, hours after Roberts' video was released. “If you sit there with someone who says Adolf Hitler was very, very cool and that their mission is to combat and defeat global Jewry, and you say nothing, then you're a coward and you are complicit in that evil.”

Senator Mitch McConnell, quoting Roberts' video, wrote on X that conservatives are not obliged “to carry water for antisemites and apologists for America-hating autocrats.”

“My mother was a Heritage board member for 40 years,” John Podhoretz, a conservative political commentator, wrote on X, quoting Roberts' post. “You have befouled her, you rancid wretch of an amoeba.” Podhoretz deleted the post on Monday.

A number of prominent Republicans, however, came out in support of Roberts.

“Excellent statement my friend. Proud to stand with you and Heritage,” Eric Teetsel, the CEO of the Center for Renewing America, which is a conservative think tank founded by Project 2025 architect and current director of the Office of Management and Budget Russell Vought, wrote on X.

“This is the common ground we need to rescue our republic,” prominent podcaster Bret Weinstein wrote in response to Roberts' post. “Attempting to police thought, speech and association is anti-American, and will only deepen our divisions.”

On Friday, Roberts responded: “Nick Fuentes' antisemitism is not complicated, ironic, or misunderstood. It is explicit, dangerous, and demands our unified opposition as conservatives,” Roberts wrote on X, before adding that his role is not to cancel but to “guide, challenge, and strengthen the conversation.”

(That same day, National Review reported, Roberts announced to Heritage staff that his chief of staff, Ryan Neuhaus, had been reassigned; subsequently, in a story on tumult inside the think tank in the wake of Roberts' defense of Carlson, the New York Post reported that Neuhaus had resigned. Neuhaus didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.)

Roberts' disavowal of Fuentes did little to stop the criticism. At the Republican Jewish Coalition conference over the weekend in Las Vegas, US representative Randy Fine of Florida blasted Carlson for hosting Fuentes, calling him the “the most dangerous antisemite in America.”

“He has chosen to take on the mantle of leader of a modern-day Hitler Youth,” Fine said. “Friends, make no mistake: Tucker is not MAGA.” Fine and several members of the audience then held up signs that read “Tucker is not MAGA.”

On Monday, prominent right-wing podcaster Ben Shapiro dedicated his entire show to the “fragmentation of the political right,” claiming it is “being caused purposefully by a splinter faction of people led by a young man named Nick Fuentes.” Shapiro also railed against Carlson: “There's no question that Tucker has become the most virulent super spreader of vile ideas in America.”

In a follow-up post on X, Shapiro wrote: “No to the groypers. No to cowards like Tucker Carlson, who normalize their trash.” Fuentes' followers are known as groypers. Quoting Shapiro's post, Fuentes replied by writing: “No to Ben Shapiro … No to Benjamin Netanyahu … No to genocide and ethnic cleansing. No to the Christ-hating Talmud. No to Greater Israel. No to our Jewish oligarchy.”

Carlson and Fuentes did not respond to requests for comment.

Carlson's interview with Fuentes came just weeks after Politico revealed the racist and antisemitic views being shared in Young Republicans' chat groups. Days later, leaked chats from Paul Ingrassia, President Donald Trump's pick to lead the office of special counsel, included Ingrassia's own description of himself as including “a Nazi streak.”

For years, Fuentes' openly antisemitic views were deemed too extreme to be taken seriously by the GOP. But as the Republican Party under Trump has embraced far-right figures and viewpoints, Fuentes' star has risen dramatically.

In recent months, Fuentes' follower numbers on platforms like X and the alternative video sharing platform Rumble have skyrocketed, especially among young white men, according to Fuentes himself and extremism researchers who have tracked his ascent in recent years. He has also appeared on a number of increasingly mainstream shows beyond Carlson's, like conservative podcaster Patrick Bet-David's PBD Podcast. Bet-David interviewed Trump last year.

But his appearance on the Tucker Carlson Show was seen by Fuentes and his supporters as a significant step in his plan to promote his racist, antisemitic, and misogynist worldview. The episode has been viewed over 5 million times on YouTube alone, a platform Fuentes was permanently banned from in 2020.

So as the GOP continues to tear itself apart over the interview, Fuentes sees it as a sign that he is finally being accepted.

“I am no longer the radical on the outside; I'm actually the leader on the inside,” Fuentes said on his own nightly show the day after the Carlson interview was released.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","It's Been a Year Since Trump Was Elected. Democrats Still Don't Get the Internet","https://www.wired.com/story/do-democrats-get-the-internet-yet/","Tue, 04 Nov 2025 15:38:00 GMT","

After losing big in 2024, Democrats promised a digital reckoning.

But 12 months out from that devastating slate of losses, Democratic digital programs are still plagued by the same issues that doomed them last year. Despite millions of dollars in influencer investments and “lessons learned” memos, party insiders say Democrats are still stuck running social media programs that strive for authenticity, but often clash with the party's unrelenting desire to maintain control.

“I can't, for the life of me, figure out why we are still so rigid and moderating everything when we have nothing to lose for the first time,” says one Democratic digital strategist, who requested anonymity to speak candidly. “All of the threats of fascism and right-wing takeover. It's all here.”

This aversion to risk has made it difficult for Democrats to innovate. In June, the Democratic National Committee launched a new YouTube show called The Daily Blueprint. In a statement, DNC chair Ken Martin said that the show—which runs news headlines and interviews with party officials in an attempt to be MSNBC-lite—“cements our commitment to meet this moment and innovate the ways we get our message across a new media landscape.”

The show, hosted by DNC deputy communications director Hannah Muldavin, has brought in only around 16,000 views total across more than 100 episodes since its launch.

“We're focused on reaching as many people as possible, and we've made huge progress this year in expanding our reach,” a spokesperson from the DNC tells WIRED. “Since January, the DNC has seen enormous follower growth on high-traffic platforms like TikTok and Instagram, accruing over 3.8 billion impressions across our accounts. We are building relationships with hundreds of creators so that the Democratic Party is a constant presence on voters' feeds, cutting across interests and backgrounds. We're investing now in building an innovative digital program that will continue to grow cycle after cycle.”

But to some Democratic strategists, The Daily Blueprint is emblematic of how the party continues to promote its least effective digital communicators. Since the government shut down earlier this month, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer has hosted a string of highly-produced videos that have barely registered outside of the Washington, DC, ecosystem. “If you are not willing to take swings or throw shit against the wall in this moment, then when are you going to do that?” says Ravi Mangla, the national press secretary for the Working Families Party, a small progressive party already critical of the Democratic National Committee. (Schumer's Senate office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)

Younger Democratic operatives say the issue stems from a broader culture of gatekeeping not just who is allowed to speak on behalf of the party, but what the content coming out of official channels looks like. The people approving content are “not young people and they're not posters,” says Organizermemes, a creator and digital strategist. “They can't explain why things [online] went well. Their ‘theory of mind' is often fundamentally wrong because they don't engage with the actual doing of it.”

This disconnect breeds frustration among the younger staffers who tend to be the people creating the content. And many of their ideas never make it to party platforms. “I'm not unfamiliar with getting 90 percent of my content that I propose shot down,” Organizermemes says. “A 90 percent rejection rate makes no sense. At that point, fire me.”

A few strategists who spoke with WIRED insist that the tides are turning in a more positive direction as the party prepares for next year's midterm elections. “I think things are changing,” says Organizermemes. “The digital narrative has made this into an on-year election for a lot of people.”

Some Democrats have been innovating: Of the possible 2028 presidential contenders, Gavin Newsom and Pete Buttigieg have shown a willingness to appear on more nontraditional platforms. Earlier this year, Buttigieg appeared on the Flagrant podcast, hosted by comedian Andrew Schulz, which president Donald Trump appeared on last year. In October, Newsom joined Twitch streamer Connoreatspants to play Fortnite while discussing the Trump administration and Democratic messaging failures. A new generation of Democrats, including New York City council member Chi Ossé and Michigan Senate candidate Mallory McMorrow, have also worked to set new precedents in what's expected from political digital programs.

In New York, Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani has set new standards for what digital programs should look like going forward, creating content that mixes humor and policy in effective ways that routinely go viral outside of the New York media world.

But Mamdani's digital and electoral success so far has highlighted not just what's possible for Democrats online, but just how much the party fears the success it doesn't control. “There's a desire to diminish his effect,” says Mangla. “Because if we actually talk about how easily it would be to replicate both what he's doing digitally and the issues he is promoting, then that's a threat to the establishment. It's a threat to the status quo.”

Without significantly overhauling the strategy that contributed to Trump's return to office, Democrats fear 2026 could be a repeat of 2024.“If you are so scared of entrusting your candidate to be themselves, you need to get the hell out of Democratic politics,” says Caleb Brock, a Democratic digital strategist who is currently the director of digital strategy for California representative Ro Khanna. “And if your candidate is going to be cringe or not stick to their talking points, the American voters and the Democratic Party's base needs to see that.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The Inside Story of How Gen Z Toppled Nepal's Leader and Chose a New One on Discord","https://www.wired.com/story/nepal-discord-gen-z-protests-vote-prime-minister-election/","Tue, 04 Nov 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

At 11:30 pm on Tuesday, September 9, Rakshya Bam stepped down from an army jeep outside military headquarters in a pitch-dark, locked-down Kathmandu. The 26-year-old hadn't slept in more than a day. Her eyes were red-rimmed and glassy, the whites threaded with thin lines of fatigue.

A wave of youth-led protests had rocked Nepal, born on Discord servers, TikTok feeds, and encrypted messaging apps. In just a few days, Bam had seen friends gunned down, watched parliament buildings smolder, and witnessed the collapse of the Nepalese government. Prime minister K. P. Sharma Oli had resigned, and the army had stepped in to try to restore order. Now, Bam was one of 10 young activists who had been summoned to an unprecedented meeting.

As she walked through the gates of Nepali Army headquarters, flanked by soldiers in full combat gear, Bam could feel her phone buzzing in her pocket. Online, misinformation was spreading fast. Bam's phone barely stopped buzzing. “The king is here.” “The army has staged a coup.” Discord was alive with chatter. Diplomats were calling, urging, “Save democracy!”

In September, thousands of young protesters took to the streets of Kathmandu, Nepal, to protest government corruption and a crackdown on social media.

Inside a sterile meeting room—no phones allowed—the 10 Gen Z activists were greeted by Army General Ashok Raj Sigdel, a stern-looking man in a crisp dark green uniform, medals gleaming on his chest. For three hours, Sigdel questioned the protesters on their motives and their backgrounds. Finally, he presented them with an ultimatum. It had been their youth-led movement that had sparked the protests, he said, so they were the ones responsible for shaping the interim government. Just days earlier, these activists had been ordinary young people, lost in the grind of their daily lives. Now they were being asked to help choose Nepal's next prime minister.

Activist Rakshya Bam became a central figure in Nepal's Gen Z protests after clips of her giving speeches to the crowd went viral.

Rakshya Bam grew up in Kailali, a lowland district in Nepal's far west, where the subtropical plains stretch toward the Indian border. The region is known for its dense sal forests and fertile fields, but after years of neglect it's one of the country's poorest areas.

Nepal is one of the youngest countries in South Asia, with a median age of 25.3 years (the US median age is 39.1). High fertility rates in previous decades have created a “youth bulge”—the largest in the region's history. But many young people like Bam see no future in their homeland. The country has effectively outsourced its labor market to Malaysia, South Korea, and the Gulf states, exporting its youth instead of creating opportunities at home. Minimum wages are not enough to sustain a life within Nepal's borders, leaving young Nepalis with a stark choice: Leave to study abroad, or leave to work abroad.

Those who stay are forced to contend with a political system that doesn't work for them. Even with steep taxes, essential services are in disarray. In the 1950s, the first democratic movement brought free elections, before the monarchy reasserted control. In the 1990s, citizens rose again and reclaimed democracy, but poor governance, civil war, and the 2005 royal coup, when King Gyanendra dismissed parliament, arrested political leaders, and imposed a media blackout, snuffed out that hope. Even after the fall of the monarchy and the end of the war, the structural problems that had driven Nepal's unrest persisted. The Maoists, who had launched a decade-long “People's War” in 1996 demanding the creation of a republic that would address deep inequalities, especially in rural Nepal, were subsumed into mainstream politics. Their movement, once rooted in the frustrations of marginalized groups like Dalits, Indigenous communities, and poor farmers shut out of Kathmandu's elite, helped establish Nepal as a federal democratic republic. But over time, the Maoists became part of the same establishment they had once fought to dismantle. Power continued to circulate among a familiar set of parties and leaders.

For Bam and her peers, the online world offered a place to express outrage, build solidarity, and speak freely. She started posting about corruption and inequality on social media, sharing photos of herself at small rallies, holding a megaphone or a hand-drawn pamphlet. Then, in early September 2025, a new trend started to sweep across Nepali social media.

The Youths Against Corruption server on Discord quickly swelled to 150,000 members, becoming a key place for young people to organize and share safety information as protesters clashed with police on September 8.

Nimesh Shrestha's TikTok feed was supposed to make him laugh. He grew up in Kathmandu and had developed a niche as a video editor and content creator, known for slapstick comedy and quirky skits. Usually, the algorithm fed him similar content. But in early September, he started to notice different kinds of videos filling his phone.

They showed luxury cars glinting in the sun and the children of Nepali government ministers stepping out of them wearing designer clothes and expensive watches. There were reels showcasing opulent weddings, intercut with images of Nepal's impoverished communities. The “Nepo Kid” trend had started in the Philippines and Indonesia, but now it was erupting in Nepal too. As it spread, the tone of the videos seemed to shift. They became more raw, chaotic, and emotionally charged, turning corruption and inequality into something tangible, instantly recognizable, and shareable.

As the videos began to rack up millions of views and spill into mainstream news coverage, the government responded with panic. On September 4, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology ordered internet service providers to block access to 26 social-media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, X, and YouTube, ostensibly because the companies had failed to register with the government as required by a Supreme Court directive. Users opened their apps to find frozen feeds, posts failing to load, and connection errors flashing across their screens.

Coming just as the Nepo Kid videos were flooding social feeds, the government's explanation felt hollow. To Nepal's young citizens, the ban wasn't about compliance or procedure—it was about fear. The system, they believed, was terrified of transparency.

VPN downloads surged. Within hours, Nepalis were trading links and workarounds in private chats and Discord servers, tunneling back online through encrypted connections. The government crackdown only amplified the sense of defiance.

On September 6, outrage turned to fury. An 11-year-old girl, Usha Magar Sunuwar, was struck by a black SUV carrying a provincial minister from the ruling party. The vehicle sped away without stopping, but the incident was captured on CCTV. The clip went viral within hours.

Later that day, Shrestha and Bam were added to a Discord server called Youths Against Corruption, which had just been set up by Hami Nepal, a nonprofit founded by activist Sudan Gurung in 2015, after he lost his son in a deadly earthquake that flattened neighborhoods across central Nepal and killed nearly 9,000 people. Hami Nepal had only about 20 active volunteers but had built up a large online following through its disaster-relief work after the earthquake and during the Covid pandemic. When the government blocked social media platforms, the same networks that once coordinated oxygen deliveries and flood relief pivoted to activism.

Discord was one of the banned platforms but needed less bandwidth than mainstream social media, which made it easier to access through VPNs. Youths Against Corruption quickly became the largest of several servers that emerged in the chaos that followed the internet shutdown, with more than 150,000 members.

The Youths Against Corruption server was set up by Hami Nepal, a youth-led organization founded in the wake of the deadly 2015 earthquake.

Late on September 6, according to Shrestha, after hours of frantic coordination on Discord, the group began preparing for their move to the streets. On Shrestha's TikTok and Instagram, he'd post stories every few minutes with safety tips, including what to do if tear gas was deployed, emergency contact numbers, and which routes to avoid. His follower count tripled. Thousands messaged him, asking how to take part. Protest guides were readily shared online, telling viewers how to remain safe and peaceful. The Discord servers enabled participants to coordinate flash protests, promote hashtags such as #OliResign, #GenZProtest, and #WakeUpNepal, and warn each other about police movements.

Rakshya Bam helped coordinate the protests on September 8, but was horrified when they turned violent.

On September 8, Bam was standing in the back of a pickup truck, microphone in hand, helping to coordinate as dozens of youth groups converged for a protest in central Kathmandu. She called out to the growing crowd, reading from a list: “We won't break trees or vandalize property. We won't shout, set fires, or create chaos. No violence, no conflict. We won't threaten or use foul language. We will stay peaceful. We will be civil and responsible. We haven't come carrying any political party's agenda.” The crowd cheered, and she waved the Nepali flag, hoping her voice would be enough to keep things calm. But the crowd was swelling faster than anyone had anticipated. Groups she didn't recognize began pushing toward restricted government zones, ignoring the curfew, ignoring her pleas. Barricades near the parliament began to topple. Vehicles were set on fire. Stones flew through the air. She saw tear gas canisters arcing through the afternoon sky like birds. The gunfire started moments later.

Panicked police commanders, fearing a breach of the parliament compound, had opened fire on the crowd. Bam saw young people collapse, shot in the head. The protests would ultimately leave at least 72 people dead and over 1,000 injured nationwide, making it the deadliest unrest in Nepal's recent history. The next day, despite the massacre and a strict curfew, thousands of young protesters returned to the streets, still trying to demonstrate peacefully. But alongside them, mobs emerged. Bam watched as groups vandalized government buildings, set private properties ablaze, and attacked homes. Smoke rose over Kathmandu. As protests spiraled and government buildings smoldered, Prime Minister K. P. Sharma Oli resigned. Within hours, the army was on the streets, enforcing a 6 pm to 6 am curfew and promising to restore stability.

The protests would ultimately leave at least 72 people dead and over 1,000 injured across Nepal.

Social media let the world watch the government crackdown in real time. Nepal's internet was filled with cell phone footage of police opening fire on young people, bodies collapsing in clouds of tear gas. A British travel YouTuber went viral after getting caught in the maelstrom. Shrestha describes the experience of following the protests online as “organized chaos.” “It was wild. Hundreds of people talking at once, memes flying around, live updates from the streets. You felt the chaos of the city through the screen,” he says.

One voice cut through the noise. Known as “Jalebi” on Discord, he requested anonymity, but his username and voice were among the most recognizable on the Youths Against Corruption server. With experience running Discord channels and a background in tech, he had volunteered to moderate the server when it was first created.

Now, as violence erupted on the streets, Jalebi found himself cast in the role of emergency responder. He clicked on a username, opened a direct message. “What's your phone number?” A voice confirmed the address and described the injuries. Jalebi posted the information in the rescue channel, and nearby users responded. He got them on a call, coordinating the pickup. That night, he and a team of volunteers drove out to evacuate a family from a burning house. The request had come through Discord, and Jalebi had verified it by phone before they went.

What had started as a platform to facilitate protests and communication quickly evolved. Moderators now verified calls for help, coordinated rescues, and organized blood donations for people trapped by the curfew. As the server swelled beyond 100,000 members, Jalebi scrambled to recruit 15 to 20 more volunteer moderators to keep up with the demand.

The server had been open; anyone could invite anyone. International YouTube channels discovered the feed and began livestreaming it. Foreigners flooded in. Some were curious observers; others spread propaganda, incited violence, or sent fake emergency calls designed to waste moderators' time or expose their networks. One cybersecurity firm estimates that a third of the social media accounts driving the protests were fake.

Jalebi soon locked down invitations. He and his team created separate groups: verified rescue requests in one, general discussion in another, and coordination in a third. His role became triage, deciding whose turn it was to speak in voice channels, which messages to pin, and which users to silence or ban. Hate messages accumulated in his inbox.

By the next day, the violence had reversed its direction. Cell phone videos showed smoke rising over the capital, government buildings in flames, and mobs storming police stations. Guns, batons, and uniforms lay scattered on the ground as the city burned.

During the protests on September 9, Nepal's parliament building was set on fire.

A few hours after their meeting with the army general on September 9, Bam, Shrestha, and a small group of protesters huddled in their safe space—a small room somewhere in Kathmandu that had become their usual meeting place during the uprising. It was the middle of the night, and their faces were lit by the glow of phones and laptops. Thousands logged in to Discord that night, as the protesters tried to wrestle with the task ahead of them.

It was a new kind of democracy—brokered not by men in suits but by anonymous users with names like meme_lord, rebel_rana, momo4justice, TheLostGhost, nepali_anon18, and 2pac, and avatars of cats in sunglasses and anime faces. There were streams of text in English and Nepali, punctuated by voice notes: someone shouting updates from Maitighar, a central square in Kathmandu near key government offices. Another played a protest song through their mic. A third laughed nervously. At times, the messages scrolled by too fast to read.

But this chaotic form of direct democracy was far from perfect. One participant, who requested anonymity, experienced this firsthand. In the frenzy of polls and speculation, they became the target of coordinated attacks after unverified claims about them began circulating on Reddit and Discord. The harassment was relentless enough to drive them offline entirely. “One moment you're part of a movement, and another you're receiving death threats through the same channels,” they said. “Someone can post a half-made-up story about your family's connections to corruption, and you're done. No verification, no due process. Just mob justice.”

As night turned to morning, the activists deliberated on who could lead, how to build consensus, and how to fill the power vacuum as soon as possible. They weighed risks and figured out a way to formalize their recommendations. By the time the sun rose over Kathmandu's skyline, they had settled on a handful of candidates. But they needed one name to take to the army general.

“Please decide on a representative right now. We do not have time,” moderator Jalebi urged. Then he created the poll, pulling from a range of public figures and influencers. The question: Who should be the interim prime minister? Names: Sushila Karki, the former chief justice; Balendra Shah, a rapper, engineer and Kathmandu's first independent mayor; a YouTuber and lawyer known as “Random Nepali.” Others. Votes accumulated over hours of chaotic discussion.

“It was about showing a consensus,” Jalebi explains. “The poll was our evidence, the only way to measure what Gen Z was thinking. We ran it on Discord but also reached out to civil society members and other stakeholders to make sure it reflected more than just online chatter.”

After hours of voting across different polls, former chief justice Sushila Karki, who had a long history of activism on women's rights, anti-corruption, social justice, and other matters of interest to younger generations, and who had become one of the movement's most recognizable figures after footage of her joining protesters went viral, finally emerged as the lead candidate.

Three days later, Rakshya Bam was standing beneath the marble arches of the presidential residence as Parliament was dissolved and Karki prepared to take the oath as Nepal's first female prime minister. As interim PM, Karki would lead a transitional government tasked with tackling corruption, ensuring transparency, and steering the country toward fresh elections. Watching her, Bam was struck by the sense that she and her peers had cracked history open.

The scene outside a torched parliament on September 14, as interim prime minister Sushila Karki started work.

Some of these events may seem familiar. Analysts have drawn parallels between Nepal's Gen Z uprising and the 2011 Arab Spring, where social media became a force for mass mobilization, calling this moment a kind of “South Asian Spring.” In recent months, similar youth-led protests have erupted in Madagascar and Morocco.

But choosing a leader through a digital platform like Discord is messy, transparent, and unprecedented, says Sudhamshu Dahal, a researcher on the social impact of communication technologies. The current movement is spontaneous, leaderless, and emotionally charged—united more by a rejection of corruption and repression than by a shared vision of what comes next.

That means the same digital infrastructure that allowed young activists to mobilize could just as easily be weaponized against them. As the Youths Against Corruption server swelled to more than 150,000 users in the days after the protests, paranoia seeped in. Organizers warned about infiltrators, government agents, provocateurs, or trolls lurking behind anonymous accounts. Facebook users discovered that a page now calling itself Gen-Z Youth Nepal, one of the amplifiers of protest content, had previously been affiliated with a major political party before quietly rebranding just days before the uprising. Screenshots of the group's history ricocheted across chats and servers, a digital flare warning of political infiltration.

Dahal says what Nepal witnessed was “the death of the old political class and the birth of a new one.” Whether this emerging generation can withstand entrenched forces remains uncertain. “The challenge now is turning digital momentum into lasting governance without sacrificing the moral clarity that gave the movement its power,” he says. He also warns that moving forward, digital surveillance will touch everyone, citizens and politicians alike, making every online action both a tool and a potential risk.

These movements have been hailed as a demonstration of social media's ability to orchestrate decentralized, digitally coordinated activism, yet their reach remains uneven. Less than half of Nepalis had internet access in early 2023, and only 17 percent in rural areas. In many remote regions, the infrastructure and digital skills needed to participate are lacking. This gap suggests that the uprising, while gaining momentum online, may struggle to include those most marginalized, raising questions about how representative and sustainable the movement can ultimately be.

For now, the Discord servers remain active—political news, blood donation calls, and suggestions for former politicians who should be arrested still pop up regularly. Nepal is in a state of messy, unpredictable flux. The interim government has formed a cabinet to keep the country running, while protesters scramble to forge a coalition. On November 1, Bam was named coordinator of the Nepal Gen-Z Front, a new organization that will bring together the youth groups associated with the protests and try to unify their demands before the elections scheduled for March 2026. The media headlines have focused on the spectacle of September 9, while September 8, when police fired on young protesters, has received little attention.

Rakshya Bam is now coordinating the Nepal Gen-Z Front, a new organization aiming to unify the demands of dozens of youth groups before elections next year.

“Maybe we didn't change everything,” says Rakshya Bam. “But we changed how people imagine what's possible.” Then she returns to that same question every Gen Z activist I spoke to is asking, one that can't be answered with a Discord poll. What comes next?

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","What's the Deal With Okapa's $300 Water Bottle?","https://www.wired.com/story/whats-the-deal-with-okapas-dollar300-water-bottle/","Tue, 04 Nov 2025 10:30:00 GMT","

“What does it do?” my friend asked as we sat there staring at the chrome-pink, futuristic looking cylinder set on the table. “It's just a water bottle,” I said.

“It doesn't filter your water? Keep track of how much you drink?” she asked. I shrugged. “Nope, I guess it does look cool though.” My friend was asking because Okapa, a brand with just one product, sells its flagship water bottle for $295.

For context, most high-end water bottles top out around $50, or maybe $100-150 if they have fancy features like self-cleaning UV lights, built-in filters, or app connectivity to monitor your drinking habits. When a brand charges that much more than market value, it's usually for one of two reasons: either it's a luxury product meant as a status symbol, or it's solving a consumer problem no one else has cracked.

Okapa is claiming to do both. Its Instagram bio says “luxury hydration”, and it's tapping the fashion world to find its clientele by partnering with a small designer for a New York Fashion Week runway show. But, also, Okapa claims its bottle redefines hygiene and durability, using materials typically found in medical and aerospace applications.

Indeed, Okapa says it's taken eight years of R&D and more than 10,000 prototypes to achieve the “micron-level precision” of its bottle, and in the process secured more than 70 patents globally. Incidentally, in case you're wondering what Okapa means, or where it comes from, according to the company it is, apparently, a mindset. “We're calling it ‘The State of Okapa' where the unthinkable is being realized” says the website bumf. The site then adds the bottle itself is “a technical feat of engineering beyond reason.”

No stranger to the luxury market, or indeed hyperbolic product promises, Okapa's founder Hardy Steinmann cut his teeth in the 80s and 90s running the marketing and sales for high-end watch brand Hublot in the USA, then relaunching Swatch Group's Hamilton watch brand globally.

Anyway, do those medical and aerospace materials actually make a difference in a water bottle? Can a water bottle really redefine hygiene? I tested it for nearly two months and spoke to a medical toxicology expert to find out.

Before I even got my hands on the water bottle, I saw the website. It has a retro video game aesthetic with the pixelated text and sliding transitions. Even the user manual is illustrated in that same playful style. And I'm a sucker for a company that puts that much intention into branding design and overall vibe.

When I unboxed the water bottle, I was even more sold. This thing is beautiful. The lines are clean, the dot pattern is eye-catching, and the finish has a soft matte sheen that looks and feels expensive. I got the pink-and-yellow colorway (“Peaches Copperwire”), but there are eight total, from all-black to bright red. Each has a name that sounds more like a budget sci-fi movie character than a color, like “Redd Rumble” or “Mitsi Pinku.”

With such a distinctive design, would my fancy water bottle elicit jealousy of my peers or strangers? Could they even tell it cost so much? I toted this throughout airports, to spas, to work events in New York City, and on trains in Europe. I kept it in hand, swinging from my fingers, fishing for compliments. I got none.

Water bottles are a pretty basic product, so the engineering and details of the Okapa bottle surprised me. First, it is really satisfying to drink from. The lid opens with the push of a button and lets out a clean little “pop” as the spring-loaded top snaps back. It's smooth to open with one hand, and as you tilt the bottle to get every last drop, the cap stays neatly out of the way instead of flopping forward to bonk you on the forehead.

The mouthpiece shape fits perfectly when you purse your lips, and the Swiss-made Grilamid plastic feels softer and more premium than most. It also has a locking mechanism that works exceptionally well. Even when I forget to engage the locked mode, the cap has never popped open in my bag. (I once ruined a laptop when an Owala opened mid-commute, so I appreciate a trustworthy latch.)

The Okapa water bottle can be completely disassembled for cleaning.

This completely recyclable bottle can handle both hot and cold liquids, as can other borosilicate glass water bottles. You can remove the inner glass carafe, fill it with tea or warm water—even microwave it—then slip it back into its aluminum shell.

The handle, though, could be better. It's only big enough for a couple of fingers, so it's not the most comfortable to carry for long stretches.

Now, to the materials. “Medical-grade”—in relation to water bottles—means very little. While the term may sound impressive and brings to mind high safety standards, “it is often just a vague marketing term that hides the real complexities and plays on people's worries about chemicals,” says Dr. Gerome Burke Jr., board-certified medical toxicologist and program director for research and reporting at the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “It leverages the prestige of the medical field to create a perception of heightened safety and performance that is not substantiated by regulatory science.”

The FDA doesn't have an official “medical-grade” designation for bottles or cups, so in practice, it doesn't mean much more than “food-grade.” Any plastic approved for food contact already meets safety standards, Dr. Burke tells me. Instead, what's important is a company's transparency about material composition and its commitment to avoiding known hazardous chemicals, like PFAS, he adds.

Still, Okapa argues that its use of “medical-grade” materials isn't just for show. The company told me that every surface in contact with water—borosilicate glass, silicone, nylon, and stainless steel—is “chemically inert,” meaning it won't leach plasticizers, metals, or PFAS. If you're concerned about microplastics, this could be a selling point.

The durable design only picked up this tiny scratch during our two-month tryout.

The materials can withstand high temperatures (up to 110°C, or 230°F) without deforming, which makes it more durable but also easier to sterilize and less prone to bacterial buildup than soda lime glass or cheap plastic, the brand says. However, there are many other borosilicate glass water bottles that are much cheaper, such as Purifyou's model, and that costs just $25. Moreover, stainless steel, one of the most common water bottle materials, is also heatproof.

But, ultimately, the materials themselves probably won't make your water safer. The real hygiene issue comes down to user behavior. Most bacteria enter water bottles through stagnant water and infrequent cleaning. To its credit, Okapa makes that process easier: the entire bottle disassembles so you can scrub every part individually, and all of the pieces except the metal shell are dishwasher-safe. Even the cap breaks down into two pieces, and all the silicone rings pop out.

While, just like Dr. Burke, I'm more than a little skeptical of the “medical-grade” claims, I'm totally sold on the durability claim. After nearly two months of daily testing, the only scratch I could find was a splinter-sized nick on the base. (All of my other water bottles are completely banged up after the first week.)

I was pretty heavy handed with it, too. Once, I hit it too hard on a counter and was sure the inner glass had shattered. Another time, it fell off my bathroom counter onto tiles. Both times, it came out unscathed. The anodized aluminum outer shell absorbed the shock to protect the glass carafe better than I expected.

The smaller components, like the push-button hinge and locking mechanism, are made from Nitronic 60 stainless steel, the same kind used in surgical instruments. I can't speak to its longevity yet, but the craftsmanship feels intricate and sturdy. The brand backs its product with a one-year warranty.

I really didn't want to love this water bottle, but I do. Every design detail, apart from that handle, is excellent. I've tested a ton of water bottles, and nearly every other model has some little annoyance—like a stubborn twist cap, leaky seal, or a hard-to-clean straw. Each flaw adds up over time until I eventually stop carrying them. And people lug their reusable water bottles everywhere with them, so I understand the appeal of a product that eliminates those daily frustrations.

But would I pay $300 for it? No. Of course not. The simple fact is you can get something nearly as good for a fraction of the price. Still, that said, as it damn well should be after 10,000 prototypes, I can't deny it's the nicest, most thoughtfully designed water bottle I've ever tested—whether it protects my body from forever chemicals or not.

Kara Swisher is the epitome of a multi-hyphenate: a podcast host, journalist, author, and CEO agitator.

Swisher has also, in her way, turned IDGAF into her personal brand. Deeply sourced and happy to ask the hard questions, she doesn't care about being liked. As she said during a recent live event, “I have four kids!”

As the host of On With Kara Swisher, her twice weekly podcast for Vox Media, she grills leaders in tech and politics, coaxing them to share the things they may not reveal on any other gabfest. For Pivot, her Vox show with New York University marketing professor Scott Galloway, she keeps the banter between herself and her cohost—but still, she doesn't hold back. Swisher's opinions are her own, and she doesn't hesitate to share them.

Swisher brought all of her opinions, and more, to this week's episode of The Big Interview, going deep on AI, Silicon Valley's relationship with President Donald Trump, and which tech CEO is her least favorite.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

KATIE DRUMMOND: Kara Swisher, welcome to The Big Interview. Thank you for being here.

KARA SWISHER: Thank you. I'm sorry I can't be in-person at your beautiful studio.

Next time.

Who's that behind you?

Actually nobody listening to this can see it, but it's a giant version of the WIRED cover with Edward Snowden.

Oh yeah. Look at him.

One of our reporters, Andy Greenberg, had this in his house for years, and then finally was like, “My wife needs me to get this out of the house. Can I bring it to the office?” And I said, “sure.” So now it sits behind me when I record this podcast.

I did a good interview with him many years ago.

He's still out there.

Yeah. He is.

We like to start with some quick-fire questions. I'm sure you're used to this kind of thing. You ready to go?

Ready.

OK. Most active text thread you're on.

God. With my kids.

Podcasts or Substacks?

What do you mean? Do I listen?

Pick one.

Oh, podcasts.

I figured.

Obviously.

The tech exec you would least want to get stuck in an elevator with.

Oh my God. All of them. Um, Mark Zuckerberg.

More disruptive: AI or social media?

Social media.

Still or sparkling?

Still.

What's the biggest lie Silicon Valley keeps telling itself?

That it cares about people.

Who would play you in a biopic?

Well, that's a good question. I was just having a meeting about that.

Oh, tell us more.

I will. But do you want more, or quick [answers]?

Now I want more.

OK. My Burn Book sold to a production studio, Tomorrow Studios—maybe it'll get made, maybe it won't. But I'm actually meeting writers, and I think they feel like they can sell it. So we'll see.

Who do they feel like would play you?

I don't know. I think they had talked about Kristen Stewart, I think.

That's good.

It should be a believable lesbian, right, who's kind of a sassy person. I love Aubrey Plaza. I think she's great. But she's too tall. They're all too tall is the problem. There's no one sort of tiny.

There are no tiny actors?

Yes, there are, but it's gotta be—I'm just trying to think who it would work well with. I mean, probably the woman who plays Wednesday, what's her name?

Jenna Ortega.

Jenna Ortega might work. It's gotta be someone who—well, they don't have to be … height doesn't matter. I guess they can act their way out of that.

Yeah.

I think an unknown. An unknown.

I like it. What's the interview that changed you the most?

Oh, the Gates-Jobs interview. The one that Walt Mossberg and I did together with Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. That was a really important interview. I think it's gonna last the test of time. I think people will watch it centuries from now. It was really a highlight of my career.

Usually in these conversations I would sort get into someone's background and ask them about their childhood.

No.

I'm not gonna do that. I feel like we have too much to talk about. But I did want to use this as an opportunity to ask you about being a woman, being a gay woman, no less, in an historically male field. The subjects of your reporting very often are men.

You did a podcast a while ago called Design Matters. You said that you wanted to write a series of three books for women and other people who may need these books, and they would be: No Is a Complete Sentence; Yes, I'll Take That; and Maybe I'll Call You Back.

Yeah, I think it's brilliant.

Tell me more about the experience of being a woman, and gay woman, in the field you're in.

I think gay has not hurt me, actually, in the field, because I think that men are more comfortable with me for some reason. Because I guess we like ladies, I don't know. I don't know what it is. They're largely straight men, and it's largely straight white men, actually.

So I think they're relatively comfortable with the gay part. I've never really gotten any kind of pushback on that issue. Actually, I do think it's a net positive in general.

Yeah?

I think I've told this story, but I was at an event, and a bunch of VCs were looking at the ladies and they're like, “Oh, she's cute. What do you think, Kara?” And I go, “Still a feminist. I don't talk about women objectively like that.”

As a woman, I don't think that's hindered me necessarily, either. Even if they do it in hiring, and they create these manospheres in technology, which they've done for a long time, it hasn't kept me out. They haven't favored men—or men who are slavishly attentive to them—until recently. Then they're willing to do interviews. But that has to do with slavishness not with anything else.

I think there's a lot to your style and your approach that has meant that you are often described as unlikable. I think that that is a function of being a woman. I don't hear a lot of strong-willed men being described as unlikable.

Yes, exactly. I don't care.

Did that ever waver? I mean, how did you learn not to care? Or do you just genetically not care?

Genetically not care. I just was like that when I was a kid. You know, again, it may have gone along with being a lesbian. I don't know. Just like, I don't need the favor of men.

It was interesting, because I don't think it is unlikable. It's that I'm being honest with them. Whenever I do interviews, I don't do the wind-up. I don't say I am gonna do one thing and then do another. I think that's relatively fair. I actually have gotten more than my fair share of great interviews, right? They haven't not interviewed with me. Why are you so mean? Like I get that from some of them—not all of them, for sure—but some of them who are really sensitive.

One more question on this topic. I've wanted to ask you this. I'm obviously a woman. I work in journalism. I work in tech. I get a lot of advice as a woman in this job in particular, about the way I dress, about the fact that I don't wear makeup. Every time there's a social clip of me that runs on the WIRED account, at least one person will say, “Makeup, please.” I don't wear makeup. I'm not interested in wearing makeup. What advice do you have?

Just ignore it.

But for women in general who are ambitious, who work in male-centric spaces. Ignore it, sure. But what else?

I tend to meet that kind of stuff with jokes that are insulting, that do the same thing. Sometimes when men start down that negging road, I often go, “Did you lose weight? Oh, no, I guess not.” That's one of my favorites.

I was on a TV show, and one of my sons was with me, who was, I guess, maybe 12 or 13 at the time. I've taught them well. I went in and the guy who was sitting in the green room with my son was like, “Doesn't your mother smile?” And my son looked at him and said, “Did you just say that?” And that's all he said.

That's incredible. I get “smile” a lot and have started just saying “No, that's just my face.”

I really don't hear it anymore. I just don't. It's so stupid. They're so fucking juvenile. I have enough toddlers in my life that I don't need more.

Well, speaking of toddlers, we have to talk about leadership in the tech industry.

They are toddlers.

They are toddlers. You've covered them, you've interviewed them for decades. When you look back now, who among this set has continued to take their responsibility to all of us, to society, most seriously, and who has failed the most profoundly?

The surprise to me has been Mark Cuban, actually. I broke the story when he sold his company to Yahoo. I was at The Wall Street Journal at the time. And he was somewhat of an arrogant little prick …

I actually just interviewed him, and I reminded him that you said he was an arrogant prick.

He was so arrogant. But I still liked him. He's a pleasant fellow. But he's really developed into this really interesting, complex person. I never necessarily know what he's gonna say, but I always know he is gonna have thought about it. I suspect through having kids and other things, he's really developed and matured. Another person like that is Evan Spiegel from Snapchat.

He was mad at the press and decided I was the press. There was a whole bad set of emails…

OK. I believe it.

He was in college, like, I'm gonna give him an out.

I remember this.

We were having lunch, and he yelled at me. I was like, “I didn't write word one about this. Honestly, I don't know why you're yelling at me.” He was mad at the press, in general. He has really developed into a really thoughtful person.

[Airbnb CEO] Brian Chesky is another person I like a lot who I really think is honest about his feelings. We don't, like, cuddle and comb each other's hair. But I really think he tries to be a better person, I guess a better man.

Most of them do not try to be a better man, but in general, Zuckerberg is at the top of the list. Elon Musk obviously, but I think he's plagued by other issues.

Sure.

That's not an excuse, that's just an explanation. I think there's a lot going on there that is really, um, I don't want to say tragic, because he kind of brings it on himself. But it's sad. It's really sad.

It's sad.

You know, Tim Cook these days is a little bit—especially since he's retiring—I'm like, Really? This is how you want to go out?

Well, this is what I'm wondering about. I ask anyone I can about this, because I'm genuinely curious for different interpretations. This cozy dynamic between tech leaders and politicians. Here we all are at dinner together. It's on C-SPAN. Here I am in my tuxedo in the UK, in the palace with the president. I mean, here I am with a tchotchke in the Oval Office. That's a Tim Cook example.

The gold statue. Yeah.

I want your assessment of why these executives—they're not only working with the administration behind the scenes, you have to imagine they're doing that—but there is this overt demonstration of fealty that we are seeing.

It's interesting you bring up Mark Cuban. I asked him this question, and he said, “If they need to get knee pads that are embroidered with a D on one knee and a T on the other knee, and show up at the White House every day, they don't have much of a choice.” He seemed to think that was just the way business works. That it's a business imperative.

In any administration, there's versions of that, right? So you have to curry favor. It's usually just dinner and a donation. That kind of thing. Now this guy requires a different kind of fealty, which is a very explicit, performative fealty.

So if this is the cost of doing business, this is the cost of doing business. I feel they don't have to. I don't think it's the cost of doing business. But they seem to think it is. And there certainly are a lot of juicy bits to slice up.

You're rich, so you don't have to do this. But I think they feel a duty to their shareholders. That's their number one. They don't have a duty to society. They don't feel like they have a duty to anything else.

On the other side, there's people who like it. People who like to exercise power. Zuckerberg would be one of those. He really does think this, because he's a particularly victimized person. He always feels like he's a victim. So I think he kind of wants to do it. He's so tired of ladies telling him what to do. He is gonna put on his MMA mitts and go for it.

Any performative maleness should be a sign for you to run for the hills. And some of them have switched, like Sergey Brin has gotten quite Trumpy. I know this from his family, most of whom are horrified. He's got a girlfriend who's real Trumpy. So there he goes down Trump Avenue, and I kind of think it makes sense.

I ran into one of them, and I'm not gonna say which one, and they're like, “Looks like we won, Kara. We beat you, Kara.” They're in DC where I live, which, I'm like, “Why did you come to my home? I moved all the way across the country to get away from you.”

It was at some event. “Looks like we won, Kara.” And I go, “Hmm, you did. But you're still an asshole.”

Very nice.

They just went “pfffsssttt.” Because they're still an asshole. Whatever. Good luck.

It's obviously different for any given executive, right? They're obviously different people. When you think about the short-term gain, long-term pain, how do you see this playing out in three years? Assuming we have a different administration in a way that hurts these companies.

It's shortsighted. I think it's really shortsighted, because at some point someone else will be in charge. I do make the joke over and over: If Kamala Harris won, Mark Zuckerberg would be a they/them. Right? He'd be like, “I love kombucha and Charli XCX, my favorite. Taylor Swift is the best.”

I think a lot of them are in fear. Very much so. Fear of hurting their business. You know, they can see what he's doing. He seems very willing to take it to the mat.

I was with some Apple people who are just horrified by Tim's behavior. I go, “Well, I guess, shareholder value.” And they said, “It isn't good for shareholder value. It's not, because it's not what our company is.” So in the short term, they get a tariff break. But as a rule, it's not about businesses, it's about oligarchy and therefore you don't compete based on the right things. You also don't let little companies rise. If you control everything, you're gonna atrophy.

What has felt interesting to me is that there's obviously the silence at the executive level, which we didn't see in 2016 to this extent, but there's also the silence of the workforce inside these companies.

They're worried.

I mean, you hear it anecdotally, but we're not seeing mass uprisings inside Google, inside Apple. We're not seeing this really spill over.

No. They fire them. They just fired an Amazon person who protested for Palestine. Like when did those free-speech warriors let that happen? That's the whole thing. That was such a performative amount of bullshit that it was like it just suited them to do that.

They don't want people to say what they think, or else I'd be doing regular interviews with Mark Zuckerberg. He wants people to tell him how great he is at MMA.

Well, Mark, you're a big important man. When you look at Silicon Valley, when you look at the industry, when you look at leadership, do you have any hope that we will see a new kind of leader emerge in this industry?

Sure.

Is it a generational shift? What does that require, and are there people out there who are representative of that to you right now?

Well, my own son. My son is a tech person, and he's studying tech at Michigan, and it's not 'cause I trained him or anything. He's also a frat bro, so I didn't stop that.

That's too bad, I'm sorry to hear that.

He likes it. They're nice kids. All his friends and the people around him talk about much deeper things like energy, about fixing things, about climate.

I just taught a course at Michigan, largely so I could irritate my son for seven weeks. I was so moved by the students. They're not dumb and idealistic, although I don't mind that in a college student, by the way.

They really do have a sense of community. Like my son, he's a mechanical engineer. He wants to make things, and a lot of it has to do with community helping people. At the same time, he's a capitalist, right? But he doesn't see it as a power thing. Maybe someday he will, and then I'll slap him back to last Sunday. But I do think that he has the real idealism of like, I wanna make something that matters, that'll help a lot of people.

Right.

I've been doing this documentary for CNN about longevity and health and all those people I find to be really moving. But it's not like dumb optimism. Like a lot of the early internet people, like Zuckerberg was always like, What I really wanna build is something to bring the world together. And he never did. Like, it was all bullshit. The first story I ever wrote for The Wall Street Journal was about the lies Silicon Valley tells itself. It was all like, We're here for the community. There's no CEO here. They had like 10 of them that when I immediately got there from the East Coast, I was like, that's a bullshit. That's a bullshit. These younger people aren't like that. They're not telling themselves lies.

So we have hope.

I do. I was glad to do that teaching thing at Michigan, because the problem is these guys, right? It's not the younger people. I do think we've left them with a bag of shit.

Both my older sons aren't on social media anymore. I don't think they're unusual. Like my one older son got off a bunch of them, and I said—well, I didn't tell him to do it—so I was like, “Why did you do that?” And he goes, “It makes me feel bad.” A very simple sentence. He's not a tech person. He understands, and all his friends are like that too.

Well, he's right. It makes me feel bad too.

Yeah. Well, why do you stay on Twitter, then?

I don't.

OK, good.

I deleted my account. I don't like it. I don't want to be there. I don't need to be there. No one can force me.

Yeah. No one can.

I am curious about you and social media. In particular, I would say that when I see criticism of Kara Swisher, it's usually on social media, and it's something to the effect of, “Kara Swisher was bullish on the industry for too long. She built these guys up. Now here she is tearing them down …”

Hmm.

“… but she won't answer for her role in X, Y, Z.” Do you pay attention to that?

I don't, because, you know, I was a beat reporter. I was writing about their businesses. I think where it comes from is Elon, and I did have great hopes for Elon. I think that's where most of it comes from.

I was never nice to Zuckerberg. I dare you to go find a nice article I wrote.

The iconic sweaty interview.

I mean, I'm sorry. I was very questioning of all their privacy issues. I was questioning all their sneaky bullshit they did around people's counts.

I really did like Steve Jobs. I did, and I thought those interviews were pretty interesting. I don't think they were slavish, and I thought they were actually fascinating. We challenged him constantly.

But, you know, that's fine. I think it's all around Elon. I would cop to that. I really was so tired of all these very selfish people like Zuckerberg. I had great hopes when someone was working on cars and climate and really cool stuff. There were a bunch of smart people working on stupid things. And here was someone who wasn't, really wasn't.

With a huge vision.

So I guess when Steve died, I and others were looking for that, looking for a bigger idea. So yeah, I would cop to that. The idea that I made any of these people is just utter bullshit. They were made because they're billionaires. They were made because they created significant companies. So I don't think I helped him by any means. If you actually go back and listen to the interviews, they're not as kind as you think they are. I think they're pretty fair.

When I do the heel turn and I'm like, wait a minute, this is a real problem. I'm quite liberal, but that's my issue with a lot of liberals: When people change, the purity tests are exhausting. For a lot of friends of mine who are conservative, who do not like Trump. Well, you can't come in our thing 'cause you were with them. Imperfect allies is life, right? That part I'm like, Oh, for fuck's sake. You and your purity test can go fuck yourself.

I have to ask you about AI.

All right. OK.

One of the things we've been covering at WIRED a lot recently are the talent wars, which I am obsessed with just because they are so outrageous and outlandish.

I love reading your stuff.

Well, thank you. I mean, much credit to the reporters who go get these scoops.

Can I please make a point? You are so smart in creating narratives, and this is a great one. This, the DOGE one. You did great. You understood. It's something we did at All Things D, we had narratives, whether it was Yahoo or it was Uber. That was a big narrative for us. But this one is really breathtaking.

It is wild. Who would you rather work for: Sam Altman or Mark Zuckerberg, if they were both offering you a hundred million dollars?

Altman.

How do you differentiate between the two?

I mean, it's a low bar, isn't it? I think in the times I've spent with Sam, there are touches of normalness. Like he understands his problem better. Mark has no idea about his problems. He doesn't look backwards for one second.

I thought when Sam did this whole opt-out thing, I thought that was breathtakingly typical of these people. I was surprised by it. I guess I wasn't surprised, 'cause they always do this. This AI thing, it's really interesting because I think, didn't AMD just announce another Oracle deal today?

I mean the deals are—it's on a daily basis.

[Pivot podcast cohost] Scott Galloway and I had said it reminds us of PurchasePro back with AOL. You don't remember this, but AOL did a bunch of deals like this where you give people money and then they'd buy ads on your service. And then you'd invest in them and get warrants and you'd get, then they would invest …

Like circular deals?

It was called round-tripping at the time. And one of these companies came up to me and said, “Well, you shouldn't call it round-tripping Kara, they're real.” I'm like, Well, nothing's being made here. Like, you're just moving $5 back and forth. And I said, “Would you prefer ‘circle jerk'? I'll use that word if you like, 'cause that's what it feels like.”

And salaries are part of that, right? You know, at some point someone's going to be very wealthy from this, and so maybe the bet isn't a bad one. It's just that if everyone's making this bet, especially around talent and investments, someone's going to lose just like they did in the early internet era.

Except the profound effect of it is massive, because these are the companies that are holding up the entire stock market. So it has bigger implications. With the salary stuff it's like every time I read a story of yours I'm like, That's insane.

It's ridiculous money. My question to you is: From where you sit, what is the there there with AI, what's real in this moment and what is marketing? What is hype? What is fearmongering?

What's really important about AI is it's a general-purpose technology, right? It crosses everything. It's not like you're going from farming to mechanized farming, that's a single device. So you could see it changing so many different fields. It's going to effect information people. But in combination, which I think is left out of a lot of this, is robotics plus AI. I think robotics gets no attention.

You mean physical robotics?

Yes. That's because Elon's running the discussion, because it's all about humanoid-looking robots. But I'm talking about real robots. They're not gonna look, by the way, like a humanoid robot. A lot of gears, like very, very simple robots that are gonna do everything. Then they're powered by AI.

So if everything's getting affected, some companies are gonna control quite a lot of everything, right? Then it will take individual companies in those sectors, like insurance or whatever the sector happens to be, medicine—and then they will be the winner of that game. So if you were one of the winners, you'd think the money was well-spent. And if you aren't, then it's just gone. Right?

Anyone you're willing to bet on at this stage?

No. I mean, I'm always sort of sitting there going, Is OpenAI Netscape or Google? Everyone thought Netscape hung the fucking moon, and then it just didn't. Remember that?

Barely, but I do.

Yes. If I had a bet, I suspect OpenAI. I feel like they're Google. I think they are doing just enough and innovating just enough. I suspect Google itself has a lot of advantages. In some areas, Microsoft, not so much Amazon. Apple will sort of ride on everybody's rails.

Where does Meta end up in all of this?

They have a lot of information. They sure do.

There's no vision though.

No. I think [Zuckerberg] is just throwing money at it. Where he could go is advertising. They're all moving into advertising, aren't they? That's an area he certainly can dominate.

Well, now I'm interested in talking about journalism with you.

Edward [Snowden] is now on your shoulder, just so you know. He's right there. Touch him gently.

Very gently. He's been through a lot. I'm interested in your assessment of tech journalism and the balance between quote-unquote “access” journalism. Right? Which is essentially where a company, let's say, invites you in. You meet with all their executives, you write something that is tacitly agreed will be a friendly piece versus accountability journalism.

I remember 15, 20 years ago, access was really much more the name of the game. Then in the mid-2010s, it really shifted.

Yeah.

I'm curious if you think we still need the access part. Is there value in that kind of reporting?

No, no. As someone who had a lot of access, being at The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, I always felt it was kind of icky, you know what I mean? It wasn't good, and you didn't really get that much out of it. It wasn't really a plus.

It was interesting, because we got a lot of access even though we weren't big, 'cause they thought we could hurt them. I think that was really what it was.

I don't think access gives you much of anything, because people are leaky as can be these days. I think I kind of perfected that at All Things D, with Yahoo. The joke that I was in the heating ducts and stuff like that. Like getting stuff not from them—getting memos, getting insiders to say what was happening. When I started really doing that more heavily, as opposed to when I was at The Wall Street Journal, everything changed. The power dynamic was very different 'cause you didn't need those people.

All you needed to do was be a really good reporter and call and call and call. Like what you guys did with DOGE was sort of classic. I don't think you were hanging around with Elon Musk at all.

Absolutely not.

But you didn't need to, because there were enough sources. As communications have changed, people can text or Signal, and that didn't exist in my earliest days. They had to call you or you had to physically see them.

I don't mind having interesting conversations. Like if you guys did a great Big Interview with Tim Cook, I'd be interested in it.

Well, if he would say anything, which again, is the issue with access—it's very controlled. It's very carefully managed.

I think some of those interviews we did at the Code Conference and All Things D, like Mark's wedding interview was a moment for him. He's not doing this again. Because he really, really messed up. But the more problematic interview was the later one he agreed to do with me about the Holocaust deniers, where I got him to say stuff.

After that, I knew I was never gonna get another interview, because something in me is able to get him to say a thing that's the truth, right? For some reason, in our rapport, he seems nervous or whatever it happens to be. So I think all of them looked around and said, “Why should we talk to fucking Kara Swisher, an unlikable bitch? She's always going to bust our chops and not saying how smart we are.”

So then they just did their own media. They do their conferences. I couldn't do a conference like Code today. No way. They go do their own thing.

Right.

I bet you get them a lot better because you get them the other way, you know?

For sure. I mean, as a journalist, it's much more interesting work to be doing.

And then you don't have to talk to them.

Well, yes.

I mean, not to not check facts, that's different. You have to call the company, you have to get the response. But I've noticed lately, I was reading one of your stories, and they didn't get back to you.

No. They don't. They don't necessarily feel the need to be in touch.

I've noticed that more than anything else, like you call them for a fact and they don't even get back to you now. That's really strange to me. That seems like a really bad development.

Let me ask you this: The New York Times did a story on your podcasting success earlier this year. They had a quote from you that caught my attention. You said, “At the end of this long career, it's like, ‘Oh wow. I made something people really like.'” What caught my attention was the “end of a long career” bit, because it made me think, do you see yourself stopping at any point? Is retirement an appealing option for you? Or maybe you wouldn't characterize it as retirement?

You know what happens, I just keep doing really well.

It's hard to do well.

I think I'm entrepreneurial, right? So far, everything's worked really well, and every time I make more money, it's sort of weird. Like the podcasting thing worked out rather well for me. It's actually a product I really am proud of. Over your career you're like, Oh, I didn't like this part. I've kind of got it to where I like it, right?

I kind of like where I am. At the same time, one, I think older people should get outta the fucking way for young people. Two, I have a number. I think it's 70. I will quit. I will just do whatever I want. I was thinking I'll write historical novels or, you know, sit in my garden. I'll end up doing well 'cause I'm actually quite entrepreneurial. Like, I'll make honey or something.

You'll sell flowers.

Scott and I signed another four-year deal with Vox. And I think On is another four-year deal. I suspect maybe one more after that.

That was the other thing that was interesting about The New York Times story: the enormous amount of money you stand to make. Because of the deal you made with Vox Media, you're very well-positioned to make a lot of money.

I'm less interested in the money itself, although I love that for you, but I'm actually interested in the decision to talk about how much money you make, which I don't think people do enough. I'm just curious about why you did that.

Well, you just answered it: Because people don't.

I think we lose power when we don't say how much money we make. We also lose power when we don't say what people aren't making, 'cause a lot of it is bullshit, right?

So we already made a lot of money from our last deal. People don't realize that.

How much money did you make?

In that one, um, $25 million, both of us together.

Then you split it?

So in that case, I had a guarantee of $500,000 for each show. And then if the guarantee wasn't met, you didn't get any more.

I don't love guarantees, by the way. I think you shouldn't have guarantees. If you make it, you make it. If you don't, you don't. I get why people do them, but we got a better split by not having the guarantee. So the last one we were getting a guarantee of, this is just for Pivot, each of us $500,000.

But the thing is, we made that money, we made that. Vox made it and more. You know, it was so interesting, because a lot of the union people were like, Oh, giving Kara the money. I'm like, I earned every fucking cent of that.

Well, you have a lucrative product.

That's right. It also makes money to help Vox as a business. They made profits on it. They were able to do different and more things. So I just think people should talk about what they make, especially women. If you fuck up, you say, “Oh, that didn't make money.” Like, we did a conference down in Florida. Didn't make money. Didn't make money because it was hard. It's hard in the first year. Then we just didn't do it anymore. But most of the things I've done, all of the things I've done, have made money.

Well, speaking of making money, you're talking about retiring at 70. What I'm wondering is when, if ever, will you buy The Washington Post from Jeff Bezos?

Well, I have a whole plan.

I know you do. Are you still working on this plan?

I have inquired, I have gone back. I have an investment banker who's been talking to his people. They are not engaging, and I don't know. Like just today there was a story about how there's no money to be made there. Like he has run this thing into the fucking wall. I guess he just doesn't care.

He's so rich, he doesn't care. He is richer than ever. I have an idea that will make it break even, like not a really great business, at all, by any means. But I think it's more than that. I have an idea about creator networks and stuff like that, but now it's kind of water under the fucking bridge. If he had actually engaged with me at the time, or people like me. Instead he brings in this terrible CEO, who just soils himself on a daily basis and doesn't want to do anything with it. So it's sort of like, Why are the Ellisons on CBS? Why do the Ellisons want this? They aren't interested in news. They want the studios. This is a cheaper way to get the studios. None of these people care about the news. I happen to care, like an idiot. I think I could do OK and employ people and create really good truthful reporting.

It wouldn't be for the money. I think I can make it a business, a little business, like a pretty good business.

What role do you see yourself playing in that? Are you the CEO of this, of The Washington Post?

I would make [Vox Media CEO] Jim Bankoff the CEO, for example. Someone like that. Someone who has business acumen. I'd probably just be chairman of the board, or maybe editorial director. I don't even need a title. I would get a kick-ass bunch of editors … I have a bunch of people I think would be great at it, but my theory depends more on journalism across the country.

Look what I'm wearing.

The Minnesota Star Tribune.

I was just there. A friend of mine is the CEO now. I was speaking in front of his staff. They're trying to redo themselves. They happen to have a nice billionaire who owns them.

Love a nice billionaire.

Very innovative stuff they're trying there. My friend Rene Sanchez is doing this thing in Louisiana that's amazing. There's all this stuff that needs a joint advertising, legal, distribution, video framework.

The New York Times, they do all their things really well by themselves, but there's room for someone who brings everything together that has journalistic trust. I think The Post still barely has that.

I mean, by a thread. My question for you is, the Ellisons own CBS News now. They have oversight of TikTok and its algorithm. You've got Bezos at The Post. It's a lot.

Except what are they buying? First, Bezos is doing nothing with The Post, so what's the point? Then the Ellisons, like they buy something, like everyone was like, Oh, CBS. I'm like, Show of hands of people who last watched the CBS Evening News. It's like nobody, right?

So what they're buying is curiously problematic.

The question, I guess, is where does journalism go from here?

I wouldn't rely on broadcast networks as journalism. There's a reason I had you on [my podcast] and others. I'm gonna do one of those every quarter, because I'm so sick of seeing “things don't work.” There's many roads to get to places.

So you could do what you're doing, which is taking a storied brand and actually reinvigorating it and trying all manner of different things. What doesn't work, what works? I totally see your strategy—what you've done there and it's worked, right? Subscriptions are up, maybe you'll move into something else. You're trying to be dynamic.

Then there's all the independent outlets, of which there are many, and then there's some that are coalescing. There are some that are video-only. There are some that are podcast-only.

Had Scott and I been younger, and we talked about this, we would've formed another podcast company and started to make more podcasts and create a network. I think we would've done rather well. We looked at each other, like, We're too old. We would've done that, but we're too fucking old. We really literally said that to each other. We'd make more money at that if we saw it through, we thought. But we would be exhausted.

And it sounds like you're making enough.

That's right.

You're good.

We're good and we're influential. But someone should do that. Not us, but someone should do that. We could do it, but we were too tired and old.

Oh, too tired and old. Speaking of which, we're gonna wrap up.

Sure.

But before we do I'm gonna force you to play a little game. It's called Control, Alt, Delete. This is like Fuck, Mary, Kill but for nerds. So what piece of tech would you love to control? What would you alt, so alter or change? And what would you delete? What would you vanquish from the earth?

I don't think I could, but social media I would delete, I would kill. Alter would be AI.

How would you alter it?

Just add safety guidelines and have more government regulations.

OK. So it's the practical stuff.

But I believe in it. I'm not like one of those doomers, like it's gonna kill us.

What would you control.

Control, I think government, so you could reform it so that it was more democratic. I think our form of government, as problematic as it is, has always been the best one. So I would get money outta politics. I would make the Supreme Court bigger. If I could do whatever I wanted, I'd pull a George fucking Washington is what I do.

I like this.

Not him. I'm not George Washington, but you know what I mean? Guess who invented the internet? The fucking government. I think our government is so critical to so many things that it deserves to have a renaissance.

Unfortunately, it's been captured by oligarchs and a very coin-operated president. He's the least of my worries.

What's the most of your worries?

Oh, the tech guys. The tech guys, I would say everybody should be. Or just wealthy people in general controlling all of our fates.

They do not have our interests at heart, and I worry that they have too much. I think we're gonna get to a point where they're so rich it just will not end well.

I mean, it never ended well in the Gilded Age. The Gilded Age people only had the railroads, which were critical, but not everything. Like they have everything.

They have everything.

That worries me, especially when they have proven themselves to be selfish pricks most of the time.

Parting words.

Except Mark Cuban!

In the fight against cancer, an important field of research is the search for safe alternatives to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. These treatments attack both cancer cells and healthy cells, exposing patients to serious side effects.

A team of scientists from the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Porto in Portugal have just brought an alternative one step closer. They've developed materials capable of converting near-infrared light, or NIR, efficiently and safely into heat that can be highly targeted against cancer cells. Their materials are tin oxide (SnOx) nanoflakes, tiny particles that have a thickness of less than 20 nanometers (a nanometer is one-thousand-millionth of a meter).

The team's findings, published in the journal ACS Nano, offer new hope for the design of photothermal therapies, the name given to these types of light-based treatments.

A photothermal therapy is a noninvasive procedure that heats up cancer cells in order to destroy them. It works by infiltrating cancer cells with materials that absorb light and turn it into heat—in this case, the SnOx nanoflakes—which can be designed so that they accumulate specifically in tumor tissues. They are then targeted with light at a wavelength that gives these materials the energy they need to produce cancer-killing heat but which doesn't damage healthy tissues.

The researchers propose that their SnOx nanoflakes could improve these types of treatments by offering greater thermal efficiency, biocompatibility, and affordability than other materials that are used in such processes.

“Our goal was to create a treatment that is not only effective but also safe and accessible,” said Jean Anne Incorvia, a UT professor of engineering and one of the project leaders, in a press statement. “With the combination of LED light and SnOx nanoflakes, we've developed a method to precisely target cancer cells while leaving healthy cells untouched.”

To evaluate the thermal efficiency of their new material, the team developed a proprietary system based on near-infrared LEDs (NIR-LEDs) that emit light at a wavelength of 810 nanometers, which is safe for biological tissues. Unlike traditional laser systems, NIR-LEDs provide more homogeneous and stable illumination, reduce the risk of overheating, and require minimal investment. The entire experimental set-up, capable of irradiating up to 24 samples at the same time, cost approximately $530, making it an affordable and versatile tool for biomedical research.

Results from beaming NIR onto SnOx-treated cancer cells have been encouraging. UT reported that in as little as 30 minutes of exposure, the method killed up to 92 percent of skin cancer cells and 50 percent of colorectal cancer cells. This was achieved without any harmful effects to healthy skin cells, demonstrating the safety and selectivity of this approach.

Although further biological and clinical studies are still required, the work demonstrates that these nanomaterials, treated with this specific type of light, could become a plausible and affordable photothermal therapy for cancer. “Our ultimate goal is to make this technology available to patients everywhere, especially places where access to specialized equipment is limited, with fewer side effects and lower cost,” said Artur Pinto, a researcher at the University of Porto's School of Engineering and another of the lead authors, in a statement.

“In the particular case of skin cancers, we envision that one day the treatment could be moved from the hospital to the patient's home,” Pinto said. “A portable device could be placed on the skin after surgery to irradiate and destroy any remaining cancer cells, thus reducing the risk of recurrence.”

                                What happens here matters everywhere.

Philips Ultrasound is laying off 33 employees from its Bothell, Wash., facility, which serves as a hub for the engineering and manufacturing of ultrasound equipment and other healthcare devices. 

The cuts were disclosed in a new filing from the Washington Employment Security Department and will take effect Dec. 31. 

Production operators, warehouse operators and technicians were affected by the cuts.

The layoff “is part of a limited restructuring of specific Philips Ultrasound activities within an ongoing strategic transition plan that was announced in 2024,” Mario Fante, Philips' global external relations director told GeekWire via email.   

The Netherlands-based company has around 1,500 employees in the Seattle area, according to LinkedIn.

In a separate incident, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in September issued a warning letter to the CEO of Royal Philips citing oversight concerns at the Bothell facility as well as a location in Pennsylvania and another in the Netherlands.

The issues at the Bothell site relate to a lack of documentation regarding the company's response when ultrasound devices are reported to be defective and either break or perform incorrectly.

“We are not able to determine the adequacy of the proposed corrective actions for your responses for the Bothell and Reedsville facilities. We understand that Philips Ultrasound has revised their complaint procedures and have updated the corresponding complaint records to include additional information and to address the inspectional findings,” states the FDA letter.

The layoffs are “completely unrelated to any regulatory action,” Fante added. 

Editor's note: Story updated to clarify that the FDA warning is unrelated to the reduction in force and to add comment from Fante.

                                What happens here matters everywhere.                                


by Kurt Schlosser on Nov 4, 2025 at 8:23 amNovember 4, 2025 at 8:25 am

When Marissa Coughlin left her latest tech job to open a romance bookstore and crafting hub in Seattle, she didn't leave technology behind completely.

In fact, alongside her partner, Constantine Vetoshev, who still works in tech, artificial intelligence has become a major player in this next chapter of their lives.

Coughlin worked in a variety of communications and content roles for companies including Airbnb, Textio, Highspot, and most recently, T-Mobile. Vetoshev is a software developer at Brook.ai, a Seattle-area health technology startup that uses AI to help clinical teams deliver remote care.

Both big readers, the pair first started looking at spaces and developing a bookstore business plan in 2023. But with two small children, they were waiting for better timing. When a space became available on Market Street in Seattle's Ballard neighborhood they finally made the leap, and opened Swoon City last month.

While Coughlin has no interest in seeing AI used to write the books or illustrate the covers that line her shelves, she's a big believer in how the technology can help the back end of the business.

“I think more businesses should be using this stuff, especially small businesses, if they can figure out how to tap into it,” Coughlin said. “It's super useful, but you have to know that it's there and what it can do, and be a little bit creative and figure out the solutions.”

Here are some of the ways Swoon City is tapping into AI, leveraging Coughlin and Vetoshev's know-how:

“I feel like there's a lot of things that we've created for this store that other people who might be curious about doing something like this could tap into and be able to leverage for their own stuff,” Coughlin said.

Vetoshev said he can come home from his day job, put the kids to bed and then focus on something that needs to be built for the store.

“A couple of hours of work with a [large language] model, and we're off to the races,” he said.

The technology is all in service of a genre that is exploding, especially among young readers.

Romance is the leading growth category for the total print book market thus far in 2025, and the volume for the category has more than doubled compared to four years ago, with 51 million units sold in the past 12 months, according to industry analysis.

NPR credited romance interest driven by Gen Z readers, especially on BookTok, a subcommunity of TikTok for recommending, reviewing, and discussing books.

Swoon City is hoping to follow in the successful footsteps of The Ripped Bodice, an independent brick-and-mortar romance bookstore with locations in Los Angeles and Brooklyn, N.Y.

Coughlin looks forward to bringing people together not just around books, but by hosting various events and building out crafting classes for embroidery, stained glass, jewelry making and more.

“I feel like part of what was exciting for a romance bookstore is the community, because it is often not a genre that's as well respected in the book community, even though it's huge,” she said.



University of Washington scientists and students are using AI to create real medicines.

Better treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, viruses and more are now on the horizon thanks to groundbreaking work with artificial intelligence from a team of scientists at the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design. Led by Nobel Prize winner David Baker, this team of Huskies uses AI tools to create proteins — biology's building blocks — that lay the foundation for new medicines. Together, this international group of students, faculty and researchers acts as a “communal brain,” with each Husky contributing ideas and expertise from their fields. The institute's recent breakthroughs — including an antivenom for snakebites, and antibiotics that combat drug-resistant bacteria — show how this innovative science can save and change lives.

AceRocket

Founded: 2025

The business: Learning platform that helps high school students prepare for SAT, ACT, and AP exams through personalized daily practice. Uses AI and an adaptive question engine to tailor each learning path to a student's performance. The bootstrapped startup has served more than 200 beta users and plans to expand its pilot program later this year.

Leadership: CEO Dong Zhang spent three years at Amazon as a machine learning scientist and two years at IBM as a data scientist.

Mean VC: “AceRocket hits a timeless market with an AI-driven, adaptive prep system that could actually make standardized test study less soul-crushing and more effective. But the test-prep space is dominated by giants with brand trust, so unless you show radically better outcomes — or pivot fast when tests go optional — you're launching into headwinds, not orbit.”

Boop

Founded: 2025

The business: AI-native social travel companion that automatically turns real trips into shoppable itineraries friends can copy, personalize, and book. Boop wants to create the world's largest network of itineraries — connecting travelers, creators, and local businesses through personalized recommendations. Boop is backed by Bling Capital, BBG Ventures, and the AI2 Incubator, and just launched its public waitlist.

Leadership: CEO Nancy Li Smith is a longtime product leader with stints at Meta, Microsoft, and more recently BrightAI.

Mean VC: “Boop taps into the perfect intersection of social discovery and travel commerce, with a clear path to viral growth if itineraries truly feel personal and shareable. But unless Boop cracks retention and monetization beyond influencer sparkle, it risks becoming another glossy app people forget between trips.”

Dotted

Founded: 2025

The business: Automates product reporting by pulling live data from tools like Jira, GitHub, and Slack, turning it into leadership-ready narratives. Aims to replace slide decks, free product teams from manual updates, and give executives real-time visibility and control. Dotted is currently in closed beta is building out its B2B early access program.

Leadership: Co-founder Dunni Abiodun was a principal product manager at Axon, and worked at Amazon and Microsoft. Co-founder Eric Neuman spent nearly a decade at Microsoft as a software engineer. Former Microsoft director Jeremy Schreiber recently joined as chief commercial officer.

Mean VC: “Dotted smartly targets a universal pain point — turning scattered product data into clear, executive-ready updates without wasting a PM's weekend on slides. But automation in reporting is a graveyard of ‘almost useful' tools, and unless Dotted nails narrative accuracy and context, leaders won't trust what it writes any more than what they already ignore.”

FurFriends

Founded: 2024

The business: Aims to help locals break the “Seattle Freeze” through dog-friendly social connections. The app organizes puppy playdates and events that help dog owners form real-world friendships. The company plans to launch premium subscription features and partnered with the Seattle Mariners earlier this year for a Bark at the Park event at Victory Hall.

Leadership: Founder Avery Morton is a former senior technical product manager at Amazon and was a product manager at Prodege.

Mean VC: “FurFriends cleverly uses dogs as social catalysts to thaw the ‘Seattle Freeze,' tapping into a playful, emotionally resonant niche with real community stickiness. But unless you crack consistent engagement beyond the first tail wag, you'll end up with more ghost towns than dog parks.”

ClickUp has redesigned its productivity platform and released new AI assistant features as it aims to create a one-stop shop for customers. 

The company said core parts of this release were possible because of its acquisition of Qatalog, the enterprise search startup that had raised  more than $29.5 million from backers like Salesforce Ventures, Atomico, Prototype Capital, Mosaic Ventures, Tiny VC, and Possible Ventures.

ClickUp is launching two types of AI agents with its 4.0 release. The first one is an agent that is present in all communication channels. The agent is designed to proactively look for questions people might have asked and try to answer them using knowledge stored in within the company and external sources like Google Drive, OneDrive, Figma, and Gmail. 

The other assistant, called Brain, is a more general-purpose assistant that can generate ideas, perform tasks like scheduling a meeting based on the availability of teammates as well as add a comment under a task, or create a new one. It can also access the web and other integrated tools, analyze reports, and create drafts. Just like many other AI assistants, Brain also lives in the sidebar and is accessible anywhere on the ClickUp interface.

The a16z-backed productivity company said the new release is making it easier for users to switch between tasks, docs, and communications. ClickUp 4.0 lets you look at your internal company forum timeline, switch between different communication channels, and look at your tasks through options in the sidebar.

ClickUp has been trying to better compete with the likes of Notion, Slack, and Microsoft Teams by providing calendar, communication, and documents, enterprise search, and task tracking under one product.

The startup has tried to make its communication have feature parity with the likes of Slack and Teams. It launched AI-powered summaries and internal live video and audio calls called Syncups last year. Now it is placing a Syncup button in every channel and also allowing its AI notetaker to record these live video calls, transcribe them, and send notes to everyone.

The company's calendar tool can now look at your meeting spread and automatically adjust meetings and tasks if you mark a certain task as a priority. ClickUp also displays an internet-style team dashboard where leaders can see various updates from different channels, look at team analytics on work progress, and check who has time off this week.

“Eight years ago, when we started, the vision and the strategy were to replace all of your work software. The strategy to do that was to build a flexible data models platform that can be used essentially for anything, and build primitives of software like a spreadsheet, a table, a document, and a task,” ClickUp CEO Zeb Evans told TechCrunch over a call. “In the age of AI, they're needed to an even greater extent because you can't really visualize things in AI within a chat interface.”

Evans said ClickUp has had great momentum in the last few years and has crossed $300 million in annual recurring revenue. He noted that with this growth rate, the company plans to go public within two years. ClickUp has raised more than $537 million in funding to date from investors like a16z, Tiger Global, Craft Ventures, and Lightspeed, according to Crunchbase data.

Nvidia is playing fast and loose with its war chest as it looks to build on its momentum as the chief benefactor of the AI boom. 

The company on Tuesday signed a €1 billion ($1.15 billion) partnership with Deutsche Telekom to set up an “AI factory” in Munich that aims to boost Germany's AI computing power by 50%.

Called the “Industrial AI Cloud,” the project will use more than 1,000 Nvidia DGX B200 systems and RTX Pro Servers with up to 10,000 Blackwell GPUs to provide AI inferencing and other services to German companies while complying with German data sovereignty laws.

Deutsche Telekom said early partners of the project include Agile Robots, whose bots will be used to install server racks at the facility, and Perplexity, which will use the data center to provide “in-country” AI inferencing to German users and companies. The telco also outlined digital twins and physics-based simulation as use cases for industrial companies.

The telecom company said it would provide the physical infrastructure for the project, while SAP will provide its business technology platform and applications.

The partnership comes at a time when the European tech industry has been calling on EU lawmakers to reduce their reliance on foreign infrastructure and service providers and to foster adoption of homegrown alternatives. At the same time, tech companies have been criticizing the bloc's approach to regulating AI, arguing that the rules only serve to hold back innovation.

The EU earlier this year committed €200 billion to set up “AI gigafactories” on the continent, focusing on “industrial and mission-critical applications.” But funding for AI initiatives in the European Union has been notably lower than in the U.S., where companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, Google, and Oracle have pumped in hundreds of billions to build massive data centers and assorted infrastructure to support development of AI models and services.

Deutsche Telekom noted that this project, expected to start operations in early 2026, is separate from the EU's AI gigafactory initiative.

“Mechanical engineering and industry have made this country strong,” says Tim Höttges, CEO of Deutsche Telekom. “But here, too, we are challenged. AI is a huge opportunity. It will help to improve our products and strengthen our European strengths.”

Apple's latest iOS update, available for eligible devices from Monday, doesn't introduce any major features, but it does bring one highly-requested tweak: the ability to change the transparency of the translucent liquid glass design.

If you didn't like the look of iOS 26, all you could do so far was to reduce transparency via the accessibility settings, which pretty much turned off the liquid glass overlay. With iOS 26.1, we now get a new menu to retain the look while increasing opacity.

You can head to Settings > Display & Brightness > Liquid Glass to select either the original “Clear” option or a more opaque “Tinted” option. You can also see a preview of each option when you're selecting them.

Liquid glass was the company's biggest design overhaul since its move to a flat design back in 2013, but similar to most changes of this scale and significance, not everybody has been on board.

Some people said the more translucent design made various parts of the interface harder to read, including notifications or navigation controls in apps, while others professed their love for the attention to detail and the new look, which felt like a much-needed update to an interface that had grown stale over the years.

Besides the transparency settings, iOS 26.1 also lets you tweak what gestures do on the home screen: You now get an option to open the camera app by swiping to the left on the lockscreen. You change this by going to Settings > Camera > Lock Screen Swipe to Open Camera.

IOS 26.1 also gives users the ability to locally capture audio and video while recording a video call. This can be useful if you're recording a call or podcast on the move. The company announced this feature for iPadOS in June during the Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC).

The update also brings support for eight new languages for Apple Intelligence: Chinese (Traditional), Danish, Dutch, Norwegian, Swedish, Portuguese (Portugal), Vietnamese and Turkish. The company is also adding live translation support for five new languages: Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Italian, Japanese and Korean.

We also get some quality of life improvements, including gestures to change songs in Apple Music; a slider to stop alarms instead of a button so you don't accidentally shut it off; and an option to automatically install security improvements.

You can update your device by going to Settings > General > Software update.

Amazon announced on Tuesday that Alexa+, its upgraded assistant powered by AI, is coming to the Amazon Music app for iOS and Android devices. 

The feature is currently available across all Amazon Music subscription plans, but is only available for users with Alexa+ Early Access. (To access Alexa+, tap the “a” button in the lower right corner and ask your question using the built-in microphone on your phone. ) 

The introduction of Alexa+ to Amazon Music aims to create a more conversational approach to music discovery. Unlike the previous version of Alexa, which only responded to basic commands, Alexa+ is designed to engage in natural dialogue. 

Users can ask specific and obscure questions, such as queries regarding an artist's influences or exploring deeper meanings behind songs. It can also help recall a song's title by providing lyrics you remember or even mentioning the movie it was featured in.

Additionally, Alexa+ can create personalized playlists tailored to specific requests, such as “Make a playlist of 2010s hits that keep me moving fast, starting with a track from Nicki Minaj,” the company suggested. 

Some other examples the company provided include: “Can you recommend new music that would make me seem cool to my 13-year-old daughter without trying too hard?” and “What's the song that plays during the opening credits of ‘The Sopranos'?”

Alexa+ was initially announced in February at the company's hardware event and is positioned as one of the first consumer-focused agent tools on the market. This assistant can perform actions on a user's behalf, such as booking restaurant reservations and ordering groceries.

While Alexa+ is still in its early stages and not yet widely available to the public, it has already rolled out to more than a million users.

The company reported that Amazon Music listeners who have tried the feature are exploring songs three times more with Alexa+ than with the original assistant, and those seeking recommendations are listening to nearly 70% more music.

In light of Spotify's recent integration with ChatGPT, this could be a strategic move by Amazon to compete with the music streaming giant and showcase its own AI investments. Amazon Music has already incorporated numerous AI features into its app, with the latest additions being weekly AI-generated playlists, AI-assisted search, and “Explore,” which helps users learn more about their favorite artists.

WhatsApp announced on Tuesday that it's launching an Apple Watch companion app. For the first time, WhatsApp users will be able to use their Apple Watch to get call notifications, read full messages, and record and send voice messages.

“This new experience will help you stay on top of your chats without needing to pull out your iPhone,” WhatsApp wrote in a blog post. “In addition to reading and responding to messages, for the first time, WhatsApp on Apple Watch will now support many requested features.”

Other supported features include the ability to react to messages and the option to see more of your chat history on-screen when reading messages. Additionally, you will see clearer images and stickers.

The Meta-owned messaging app notes that, as always, your personal messages and calls are protected with end-to-end encryption. WhatsApp also says that it plans to deliver even more functionality to Apple Watches in the future.

The new WhatsApp Apple Watch app requires an Apple Watch Series 4 or later, running watchOS 10 or later.

Tuesday's announcement doesn't come as a total surprise, as WhatsApp was spotted testing the new Apple Watch app last week.

WhatsApp has been working to make it easier for users to access its service beyond mobile and desktop. In May, WhatsApp debuted its long-awaited iPad app, which allows you to make video and audio calls with up to 32 people, share your screen, and use both front and rear cameras. Before the launch of the app, if you wanted to use WhatsApp on your iPad, you had to use the web version in a browser.

WhatsApp's launch of an Apple Watch app comes a few months after Snapchat rolled out one as well. The app allows users to preview an incoming message and also reply using the keyboard, Scribble, Dictation, or an emoji. Snapchat is focused on using its watchOS app to enable users to quickly respond to messages, not to view images or videos.

GoFundMe has introduced a new offering that allows you to purchase digital gift cards for your loved ones, enabling them to donate to their favorite nonprofit organizations during the holidays. 

The gift cards start at $5 and come in a variety of themes and causes, including Birthday, Christmas, Hanukkah, and Ramadan, as well as cards for animal lovers, cancer fighters, and nature protectors.

These cards work differently than traditional gift cards, though. They operate through Giving Funds, GoFundMe's fee-free donor-advised fund (DAF). Launched in June, this marked the platform's first entry into DAFs, aiming to make them accessible to everyday donors. Historically, donor-advised funds have been out of reach for most people due to high minimum contributions and fees.

When recipients claim the gift card, the amount is deposited into their personal Giving Fund. They then have the option to donate immediately or allow the funds to grow tax-free in their account, which gives them the opportunity to contribute even more later. The person who purchased the gift card receives a tax deduction.

Recipients can choose from 1.4 million nonprofits on the platform, ranging from local food banks to global organizations that provide disaster relief, support youth programs, and promote animal welfare.

GoFundMe's new gifting strategy could appeal to users for several reasons. For example, instead of giving a generic gift, people can help their loved ones support causes that truly matter to them, such as a local soup kitchen that helps feed families during Thanksgiving, a time when many people struggle to put a meal on the table.

Plus, a nonprofit gift card can also be a great way for older generations to teach younger family members about the importance of giving back. It opens up conversations about different causes and the real impact they have.

In May, GoFundMe celebrated its 15th anniversary and announced that it had surpassed $40 billion raised globally. The company also launched GoFundMe Pro, a platform aimed at helping nonprofits with fundraising. The new platform introduced AI tools designed to make it easier for nonprofits to ask for donations.

Additionally, the postgres extension system supports most of the current project, so wouldn't say it was forced in this case, it was a design decision. :)

More likely, you don't need Snowflake to process queries from your BI tools (Mode, Tableau, Superset, etc), but you do need it to prepare data for those BI tools.  Its entirely possible that you have hundreds of terabytes, if not petabytes, of input data that you want to pare down to < 1 TB datasets for querying, and Snowflake can chew through those datasets.  There's also third party integrations and things like ML tooling that you need to consider.You shouldn't really consider analytical systems the same as a database backing a service.  Analytical systems are designed to funnel large datasets that cover the entire business (cross cutting services and any sharding you've done) into subsequently smaller datasets that are cheaper and faster to query.  And you may be using different compute engines for different parts of these pipelines; there's a good chance you're not using only Snowflake but Snowflake and a bunch of different tools.

Once those tables exist, queries against them are able to either push down entirely to the remote tables and uses a Custom Scan to execute and pull results back into postgres, or we transform/extract the pieces that can be executed remotely using a FDW and then treat it as a tuple source.In both cases, the user does not need to know any of the details and just runs queries inside postgres as they always have.

For instance, you could compute a `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mytable WHERE first_name = 'David'` by querying all the rows from `mytable` on the DuckDB side, returning all the rows, and letting Postgres itself count the number of results, but this is extremely inefficient, since that same value can be computed remotely.In a simple query like this with well-defined semantics that match between Postgres and DuckDB, you can run the query entirely on the remote side, just using Postgres as a go-between.Not all functions and operators work in the same way between the two systems, so you cannot just push things down unconditionally; `pg_lake` does some analysis to see what can run on the DuckDB side and what needs to stick around on the Postgres side.There is only a single ""executor"" from the perspective of pg_lake, but the pgduck_server embeds a multi-threaded duckdb instance.How DuckDB executes the portion of the query it gets is up to it; it often will involve parallelism, and it can use metadata about the files it is querying to speed up its own processing without even needing to visit every file.  For instance, it can look at the `first_name` in the incoming query and just skip any files which do not have a min_value/max_value that would contain that.

I use DuckDB today to query Iceberg tables. In some particularly gnarly queries (huge DISTINCTs, big sorts, even just selects that touch extremely heavy columns) I have sometimes run out of memory in that DuckDB instance.I run on hosts without much memory because they are cheap, and easy to launch, giving me isolated query parallism, which is hard to achieve on a single giant host.To the extent that its possible, I dream of being able to spread those gnarly OOMing queries across multiple hosts; perhaps the DISTINCTs can be merged for example. But this seems like a pretty complicated system that needs to be deeply aware of Iceberg partitioning (""hidden"" in pg_lake's language), right?Is there some component in the postgres world that can help here? I am happy to continue over email, if you prefer, by the way.

With DuckLake, the query frontend and query engine are DuckDB, and Postgres is used as a catalog in the background.With pg_lake, the query frontend and catalog are Postgres, and DuckDB is used as a query engine in the background.Of course, they also use different table formats (though similar in data layer) with different pros and cons, and the query frontends differ in significant ways.An interesting thing about pg_lake is that it is effectively standalone, no external catalog required. You can point Spark et al. directly to Postgres with pg_lake by using the Iceberg JDBC driver.

> This separation also avoids the threading and memory-safety limitations that would arise from embedding DuckDB directly inside the Postgres process, which is designed around process isolation rather than multi-threaded execution. Moreover, it lets us interact with the query engine directly by connecting to it using standard Postgres clients.

reply

- Separation of concerns, since with a single external process we can share object store caches without complicated locking dances between multiple processes.
- Memory limits are easier to reason about with a single external process.
- Postgres backends end up being more robust, as you can restart the pgduck_server process separately.

For the postgres grants themselves, we provide privs to allow read/write to the remote tables, which is done via granting the `pg_lake_read`, `pg_lake_write` or `pg_lake_read_write` grants.  This is a blanket all-or-nothing grant, however, so would need some design work/patching to support per-relation grants, say.(You could probably get away with making roles in postgres that have the appropriate read/write grant, then only granting those specific roles to a given relation, so it's probably doable though a little clunky at the moment.)

It's what the industry uses to create the masks used in lithography machines, but it could just as easily be used to make the actual chip. The problem is that it doesn't scale, at all. A scanning process is way too slow to be useful in mass production.Thus you should always be skeptical when someone says they've built a machine that beats ASML's machines, because that's actually the easy part. The hard part is scaling it up.

Chipmaking is in a very weird geopolitical state and it has national security interests for most of the world. A Dutch company produces the machines to make chips and sells them to Taiwanese companies. The US still has the power to dictate who ASML can sell to and China is restricted.This system has a number of flaws:1. With this administration torching US influence at a never-seen-before rate, the US may no longer be able to dictate terms to ASML. At some point, it's all going to be too much for the EU;2. Taiwan is disputed territory. This statement tends to make people mad but it's true. China claims it as China but, more importantly, the One China policy is official policy of the US [1] and the EU. Yet the US also has a defence pact with Taiwan. Not that it matters because China simply doesn't have the military capability to invade Taiwan and I honestly don't think they would anyway; and3. The US has basically lost the ability to fab chips. Yes, Intel exists but they are a shadow of their former selves. The CHIPS Act tried to rectify this but even if this administration hadn't basically abandoned it, I don't think the US can see this one through regardless of administration. It's too long term. Any US company now that gets government aid just uses it on more executive compensation and share buybacks. Everything is now so financialized that any ability to produce anything is really just inertia from a bygone era.China has the exact same national security concerns except it has a proven track record of investing in and delivering long-term projects.[1]: https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-us-one-china-policy-and-w...

FYI: gpt-oss:120b is better at coding (in benchmarks and my own anecdotal testing) than gpt5-mini.  More importantly, it's so much faster too.  We need more of this kind of optimization.  Note that gpt5-mini is estimated to be around ~150 billion parameters.

This is already a fact and it's set in stone - making AI cheaper won't change anything in that regard. However, a cheaper AI will allow the laid-off software engineers to use models independently of those firing them, and even compete on a equal footing.

(You can have inflation while your currency go up relatively to all the others on the FX market, like what happened to USD in 2022-S1, or you can have massive inflation difference between countries sharing the same currency, like it happened in the Euro Area between 2022 and today).

reply

Not to mention that ""debasement"" doesn't make sense anymore given that there basically aren't any currencies on the gold standard anymore. At best you could call a pegged currency that was devalued as being debased (with the base being the pegged currency), but that doesn't apply to USD. ""debasement"" therefore is just a pejorative way saying ""inflation"" or ""monetary expansion"".

The shareware/unlock-code economy of the 90s was probably the closest you'd get to cutting out the middlemen, where you could download from some BBS or FTP server without the dev getting involved at all and then send them money to have them email you an unlock code, but it was a lot of manual work on the developer's part, and a lot of trust.

RAM usage for a lot of workloads scales with core/thread count, and my general rule of thumb is that 1G/thread is not enough, and 2G/thread will mostly work, and 4G/thread is probably too much, but your disk cache will be happy. Also, the same applies to VMs, so if your hosting a VM and give it 16 threads, you probably want at least 16G for the VM. The 4G/thread then starts to look pretty reasonable.Just building a lot of opensource projects with `make -j32` your going to be swapping if you only have 1G/thread. This rule then becomes super noticeable when your on a machine with 512G of ram, and 300+ threads, because your builds will OOM.

I think the Nintendo ecosystem has been a pretty good example of where intentional underproduction can backfire. Another example might be that migration to SSD was likely accelerated by (forced) underproduction of spinning disks in 2011. We use SSDs for a lot of things that traditional magnetic media would be better at simply because the supply has been so overpowering for so long.You can train your customers to stick with you by bathing them in product availability. Overproduction can be a good thing. Inventory can be a good thing. We've allowed a certain management class to terrorize us into believing this stuff is always bad.

Doubtful. A shortage is normally a scary prospect for a vendor. It means that buyers want to pay more, but something is getting in the way of the seller accepting that higher price.

                Reading time 4 minutes
      

Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales commented on the online encyclopedia's English-language entry about the genocide in Gaza on Sunday, which had been previously locked over disputes about its neutrality. Nobody can edit the text of the article as the conflicts are resolved. Wales seems to think that the deeply-sourced article—which contains hyperlinks to more information—isn't neutral enough on the topic, calling it “particularly egregious.”

“I believe that Wikipedia is at its best when we can have reasonable discussion rooted in a commitment to write articles that reflect a neutral point of view. I believe that's especially important on highly difficult or contentious topics,” Wales wrote in his announcement from the “Talk” page for the article “Gaza genocide.”

Wales went on to write that he was asked in a “high profile media interview” about the Gaze genocide article and stated that it had failed to meet Wikipedia standards and “needs immediate attention.” Wales didn't explain which interview he had been doing where the topic came up, but he's currently on a media tour for his new book The Seven Rules of Trust: A Blueprint for Building Things That Last.

Wales wrote that he's going to be leading a NPOV working group, which stands for “neutral point of view,” on Wikipedia for a number of topics, including Zionism.

“While this article is a particularly egregious example, there is much more work to do. It should go without saying that I am writing this in my personal capacity, and I am not speaking on behalf of the Wikimedia Foundation or anyone else!” Wales wrote.

He went on to say that while he assumed every volunteer editor who worked on the article about the genocide in Gaza was working in good faith, the idea that Israel is committing genocide is “highly contested.”

“A neutral approach would begin with a formulation such as: ‘Multiple governments, NGOs, and legal bodies have described or rejected the characterization of Israel's actions in Gaza as genocide,'” Wales wrote as an example.

The opening paragraph of the English-language Wikipedia entry currently reads:

The Gaza genocide is the ongoing, intentional, and systematic destruction of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip carried out by Israel during the Gaza war. The genocidal acts include mass killings, starvation, infliction of serious bodily and mental harm, and preventing births. Other acts include blockading, destroying civilian infrastructure, destroying healthcare facilities, killing healthcare workers and aid-seekers, causing mass forced displacement, committing sexual violence, and destroying educational, religious, and cultural sites.[9] The genocide has been recognised by a United Nations special committee[10] and commission of inquiry,[11] the International Association of Genocide Scholars,[12][13] multiple human rights groups,[c] numerous genocide studies and international law scholars,[19][20] and other experts.

As the Wikipedia entry notes, experts on genocide recognize what's happening in Gaza as a genocide. But the people who don't believe it's a genocide fall into more or less two camps: 1) Those who think Israel's actions since the attacks of Oct. 7, 2023 are just like any other war where casualties are high (about 11% of Gaza's population has been killed or injured, according to NPR) and 2) those who think that Israel is committing war crimes, but that those war crimes don't qualify as genocide.

In the latter camp, you have people like former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who served in that position from 2006 to 2009. Olmert has pointed to things like Israel's months-long total blockade of aid getting into Gaza as evidence of war crimes, but stopped short of calling it a genocide.

In the former camp, you have people like Benjamin Netanyahu, who denies an intentional effort to starve Palestinians in Gaza, among countless other crimes. Netanyahu and his allies regularly call Israel's military the most moral army in the world.

The situation in Gaza has improved since a ceasefire agreement was reached on Oct. 10, but people in the territory are still struggling immensely, according to the latest status report from the United Nations. More food and emergency personnel have been allowed into Gaza over the past three weeks, but shelter needs are still “largely unmet,” according to the UN, with much of the area turned to rubble and severely damaged buildings at risk of collapse.

Wales has been taking heat for his decision to weight in on the Gaza genocide, but he's also getting attention from other corners of the world. Elon Musk has been picking a fight with Wales and Wikipedia, which the Tesla CEO calls “Wokeipedia.” Musk recently launched a competitor called Grokipedia that just plagiarizes the scientific articles from Wikipedia and skews all of the information on other articles to favor Musk's right-wing worldview.

Wales was asked about allegations that Wikipedia is biased in an interview with Yahoo Finance on Monday and Wales said that he wants the platform to be unbiased.

“So our fundamental core rule above all others is neutral point of view is non-negotiable. Now that, just saying it doesn't make it true obviously, but it is something that the community is very committed to,” said Wales.

Wales also addressed the allegations from Musk specifically.

“We haven't been taken over by left-wing activists at all, but if he's signalling to kind and thoughtful conservatives that Wikipedia is not going to be welcoming to them, that doesn't help us,” said Wales. “If he's signaling to crazy left-wing woke activists that Wikipedia is their new home, then we have to deal with them, and those people do exist and so forth.”

“What we really want is for people of goodwill of all kinds who can understand how we have an open system that's built on trust and living up to other people's trust in you as you're working Wikipedia,” said Wales.

Correction, 9:05 pm. ET: An earlier version of this article stated that Jimmy Wales himself had locked the article on the genocide in Gaza, which isn't true. The article was locked before he commented on it. Gizmodo regrets the error.

Damn, I feel cool. I feel cool in the abstract sense, and I don't know how to accurately define this feeling from the perspective of a gadget-obsessed nerd plugging away at a review product like I do any day of the week. But I'm currently laid up with the Acer Predator Triton 14 AI on my knee, listening to John Coltrane put his soul into his sax, feeling like a smooth operator with every key, with a stylus shoved between my thumb and ring finger like a 1950s novelist about to take a drag from a cigarette. The gaming laptop has just enough of everything I want from a portable machine. It's light, pretty, and relatively powerful—and, beyond all that, it has a sleek, seamless haptic trackpad and ultrabright RGB keys. The next person to come along and tell me RGB is a worthless expense can go ahead and tell it to the Predator Triton's mini LED per-key backlit keyboard. It's bright and fits the theme of this laptop—much like the system itself, it's full of small surprises.

Acer Predator Triton 14 AI

Few laptops offer so much in a small package, though it may not be the perfect device for gaming.

Pros

Cons

The Predator is arriving at the tail end of 2025, a time when most big laptop launches have already come and gone. What's more, it's on the expensive end of 14-inch gaming laptops with these specs, demanding $2,500 for a system that may be overshadowed in just a few months when the next slate of next-gen CPUs arrives. Not only that, but it arrives just short of being the perfect “everything” laptop. Performance isn't quite on par with that of similar clamshells of this size. Battery life won't match the “all-day” span you can find among recent thin devices, from Apple's M-series MacBooks to all those AMD, Intel, or Qualcomm devices that aren't running a discrete GPU under the hood.

But those competing laptops don't have a trackpad that also acts as a drawing pad for the included stylus, plus a touch screen. You pay more for unique qualities, and when the Predator Triton works so well, it becomes easier to overlook any flaws and—yes—even that price. There are more affordable options on the market that deliver a solid gaming experience—but feeling cool often requires spending more.

As soon as you unbox the Acer Predator Triton's frame, you'll quickly realize how sturdy this miniature beast feels in your hand. There's very little flex on the lid or keyboard. Only when you press hard, directly in the center of the device, will you notice any bend whatsoever. That's significant considering how light it is. The unit weighs just 1.6 kg, or around 3.5 pounds, equivalent to two and a half hardcover books. When you have that in hand, it doesn't have any real heft thanks to its small size. Sure, it's heavier than the best thin and light commercial notebooks, such as the Asus Zenbook S14, but in the end, you're getting a rough-and-tumble design that will even resist the most overt smudges you find on most black-colored tech.

There are other things going on under the hood that set this device apart. It's sporting a graphene-based thermal interface on the CPU rather than more traditional thermal paste. Acer promised this would improve thermal conductivity and enhance the device's heat dissipation. The little laptop can get warm around the palm rests, but with the fan on the auto cooling profile, I never felt uncomfortable, even with my finger pressed closest to the screen and near the exhaust vents. Otherwise, you have a standard slate of ports, including HDMI, two USB-A 3.2 slots, one Thunderbolt 4 slot, and another USB-4 port for DC power. There's an additional headphone jack and a microSD card slot that will prove handy for some creators, though I will remain wistful for a full SD card slot on a 14-inch Windows laptop, like the one my 14-inch MacBook Pro has.

Another prominent feature that sets the Predator Triton apart is its seamless haptic touchpad. It's extra-large and stretches from the bottom edge of the laptop to the keyboard. There's no bevel; instead, it relies on two LED strips to designate the cut-off point between the palm rests. I can't physically tell what is and isn't touchpad. There's no physical “click” either: Instead, the middle portion is pressure-sensitive and provides force feedback. But I never found myself swiping where I wasn't supposed to, unlike with the notorious Dell Pro Premium—the laptop formerly known as the XPS 13—which also lacks any barrier to mark where the touchpad starts and ends.

Acer borrowed heavily from Asus in designing its Predator Triton 14 AI. This laptop, from the keyboard to the thick, sturdy shell, resembles the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, down to the key layout and the lack of replaceable RAM (it's built into the Intel Core Ultra 288V chip). The Zephyrus was one of the best shells from last year, so much so that the company reused it with its most recent ProArt designs, built with creatives in mind. This year's G14 redux, with the higher-end Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti GPU, is $100 cheaper than Acer's new RTX 5070 SKU. Still, if I had to give the nod to either Asus or Acer, the Predator Triton has taken the win thanks to that haptic trackpad.

The Corning Gorilla Glass is smooth to use. I also didn't have as many issues of palm rejection—where the laptop registers the mouse pointer when typing on the keyboard—as I do on other laptops with physical touchpads. The keyboard's flat keys with 1.7mm of key travel also kept me feeling like a smooth operator. There's enough of a clicky sensation with every push and enough separation between keys that I didn't worry I could lose my place if I wasn't paying attention. I also have to recognize the per-key RGB. The lights seem extra bright and remain clear even when I'm sitting next to a window. Combined, it all makes for the kind of experience the partitioned gamer component of my brain adores.

If you're not here for the RGB and would rather turn it off, you can. You won't be able to do the same with the haptic touchpad or the obvious Acer Predator logos stenciled into the palm rest and laptop lid. However, there's a big reason this laptop is designed like it is.

The haptic touchpad acts like a drawing pad for a compatible stylus with the MPP 2.5 protocol. The box comes with Acer's own Active Stylus, but you may have already noticed from the pictures that there's no slot on the laptop where you can stick it. There's no magnetic attachment, either. You'll have to remember to stick the stylus back in your bag—preferably in your backpack, if it has a pencil holder—and hope you don't forget it at your table at Starbucks.

Yes, the laptop has a touchscreen, but the stylus will not work on anything but the trackpad. If you were looking for a 2-in-1 laptop or tablet-like experience, this isn't it. I tried out the pen in apps like Photoshop, where the trackpad essentially acts as a scaled version of your canvas. Positioning the tip above the trackpad indicates where you are on the canvas. However, this hover function sometimes didn't work, and I would jab down on the wrong part of the picture. This could make selecting specific parts of the image more difficult than simply clicking with a mouse. However, once you master using the stylus as a faux pen, it starts to feel incredible. The stylus has tilt support and 4,096 pressure levels. Having the option to draw on the trackpad rather than the screen meant I could press the pen as hard as I needed without fear of damaging the display.

I'm no artist, so I couldn't tell you how useful it may be when your drawing surface is barely any larger than your iPhone screen. The pen runs on a single AAA battery, with an estimated 12 months of life before you need to replace the cell. Unlike a device like the Apple Pencil Pro, there are no on-pen controls to make sure you don't have to swap between your mouse and pen to select a new tool. This laptop's pen situation will offer different strokes for different folks. If you want an all-in-one laptop and drawing pad, I can't think of a better alternative than the Predator Triton 14 AI.

If I were judging the Acer Triton 14 AI purely on its gaming performance, it would come up short compared to recent laptops like the Razer Blade 14. Thankfully, the performance delta isn't enough for me to say everyone should go out and grab a different device for a similar price—that may depend on the apps you expect to run. If the one thing you care about is in-game performance with the supported Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 GPU, then there are other devices of similar scale that will perform better.

The last gaming-ready 14-inch laptop I reviewed was the Razer Blade 14. That device costs $2,700 without any discount, though it regularly sells for less. Compared to that slim gaming machine, the Predator is a loud beast that can't quite keep up with Razer's gazelle-like speeds. The Predator Triton uses the same RTX 5070 GPU with 32 GB of RAM, though instead of AMD, it's one of the few laptops bearing Intel's Core Ultra 9 288V. It's one of Intel's Lunar Lake devices that promised strong performance with excellent battery life in lightweight laptops, though few, if any, sported the top-end SKU. It has the same eight-core configuration as the more ubiquitous Core Ultra 7 258V (four performance cores and four efficiency cores), but with a higher 5.1GHz clock speed and 30W power draw.

Finally getting the long-awaited Intel Core Ultra 9 288V in my hands proved underwhelming. On both Geekbench 6 and Cinebench 2024, the Lunar Lake chip underperformed the Blade 14's AMD Ryzen AI 9 365, especially in multi-core tests. That makes sense, considering that 10-core CPU has a possible TDP up to 54W. On the Turbo power profile, with the CPU overclocked, the system hit 10,704 points compared to the Blade 14's 14,949. On Cinebench, which measures how well the CPU handles graphics, the system scored a 636 in multi-core compared to the Ryzen AI 9 365's 1074.

The Core Ultra 9 288V is a lightweight laptop chip with a 30W envelope that can't reach the heights of CPUs designed for gaming laptops. Intel's Arrow Lake-H series has proved fairly strong across the many 16- and 18-inch laptops I've used this year. A 14-inch chassis will necessarily limit its performance in some apps. In our Blender tests, which measure how long it takes to render a BMW scene on both the CPU and GPU, the Intel chip took 3 minutes and 50 seconds, compared to just over 1 minute for the 16-inch Lenovo Legion Pro 7i with its Intel Core Ultra 275HX chip.

On several 3DMark graphics benchmarks, the Predator RTX 5070 and Intel Core Ultra 9 were a few hundred points below the Razer Blade 14 in all but the classic Time Spy test. On gaming benchmarks, that equated to a difference of around 3-5 fps, depending on the title. In Cyberpunk 2077, at the max 2,880 by 1,800 resolution and Ultra settings without ray tracing, the laptop could net around 41 fps. At max resolution with all the ray tracing enabled to make Night City glow with more realistic lighting, you can technically achieve at least 35 fps with DLSS upscaling set to auto.

It's a similar story in games like Horizon Zero Dawn: Remastered and Black Myth Wukong, where, at max resolution and with no frame gen, you can squeak by at just over 30 fps on the highest settings. The ceiling for an RTX 5070 and an Intel Core CPU may be lower than what you want, despite the asking price. I could barely make Marvel's Spider-Man 2—which, to be fair, is notoriously hard on the GPU, especially with ray tracing enabled—playable at medium settings with DLSS enabled. Meanwhile, in Baldur's Gate III, I found I could easily hit 60 fps in most settings without even needing to use DLSS, thanks to the latest updates.

All these trials were performed on the maxed-out Turbo performance setting in Acer's PredatorSense software, which made the fans kick up such a racket that I felt like the laptop was about to VTOL off my desk and fly into the ceiling. It was so loud I could barely hear the game audio. Sticking to the lower power profiles will be good enough for most of those same games I described before, with a difference of a few fps, at most.

Being that it has a Lunar Lake CPU, the Triton qualifies as a Copilot+ PC, which ostensibly means you get access to all of last year's AI features. That includes Recall, should you dare to let Microsoft screenshot almost everything you do on your PC. The NPU, or neural processing unit, central to this type of PC, isn't anywhere close to the end-all, be-all. Again, this splits the difference between a creative-focused and a gaming-focused laptop. Luckily, I found the battery could make up for some of the limited performance, even if few current gaming-ready laptops with the latest RTX 50-series GPUs will offer true “all-day” battery life.

The Acer Predator Triton 14 AI is extremely portable for a gaming laptop. The device fit snugly into any backpack I threw it into, and it doesn't require a proprietary charger. The accompanying 140W power brick was small enough that I could wrap it up and tuck it up into the bottom of my bag without much consideration to how much heft I had to bring to and from work.

Such a small brick is a nice change of pace after lugging around the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i's 400W power brick—the most brick-like of any power adapter I've used. However, the device's limited power draw is indicative of its overall performance. Like most traditional gaming laptops, the Predator Triton 14 will not last you from dawn till dusk. On Balanced power settings, I managed a maximum of 3 hours of battery life in general use. I was able to get close to 30 minutes more when I put the device on Quiet power settings and turned off all RGB lighting.

If you're using this device on the go, you'll need the charger with you. That's the same story for every 2025 gaming laptop, and at least Acer's device is far less cumbersome than other options.

When you use as many laptops as I do, coming back to an OLED display is like rubbing the sleep from your eyes every morning, thinking, “Oh, right, this is how things are supposed to look.” OLED, which stands for organic light-emitting diode, offers deeper black levels and better contrast than more traditional LCD screens.

The Acer Predator Triton's panel offers a 120Hz refresh rate and a claimed peak brightness of 340 nits. OLED displays are notoriously dimmer than others, but you'll find this one bright enough, indoors, for most use cases. Even hanging out near a window in full daylight, I wasn't disturbed from my perch. When you go outside, that's when you'll start to see the visuals start to dim. At least the screen isn't as glossy as those of some recent Lenovo devices I've used, and it wasn't reflective to the point that I had to angle myself just to read my own text.

If you were hoping this laptop would be a full audio-visual suite for all your work, the Predator Triton's sound quality does punch above its small stature. However, I wouldn't say it's anywhere near the perfect audio specimen. It sports six speakers, four downward-firing and two on the side. It's the downward speakers that let it down the most. If you're working on a table or desk, the noise becomes more muffled than it is if you're holding it aloft. It creates an awkward echo effect that won't occur when you're using the laptop on your lap.

The device can get rather loud in a confined space if you turn up the volume. The overall experience feels balanced, for the most part. The one area where it starts to sound sharp is in the highs. If you listen to the crackle in the opening video of Cyberpunk 2077, you'll start to identify when it's a little too much. The device also comes packed with DTS: X Ultra software, with settings for various types of games. This can enable a small sense of spatial audio in some supported games, but the effect will be less reliable than you'd achieve with a good pair of headphones.

One more thing: Excellent display aside, this is still Acer we're talking about, and the system itself comes preloaded with an obnoxious amount of annoying and intrusive bloatware, such as Acer's Planet9, Acer Assist on Store, Acer QuickPanel, and on and on. It doesn't help that Windows 11's most recent update has ballooned the number of Copilot AI apps vying for your attention. Running the machine for the first time was like opening up a beautifully wrapped present on Christmas and needing to dig through 15 layers of bubble wrap, old newspaper, and expired coupons to get to the good stuff beneath.

I keep imagining the “everything laptop,” something that can handle everything well, from work to creative tasks to gaming. I can't imagine anything that would look far off from the Acer Predator Triton AI 14—at least, as long as you have its power brick nearby and easy access to an outlet.

The product's flaws don't detract much from the overall experience. Even if performance may not be up to par with other devices at similar price points, I still prefer the other unique benefits Acer's latest brings to the table. Or at least I will, until Acer decides to stick a Panther Lake chip in this thing and figures out how to give it all-day battery life. At that point, it may truly strike gold.

Despite its proven popularity, everybody—even Nintendo itself—seemed to underestimate the Switch 2. The sequel handheld console hybrid is now on pace to be the company's fastest-selling device ever. Okay, you may be asking, so what if a multi-billion-dollar company makes more money? Nintendo is proving to the entire video game industry that the old ways still work and that developers who want to succeed need to design games with the Switch 2's limited hardware in mind.

In its latest quarterly earnings report, Nintendo told investors it now expects to ship 19 million units before the end of March 2026, which is the end of its fiscal year. Before, the company promised to ship 15 million units worldwide. The company also expects to sell 48 million units of its software offerings, 3 million more than previous estimates. That's indicative of how well the Switch 2 has done since launch back in June. Nintendo says it has sold a total of 10.36 million units up through Sept. 30.

There's a small portion of gamers who buy Nintendo's consoles to exclusively play the company's first-party titles. Nintendo claims it sold 9.57 million copies of Mario Kart World. That game shipped alongside the Switch 2, so 8.1 million of those sales were for the $500 bundle that saved players from paying the full $80 for the game individually. Meanwhile, Donkey Kong Bananza, the company's first major post-launch success, notched up an impressive 3.49 million total sales since July. We don't know what the total sales were for Pokémon Legends: Z-A, which launched in October, though that game seems to have already made its mark with 5.8 million units sold in its first week.

Nintendo said that if you also accounted for third-party games, then the total software sales number equaled 20.62 million. Nintendo isn't releasing specific numbers for how many gamers bought the Switch 2 editions of original Switch titles like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, or if it counts Switch 2 upgrade packs for games like Super Mario Party Jamboree in those figures. That makes it more difficult to judge the overall scale of third-party game sales on Switch 2.

However, Nintendo dropped an interesting tidbit regarding physical games versus software sales. Digital sales for the first half of its fiscal year declined by 2.8% compared to the previous year. It seems players are more interested in buying true physical games they can actually own. Data from analyst firm Circana showed that more than 75% of the sales for Cyberpunk 2077 on Switch 2 were for the version with a physical game card. Developers CD Projekt Red previously said the game had ranked as one of the top-selling third-party games since launch.

Judging these sales numbers compared to the competition, it's not even a fair game. Xbox's hardware sales have been on a steady decline over the past year, and it likely won't change until we finally have a next-gen Xbox console in hand. Xbox raised the price of its consoles twice this year. Now, a standard Series X console with an optical disc drive costs $650, $150 more than at launch. Sony also hiked PlayStation 5 prices up to $550 for its base console. Like Nintendo, Sony's sales numbers have been on the rise, increasing by about 2% year over year. However, the PS5 sold around 19 million units by its first anniversary in 2021 and only reached around 7.8 million units shipped after the first five months. The Switch 2 is now set to outsell the PS5, and it doesn't even need a pandemic to keep people indoors to play its games.

Compared to consoles that cost over $500, Nintendo's Switch 2 has been explosive. Developers can't ignore the smaller console despite its specs seeming weaker than the competition. Those who worked on the ports for Cyberpunk 2077 and Star Wars Outlaws took the time to remove extraneous environmental detail and format their games to run well on Switch 2 despite the handheld's low power draw. The fact that the console has access to AI upscaling through Nvidia's DLSS has also proved a surprising boon. This allows the games to run at a lower resolution, then software recreates the scene at the native 1080p—or more when docked—while maintaining the performance.

The Switch 2 is giving the current landscape of gaming a reality check. Gearbox's Borderlands 4, a game that ran poorly on practically every system at launch, has been indefinitely delayed on Switch 2 in order to “deliver the best possible experience.” FromSoftware also delayed Elden Ring Tarnished Edition until 2026 to “allow for performance adjustments.” That's notable, considering that game ran poorly on handheld PCs like the Steam Deck until multiple updates made it more playable. Players don't necessarily want the best graphics possible. They just want to play their games at a stable frame rate. If that means redesigning a game to fit the power-sipping system, then so be it.

While Xbox and PlayStation are moving toward an open landscape where exclusive titles are nothing but a memory, Nintendo is undercutting everybody with a cheaper console and games you can't get anywhere else. Sure, Microsoft is willing to make the case that the console wars are over, but there's a fair argument to say Nintendo is winning the battle—and may just win the war as well.

A Japanese trade organization that includes heavy-hitting media creators like Studio Ghibli, Square Enix, and Bandai just announced that it sent a letter to OpenAI dated October 28 concerning alleged copyright violations.

The letter includes some observations about the similarity of Sora 2 videos to “Japanese content,” and issues two requests: It asks OpenAI not to use CODA content as training data without prior permission, and requests that OpenAI “responds sincerely” when a CODA member complains about copyright issues.

Notably absent are anything like “demands” of “immediate action,” or any sort of direct legal threats.

Sora 2, OpenAI's top-of-the line text-to-video model was released in late September, and anyone with an interest in AI watched in a mix of amazement and disgust as copyright hell was unleashed immediately. That included a great deal of content that looked a lot like Japanese media properties like Pokemon, Hideo Kojima's video game universes, and some unspecified Studio Ghibli production.

The framing of the alleged infringement is different in tone and approach than most American copyright claims. The similarity between Sora 2 and Japanese images and video “is the result of using Japanese content as machine learning data,” CODA says. When such content is the output, “CODA considers that the act of replication during the machine learning process may constitute copyright infringement.”

Japan's Copyright Act has a potentially relevant section on AI called Article 30-4 that may shed some light on CODA's logic, and its reason for starting with such a gentle approach to achieving redress—namely that Japan is a permissive legal environment for this sort of thing. According to a government fact sheet on the law, “exploitation for non-enjoyment purposes” such as “AI development or other forms of data analysis may, in principle, be allowed without the permission of the copyright holder.”

CODA, however, says that in Japan, “prior permission is generally required for the use of copyrighted works, and there is no system allowing one to avoid liability for infringement through subsequent objections.”

Scale is one of the biggest challenges currently facing the AI and robotics “revolution,” which is to say: How are we going to set up all the infrastructure needed for all these autonomous tools? One answer that you're about to hear a lot more often: swarms. While OpenAI and other major artificial intelligence firms continue to build multi-billion-dollar centralized data centers, a more decentralized approach is starting to take hold.

The Register recently highlighted one company taking the “swarm” approach to AI, and apparently producing some impressive results. Startup company Fortytwo published benchmarks that showed its approach of running small AI models on personal computers has managed to outperform some of the latest models in reasoning tests, claiming better outcomes than OpenAI's GPT-5, Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.1, and DeepSeek's R1.

The company's theory, which appears to be borne out in the results, is pretty simple: large AI models can get stuck in reasoning loops when given complex tasks. Smaller models, meanwhile, not only limit those reasoning death spirals but also provide multiple answers that can be ranked to find the best available answer. That can, in theory, be done by distributing the computing tasks across many devices rather than having it done in a single, central data center—not unlike how cryptocurrencies farm out the computing tasks for logging transactions to many different machines. Fittingly, the company is offering a crypto-based reward to folks who create specialized models and run them as part of the swarm.

Something similar is developing in the robotics realm, per the Wall Street Journal, which recently highlighted research that shows how robots could operate with a sort of colony-like communication that would allow them to work as a collective intelligence. The researchers suggested such a model could be used in settings like wildfire monitoring, where swarms of drones are tasked with identifying potential fires. If one drone were to fail, the others would identify that it went down and pick up the slack. Another example the researchers floated was developing microscopic robots that could work together to do things like deliver medication inside the human body or clear a blockage without requiring surgery. That latter example was apparently not theoretical: researchers used tiny magnetic robots to form a chain push as a unit to clear blockages in artificial blood vessels.

The basic idea behind the research is that these machines can be extremely simple but perform more complex tasks when operating together. Researchers completed an experiment in which a swarm of robots that was only able to perform three abilities—move forward, make sound, and listen to neighbors—was able to link together and navigate around obstacles in a way they couldn't do on their own. Apparently, the old idiom, “two heads are better than one,” applies to AI and robots, as well.

James Cameron has never made a Predator movie, but he's oddly tiptoed all around it. He, of course, directed one of the best sequels ever with Aliens, a franchise that has been connected to Predator for a while. With The Terminator, he helped make Arnold Schwarzenegger, who starred in the first Predator, one of the biggest stars ever. And, while Predator: Badlands was filming in New Zealand, Cameron was also in the country making his own Disney creature movie, Avatar: Fire and Ash. So when Cameron gets thanked in the credits of this week's Predator: Badlands, it isn't exactly a surprise, but the truth of it goes much deeper than all of that.

Speaking to io9 in Los Angeles this week, Badlands director Dan Trachtenberg explained why he thanked Cameron in the credits. “I consider myself very lucky that we were making movies at the same company,” Trachtenberg said. “We collaborate with the same executives, and he saw Prey and loved it. So when we were heading down to New Zealand to shoot, he invited me down to Wellington to hang out on [the Avatar 3] set and in his edit bay. And I divulged all my anxiety about making this movie and the methodology that we were doing, which was going to be very new for the franchise and certainly very new to me.”

Trachtenberg is primarily referring to the fact that Badlands flips the Predator franchise on its head by making a Yautja, the killer species at the center of the franchise, a hero. He is probably also referring to the fact that the character's face was completely created using CGI based on the facial expressions of its actor, Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi. It's a process Cameron is very well-versed in.

“Then we reconvened for dinner, and we drove separately,” Trachtenberg continues. “And when he sat down, he said, ‘I was thinking about what you're doing on the way over here and I think it's going to work.' And that was insane. He put so much wind in my sails to bring back up to Auckland and tell the whole crew.”

But that encouragement wasn't the only reason Trachtenberg decided to thank Cameron in the credits. After filming ended, he turned to the Oscar-winning director one more time.

“Then, just a few months ago, we had a cut movie of the movie that was almost done, not quite, and I wanted to get his input before we put the finishing touches on,” Trachtenberg said. “And he wrote a note back that said, ‘I have to be honest, when I first heard about what you're doing, I didn't think it was going to work, but holy crap, it really worked.' I don't know if he didn't remember the first thing or if he just knows exactly what someone in my shoes needs to hear when they hear it. So it was just amazing.”

We think lots of people are going to have Cameron's reaction to Predator: Badlands when it hits theaters later this week. Check back for more from Trachtenberg and on the film soon.

Mainstream DDR5 memory is already at least twice as expensive as it was in July.

DRAM prices are continuing to skyrocket thanks to exorbitant demands from the AI industry. CTEE reports that DRAM contract prices have increased by a whopping 171.8% year over year as of Q3 2025. In fact, DRAM prices have risen to the point that they are now outpacing the recent price increases of gold. ADATA chairman Chen Libai reportedly stated that Q4 of 2025 will mark the start of a major DRAM bull market, with 2026 likely to see severe DRAM shortages.

Significant memory price hikes have been a recurring theme in the industry during 2025. In late October, we reported that memory prices were increasing by up to 50% for Q4 2025, up from the 30% hike buyers had predicted earlier in the year. Going back to September, we covered NAND and DRAM contract prices rising by 15-20%. All of this (and more) has compounded into the whopping 171.8% year-over-year price increase we are now seeing in DRAM contract prices. These increases in pricing will take time to fully wash down to retail, but the price increases we already see on the market are only going to intensify over the coming months.

Despite server-grade RDIMM memory and HBM being the main attractions for hardware manufacturers building AI servers, the entire memory industry, including DDR5, is being affected by price increases. The problem for consumers is that memory manufacturers are shifting production prioritization toward datacenter-focused memory types and producing less consumer-focused DDR5 memory as a result.

Desktop memory prices reflect the severe memory shortages plaguing the industry. Just looking at Newegg, regular DDR5 memory prices are roughly double what they were just a few months ago. For example, Corsair's Vengeance RGB 2x16GB 6000MT/s dual-channel DDR5 kit is going for $183 on Newegg (at the time of writing). But if you check pricing history with PCPartPicker, that same kit cost just $91 in July.

DRAM isn't the only thing being affected by the insane price increases. NAND flash and even hard drive prices are increasing to meet the high demand from AI server manufacturers. Experts suggest that this pricing trend will continue for at least four years, which is the amount of time at least some companies have signed DRAM supply contracts with Samsung and SK Hynix.

If you own a GeForce RTX 5090 Founders Edition, do yourself a favor and don't take it apart.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


An extremely fortunate RTX 5090 owner who contacted Nvidia after breaking their GPU while trying to install a custom liquid cooling block has received a brand new card free of charge, despite voiding their warranty as a result of the daring modification.

The GeForce RTX 5090 Founders Edition is arguably among the best graphics cards available currently. However, the Blackwell flagship features a notably delicate design, which could pose risks if you damage one of the fragile internal components. It is somewhat refreshing to see a damaged GeForce RTX 5090 that is not caused by the melting of the 16-pin power connector from time to time. Although this individual was fortunate enough to have his graphics card with a broken connector replaced by Nvidia, this may be an exceptional case; nonetheless, it sets a notable precedent.

It is understandable if you have not observed the insides of a GeForce RTX 5090 Founders Edition. This graphics card, priced at $1,999, indeed represents a significant investment, and even for those with the financial capability, obtaining it can be challenging because it is hardly in stock. Nevertheless, an online search for the internal structure of the GeForce RTX 5090 Founders Edition reveals that it employs a modular design comprising three circuit boards. The primary board, which houses essential elements such as the GPU die and memory modules, is connected to a separate board containing the PCIe connector and to another board that accommodates the display connectors.

The main board communicates with the PCIe board via a delicate internal connector comprising approximately 128 pins. This design resembles connectors typically found within smartphones or tablets. The issue is that this connector is unavailable for purchase separately, making it irreplaceable. An owner of a GeForce RTX 5090 Founders Edition, along with NorthridgeFix, a specialized graphics card repair shop, encountered this problem firsthand. The shop's limited experience with Founders Edition models is understandable, given the rarity of such repairs, as few individuals would venture to open the elusive $1,999 graphics card.

The courageous user disassembled his GeForce RTX 5090 Founders Edition in order to install a custom water block aimed at liquid cooling the graphics card. The individual asserts that he handled the disconnection and reconnection of the PCIe board with care, refraining from exerting unnecessary force on the 128-pin connector. Nevertheless, NorthridgeFix subsequently identified that the user had bent one pin and damaged another, which was sufficient to render the GeForce RTX 5090 Founders Edition non-functional. The challenge associated with a modular design is that all exerted pressure from the PCIe board is transmitted to the 128-pin connector.

Having exhausted all options, the distressed owner contacted Nvidia to inquire whether the chip manufacturer would supply or sell a replacement board for the damaged graphics card. Although Nvidia confirmed that it did not sell replacement parts, the company agreed to replace the graphics card at no cost after the issue was escalated to a senior representative. Clearly, the owner was exceptionally fortunate, as the GeForce RTX 5090 Founders Edition's warranty was voided immediately upon disassembly. The position for liquid-cooling a graphics card varies depending on the partner. Certain brands permit it, provided that the graphics card remains undamaged during the procedure, whereas others explicitly prohibit it under the warranty terms.

If liquid cooling is included in your plans, it would be advisable to consider purchasing a custom GeForce RTX 5090, as aftermarket designs are generally more convenient. Nevertheless, there remains some risk, as with everything in life. Alternatively, you may opt for one of the GeForce RTX 5090 variants equipped with an AIO liquid cooler or a pre-installed water block, if you're willing to pay a premium. However, if you are among the fortunate owners of a GeForce RTX 5090 Founders Edition, it is highly recommended that you refrain from disassembling it. We suspect Nvidia may handle these situations on a case-by-case basis, so you may not have the same luck as the owner in this story.

Kirin 9000X CPU leads Huawei's new army of desktop PCs


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Huawei has introduced two new desktop systems in the Chinese domestic market. The Qingyun W515y and W585y leverage Huawei's homemade Kirin 9000X processor, complemented by the Tongxin UOS V20 or Galaxy Kylin V10 operating systems that aim to unseat Windows in the Chinese market.

The company has not officially unveiled the Kirin 9000X chip to the public yet. However, reports indicate that the octa-core, 16-thread processor, developed by HiSilicon, features a 2.5 GHz base clock. The Kirin 9000X succeeds the Kirin 9000C, which aligns with the recent release of the Qingyun W515y and W585y as direct replacements for the Qingyun W515x and W585x, respectively.

The original Kirin 9000, based on the Arm architecture, comprises three Cortex-A77 cores—one operating at 3.13 GHz and three at 2.54 GHz—and four Cortex-A55 cores at 2.05 GHz. Furthermore, the chip incorporates a 24-core Mali-G78 iGPU. Huawei has released multiple variants of the Kirin 9000 to accommodate various devices, including smartphones, laptops, and desktops. TSMC previously manufactured the Kirin 9000 for Huawei, using the 5nm+ FinFET EUV (N5) process node before the imposition of U.S. trade restrictions.

Huawei has not disclosed the complete specifications of the Qingyun W515y and W585y models. The manufacturer only states that these devices are equipped with quad-channel LPDDR5x memory, an unspecified SSD and hard drive, and offer the option to install an optical drive (DVD-RW). Both the Qingyun W515y and W585y have identical dimensions —11.5 x 3.7 x 12.4 inches (293 x 93 x 315.5 mm) —and weigh 7.9 pounds (3.6 kg) when the optical drive and hard drive are not included. They are the same size as their predecessors but just a bit lighter.

Huawei has been vigorously promoting its HarmonyOS operating system across its product range for some time. Consequently, it is surprising that neither of these utilizes this operating system. The previous Qingyun W515x and W585x didn't use HarmonyOS, either. Instead, these devices offer consumers a choice between UOS V20 (Unified Operating System), developed by UnionTech (Tongxin), and Galaxy Kylin V10. Both operating systems are based on Linux with their respective modifications.

The designs of the Qingyun W515y and W585y haven't changed from their predecessors. The case still features a front panel equipped with one USB Type-C port, three USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A ports, and a combined 3.5mm microphone and headphone jack. Conversely, the rear panel is furnished with four USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A ports, a Gigabit Ethernet port, a serial port, three 3.5mm audio connectors, one VGA port, and one HDMI port.

Huawei includes the K100 wired keyboard and M100 wired mouse with the Qingyun W515y and W585y models. The manufacturer has not disclosed the pricing or the availability dates for the new desktops.

Nancy A. Melville

 November 04, 2025  

PHOENIX — The opportunity to diagnose eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) when patients present to the emergency department (ED) with the classic symptom of esophageal food impaction (EFI) is commonly missed, with necessary biopsies provided at strikingly low rates, despite guideline recommendations, new research showed.

“This is the first study to assess the rate of biopsies at time of esophageal food impaction in a large, real-world dataset of community practices,” the authors explained in research presented at the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) 2025 Annual Scientific Meeting.

The findings underscore that “clinicians should remember to perform esophageal biopsies during endoscopy for esophageal food impaction.”

Research shows patients with EoE, a chronic and progressive type 2 inflammatory disease, have an average delay of 4 years before being diagnosed, with a delay of up to 10 years in about a third of cases. With those delays comes the likelihood of disease progression.

The latest guidelines from the ACG indicate that for diagnosis, “from a practical standpoint,” the preferred approach is to obtain at least two to four biopsies from at least two distinct esophageal areas, while targeting areas of visual inflammation.

However, prior evidence suggests that the biopsies are commonly not performed when patients present with the symptoms of EFI.

To further investigate the management of EFI during and after ED visits in a real-world setting, first author Walker D. Redd, MD, Center for Gastrointestinal Biology and Disease, UNC School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and colleagues conducted a retrospective cohort study of 2566 patients in a multistate gastrointestinal practice group at 143 care centers in seven US states.

The patients were treated for esophageal food or foreign body removal between 2018 and 2024.

Among them, 1434 patients received evaluation with esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), with 754 having no EGD and 378 receiving EGD for non-EFI.

The patients had a mean age of 63, with nearly 60% being older than 60 years, and 44.9% were women.

At the index EGD, only 19% had records of having esophageal biopsies. Among them, nearly half, 47%, were determined to have biopsy-confirmed EoE.

Of those who did not receive biopsies, only 7% had records of having received a follow-up EGD with an esophageal biopsy within 1 year, with 40% of those having EoE confirmed from a biopsy.

Among the remaining 93% of patients who had no record of such follow-up care within 1 year, 41% were lost to follow-up.

“We found that only about one fifth of patients had esophageal biopsies collected at the time of esophageal food impaction, which is similar to previous reports,” Redd said.

Overall, “esophageal biopsy rates at the time of esophageal food impaction remain low, and follow-up EGD with biopsy rates are also very low.”

Responding to a comment from the audience, Redd agreed that a limitation of the study was the scenario of patients from out of town being treated at an ED and then going back home, where their follow-up status may not be known.

Nevertheless, awareness of the low rates “represent an important opportunity to reduce the diagnostic delay and improve quality of care in EoE,” he said.

Commenting on the study, Danny Issa, MD, an interventional gastroenterologist at UCLA Health, agreed that the low rates of follow-up were troubling.

“Only 1 in 10 is a very low rate of follow-up endoscopy,” he told Medscape Medical News.

“These results show we need to encourage quality improvement initiatives to make sure those patients are followed up,” he said.

Furthermore, “additional studies are needed to better understand the barriers behind the lack of follow-up, which were not addressed fully in the study.”

Co-moderator Sita S. Chokhavatia, MD, a gastroenterologist at Valley Medical Group, in Paramus, New Jersey, added that “the point that needs to be made is that these patients need biopsies so you can diagnose and subsequently treat them.”

Redd reported having a consulting relationship with Sanofi. Issa reported having relationships with Boston Scientific and Eli Lilly. Chokhavatia had no disclosures to report.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Hello. I'm Dr JoAnn Manson, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital. I'd like to talk with you about a recent report in the journal Diabetes Care on intake of ultraprocessed foods (UPFs), weight gain, and risk of type 2 diabetes in a high-risk group of women with prior gestational diabetes. 

This was a large study. The investigators included more than 4000 women with a history of gestational diabetes from the Nurses' Health Study II, and there were more than 1000 incident cases of type 2 diabetes during long-term follow up. I'd like to acknowledge I'm one of the study researchers.

Type 2 diabetes is a major global health concern known to be strongly related to weight gain and diet, and UPFs are known to be associated with higher caloric intake, added sugar, saturated fats, sodium, other additives, and low dietary fiber. However, few previous studies have rigorously evaluated the relationship of UPFs with type 2 diabetes. 

Overall, the study documented a strong link between higher habitual UPF intake and both weight gain and elevated risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to low UPF intake. Women with low UPF intake had only about 1 lb of weight gain every 4 years, while women with higher UPF intake had steady weight gain during midlife of about three to four times that magnitude. The P value for difference between groups was very strong, less than .001.

Among the women with higher UPF intake, the risk of type 2 diabetes was increased by 20%-25%. Although not a high relative risk, this increase would translate into a substantial number of excess cases of type 2 diabetes, suggesting UPFs may be responsible for millions of the cases of diabetes in the US today. Elevated risk was seen in women with either high or low diet quality by the Alternative Healthy Eating Index, suggesting that higher UPF intake is linked to elevated type 2 diabetes risk, even if other aspects of the diet appear to be healthy. 

In conclusion, the study suggests that higher habitual intake of UPFs is contributing to both weight gain and type 2 diabetes risk. It will be important to include nutritional counseling to lower UPF intake, especially in high-risk groups. Additionally, more work is needed to change the US food supply to reduce the population's exposure to UPFs. ","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

Primary care physicians (PCPs) spent a median of 61.8 hours per week caring for patients, with part-time PCPs investing more time per patient than their full-time colleagues. Panels with older patients, those with greater medical complexity, or more Medicaid enrollees required more time from PCPs.

“[The] findings suggest that even as physicians seek to reduce their clinical effort to increase the sustainability of primary care jobs, their time expenditure per patient will likely not decrease in proportion,” the authors of the study wrote. “These findings can inform efforts to design primary care roles and adjust PCPs' panels to facilitate the sustainability of primary care careers,” they added.

This study was led by Lisa S. Rotenstein, MD, MBA, of the University of California at San Francisco and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. It was published online on October 21, 2025, in Annals of Internal Medicine.

This study focused on a single health system in the Northeast, thus limiting generalizability. The researchers lacked information about clinic staff and support, such as scribes or advanced practice providers. The analysis used data from 2021 and may have been influenced by effects of the pandemic.

This study received funding from the Physicians Foundation. One author reported receiving grants and contracts from, holding stocks of, and having other financial ties with multiple organizations, including the American Medical Association, FeelBetter, and Augmedix, Inc. Three other authors reported having similar ties with various organizations, including the Physicians Foundation.

This article was created using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process. Human editors reviewed this content before publication.

Average total compensation for female physicians in the US rose 2.9% in 2024 to about $318,000 (around $268,000 for specialists and $339,000 for primary care doctors). About 5 in 6 female doctors told Medscape in a survey that their pay either was flat or rose by no more than single digits, percentagewise. Only 43% of women said they felt fairly paid for their job demands.

Use of artificial intelligence (AI) platforms to answer typical questions about menopause and hormone therapy revealed low accuracy rates across four different large language models (LLMs), according to research presented at The Menopause Society 2025 Annual Meeting in Orlando, Florida.

Though the well-known ChatGPT 3.5 platform had the highest accuracy for typical patient questions, it still answered barely more than half of them correctly and only answered a third of typical clinician questions correctly. Google's Gemini platform performed even worse for questions that both patients and clinicians might ask.

“Generative artificial intelligence has rapidly advanced and is now explored in healthcare as a resource for both patient and clinician education,” Jana Karam, MD, postdoctoral research fellow at the Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida, told attendees. “As large language models are increasingly used to answer medical queries, evaluating their performance in providing accurate and reliable information is essential.”

Mindy Goldman, MD, the chief clinical officer at Midi Health and clinical professor emeritus at the University of California, San Francisco, was not involved with the study, but she told Medscape Medical News she was not surprised by the findings.

“Although most everyone in medicine now uses AI in some contexts, my understanding has been that one cannot always be sure of the accuracy of responses, and clinicians should always check the references,” Goldman said. “Even when using OpenEvidence, my usual way of assessing responses is to take the references and do a PubMed search for similar articles to confirm any findings.”

Goldman even conducted her own test by asking an LLM about its accuracy and received a response saying that “generative AI's accuracy is highly inconsistent and varies drastically by domain, task complexity, and the specific model used.” The response she received went on to mention that AI can generate “plausible but potentially inaccurate information” as well as hallucination, which refers to the wholesale creation of false, or “imaginary,” information.

For providers, “this study highlights the need to check the references and additional sources, such as The Menopause Society and ACOG [American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists], as well as doing their own PubMed searches before assuming something is true,” Goldman said.

It is important for providers to educate their patients about not assuming that whatever answers they are getting from AI are 100% correct, she said. They should also look to information provided by organizations like The Menopause Society and ACOG. “Just don't accept a simple response from an AI tool!”

Karam and her colleagues input 35 questions — 20 that patients might enter and 15 that clinicians would — into four different AI systems: the free ChatGPT 3.5, the paid ChatGPT 4.0, Gemini from Google, and OpenEvidence. For the test with OpenEvidence, the researchers only entered the clinician-level questions.

Then four expert reviewers, who did not know which LLM was used for each set of questions, evaluated the answers provided by each AI platform and compared how well those responses aligned with clinical guidelines. Responses considered fully correct received 2 points, those that were incomplete or missing key information received 1 point, and those that were incorrect received 0 points.

The researchers also assessed the readability of the patient-level responses using both word count and the Flesch Reading Ease score, which gives a rating from 0 to 100, with lower ratings indicating more complex responses that are less accessible for patients.

For patient-level questions, ChatGPT 3.5 showed the highest accuracy but still had only 55% of responses judged as correct. The paid ChatGPT 4.0, meanwhile, had only 40% correct answers, and Gemini performed most poorly, with less than a third of the answers (30%) deemed accurate.

Although the responses from all three LLMs had similar word counts (P = .12), readability differed significantly across the platforms. Though it was least accurate, Gemini scored best in readability, with a score of 38.9. ChatGPT 4.0, meanwhile, had the most complex responses, with a score of 26.5.

Gemini was even less accurate for clinician-level questions, answering only 20% of them correctly. And while ChatGPT 3.5 did best for patient-level questions, it only answered a third (33%) of clinician-level questions accurately. ChatGPT 4.0 did only slightly better, with 40% of the responses judged as accurate, the same rate as OpenEvidence. More than half the answers provided by OpenEvidence (53%) were incorrect, and both ChatGPT 3.5 and Gemini gave 40% incorrect answers. ChatGPT 4.0 was only slightly better, with a third (33%) of its responses being inaccurate.

The responses that were incomplete ranged from 7% to 40% across different platforms for both the patient-level and clinician-level questions. For example, Gemini did not have any incomplete responses for patient questions — all of them were either correct or incorrect — but it had just as many incomplete answers (40%) as correct ones for the clinician questions.

“Because this is all still relatively new, the models themselves are still learning,” Goldman said. “I would expect if this study were repeated in the near future, the findings might differ somewhat.”

Goldman also noted that the study is fairly small and that it makes the assumption that the expert reviewers would all provide answers similar to one another in their own responses to the questions used in the testing.

The research did not use external funding, and Karam reported having no disclosures. Goldman reported having no disclosures beyond her employment at Midi Health.

Wolfgang Paik

 November 04, 2025  

A man in his early fifties developed lingual and sublingual haematomas causing acute airway compromise that required an emergent tracheostomy. He had been on warfarin following prosthetic mitral valve replacement, with an increased dose to maintain a therapeutic international normalised ratio (INR). Clinicians should recognise that airway haematomas can occur in patients with supratherapeutic INR.

The case report by emergency physician Mohamed Darwish, internal medicine resident from the Department of Emergency Medicine, Tawam Hospital, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, and colleagues, documented the current guidelines on difficult airway management and the role of a multidisciplinary team in managing imminent airway obstruction.

The patient presented with a 2-day history of neck and intraoral swelling, drooling blood-stained saliva, and inability to speak. The symptoms gradually worsened over 2 days. He denied fever, chest pain, or dyspnoea. The patient was unable to lie flat. No further history could be obtained because of the patient's clinical condition.

One year prior to this presentation, he had been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation secondary to severe mitral stenosis, in addition to parathyroid adenoma.

He had elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, parathyroid hormone, and calcium. The patient underwent parathyroid adenoidectomy.

Three months before his index presentation, he underwent prosthetic mitral valve replacement and was started on warfarin 2 mg once daily, which was later increased to 5 mg daily to maintain a therapeutic INR range of 2.5-3.5.

Family, social, drug, travel, and allergy histories were unremarkable.

The patient's vital signs were measured upon admission. Oxygen saturation was 99% on room air, with a respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min. He was afebrile, with a heart rate of 135 beats/min and blood pressure of 119/75 mm Hg.

Inspection, auscultation, palpation, and percussion of the patient's body confirmed the medical history.

Multiple ecchymoses were observed in the suprasternal, neck, and submandibular areas. His mouth was partially open, his tongue was swollen and bruised, and he was drooling blood-stained saliva.

An x-ray showed diffuse soft tissue swelling of the floor of the mouth and epiglottic area, with near-complete occlusion of the hypopharynx.

A CT scan of the head and neck revealed extensive soft tissue swelling in the neck and compression of the oropharynx and hypopharynx.

His INR was 10 (normal range, ≤ 1.1); prothrombin time, 120 seconds (normal range, < 15); activated partial thromboplastin time, 148 seconds (normal range, < 40); platelet count, 508 × 10⁹/L (normal range, 150-400); and C-reactive protein, 141 mg/L (normal range, < 5).

A CT scan of the head and neck post-tracheostomy showed extensive soft tissue swelling of the neck with compression of the oropharynx and hypopharynx.

The ear, nose, and throat (ENT) team was consulted for impending airway obstruction. He received high-flow intranasal oxygen, intravenous crystalloids, and 10 mg of intravenous vitamin K. The patient was also administered 500 units of prothrombin complex concentrate.

The decision to perform an emergency tracheostomy was made in an interdisciplinary meeting.

Postoperatively, the neck swelling subsided over 10 days, and the tracheostomy was removed. He was restarted on warfarin 4 mg daily with bridging therapeutic enoxaparin.

“Existing guidelines emphasise a stepwise approach to difficult airway management. However, in cases of pharyngeal obstruction caused by a haematoma, it is advisable to proceed directly to a surgical airway,” wrote the authors.

Treating physicians should keep in mind that lingual, sublingual, and pharyngeal haematomas can complicate warfarin therapy. A multidisciplinary team of anaesthetists, ENT specialists, and emergency physicians should assess and make a predetermined decision on the best means of securing the airway in patients with airway haematoma.

Sleep patterns and eating habits can influence each other, but the link between these behaviors remains unclear. In a new JNeurosci paper, researchers led by William Ja, from the Herbert Wertheim UF Scripps Institute for Biomedical Innovation and Technology, used fruit flies (Drosophila) to explore how different kinds of sleep deprivation influence subsequent sleeping and feeding behavior. 

The researchers tested different sleep loss conditions and discovered that when fruit flies are sleep deprived to the point of energy loss, they compensate by feeding and sleeping more to restore their energy. When the flies experience sleep deprivation that doesn't deprive them of energy, they do not eat or sleep more. 

According to the authors, this work shows that energy deprivation from lack of sleep is linked to an urge to consume and sleep more later. Says Ja, ""I think our work adds credence to using less-intrusive, behavioral sleep interventions for alleviating eating and metabolic disorders. It is possible that by correcting sleep habits, cravings and eating habits will be easier to change. Our work also suggests that it might be hard to treat sleep or metabolic disorders in isolation-we may need to correct multiple behaviors, including sleep and eating habits, for successful therapeutic interventions.""

Researchers at Helmholtz Munich and the Technical University of Munich (TUM) have developed Nicheformer, the first large-scale foundation model that integrates single-cell analysis with spatial transcriptomics. Trained on more than 110 million cells, it offers a new way to study how cells are organized and interact in tissues – knowledge that is crucial for understanding health and disease.

Single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed biology by showing which genes are active in individual cells. However, this approach requires cells to be removed from their natural environment, erasing information about their position and neighbors. Spatial transcriptomics preserves this context but is technically more limited and harder to scale. Researchers have long lacked a way to study cell identity and tissue organization together.

Nicheformer overcomes this barrier by learning from both dissociated and spatial data. It can “transfer” spatial context back onto cells that were previously studied in isolation – essentially reconstructing how they fit into the bigger picture of a tissue. To make this possible, the research team created SpatialCorpus-110M, one of the largest curated resources of single-cell and spatial data to date. In their study published in Nature Methods, the model consistently outperformed existing approaches and showed that spatial patterns leave measurable traces in gene expression, even when cells are dissociated. Beyond performance, the researchers also explored interpretability, revealing that the model identifies biologically meaningful patterns in its internal layers – offering a new window into how AI learns from biology.

“With Nicheformer we can now transfer spatial information onto dissociated single-cell data at scale,” says Alejandro Tejada-Lapuerta, PhD student at Helmholtz Munich and TUM and co-first author of the study together with Anna Schaar. “This opens up many possibilities to study tissue organization and cellular neighborhoods without additional experiments.”

The study connects to the emerging idea of a “Virtual Cell”, a computational representation of how cells behave and interact within their native environments. While this concept is gaining momentum across biology and AI, previous models have largely treated cells as isolated entities, without reasoning their spatial relationships. Nicheformer is the first foundation model to learn directly from spatial organization, offering a way to reconstruct how cells sense and influence their neighbors. Beyond introducing this new capability, the researchers also present an entire suite of spatial benchmarking tasks that challenge future models to capture tissue architecture and collective cellular behavior – an essential step toward biologically realistic AI systems.

With Nicheformer we are taking the first steps toward building general-purpose AI models that represent cells in their natural context – the foundation of a Virtual Cell and Tissue model. Such models will transform how we study health and disease and could ultimately guide the development of new therapies.”

Prof. Fabian Theis, Director of the Computational Health Center at Helmholtz Munich and Professor at TUM

In their next project, the team aims to develop a “tissue foundation model” that also learns the physical relationships between cells. Such a model could help analyze tumor microenvironments and other complex structures in the body with direct relevance for diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and chronic inflammation.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Personalized pain care could greatly improve life for Australians with Parkinson's","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251103/Personalized-pain-care-could-greatly-improve-life-for-Australians-with-Parkinsone28099s.aspx","Tue, 04 Nov 2025 01:51:00 GMT","

Every 27 minutes, someone in Australia is diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Best known for its tremors, movement and balance issues, it also brings another, often overlooked burden – persistent pain.

Now, new research from the University of South Australia shows that many people with Parkinson's are struggling to manage their pain, with researchers calling for more individualized, multidisciplinary and empathetic care.

In two studies that assessed how people with Parkinson's manage pain and their experiences of pain care services, researchers found notable gaps in support, with many people resorting to trial-and-error strategies due to a lack of tailored clinical care.

In Australia, more than 65,000 people with Parkinson's disease experience persistent pain.

Lead researcher and UniSA PhD candidate Anthony Mezzini says we need to improve quality pain care for people with Parkinson's.

Pain is a prevalent and debilitating non-motor symptom of Parkinson's. It's one of the most troublesome issues in early-stage Parkinson's and a leading case of reduced quality of life.

People with Parkinson's told us that they often rely on trial-and-error approaches to manage their pain – not because they want to, but because they don't always have access to specialist pain support or tailored advice.

When pain care worked well, it was because healthcare professionals – especially allied health practitioners and Parkinson's nurses – took the time to listen, understand their experience, and tailor care to their specific needs.""

Anthony Mezzini, lead researcher and UniSA PhD candidate 

Researchers found that people's experiences of pain care were shaped by five key features: empathy and understanding, listening to needs and concerns, clear explanations, Parkinson's-specific knowledge, and individualised treatment.

However, these qualities were inconsistent across the health care system, with people reporting mixed feedback about the support they received from general practitioners and neurologists, and significant access barriers in rural and regional areas.

UniSA's researcher and Parkinson's Nurse Dr Sue Sharrad says improving pain management for people with Parkinson's requires both greater access to multidisciplinary care and enhanced training for healthcare providers.

""Embedding empathetic, individualized care into routine practice – and expanding access to Parkinson's nurses and allied health professionals – could make a real difference,"" Dr Sharrad says.

""Parkinson's specialist nurses and allied health professionals are often praised for their high level of care. We need to ensure that every person with Parkinson's receives pain care that's tailored, evidence-based, and delivered by professionals who understand the complex nature of Parkinson's pain.

""Pain is not just a symptom – it's a major factor that affects quality of life. By making care more personalized, coordinated, and compassionate, we can help people with Parkinson's live better, less painful lives.""

The research forms part of UniSA's ongoing work to improve quality of life for people living with neurological conditions.

The multidisciplinary research team includes Anthony Mezzini, Prof. Saravana Kumar, Dr. Sue Sharrad, Dr. Joanne Harmon, and Prof. Marion Eckert.

Interviews were conducted with a hundred doctors working in three “undoctored” areas between December 2022 and March 2024, across a range of doctors working in primary and secondary care, at different career stages, and with a range of demographic characteristics such as age, gender and ethnicity.

Undoctored areas are, by definition, those with ongoing issues in recruitment and retention of medical workforce and understanding the motivations for working in these locations is crucial for leveraging access to care in these locations.

By examining routes into a location and the impact of different life stages, we have described some of the rationales for working in these areas and reflected on how these decisions were often driven by compromises.”

Dr. Liz Brewster, Lead Author

Doctors presented complex, intertwined accounts of their rationale for working in these areas, which encompassed elements of family life, career satisfaction and place-characteristics.

For many participants, the driving factor in where they lived and worked was guided by those around them (e.g. family, partners, friends).

A medical consultant in the Northwest, Tegan, said: “I can't imagine me leaving. Personally, because I'm from this area, live in this area, my family are in this area, I wouldn't be planning to move anywhere else.”

A smaller number expressed their decision-making as being driven by the place itself, sometimes based on the attractions of scenery or outdoor opportunities.

Northern GP Yasmin said: “We both wanted to be somewhere more rural. And I took a locum job in Cumbria, and we ended up staying here. West Cumbria is an environment all of its own, so a lot of poverty, a lot of needs. It was challenging but on the doorstep of some of the world's most stunning scenery.”

However, a more common explanation for ending up working in an underdoctored area was because of career opportunities or other work-related attractions.

Another consultant in the Northwest, Xavier, said: “I deliberately picked [deprived town in northern England], because I could tell that it would allow me to do as much as possible of what I had trained to do to as high a level as I possibly could.”

Any choice based on one of these factors had potential consequences for the others. For some participants, these intertwined factors were aligned, which enabled them to settle in place, but for others, the factors were in conflict, and compromises had to be made.

Dr Brewster said: “Our research highlights some of the patterns where particular types of choices are made, which may be useful for considering future workforce planning.

“We found that for the doctors in our study, these expectations of mobility in early training often led to a desire to settle down in a place longer term. Location of medical school did not seem to be a deciding factor unless there were other affordances offered by the place.

“These findings raise questions about what might shift perceptions of places, what meaningful work looks like alongside a good quality of life, and what might be altered to encourage more doctors to work in particular areas.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Researchers use genetic engineering to create “product-ready” snakebite antivenom","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251104/Researchers-use-genetic-engineering-to-create-e2809cproduct-readye2809d-snakebite-antivenom.aspx","Tue, 04 Nov 2025 05:11:00 GMT","

An international team of researchers has used genetic engineering to create the first ever “product-ready” antivenom for snakes such as cobras and mambas.

The groundbreaking research is published in Nature by a team led by the Technical University of Denmark with The Scripps Research Institute, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Lancaster University, University of Northern Colorado, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, University of Bristol, University of Liverpool and Sophion Bioscience in Denmark.

This work shows how we developed the first “product-ready” recombinant snakebite antivenom that covers all the elapid species in Africa, including cobras, mambas, and rinkhals snakes, and which outperforms existing serum-derived antivenoms.”

Dr. Stefanie Menzies, Lancaster University

Because the antibodies are produced recombinantly - using genetic engineering - rather than harvested from immunized animals, future manufacturing does not depend on the use of animals. This enables scalable, ethical, and fully defined production with consistent quality and specificity. The hope is also, that it may also lead to more inexpensive antivenoms.

Snakebite is a neglected tropical disease (NTD), causing over 100,000 deaths annually and 300,000 disabilities each year, mostly in poor rural communities. Snakebite is one of the 21 NTDs recognized by the WHO, yet snakebite kills more people than the other 20 NTDs combined.

Current animal-derived antivenoms are lifesaving but flawed, showing batch variability, side effects, and limited snake species coverage. Creating an antivenom that works for all bites is extremely challenging because each snake species produces a different mix of toxins that attack nerves, blood, or tissues.

This study used genetic engineering to develop a recombinant nanobody-based antivenom, combining eight alpaca- and llama-derived nanobodies that neutralize seven toxin families across cobras, mambas, and rinkhals snakes – all African elapids. Elapids include well-known snakes such as cobras, mambas, coral snakes, and sea snakes.

The new therapy outperformed traditional serum antivenoms, preventing death and tissue damage in animal models while offering greater safety and consistency. The work validates a rational, modular platform, proving that a small, defined antibody mixture can replace complex animal-plasma products.

Dr Menzies said: “This research highlights the potential of biotechnology to develop antivenoms capable of neutralising toxins from multiple snake species. While clinical validation will be crucial, these findings represent an important step towards improving the treatment of snakebite.”

Next steps include optimizing large-scale production and clinical translation to make recombinant antivenoms accessible in the field.

Lead author Professor Andreas Hougaard Laustsen-Kiel from the Technical University of Denmark said: “It is fantastic to see how international collaboration between complementary research groups can help make a mission like this successful. I truly believe that team efforts like this can help transform snakebite envenoming therapy and bring better treatments to those victims most in need.”

Investigators from Mass General Brigham have developed a way to promote antitumor immunity by hijacking cellular machinery within cancer cells. The study demonstrated that inducing cancer cells to produce an immune-activating molecule led to reduced tumor growth in preclinical models. Results are published in PNAS.

Tumor cells comprise a significant proportion of the tumor microenvironment but are often under-utilized for immunotherapy. These findings highlight how tumor cells can be used to actively contribute to their own elimination.""

Natalie Artzi, PhD, corresponding author, researcher in the Mass General Brigham Department of Medicine

The presence of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in a cell's cytoplasm activates innate immune sensors that set off defense mechanisms against potential infections or cellular damage. One such sensor known as cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) detects cytosolic dsDNA and produces cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), which triggers the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway and leads to inflammatory immune responses. Furthermore, cGAMP can be transported out of the cell to activate neighbouring cells. While cancer cells can have high levels of cytosolic dsDNA, they often silence the cGAS-STING pathway - preventing their own activation and of bystander immune cells within the tumor microenvironment.

The research team exploited this innate mechanism within cancer cells to increase cGAMP production and thereby boost antitumor immunity. They found that cultured mouse melanoma cells upregulated cGAMP production when treated with dsDNA and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) carrying mRNA coding for cGAS. Immune cells showed signs of activation in response to elevated extracellular cGAMP levels produced by cancer cells. Similarly, treatment with cGAS LNPs activated surrounding immune cells, slowed tumor growth and improved overall survival in mouse models of aggressive melanoma. Combining this treatment with immune checkpoint blockade therapy further improved outcomes.

The authors suggest that this strategy could find future applications beyond cancer therapies, including in vaccines.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Understanding how the human brain responds to persuasive messages","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251104/Understanding-how-the-human-brain-responds-to-persuasive-messages.aspx","Tue, 04 Nov 2025 17:01:00 GMT","

An analysis of brain scans from 572 people reveals that activity in brain regions linked to reward and social processing can predict how effective messages will be.

Christin Scholz, Hang-Yee Chan, Emily Falk, and colleagues pooled data from 16 functional MRI studies to explore how the human brain responds to persuasive messages across various contexts, including public health campaigns, crowdfunding sites, movie trailers, and YouTube videos.

Across these diverse settings, the researchers found that effective messages activated brain regions involved in anticipating and receiving rewards, as well as those related to understanding other people's thoughts and feelings - a process known as mentalizing. These brain responses predicted not only which messages were preferred by participants who underwent brain scans, but also which messages were well received by broader audiences whose brains were not scanned. Brain activity associated with emotion predicted message effectiveness in large audiences but not in the individuals who were scanned.

These results suggest that certain aspects of our neural responses - such as whether a message prompts us to think about others or evokes emotion - may serve as universal indicators of persuasiveness across people and contexts. According to the authors, these insights deepen our understanding of what makes a message effective and could inspire new, broadly applicable persuasion strategies.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New research sheds light on E. coli spread in human communities","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251104/New-research-sheds-light-on-E-coli-spread-in-human-communities.aspx","Tue, 04 Nov 2025 13:31:00 GMT","

Bacteria that often cause urinary infections can spread as rapidly as swine flu. But E. coli that are resistant to several classes of antibiotics behave differently.

Escherichia coli (E. coli) are the most common cause of urinary tract and bloodstream infections worldwide. Many patients are therefore treated with antibiotics, but several variants of E. coli have become multi-drug resistant, which limits available treatment options and poses a major threat to public health.

For this reason, we wanted to understand how quickly new variants of E. coli spread in the human population. Our findings provide further impetus to decipher the fundamental genetic drivers of variation in transmissibility.""

Jukka Corander, Professor, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, UiO

Of note, he says that their research in this project is not considering those types of E. coli that cause a food poisoning, which typically results in symptoms like vomiting, diarrhoea and fever.

In recent years, we have had pandemics caused by viruses, such as covid and swine flu. The key tool of epidemiologists is to measure the transmissibility of a virus by a so called basic reproduction number, R0 for short. However, estimating R0 for bacterial pathogens is far more complicated and rarely done.

'Whereas viral infections will typically quickly lead to noticeable symptoms, opportunistic pathogenic bacteria such as E. coli can live even up to several months in the gut without causing any problems. It is only when they relocate to other parts of the body that are normally sterile, such as the bloodstream, that they cause an infection', says Corander.

In a new study published in Nature Communications, scientists have estimated the basic reproduction number (R0) of E. coli for the first time in a human community setting. R0 indicates how many other people an average individual will infect in a population with no immunity or infection control measures in place.

The researchers gathered data from many patient samples in Norway and the UK and studied three closely related genotypes of E. coli. These three types began spreading at the beginning of the 2000s and all belong to the same main type ST131, which was discovered in 2008, after it had already caused a worldwide pandemic. Because the ST131 causes such a large number of urinary and bloodstream infections, it has been a focus of international attention for scientists ever since it was first detected.

'What we found was that one type, ST131-A, spread as rapidly as certain viruses that have caused major outbreaks worldwide, such as the swine flu (H1N1). That was quite surprising, for whereas swine flu is transmitted via droplets in the air that are inhaled, E. coli does not spread in the same way. It uses a rather longer route via fecal-oral transmission, where bacteria in faeces get onto hands and surfaces, or contaminate food and drink', says Corander.

The two other variants of E. coli that the scientists investigated in the study, ST131-C1 and ST131-C2, are resistant to several classes of antibiotics and do therefore pose a bigger risk when causing infections. However, these two are not transmitted so easily between healthy individuals.

'This sounds like good news, but we detected some other challenges', says the professor.

The conclusion they came to was that the multi-drug resistant types of E. coli bacteria are more likely transmitted in hospitals and care homes where the frailest patients are. In these cases, an infection can pose a major threat to the survival, since several classes of antibiotics are no longer effective against these bacteria.

Corander explains that the multi-drug resistant genotypes included in the study seem to have become very hardy and adept at survival. They likely defy the disinfectants frequently used in health care facilities and have obviously adapted themselves genetically so that they can survive in such settings.

'The conclusion that the multi-drug resistant E. coli variants are not transmitted so easily amongst healthy people, would suggest that these bacteria are also further assisted by medication to survive the continuously ongoing battle between different types of E. coli. The hypothesis is that since hospitalized patients are typically given antibiotics and other medicines, these kill off the competing more susceptible bacteria, helping the multi-drug resistant E. coli to become dominant', he explains.

In the future, we risk not being able to treat infections caused by bacteria that have become resistant to critical antibiotics.

'So the next stage will be to find out why these variants of E. coli have developed such a capacity to survive under more selective pressure and the exact genetic reasons for their poorer transmissibility in the community settings. We also need fast and affordable ways for making rapid diagnosis and it will be important to find more ways of killing bacteria without resorting to use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. For example, in a number of new studies, researchers have tested the use of ultrasound on bacteria that hide behind biofilm - a thin layer of cellular material that they produce in order to protect themselves', says Corander.

Jukka Corander led the new study together with professor Pekka Marttinen from Aalto University in Finland.

People who work against their internal clock over a long period of time increase the risk of fatty liver. The correlations are complex, but one research team in Bochum is trying to get to the bottom of the issue.

""Artificial light is making us sick,"" says Professor Mustafa özçürümez. It allows us to turn night into day. We stay awake and eat late, sleep irregular hours, and mainly stay indoors. All of this derails our entire metabolism. In the worst case, if we disregard our internal clock for years or decades, this can lead to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (formerly non-alcoholic fatty liver disease). özçürümez and his team at the Knappschaft Kliniken Universitätsklinikum Bochum are working hard on tests to determine what exactly happens in the liver during this process. Rubin, the science magazine of Ruhr University Bochum, reports on the experiments.

Melatonin plays a key role in our day-night system. The hormone is released when it gets dark, making us tired and ensuring a relaxing slumber. One problem: Artificial blue light, such as that emitted by mobile phones, computers, televisions, and streetlights, make it difficult to achieve true darkness at night.

Even at ten lux, which is the light emitted at night during a full moon, it is more difficult for the body to produce melatonin.""

Professor Mustafa özçürümez

He is investigating many other factors that influence our internal clock, such as the role of genetic predisposition. What exactly happens in the body depending on how we structure our day is the subject of an ongoing study for which participants are being sought. In it, the team is investigating the biorhythms of test subjects with and without fatty liver disease. Blood pressure and body temperature are continuously recorded over a 24-hour period, and blood and saliva samples are taken at various times to measure, among other things, melatonin levels and other laboratory values. In addition, the participants fill out questionnaires about their activities, their sleeping habits, and their time spent indoors and outdoors. Afterwards, they wear light sensors for two weeks that precisely record how much light, both natural and artificial, reaches the eyes at what time of day.

In order to be able to break down the processes in the liver even more precisely, the team has developed an experimental setup in which they can artificially maintain pig livers outside the body in a nutrient solution, allowing them to study metabolic processes under controlled conditions.

New research that sheds light on how the immune system responds to serious eye infections is underway at Wayne State University, supported by a $2.3 million federal grant from the National Eye Institute of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

The four-year project, ""The Role of Eosinophils in Modulating the Corneal Response to Infection,"" is led by Dr. Elizabeth Berger, associate professor of ophthalmology, visual and anatomical sciences at the Wayne State University School of Medicine.

The study focuses on microbial keratitis, an infection of the cornea often caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterium that is difficult to treat due to its aggressive nature and resistance to many antibiotics. If not treated properly, it can lead to corneal scarring, perforation and blindness. Risk factors for microbial keratitis include eye trauma/injury, a weakened immune system, and improper use of contact lenses or eye drops.

While eosinophils are typically associated with allergy and asthma, there is growing evidence that they play a more nuanced role in infection and tissue repair. Our goal is to uncover how these cells influence the delicate balance between inflammation and healing in the cornea. By understanding their role, we hope to identify new therapeutic strategies that not only fight infection but also preserve vision.""

Dr. Elizabeth Berger, associate professor of ophthalmology, visual and anatomical sciences, Wayne State University School of Medicine

Eosinophils are types of white blood cell that have been largely overlooked in eye research. However, emerging studies suggest that they may help modulate inflammation and promote healing during corneal infection. At the same time, their persistence in the cornea could lead to extensive tissue destruction, including corneal opacity, stromal fibrosis and ulceration.

By characterizing the role of eosinophils within the corneal microenvironment, Berger's research aims to fill a critical gap in understanding eosinophil biology in ocular health. She hopes the findings will ultimately lead to novel cellular targets for treating infections and reducing associated complications, particularly in high-risk groups such as contact lens wearers and immunocompromised individuals.

 ""This NIH grant is an exciting addition to Dr. Berger's research portfolio that supports the important research that she is doing here at Wayne State University,"" said Dr. Ezemenari M. Obasi, vice president for research & innovation. ""Federal funding is critical to not only help with discovering new ways to treat health challenges, but also to train the next generation of researchers that are learning how to make discoveries that improve lives. I look forward to the important impact this research will have.""

The award number for this grant from the National Eye Institute of the National Institutes of Health is EY036697.

Inherited (germline) genetic data from patients and, in many cases, their parents

Tumor-specific (somatic) genetic changes

RNA sequencing data that shows which genes are active in the tumors

This study complements an earlier Kids First dataset on intracranial germ cell tumors, providing researchers with a more comprehensive view of how these cancers develop both within and outside the brain.

Both studies can be accessed through dbGaP under accession number phs002322.

WHEN: The extracranial germ cell tumors study is available now.

WHERE: Access and explore these new data through the Kids First Data Resource Portal. Instructions for requesting access to controlled data are available in the Kids First Help Center.

WHY: Through access to rich genomic data from children with cancer and congenital conditions, Kids First gives researchers the tools to spot disease drivers, develop new therapies, and uncover early diagnostic signals. This shared resource fuels collaboration and speeds progress toward better outcomes for children.

Both traditional and heated tobacco exposure, whether active or passive, were linked to intestinal permeability, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction, revealing that “smokeless” doesn't mean harmless.



Review: Tobacco Smoke Exposure and Oxidative Stress: The Role of Circulating Lipopolysaccharides in Heated and Conventional Products

In a recent article in the journal Antioxidants, researchers in Italy investigated the effects of tobacco smoke exposure on endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress. They found that adults and children who were exposed to tobacco smoke, either from heated tobacco products (HTPs) or conventional cigarettes, showed markers of oxidative stress and endotoxemia. Unlike electronic cigarettes, which vaporize nicotine-containing liquids, HTPs heat real tobacco at lower, non-combustion temperatures to generate a tobacco aerosol, making them chemically and biologically distinct from vapes.

Tobacco use remains a leading preventable cause of disease and death worldwide, mainly due to its connection to cardiovascular disease and cancer. Conventional cigarettes emit a range of toxic compounds that trigger systemic inflammation and chronic health problems.

Manufacturers promote HTPs as “safer alternatives,” claiming reduced harmful emissions because of lower heating temperatures. However, emerging data suggest that HTPs still cause oxidative stress and vascular injury similar to traditional cigarettes.

One central mechanism underlying tobacco-related harm is endotoxemia, characterized by elevated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels resulting from the presence of Gram-negative bacteria in the bloodstream. Smoking disrupts gut microbiota and weakens the intestinal barrier, allowing LPS to enter circulation. Smoke particles themselves may also carry endotoxins.

Circulating LPS activates Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), promoting inflammation and oxidative stress through the activation of NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2). This cascade links intestinal permeability with systemic oxidative stress and endothelial injury observed in both adults and children.

While the relationship between endotoxemia and vascular injury is correlational rather than causal, endotoxins may originate not only from the gut but also from the lungs or oral cavity. The reactive oxygen species generated through NOX2 activation impair endothelial function and heighten cardiovascular risk.

Children exposed to second-hand smoke may be particularly susceptible to oxidative and vascular damage. Comparative data on endotoxemia and NOX2 activation between adults and children exposed to either conventional or heated tobacco remain scarce. The Italian study aimed to fill these gaps by evaluating LPS levels and related oxidative and vascular biomarkers in these populations.

Researchers used a cross-sectional study design involving both children passively exposed to tobacco smoke and adults who actively used conventional cigarettes or HTPs. The primary goal was to measure serum LPS levels, with secondary analyses exploring oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and platelet activation.

The child cohort included 78 participants (aged 2–18): 26 passively exposed to HTPs, 26 to conventional cigarettes, and 26 unexposed controls. The adult cohort comprised 60 participants: 20 chronic HTP users, 20 smokers, and 20 non-smokers. All HTP users had previously smoked conventional cigarettes.

Fasting blood samples were collected to measure LPS, oxidative stress markers (NOX2-derived peptide, hydrogen peroxide, and isoprostanes), endothelial function (nitric oxide levels and flow-mediated dilation), and intestinal permeability (zonulin). Serum cotinine verified tobacco exposure.

Statistical testing involved ANOVA or non-parametric tests, correlation analysis, and multivariate regression adjusted for age, sex, BMI, and cotinine.

Both passive and active exposure to tobacco smoke, whether from HTPs or cigarettes, were linked to increased endotoxemia and intestinal permeability. Among children, serum LPS and zonulin were significantly elevated in both HTP- and cigarette-exposed groups compared with controls, showing no significant difference between exposure types.

LPS correlated positively with cotinine, zonulin, and platelet activation markers (sCD40L, P-selectin) and negatively with antioxidant capacity (HBA). Cotinine and zonulin emerged as independent predictors of LPS, reinforcing the connection between nicotine exposure, gut permeability, and oxidative stress.

In adults, both HTP users and cigarette smokers exhibited elevated LPS and zonulin levels compared to non-smokers, with no significant difference between the two groups. LPS correlated positively with zonulin, NOX2, hydrogen peroxide, and platelet activation markers but negatively with nitric oxide, evidence of endothelial dysfunction.

Regression models identified zonulin and nitric oxide bioavailability as key predictors of LPS, underscoring the intertwined nature of gut barrier disruption and vascular stress.

The findings demonstrate that both HTPs and cigarettes, whether actively used or passively inhaled, promote low-grade endotoxemia linked to oxidative stress and vascular impairment. This challenges industry claims that HTPs are meaningfully safer alternatives to traditional smoking.

This study provides the first evidence connecting HTPs and cigarette exposure to elevated circulating LPS and zonulin in both children and adults, implying intestinal barrier dysfunction and cardiovascular risk. While comprehensive in scope, the study's small sample size, lack of microbiome data, and absence of mechanistic experimentation limit the ability to draw causal conclusions. Prior cigarette use among HTP users could also confound results.

The authors further note that HTP aerosol temperatures can still reach levels sufficient for nicotine pyrolysis, potentially eliciting similar oxidative responses to those from combustible cigarettes. Nicotine exposure itself may exacerbate gut permeability and dysbiosis, amplifying oxidative stress.

In conclusion, both HTPs and conventional cigarettes impair gut barrier integrity and increase cardiovascular risk, refuting claims of reduced harm. The results highlight the urgent need for stronger tobacco control policies and targeted public health interventions to protect both smokers and those exposed to second-hand smoke.

Culture shock was at a minimum for Aidan Morris when he swapped Central Ohio for north-east England with a transfer from the Columbus Crew to Middlesbrough in 2024.

Sure, driving on the opposite side of the road took a minute to get used to, but Morris assimilated quickly into a quiet life outside the soccer pitch. On the field, too, Morris took to the Championship like a fish to water — for the most part. There was one glaring difference.

“Honestly, with there being no VAR, it's a mess,” Morris told The Athletic. “Guys can get away with so much cheap stuff, cheap hits and bad tackles. The players know they can. It's a culture of, ‘Hey, I'll hit the crap out of you on a set piece and there's no camera watching me.' Then if an English ref calls a foul, it's like, ‘That's soft.'”

The combative Morris doesn't feel out of place, mind you. He doesn't back down from challenges and it does nothing to dampen his competitive fire, but it sure took some getting used to.

“Once I realized the ref probably doesn't see anything and there's no check, all right, let's move on,” Morris said.

VAR has been part of the game his entire professional career in MLS, ditto for most of his 11 senior international caps with the U.S. men's national team. But while the on-field oversight may be different on a weekly basis now, there are elements of the overall style that also feel a little bit like home.

“Concacaf and (the EFL Championship) are pretty similar, honestly,” Morris added with a laugh, with a nod to the international region's extremely difficult playing environments, subpar pitches, passionate fans and opposition well-schooled in the dark arts.

While Morris is growing each week in his not-so-new surroundings, he hopes to add to his cap tally later this month as well, when Mauricio Pochettino's U.S. side hosts Paraguay and Uruguay to continue preparations for a home World Cup. The 23-year-old central midfielder impressed in his return to the national team last month, with a wait between caps – he started the first two games of the Pochettino era in October 2024 but hadn't been back since – just five days short of a year.

Morris started for the USMNT in an impressive draw against Ecuador after being left off the roster for two September friendlies and being overlooked for the Gold Cup in the summer and the Nations League finals in March.

“It was refreshing to be back, it was really nice,” said Morris, who added that he had been in touch with U.S. assistant coach Jesus Perez after the Gold Cup and “had a good conversation.”

“It was longer (to wait) than I would have liked, but that's life. It's not always perfect, not always what you want. I knew my time would come again.

“It's about having a mindset of not being a victim. What are you going to do when you get the chance? You can cry and complain for a little shy of a year about not getting called up, but you get your opportunity and if you're not great, what does that really mean? It felt good.”

Morris played 74 minutes in the 1-1 tie with Ecuador, then featured 14 minutes off the bench in a 2-1 win over Australia. Every chance counts, with Morris hellbent on making the World Cup squad.

“With the World Cup coming to America, I think about opportunity,” Morris said. “Opportunity to inspire the next generation and grow the support. Being over here, it's eye-opening. It'd be such a huge accolade to play in a World Cup on home soil. And, man, let's go out and win it. Why not?”

He may have ambitious plans for the U.S., but between camps, Morris is focused on putting his best foot forward for his club-level opportunity: Boro and its promotion push.

The midfielder quickly established himself as a crucial player under new head coach Rob Edwards, just as he was under Michael Carrick in his debut season.

Morris started 33 matches last year, a constant presence outside of a knee injury that kept him out of action for two months last winter. He's appeared in all 13 of Boro's league games this year, starting 11, and the club currently sits second in the table with 25 points, three off leader Coventry.

“Promotion is always a goal, but I hate talking about it, I do. It's so early, man,” Morris said. “This time last year, I was sure we were going to go up, so I just try to stay in the present. We have the players and the coaching staff to do it, but it's about replicating 46 solid performances throughout the year.”

Boro finished 10th last season – four points out of the playoff places – despite, at times, looking like one of the best teams in the league. This time around, Morris points to the basics.

“I'm all about tactics, being fancy a little bit, but you can't do that if you don't have the basics,” Morris said. “Last year we were so good, but we didn't live up to our expectations. The one thing that's different is the basics of football. The running. When we have success in games, there's a relation to the output we have in running, high-speed running, winning duels, everything else. That's the basics of football. Going back to those roots has led us in the right direction.”

Statistically, Morris is one of the most effective midfielders in the league. Among midfielders in the Championship, Morris ranks high in tackles (92nd percentile), pass completion (96th percentile), progressive passes (90th percentile) and expected assists (80th percentile), according to FBref.com.

The numbers emphasize what anyone can see when watching Boro's No. 18: A modern midfielder who can advance the ball with technical ability but still covers ground and wins tackles at a clip better than almost all of his contemporaries. Morris gives a nod to his time in MLS when discussing his recent success.

“I was in such a good environment in Columbus and I felt like I was playing at such a high level,” said Morris, who has previously credited former Crew teammate and retiring midfielder Darlington Nagbe as having been a major influence on his career. “The way Wilfried (Nancy) challenged me and the way we played, with everything he was asking me, I felt like I could go anywhere, any style, and have success.

“This year I just tried to go back to Aidan in Columbus – be a bit more free.”

The pass completion and tackling numbers aren't much different from his debut season, but a key difference is that he feels fresher now than he did last year. Morris joined Boro in the 2024 summer transfer window, which is halfway through an MLS season – and that particular season he started after a mere few-week break, owing to the Crew's 2023 MLS Cup triumph.

Essentially, this summer was Morris' first actual, genuine, offseason since the winter of 2022.

“The break was much-needed,” Morris said. “I felt like I was running on fumes a bit towards the end of the year. I basically just golfed, trained and hung out with family this summer. I was like an Olympic athlete, just trying any sport in the summer, too.”

Golf and tennis were the two activities of choice alongside his offseason training program, because while the break was necessary, that competitive fire still burned bright.

“We've been so impressed with him,” Edwards said at the end of September. “The time off he had over the summer will have helped, mentally as well as physically, and his performances have been of a very high level. He's working so hard for us.”

That competitive streak and work ethic fueled his early career. He spurned an overture from Canada, for which he had eligibility, in order to represent the U.S. He made that choice despite the path to playing time being much clearer with Canada. Tyler Adams (Bournemouth), Weston McKennie (Juventus), Johnny Cardoso (Atlético Madrid) and Tanner Tessmann (Lyon) are just a few of the players he's competing with for playing time on Pochettino's crowded central midfield depth chart.

That mindset fueled how quickly he settled with Boro and became one of the team's leaders this season, just his second in English soccer.

“I'm a winner, man,” Morris said, before displaying the side of him that appears to have meshed quite well with the culture of the anything-goes Championship.

“I love winning and I hate f***ing losing. I'll do anything I have to do to win. If it requires me to be a bad guy and pissing someone off? I'll do it.”

An expanded Under-17 Men's World Cup begins this week, the first of five consecutive competitions hosted in Qatar.

The field of 48 teams includes the United States, which called up a squad consisting primarily of players born in 2008. It's a very talented team heading to the Aspire Academy, which is set to host the competition over the next month.

Results are secondary in any youth World Cup, though a strong showing should help players bolster their resume to either contribute more in their MLS club or as a showcase to move abroad.

Luis Enrique is confident Paris Saint-Germain can bring an end to Bayern Munich's ""incredible"" 15-game winning run in Tuesday's Champions League showdown.

The German champions head for the French capital to face the last side to beat them in a competitive match, with PSG having emerged 2-0 winners when the sides met in a Club World Cup quarterfinal in Atlanta in July.

Head coach Luis Enrique told a press conference: ""If we talk about the results and their run in the last 15 games, it is incredible. We know how difficult it is to win three or four matches in a row, but if it is 15, that is just incredible. They deserve it.

""But as for the game tomorrow, it's at the Parc des Princes in front of our supporters with the atmosphere they create in every game and we are confident that we can improve our performance level to try to overcome their pressure.

""I think it will be similar to the game in the summer.""

Holders PSG and Bayern, who beat them in the 2020 final, head into the fourth round of matches occupying the top two places in the table, with the French side ahead on goals scored, although Vincent Kompany's team have won the last four Champions League games between the clubs without conceding.

Asked if the victors could be considered the best side in Europe, PSG midfielder Vitinha said: ""I think we can find out the answer tomorrow. It is better to do our talking on the pitch than here.""

Six-times winners Bayern's hopes could rest on to what extent England captain Harry Kane is able to add to his tally of 24 goals for club and country so far this season.

Vitinha said: ""Harry Kane is a great player, he is one of the best in the world. He is incredible. His figures over many seasons have been fantastic and he has started brilliantly this season with figures that are out of this world and difficult to achieve.

""But as we know, Bayern Munich are a strong team with many good players like Harry Kane.""

Veteran Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, however, is equally aware of the threat PSG pose to their hopes of victory.

The 39-year-old told a press conference: ""We're not afraid, we like playing against PSG. They're a strong side individually with a good coaching team. They deserved to win the Champions League.

""Their counter-attacking play is dangerous, as are their shots from distance. PSG have a lot of quality. We'll have to defend well and take advantage of the situations when we can hurt PSG.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Many would argue that Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League duel with Bayern Munich represents a meeting between Europe's two most potent forces. 

The European champions have had a few domestic difficulties at the start of 2025–26, but their brilliance has come to pass on the continental stage. Bayern, meanwhile, haven't got a single blemish on their record so far this term. 15 games, 15 wins. Imperious. 

While much is likely to change as the season evolves, it would be anything but far-fetched to suggest that these two are on a collision course to meet at a more critical juncture later on this season. 

Bayern had won four straight in this fixture before PSG won their Club World Cup semifinal 2–0 in the summer, and their upcoming duel promises to be the pick of the bunch.

There's another international break on the horizon, with PSG and Bayern Munich each having just one more league outing before the next interval.

Enrique's Parisiens make the trip south to Lyon in Ligue 1 on Sunday night, while Bayern visit the German capital to face Union Berlin on Saturday afternoon.

The two giants will then combine in a bid to make north London weep in Gameweek 5 of the league phase later this month, as Die Roten take on Arsenal and PSG host Tottenham Hotspur.

Fifa Club World Cup participants Auckland City FC have been targeted in a social media cyber attack. Photo / Photosport

An Auckland football club has been targeted in a cyber security attack, with hackers posting sexual images to its social media account.

Auckland City FC captured global headlines in June amid their participation as the only amateur club in the Fifa Club World Cup.


Now, the Sandringham-based club is making
headlines again – this time as the apparent victim of a cyber attack.


A series of images showing women in compromising positions have flooded one of the club's verified social media accounts with more than 100,000 followers.

The risque content is yet to be deleted.

An Auckland City FC spokesperson told the Herald the club had contacted the New Zealand Police before the images emerged as one of its clients had been targeted a few days earlier and it feared it would be the next victim.

“The hackers have kicked out all the administrators so we have no control... we can't remove anything,” they said.

The Herald understands the club has not been able to access its social media account for two days.

The club had reported the matter to New Zealand Football, the Oceania Football Confederation, Fifa and Netsafe – a government-appointed agency that investigates online abuse.

The spokesperson was unaware of when the issue would be resolved.

A statement posted to the club's website on Monday said the safety and integrity of its digital platforms are of “utmost importance”.

“We are taking all necessary steps to restore normal operations.

“We appreciate the patience and understanding of our supporters during this time. Further updates will be provided as appropriate.”

The Herald has approached police for comment.

Auckland City FC was in the news globally in June, although mostly because of their inferior performances in the Fifa Club World Cup.

After losing their opening match 10-0 to Bayern Munich, they were handed a 6-0 defeat at the hands of Benfica. Despite their struggles, there was a Cinderella ending with a 1-1 draw against Boca Juniors.

The club are currently fifth on the New Zealand National League ladder, with two wins from five matches and eight points.

The World Cup is likely to rule out Manchester United going on another mini tour as soon as the season ends next year – and could have a significant bearing on their pre-season plans, too.

Confidential understands there won't be time between the end of the campaign on May 24 and the start of the tournament in North America on June 11 for United to repeat their visit to Malaysia and Hong Kong after the final game of last season, which earned the club around £10million.

United must also decide if the five-week World Cup will whet the US public's appetite for more football or saturate the market, potentially impacting ticket sales. The World Cup final will take place on July 19 at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, and United are set to go on tour shortly afterwards. 

Sources stress that a decision has yet to be made and all options remain open, with the current focus on agreeing a mid-season friendly in Saudi Arabia which would compensate for the loss of the post-season trip.

But having toured the US for the last three summers in conjunction with a £60m-a-year sponsorship deal with Snapdragon, there is a feeling that United might be better off exploring the Asian market again next year.

As well as the desire to connect with their fans worldwide, the club are under pressure to generate more money from tours after missing out on £100m by failing to qualify for this season's Champions League, which also triggered a £10m penalty payable to kit suppliers adidas.

Ruben Amorim is taking a hands-on approach with Shea Lacey's progression towards the first team.

The 18-year-old is yet to make his first-team debut but, as previously detailed in this column, he is widely seen as the next one off the conveyor belt of academy talent.

Lacey featured in the Under 21s' first Premier League 2 defeat of the season on Friday night, but was not involved in the National League Cup against Rochdale last Tuesday as part of pre-planning from Amorim and director of football Jason Wilcox.

Confidential exclusively revealed how Amorim and Lacey have had numerous one-to-one conversations around the training ground in recent weeks, and his increasing involvement with the first-team group has seen a greater focus on mapping out his route to a debut.

‘It's important the games programme doesn't get in the way of his opportunities with the first team,' Under 21s boss Travis Binnion told us. ‘He's had a good few days with the first team (last week). We speak every day with the first team and get a week ahead in terms of what games he's going to play and what's right for him.

‘I saw Jason at Barnsley and you have conversations with him, (academy head) Stephen Torpey, Ruben and (assistant) Carlos (Fernandes) around who, where, when, what.

‘We are trying to get ahead of it by planning around the games, and you can't do that without the dialogue that we have.'

For Lacey, who is best suited playing in a right attacking midfielder role, the aim is to play a part with the first team when Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui head off to the Africa Cup of Nations, which begins on December 21.

Lisandro Martinez could join up with Argentina in the international break, even though he might not have made his comeback for United after a long-term knee injury.

Martinez is back in full training for the first time since rupturing an ACL in early February, but Amorim is being careful not to rush the 27-year-old defender.

It's understood that United feel Martinez's recovery may be better served by training at a high level with Argentina rather than staying at Carrington when most of his team-mates will be away on international duty and the remainder will be having some time off and lighter workouts.

Martinez was hoping to be back in action before the break but only has one more opportunity at Tottenham on Saturday, and Amorim hasn't been taking any chances.

‘He wants to go to this one, but he's not going to,' said the United boss before last weekend's draw at Nottingham Forest. ‘He's going to take time. He started training with us, but we had to change some things in the exercises for him. So slowly he's going to get better.'

Roma are expected to revive their interest in Joshua Zirkzee in the January transfer window as the Dutchman's career at United continues to stagnate.

Confidential revealed last month that Zirkzee would look to go out on loan in search of first-team football ahead of the World Cup if his playing time at United doesn't increase. The 24-year-old's five appearances this season have all come off the bench.

Roma made an unsuccessful bid to sign Zirkzee in the summer and are set to try again for the forward who made his name playing for Bologna in Serie A before moving to Old Trafford in a £36.5m deal.

Amorim admitted last week that he expects unsettled stars like Zirkzee and Kobbie Mainoo to ask to go out on loan.

United are set to resist calls to relax their season-ticket attendance rules after they were handed an ‘unprecedented' run of midweek and night-time kick-offs.

Amorim's side will not play a Premier League match at Old Trafford on a weekend for at least 105 days – between October 3 and January 17 – after several of their games were moved for TV coverage.

The Manchester United Supporters' Trust and the Fans' Forum have led calls for the club to change their regulations around minimum ticket usage, which state supporters must either attend the match themselves, transfer, donate or resell their ticket through official channels for 15 of the 19 home games or risk losing their seat for next season.

They argue it is unfair to keep the rule in place due to the ‘unprecedented inconvenience' caused by the fixture alterations, but Confidential understands United have no plans to make any changes.

Sources close to the matter believe fans have several options regarding their tickets for the rescheduled matches, none of which have been moved at less than 14 days' notice – the cut-off for fans to resell their seats back to the club.

United raised the scheduling issue with the Premier League but, just a week later, they confirmed the home clash with Newcastle would be the sole match on Boxing Day, with an 8pm kick-off.

The decision to train later on Fridays so the players aren't hanging around before travelling to away games led to Amorim bringing his pre-match press conference forward by 24 hours last week.

The United squad usually train at 11am, giving Amorim enough time to speak to the media before the 1.30pm deadline on Friday set by the Premier League. However, the schedule left the players at a loose end at the training ground, but with not enough time to go home.

Confidential understands the decision was taken to train later last Friday before Amorim and his squad left for the game against Nottingham Forest, and for the head coach to speak to the media on Thursday instead.

That will be repeated this week before United face Tottenham, but won't be an issue again for quite a while with the next away game on a Saturday not scheduled until Amorim's side travel to Arsenal in late January.

With Premier League 2 matches on pause until January and cup competitions now the sole focus for the Under 21s, coach Binnion and his staff have been eager to add more fixtures to the calendar.

Confidential can reveal they have done just that with two high-profile games that will see the United youngsters host South African side Kaizer Chiefs at Carrington, while also taking on Arsenal in a match at St George's Park.

The Kaizer Chiefs are travelling over for a mini-tour of the UK, with further games expected against Leeds United and QPR.

With games against Notts County in the EFL Trophy, Solihull Moors and Tamworth in the National League Cup, as well as Anderlecht and Borussia Dortmund in the Premier League International Cup, United are hopeful they can stay competitive in the league's mid-season break.

Binnion said: ‘Those fixtures plus the two added as a whole give us a fantastic games programme with a variety of experiences, which is what we want to make sure all the players are getting the opportunity that they need.'

It was noteworthy to see Under 18s manager Darren Fletcher on the touchline for the past two Under 21 matches – but it is not a long-term role.

Confidential understands Alan Wright, Binnion's usual assistant in that age-group, has been granted some time away to deal with a personal issue and Fletcher has stepped in.

What it did present on Friday night was the rare opportunity for Fletcher to coach one of his own sons, in this case Tyler. His other son Jack watched from the stands after picking up an injury in first-team training. He is expected to be back involved for Tuesday's match-up against Notts County.

Mary Earps has been in the news this week, and the former United goalkeeper will be the centre of attention again when she returns to Old Trafford with Paris Saint-Germain next Wednesday.

Earps' new book, and in particular the comments about her England rival Hannah Hampton and coach Sarina Wiegman, have caused quite a controversy.

Hampton helped the Lionesses win the Euros this summer after taking Earps' place, and the 32-year-old's replacement at United, Phallon Tullis-Joyce, has also seized her opportunity to become one of the most consistent performers for Marc Skinner's team.

United took a risk by letting Earps and another England star, Alessia Russo, leave in recent years but are reaping the benefits with a pool of emerging talent that is unbeaten in the WSL and playing in the main phase of the Champions League for the first time.

After beating Atletico Madrid and Valerenga, PSG represent the biggest test so far for United, who are looking forward to welcoming back Earps in front of a big crowd at Old Trafford.

Bruno Fernandes walked out for United's game against Brighton at Old Trafford with Paul Brand's two young sons as part of the club's farewell to their outgoing head of performance analysis.

Brand is leaving United after 12 years to become the football intelligence lead at UEFA. As well as his sons being mascots, Brand was presented with a framed No 12 shirt by Fernandes who gave a speech in front of players and staff at Carrington on Friday.

‘Manchester United is the biggest and best club in the world and they've especially shown that in the way they've treated me, and my family, in the past couple of weeks,' said Brand. ‘To see my boys walk out with Bruno at Old Trafford – followed by a simply incredible send-off from all players and staff – it's been the perfect ending to this chapter of my career, and life.'

There was another touching moment at the Brighton game when the Seagulls' players took it in turns to hug their former chef Will Carvalho on the way into Old Trafford. Carvalho, who left the south coast for United in the summer, had waited by the entrance to greet the visitors.","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","soccer"

Trent Alexander-Arnold was labelled a ""rat"" as his famous Liverpool mural was vandalised ahead of the defender's return to Anfield with Real Madrid. After two decades in red, Alexander-Arnold's exit in the summer left a bitter taste on Merseyside. Having joined Liverpool's academy at just six years old, he went on to make 354 appearances and lift every major club trophy available.

When Alexander-Arnold opted to leave on a free transfer to Real Madrid rather than extend his contract, that bond with the Kop was shattered. Liverpool, desperate not to lose their vice-captain for nothing, reluctantly agreed to a £10 million compensation deal that allowed him to join the Spanish giants ahead of the Club World Cup. The mural, which is painted on Sybil Road just a stone's throw from Anfield, remains a proud monument celebrating local success. The image was created by renowned French graffiti artist Akse and was commissioned by Liverpool podcast The Anfield Wrap. It carried a touching quote from the player himself: ""I'm just a normal lad from Liverpool whose dream has come true.""

Now, before his return to Merseyside, the mural has been defaced. The artwork, which was once a proud tribute to a local boy who lived the Liverpool dream, was splattered with the word ""RAT"" in white paint. Graffiti reading ""adios el rata"", Spanish for 'goodbye rat', was also emblazoned across the mural. Cleaners were seen on Tuesday morning, desperately scrubbing the wall to remove the abuse before the match gets underway in the evening. 

This isn't the first time the artwork has been targeted. In May, just before Alexander-Arnold's final Liverpool appearance, the same slur, ""rat"", appeared across the mural. Back in 2022, ahead of a Merseyside derby, vandals struck again, splashing blue paint across the street art in what appeared to be an Everton-inspired jibe. The mural also carried a message of solidarity, with a nod to Fans Supporting Foodbanks, a cause Alexander-Arnold championed throughout his time at Liverpool. 

Despite the backlash, Alexander-Arnold revealed that his feelings for Liverpool remain the same and no amount of hatred will change that. Speaking to Prime Video Sport ahead of Tuesday's Champions League clash, he said: ""When the draw was announced, I think everyone kind of knew it was going to happen, it was destined for that fixture to come. Obviously, they're a top team, so I knew at some point I'd end up going back there or playing against Liverpool. It's happening so soon. Mixed emotions. I think it'll be a very, very difficult game but one that I'm excited for.""

When pressed about the hostile reception he might face, the England international said: ""Whatever way I'm received is the decision of the fans. I'll always love the club, I'll always be a fan of the club. I'll always be thankful for the opportunities and the things we achieved together - they'll live with me forever. No matter what, my feelings won't change towards Liverpool. I've got memories there that will last me a lifetime and, no matter how I'm received, that won't change.""

Alexander-Arnold's participation on Tuesday night remains doubtful, however, with Real Madrid boss Xabi Alonso confirming that the defender is still on a strict rehabilitation plan after suffering a hamstring injury against Marseille in the Champions League, just 10 minutes into the match at the Santiago Bernabeu. According to The Athletic, the fixture falls during the seventh week of his eight-week recovery schedule.

Madrid's medical team are aware of the risks and has advised caution to avoid a recurrence. Alonso, too, is said to be reluctant to rush him back into the starting XI. Though he featured on the bench for both El Clasico and Madrid's weekend La Liga clash against Valencia, the England star has yet to play a single minute since returning to full training. Sources suggest he may be included among the substitutes for a late cameo, but a starting role appears 'highly unlikely'. With Dani Carvajal also sidelined, Alonso is expected to persist with Federico Valverde as a makeshift right-back; a tactical switch that has paid off handsomely in recent weeks.

""He's (Trent) available, and he didn't play the other day because of the circumstances of the match,"" Alonso said. ""We need him because he has tremendous quality. It's a new stage for him, and we have to help him and give him what he needs to perform because he's an exceptional player in this squad.""

For many Liverpool fans, watching Alexander-Arold line up, even on the bench, in Madrid white at Anfield will feel surreal. This was the lad from West Derby who grew up idolising Steven Gerrard, who lifted the Champions League and Premier League as one of their own. Now, the same fans who once sang his name may well jeer it. The atmosphere will be tense, and it remains to be seen if Alonso throws him into the mix.

EFL

Culture shock was at a minimum for Aidan Morris when he swapped Central Ohio for north-east England with a transfer from the Columbus Crew to Middlesbrough in 2024.

Sure, driving on the opposite side of the road took a minute to get used to, but Morris assimilated quickly into a quiet life outside the soccer pitch. On the field, too, Morris took to the Championship like a fish to water — for the most part. There was one glaring difference.

“Honestly, with there being no VAR, it's a mess,” Morris told The Athletic. “Guys can get away with so much cheap stuff, cheap hits and bad tackles. The players know they can. It's a culture of, ‘Hey, I'll hit the crap out of you on a set piece and there's no camera watching me.' Then if an English ref calls a foul, it's like, ‘That's soft.'”

The combative Morris doesn't feel out of place, mind you. He doesn't back down from challenges and it does nothing to dampen his competitive fire, but it sure took some getting used to.

“Once I realized the ref probably doesn't see anything and there's no check, all right, let's move on,” Morris said.

VAR has been part of the game his entire professional career in MLS, ditto for most of his 11 senior international caps with the U.S. men's national team. But while the on-field oversight may be different on a weekly basis now, there are elements of the overall style that also feel a little bit like home.

“Concacaf and (the EFL Championship) are pretty similar, honestly,” Morris added with a laugh, with a nod to the international region's extremely difficult playing environments, subpar pitches, passionate fans and opposition well-schooled in the dark arts.

While Morris is growing each week in his not-so-new surroundings, he hopes to add to his cap tally later this month as well, when Mauricio Pochettino's U.S. side hosts Paraguay and Uruguay to continue preparations for a home World Cup. The 23-year-old central midfielder impressed in his return to the national team last month, with a wait between caps – he started the first two games of the Pochettino era in October 2024 but hadn't been back since – just five days short of a year.

Morris started for the USMNT in an impressive draw against Ecuador after being left off the roster for two September friendlies and being overlooked for the Gold Cup in the summer and the Nations League finals in March.

“It was refreshing to be back, it was really nice,” said Morris, who added that he had been in touch with U.S. assistant coach Jesus Perez after the Gold Cup and “had a good conversation.”

“It was longer (to wait) than I would have liked, but that's life. It's not always perfect, not always what you want. I knew my time would come again.

“It's about having a mindset of not being a victim. What are you going to do when you get the chance? You can cry and complain for a little shy of a year about not getting called up, but you get your opportunity and if you're not great, what does that really mean? It felt good.”

Morris played 74 minutes in the 1-1 tie with Ecuador, then featured 14 minutes off the bench in a 2-1 win over Australia. Every chance counts, with Morris hellbent on making the World Cup squad.

“With the World Cup coming to America, I think about opportunity,” Morris said. “Opportunity to inspire the next generation and grow the support. Being over here, it's eye-opening. It'd be such a huge accolade to play in a World Cup on home soil. And, man, let's go out and win it. Why not?”

He may have ambitious plans for the U.S., but between camps, Morris is focused on putting his best foot forward for his club-level opportunity: Boro and its promotion push.

The midfielder quickly established himself as a crucial player under new head coach Rob Edwards, just as he was under Michael Carrick in his debut season.

Morris started 33 matches last year, a constant presence outside of a knee injury that kept him out of action for two months last winter. He's appeared in all 13 of Boro's league games this year, starting 11, and the club currently sits second in the table with 25 points, three off leader Coventry.

“Promotion is always a goal, but I hate talking about it, I do. It's so early, man,” Morris said. “This time last year, I was sure we were going to go up, so I just try to stay in the present. We have the players and the coaching staff to do it, but it's about replicating 46 solid performances throughout the year.”

Boro finished 10th last season – four points out of the playoff places – despite, at times, looking like one of the best teams in the league. This time around, Morris points to the basics.

“I'm all about tactics, being fancy a little bit, but you can't do that if you don't have the basics,” Morris said. “Last year we were so good, but we didn't live up to our expectations. The one thing that's different is the basics of football. The running. When we have success in games, there's a relation to the output we have in running, high-speed running, winning duels, everything else. That's the basics of football. Going back to those roots has led us in the right direction.”

Statistically, Morris is one of the most effective midfielders in the league. Among midfielders in the Championship, Morris ranks high in tackles (92nd percentile), pass completion (96th percentile), progressive passes (90th percentile) and expected assists (80th percentile), according to FBref.com.

The numbers emphasize what anyone can see when watching Boro's No. 18: A modern midfielder who can advance the ball with technical ability but still covers ground and wins tackles at a clip better than almost all of his contemporaries. Morris gives a nod to his time in MLS when discussing his recent success.

“I was in such a good environment in Columbus and I felt like I was playing at such a high level,” said Morris, who has previously credited former Crew teammate and retiring midfielder Darlington Nagbe as having been a major influence on his career. “The way Wilfried (Nancy) challenged me and the way we played, with everything he was asking me, I felt like I could go anywhere, any style, and have success.

“This year I just tried to go back to Aidan in Columbus – be a bit more free.”

The pass completion and tackling numbers aren't much different from his debut season, but a key difference is that he feels fresher now than he did last year. Morris joined Boro in the 2024 summer transfer window, which is halfway through an MLS season – and that particular season he started after a mere few-week break, owing to the Crew's 2023 MLS Cup triumph.

Essentially, this summer was Morris' first actual, genuine, offseason since the winter of 2022.

“The break was much-needed,” Morris said. “I felt like I was running on fumes a bit towards the end of the year. I basically just golfed, trained and hung out with family this summer. I was like an Olympic athlete, just trying any sport in the summer, too.”

Golf and tennis were the two activities of choice alongside his offseason training program, because while the break was necessary, that competitive fire still burned bright.

“We've been so impressed with him,” Edwards said at the end of September. “The time off he had over the summer will have helped, mentally as well as physically, and his performances have been of a very high level. He's working so hard for us.”

That competitive streak and work ethic fueled his early career. He spurned an overture from Canada, for which he had eligibility, in order to represent the U.S. He made that choice despite the path to playing time being much clearer with Canada. Tyler Adams (Bournemouth), Weston McKennie (Juventus), Johnny Cardoso (Atlético Madrid) and Tanner Tessmann (Lyon) are just a few of the players he's competing with for playing time on Pochettino's crowded central midfield depth chart.

That mindset fueled how quickly he settled with Boro and became one of the team's leaders this season, just his second in English soccer.

“I'm a winner, man,” Morris said, before displaying the side of him that appears to have meshed quite well with the culture of the anything-goes Championship.

“I love winning and I hate f***ing losing. I'll do anything I have to do to win. If it requires me to be a bad guy and pissing someone off? I'll do it.”

The Business of Women's Sports: Media Rights and Production, 12:30 ET Wednesday

Massachusetts lawmakers are analyzing how much the state will need to spend to help host the 2026 FIFA World Cup next summer, and the calculations have “triggered recent Senate talks with event organizers,” according to Ella Adams of MASSLIVE.com. Negotiations formally began yesterday on a $2.3B bill to wrap up fiscal year 2025 spending and the bill “could be the vehicle for a support outlay for the international event.” But the “question is how much is enough.” The House version of the bill allocated $10M in “connection with hosting the matches,” while the Senate's version “allocated no funding.” Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey requested $20M for a “reserve to support costs associated with the matches.” When asked why the Senate's bill did not allocate funding, Senate Ways and Means Committee Chair Michael Rodrigues said, “We really had no formal ask of us to allocate any money.” Rodrigues noted that a June spending law included $5M for a reserve for “publicly incurred transportation costs associated with the 2026 World Cup matches.” He said “the organizers of the World Cup had not had any conversations with the State Senate” leading up to the chamber's supplemental budget vote. Massachusetts Sen. Patrick O'Connor “withdrew a supplemental budget amendment” that would have provided $20M for hosting costs but warned that “the way we respond to this moment will have generational ripple effects” (MASSLIVE.com, 11/3).","{'href': 'https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com', 'title': 'Sports Business Journal'}","soccer"

Sarina Wiegman took over as England manager in September 2021

England have been drawn with Spain in their qualifying group for the 2027 Women's World Cup.

Spain beat the Lionesses in the 2023 World Cup final, but England gained revenge when they beat the world champions in the Euro 2025 final in July to retain their European title.

Iceland and Ukraine have also been placed in Group A3 alongside Sarina Wiegman's side.

Scotland have been paired with Belgium, Israel and Luxembourg in Group B4, while Wales will face the Czech Republic, Albania and Montenegro in Group B1.

Northern Ireland have been placed in Group B2 with Switzerland, Turkey and Malta, and the Republic of Ireland are in Group A2 alongside the Netherlands, France and Poland.

Qualifying for the World Cup, which will be held in Brazil, follows the same format as the Nations League and is split into three tiers.

Only the four group winners in League A will automatically qualify for the finals, with the remaining teams having to go through the play-offs for the remaining eight places.

The qualifiers will be played across six matchdays, on a home and away basis, during 2026, starting on 3 March and finishing on 9 June.

Uefa has been allocated 11 places for the 32-team 2027 World Cup. 

An additional European team could also qualify through Fifa's intercontinental play-offs.

Republic of Ireland's draw 'not the worst' - Ward

The biggest benefit of being in League A is that a play-off for the World Cup is guaranteed at the very least.

The four respective winners of the top-tier groups will automatically qualify for the finals in Brazil.

If England or the Republic of Ireland finish second or third they would face a League C side in their first-round play-off.

If they reached the next round, they would then play a side who finished fourth in their League A pool or a League B team for a place at the World Cup.

The bottom four sides in League A - who will be relegated for the next Nations League - face a first-round play-off against a side who finished second or third in League B.

The winners of those ties would then play the victors from the tie between the second and third-placed League A teams and the League C sides.

If Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are to earn a play-off they must avoid finishing bottom of their respective groups.

Not only would they be relegated to League C they would also miss out on a play-off.

On the other hand, if they were to win their respective groups, they would not only earn promotion to League A but their first-round play-off would be against a side who finished second or third in League B.

Likewise, if Scotland, Wales or NI were to finish second or third in their group they would face a side who finished in fourth place in League A or a League B group winner.

The second round of the play-offs are seeded, and if they progress they would likely face League A opposition.

So, in short, if Wales, Scotland or NI are to reach the World Cup they will likely have to defeat two strong nations along the way.

Cristiano Ronaldo says that he will consider retiring from football “soon” and will “probably cry” when the time comes for him to leave the game behind. 

The Portugal forward, who has a contract with Al-Nassr until 2027, has netted 952 goals in his career so far and wants to reach 1000 before he hangs up his boots.

Ronaldo also intends on playing at next summer's FIFA World Cup in North America in the hope of winning the one trophy that has thus far eluded him. Although the former Manchester United and Real Madrid star claims lifting the World Cup “is not a dream for me”.

“Winning one tournament doesn't prove you're one of the greatest players in history,” he said on Piers Morgan Uncensored. “It's just six or seven matches — that's not fair.”

Asked when he might consider retiring, Ronaldo replied: “Soon. But I think I will be prepared.

“It will be tough, of course. I probably will cry, yes… I'm an open person. It will be very, very difficult, yes.

“But, I have prepared my future since [the age of] 25, 26, 27 years old. I think I will be capable to support that pressure.”

Premier League giants Manchester City have renewed their ""serious interest"" in Valencia wonderkid Jaume Dura, according to reports in Spain. The attacking midfielder rejected a move to the Etihad last year to sign a new contract until 2027 but Pep Guardiola's City are now making ""another attempt"" to sign the Spain U17 international star. 

City have renewed their transfer interest in 17-year-old Dura according to a report from Spanish outlet Cadena Cope.

The Premier League champions are reportedly making ""another attempt"" to secure the teenager, despite having been rejected by the player in favour of a new contract at the Mestalla just last year.

City are said to be tracking the Spain U17 international's progress intensely, indicating a ""serious interest"" in the player. The report claims Pep Guardiola's side ""don't miss a single detail of his progress"" as he develops within the Valencia academy setup.

It is not specified whether City are plotting a move for the January transfer window or will wait until the summer of 2026. However, their intent to return to the table for a player who previously turned them down signals a strong belief in his potential. Valencia, the report notes, must ""be cautious"" of the renewed efforts from the English giants.

Dura, who will not turn 18 until May 2026, is a product of the prolific Valencia academy. He currently captains the club's Valencia U19s squad and operates primarily as an attacking midfielder, though he has not yet made his senior debut for the Spanish side.

Despite his age, Dura is already a fixture in the Spanish youth setup, having earned 10 caps and scored one goal for the Spain U17 national team. His technical skill and vision have marked him as one of the most promising talents in his age group in Spain, attracting attention from several major European clubs, with City's interest being the most persistent.

City's current interest is a continuation of a previous pursuit. The club attempted to sign Dura in 2024, before the young midfielder had committed his future to Valencia.

However, in a significant show of faith in his boyhood club, Dura rejected the advances from the Etihad in favour of signing a new long-term contract. That deal, signed last year, theoretically secures him at Valencia until 30 June 2027. This contract gives Valencia a strong negotiating position but has clearly not deterred City from making a second push for his signature.

City's renewed pursuit comes as Durà is working his way back to full fitness. The teenager suffered an injury that forced him to spend a significant spell on the sidelines, interrupting his development.

He is reportedly starting to rediscover his best form this year. His current focus is on ""regaining his rhythm and intensity,"" which is necessary for him to consistently complete full 90-minute matches and make the anticipated step up towards the senior setup.

Any potential deal for City is complicated by post-Brexit transfer regulations. As Dura is a non-UK citizen, he cannot be signed by an English club until he turns 18.

Dura's 18th birthday is not until May 15. This means that even if City were to successfully ""agree terms with Valencia"" in January or during the summer 2025 window, the player would not be eligible to formally arrive in the UK until the summer 2026 transfer window opens.

This gives Valencia a short-term shield against losing the player immediately, but the persistent interest from a club of City's stature places significant pressure on the La Liga side as they attempt to map out a long-term future for their prized academy asset.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Revealed: Virgil van Dijk contacted Real Madrid over free transfer before signing Liverpool contract as Spanish giants opted to pursue Dean Huijsen instead","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/revealed-virgil-van-dijk-contacted-real-madrid-free-transfer-liverpool-deal-spanish-giants-dean-huijsen-instead/blt7d54b0fb7d11c677","Tue, 04 Nov 2025 11:27:11 GMT","

Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk was in contact with Real Madrid through his entourage last season regarding a potential free transfer in the summer. Van Dijk rejected offers from several other clubs, including Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal, as his priority was to join Madrid. However, the Spanish side chose to look elsewhere and instead signed defender Dean Huijsen.

According to Spanish outlet AS, Madrid were reportedly unconvinced about signing Van Dijk due to concerns over his age and the serious ACL injury he suffered in 2020. Despite having a contract extension offer on the table from Liverpool last season, the Dutch defender was keen on a move to the Spanish giants and offered his services to them through his agents. Van Dijk's desire to join Madrid saw him turn down approaches from several other clubs, with Al-Hilal offering a lucrative deal.

However, Madrid ultimately choose instead to sign young defender Huijsen from Bournemouth as part of their long-term defensive planning. With Madrid no longer an option, Van Dijk eventually accepted Liverpool's two-year contract extension. 

Van Dijk joined Liverpool from Southampton in January 2018 for what was then a world record fee for a defender. Since his arrival, Van Dijk has made 333 appearances for the club, scoring 30 goals. The Dutchman has been a key figure under both Jurgen Klopp and current manager Arne Slot, helping Liverpool secure major trophies including two Premier League titles, one Champions League and one FA Cup. His influence goes beyond team success, as he redefined the role of a modern defender with his consistency, positioning, and reading of the game.

Individually, Van Dijk was named UEFA Men's Player of the Year for the 2018–19 season and finished second to Lionel Messi in the 2019 Ballon d'Or rankings, recognition of his outstanding performances and immense contribution to Liverpool's rise to the top of European football.

Liverpool have struggled for consistency this season despite retaining Van Dijk and investing heavily during a major summer transfer window. The Reds began the campaign strongly, winning seven consecutive matches across all competitions, but their form has since dipped sharply. A series of poor performances has raised concerns about the team's balance and defensive stability. Their slump was highlighted by six defeats in seven games, including four consecutive losses to Crystal Palace, Galatasaray, Chelsea and Manchester United in the Premier League and Champions League. The disappointing run has cast doubt over Liverpool's ability to challenge for major honours despite their strong start and talented squad.

The recent results have drawn criticism towards Van Dijk, with United legend Wayne Rooney questioning his leadership. Rooney said: ""Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah, they've signed new deals but I don't think they've really led that team this season.

""I think body language tells you a lot, and I think we're seeing slightly different body language from the two of them. They are the top two players in that team and if their body language is not right, that affects everyone else.""

Meanwhile, Real Madrid sit comfortably at the top of La Liga, five points clear of rivals Barcelona following their recent 2-1 victory in El Clasico. Xabi Alonso's side have been in exceptional form, losing only once across all competitions this season. Their success has been built on a solid defensive foundation, boasting the best record in La Liga with just 10 goals conceded. The signing of Huijsen has proven instrumental, further strengthening Madrid's already resilient backline.

Liverpool will host Real Madrid at Anfield in the Champions League today. Van Dijk will be aiming to help turn Liverpool's form around and silence his critics with a big performance and a crucial win over Madrid.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Lothar Matthaus has downplayed Paris Saint-Germain's chances against Bayern Munich ahead of their Champions League showdown in Paris. The German legend insists PSG lack a difference-maker like Harry Kane and claims Bayern's unbeaten run under Vincent Kompany makes them the true favourites to win the heavyweight clash at the Parc des Princes.

Ahead of the high-powered Champions League meeting at the Parc des Princes, former Bayern captain Matthaus has tipped the German giants to come out on top. Writing in his Sky Sport column, the World Cup winner explained why he rates Vincent Kompany's side higher than Luis Enrique's PSG, even though the French side are the defending European champions.

Matthaus pointed to Bayern's incredible momentum as a key factor in his analysis. “It was a demonstration of power. With a commanding 3-0 victory against Leverkusen, FC Bayern celebrated their 15th win in 15 games,” he wrote. “Many things need to come together for the opponents to leave the pitch as non-losers against Bayern.”The Bavarians have been unstoppable this season, boasting 15 consecutive wins in all competitions and sitting top of the Bundesliga as well as the Champions League league phase, after PSG with a goal difference and a perfect record. PSG, meanwhile, have dropped points in Ligue 1, showing signs of vulnerability despite their European success last season.

In his analysis, Matthaus argued that the French champions lack the world-class spine that makes Bayern so complete. “Paris Saint-Germain will be the next test. On Tuesday, two top European teams will face each other. Both have high quality in their squads, but Paris doesn't have a Kane, a [Michael] Olise, a [Joshua] Kimmich, or a [Manuel] Neuer,” he explained.

The Bayern icon praised boss Kompany's team as well-oiled, balanced unit capable of adapting to different opponents. “The French team has played exceptionally well in the Champions League so far, but they've already dropped points and lost a game in Ligue 1. Bayern are a well-oiled machine, they're in a flow. Therefore, I say: Paris is definitely not the favourites,” Matthaus insisted.

His comments underline how much respect Bayern's current form commands across Europe. Kompany's men have combined attacking flair with defensive stability, scoring 54 goals in just 15 matches this season while conceding only 12.

Bayern travel to Paris with confidence and depth, as the German champions are unbeaten in all competitions this season and have swept aside Chelsea, Pafos, and Club Brugge in the Champions League with an aggregate score of 12-2. Their attacking trio, English superstar Kane, French hero Olise and Colombian international Luis Diaz, were rested at the weekend in the first half and are expected to start in Paris, giving Kompany his full attacking arsenal.

Matthsus' prediction reflected that confidence, “I'm predicting a 2-1 victory for Bayern,” he declared. “PSG are the reigning Champions League winners, but Bayern have won their last four matches in the competition. The players are aware of that.”

He further pointed out that even in the Club World Cup defeat to PSG earlier this year, Bayern “were more dominant, had more scoring opportunities, and were the better team.” That loss, Matthaus believes, only fueled their current winning streak.

Matthaus also commented on PSG's superstar Ousmane Dembele's recent Ballon d'Or triumph, offering a measured perspective on the Frenchman's resurgence. “Ousmane Dembele may have won the Ballon d'Or, but there were other players who performed just as well over the course of the year, but whose clubs were eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals,” he wrote.

While acknowledging Dembele's maturity and contribution since joining PSG, Matthaus maintained that individual brilliance alone might not be enough to tip the scales against a dominant Bayern side. The winger has only recently returned from a thigh injury and could feature off the bench in Paris, giving Luis Enrique a much-needed creative spark.

Still, Matthaus' broader point is that PSG's success relies heavily on moments of individual flair, whereas Bayern function as a collective. His remarks reflect a growing narrative that Enrique's team, while star-studded, lacks the structural discipline that defines Kompany's Bayern.

Tuesday night's clash at the Parc des Princes will likely decide who stays at top of the Champions League league phase, with both teams currently level on nine points. PSG have a slight edge on goals scored, but Bayern's record-breaking start under Kompany has made them Europe's team to beat.

For Enrique, this fixture is about reaffirming PSG's status as reigning champions amid questions about consistency and reliance on individual brilliance. Dembele's potential cameo could inject creativity, but Matthaus' words serve as a warning, the French giants must prove they can match Bayern's collective intensity.

Cristiano Ronaldo has claimed that Manchester United still ""don't have a structure"" in an explosive new interview with Piers Morgan. The former Red Devils striker has also ruled Ruben Amorim's side out of the 2025-26 Premier League title race, insisting that the Portuguese coach cannot perform ""miracles"" with the current resources at his disposal at Old Trafford.

“For me, I'm sad because of the club, that's one of the most important clubs in the world, and a club that I still have in my heart because of the obvious reasons,” Ronaldo began in the combined sit-down for his YouTube channel and Talk TV's Piers Morgan Uncensored.

“You have to follow with the intelligent people, smart people, to create a base for the future as Manchester United have [done] so many years ago. Nicky Butt, Gary [Neville], Roy Keane, Beckham, they became big players but they had youth. So Manchester United right now, they don't have a structure.  

“I hope that changes in the future, present/future, because the potential of the club, it's amazing. It's one of the most important clubs of the century.”

The Al-Nassr and Portugal superstar added on the task Amorim is facing: “He is doing his best, what else can he do? He can't do miracles. We say in Portugal, ‘Miracles is only in Fatima'... And he's not gonna do miracles. They have good players but they don't have, some of them, in mind what Manchester United is.”

When pressed on United's chances of clinching the Premier League title this season, Ronaldo replied: ""It's not possible for them to win the Premier League. They're already too many points behind Arsenal.""



Ronaldo believes that the club's hierarchy is still failing to take the steps needed to bring United back to the top of the game, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS now overseeing football operations and the Glazer family taking a backseat as majority owners.

He added: “Of course (it hurts me) because I played there for so many years. I win the Champions League, the Golden Ball, I win like 12, 13, 14 titles there, so as I say and I repeat, Manchester United is still in my heart. I love that club. But we have to all be honest and look for ourselves and say we are not in a good path, so they need to change, and it is not only about the coach and players, in my opinion.”



Ronaldo made similar claims in his last interview with Morgan back in November 2022, which led to the abrupt end of his second spell at United. The former Real Madrid and Juventus frontman criticised the club's younger players and accused then-manager Erik ten Hag of disrespecting him, while also expressing his belief that the club had stagnated after the departure of legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson in 2013.

""At United, the progress was zero, in my opinion,"" Ronaldo said. ""To compare with Real Madrid and even Juventus, that they follow the rest of the world, so the technology, especially in terms of training, nutrition and conditioning, eat properly and to recover better than before - surprised me.

""Manchester right now to compare with that club, I think it's behind in my opinion, which is something that surprised me. A club with this dimension should be the top of the tree in my opinion and they are not, unfortunately. They are not in that level. But I hope the next years they can reach to be in a top level.

""I don't know what's going on but since Sir Alex Ferguson left I saw no evolution in the club, the progress was zero.""

Ronaldo's latest comments are unlikely to go down well with Ratcliffe. The INEOS chairman has delivered state-of-the-art new training facilities and invested heavily in new players to take the team forward, with a £170 million ($222m) summer splurge seeing the likes of Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo all arrive at Old Trafford. 

United are seemingly making progress on the pitch as a result, having picked up 10 points from a possible 12 across their last four league games to move into the top eight. However, Ronaldo's thoughts on a title bid are a fair reflection of the eight-point gap between his old club and Arsenal.

Amorim will aim to deliver another positive result when the Red Devils travel to Tottenham on Saturday. Ronaldo, meanwhile, is due back in Saudi Pro League action for Al-Nassr against Neom on the same day.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Rap superstar Snoop Dogg remains interested in acquiring a stake at Celtic. He is already part of the ownership group at Swansea City, alongside Ballon d'Or winner Luka Modric, but wants to expand his sporting portfolio. That could mean pumping funds into Scottish giants, while also helping to bring Ange Postecoglou back to Parkhead for a second spell at the helm.

Snoop has become one of Celtic's most famous celebrity fans, with the American music icon having pledged allegiance to the Hoops since being gifted a replica shirt in 2005. He has spoken on a regular basis since then of wanting to establish professional ties with the club.

The 54-year-old is prepared to put his money where his mouth is, with some of his reported £120 million ($157m) fortune being put aside for business ventures. Snoop has claimed that he would be willing to help bolster transfer budgets in Glasgow, while also restoring stability in the dugout.

He is not looking for a hands-on role, having already accepted a position behind the scenes at Swansea, and feels that he could help to keep spirits high within a demanding fan base. The ball is now in Celtic's court when it comes to discussing investment opportunities.

Snoop has told the Daily Record when asked about a potential role at ‘Paradise': “I don't know about coach, but as an investor sure. Investing in Celtic is something I have talked about in the past and if the opportunity was right I would be down for it. Celtic is a huge club and fans want to see the best players playing in this great stadium. All the owners have got to do is ask.”

Asked for his reaction to Brendan Rodgers' shock resignation, with Hoops legend Martin O'Neill currently back at the helm on an interim basis, Snoop added - with a nod being offered to an Australian coach who is out of work after leaving Premier League side Nottingham Forest: “I love sport, and in sport players leave, coaches leave, and you move on.

“You got to give Martin O'Neill big respect, he is coming back when we need him. I think you got to bring Ange back, the club are gonna do what they are gonna do but the fans would love to see him back.”

Snoop has previously said of following Hollywood superstar Ryan Reynolds into the ownership business, with the Deadpool actor enjoying considerable success at Wrexham: “I love what Ryan has done with Wrexham – it's just a great story. Investing in a sports team has been something I have been looking at for a long time – if the chance came to invest in Celtic, I would be crazy not to take a look at it. I have watched so much soccer in Europe but I have never seen fans like the Celtic fans. There is something so special about them.

“There is a reason why their fans are talked about across Europe – the best players and coaches in the world tell you there is nowhere like Celtic Park and I want to be a part of that. Their mascot is a hound – you couldn't make that up. Snoop Dogg becomes Hoopy the Hound – that's gotta be a match made in heaven. The headlines write themselves.”

He has also joked about opening a burger van outside the Hoops' stadium, saying: “I would love to bring a pop-up burger [van] to a sports stadium to show fans that food at stadiums can be good. It's got to be Celtic Park, man.

“The secret to a good burger is the love in the preparation. The ground beef has got to be mixed with some secret spices, then add a good-quality cheese and some maple-cured bacon. The Celtic fans are gonna love it, and to make sure they are just right, Snoop is going to be serving them himself.”

After seeing Celtic claim a morale-boosting Scottish League Cup semi-final victory over Old Firm rivals Rangers last time out, Snoop Dogg will be among the interested observers when O'Neill's side return to Europa League action on Thursday against Midtjylland.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Cristiano Ronaldo 'not even close' to Lionel Messi! Inter Miami superstar's GOAT status validated by ex-Atletico Madrid & Chelsea star who stayed in to watch all of his Barcelona games","https://www.goal.com/en-in/lists/cristiano-ronaldo-not-even-close-lionel-messi-inter-miami-goat-status-validated-ex-atletico-madrid-chelsea-star/bltebf9b8aab9af57ec","Tue, 04 Nov 2025 12:04:51 GMT","

Cristiano Ronaldo has been told that his GOAT battle with eternal rival Lionel Messi is “not even close”, with former Brazil international Filipe Luis explaining why Argentina's iconic No.10 is the undisputed greatest of all-time. The ex-Atletico Madrid and Chelsea defender has faced plenty of iconic figures down the years, and considers Messi to be the pick of the bunch.

Portuguese superstar Ronaldo has reiterated, during another interview with Piers Morgan, that he considers himself to be the best. He has previously ranked himself above the likes of Messi, Pele and Diego Maradona. CR7 admits that he has no desire to be “humble” and will always back his own cause.

Many others are happy to side with him, but plenty more see themselves very much in the Messi camp. Luis, who is now coaching in his homeland with Flamengo, is prepared to overlook illustrious countrymen such as Pele when it comes to naming his GOAT.

For him, nobody can compete with Messi when it comes to moments of match-altering magic. That skill set has allowed the mercurial playmaker to win eight Ballons d'Or, the World Cup and a collection of honours that make him the most decorated player in history.

Asked to pick between the brightest stars to ever illuminate a football pitch, Luis told The Obi One podcast: “I played against Messi, he's number one, for sure. By far, there's no one even close. He's the player I most enjoyed watching; I watched every Barcelona game. And you know, every game, every team, every coach who faced Barcelona, their concern was doing something to stop him.

“Like I said, I watched every Barcelona game, even when I was playing for Deportivo La Coruna or Atletico. If Barcelona was playing on Saturday at eight o'clock at night, I couldn't go out to eat; I had to stay and watch the game because Messi was going to be playing. And when I played against him, my only thought was to stop him, to think about how to try and beat him. He's the player who challenged me the most.”

Luis added: “Of all the players I've seen - because I didn't see Pele or Maradona - I didn't feel anything like that with Messi. He's number one, I'm a huge fan of his, and I think he's brought a lot of joy to many people with his style of play.”

While Luis has enjoyed watching Messi down the years, he always tried to make life difficult for the Argentine when lining up against him. That meant putting respect to one side, with the Brazilian making a point of never asking for a post-game shirt swap with his fellow South American.

The former full-back has previously said of trying to get the better of Messi in competitive action: “I always hit him to stop him; he never reproached me. I admire him a lot for his football. I never asked him for his shirt, because I come onto the pitch to win, not to say that I played against him.”

He added, when hammering home his GOAT message: “Everybody knows what I think of him. The only thing you have to do is enjoy him because I don't know how many years or decades will pass before another player like him appears. He should always win the Ballon d'Or.”

Luis is 40 years of age - six months younger than Portuguese superstar Ronaldo - and hung up his boots in 2023. CR7 is still going strong with Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr, as he chases down 1,000 career goals, while Messi has committed to a new three-year contract with MLS outfit Inter Miami that will keep him in the United States through 2028.

Both all-time greats are expected to grace next summer's World Cup finals, with Luis set to be among the interested observers as a global audience readies itself for one final battle between iconic career-long adversaries.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Real Madrid centre-back Dean Huijsen has leapt to the defence of his team-mate Vinicius Junior following his temper tantrum during the 2-1 win over Barcelona. The Brazilian was enraged after being asked to come off in the second half by Xabi Alonso, with the reaction drawing significant backlash. Huijsen, however, blamed the media for making a ""huge fuss"" over the incident.

Vinicius Junior looked like a man possessed – a player on a mission – as he tore down the left flank in Real Madrid's 2-1 triumph over Barcelona in last month's El Clasico. From the opening whistle, the Brazilian was relentless, dazzling with his trademark pace and footwork, and keeping the Catalan defence constantly on edge. But despite his effervescent performance that caused the visitors considerable damage, the night took an unexpected turn. In the 72nd minute, head coach Xabi Alonso called for Rodrygo, signalling for Vini to come off.

“Me? Me? Mister, mister! Me?"" Vini Jr. shouted in disbelief as Alonso prepared the substitution. The Madrid No.7 trudged off visibly frustrated before heading straight for the tunnel. ""Always me... I am leaving the team. I am leaving. It's better I leave,"" he reportedly muttered, bypassing the bench and disappearing from view.

His reaction drew immediate attention – and criticism. Cameras captured his visible anger, sparking debate across Spain and in media about the winger's temperament and professionalism. Vini did eventually return to the dugout before the final whistle, but the incident had already made headlines.

Huijsen spoke to reporters on Monday and provided his thoughts on his team-mate's Clasico substitution controversy. The former Bournemouth centre-back criticised the media for overexaggerating things. His words acted as a shield for his Real Madrid team-mate, who is often in the spotlight for reasons not related to his game.

""There's a lot written in the press, and you've made a huge fuss over something that wasn't such a big deal,"" said Huijsen. ""He apologised, which I thought was fair, but he's an incredible teammate, a really good guy, and it's no big deal. These things happen in football.""

In the aftermath of his controversial temper tantrum, the Brazil international issued a public apology, but did not mention Alonso in the statement. ""Today I want to apologise to all the Madridistas for my reaction when I was substituted in the Clasico,"" he wrote. ""Just as I have already done in person during today's training, I also want to apologise again to my teammates, the club, and the president. Sometimes passion gets the better of me because I always want to win and help my team. My competitive character stems from the love I feel for this club and everything it represents. I promise to keep fighting every second for the good of Real Madrid, as I have done since the first day.""

As if his theatrics after being substituted weren't enough, the apology drew further criticism for not including his head coach in the statement. However, Alonso was quick to quash any speculation, insisting that everything had been cleared up after a frank, face-to-face conversation with the attacker.

""Has Vinicius apologised to me? We had a meeting with everyone on Wednesday, and Vinicius was impeccable,"" the Madrid manager told reporters last weekend. ""He spoke honestly and was very good. For me, that settles the matter.

""It was a very valuable, very positive statement. He demonstrated his honesty; he spoke from the heart. What he said was the most important thing, and I was very satisfied. I've already said it, I was very proud and the matter was settled on Wednesday itself. We trained well yesterday, I see Vini doing well, and we're all in the same boat and rowing in the same direction.""

Real Madrid face a formidable test on Tuesday evening as they prepare to take on Liverpool at Anfield in the Champions League. The clash marks the highly anticipated return of Trent Alexander-Arnold to his boyhood club, just months after leaving on a free transfer to join Los Blancos. It will also be a homecoming of sorts for Alonso, who spent five memorable seasons with the Reds during his playing career.

As for Vini, few opponents seem to inspire him quite like Liverpool. The 25-year-old has faced the Premier League giants five times, scoring as many goals – including a stunning brace at Anfield that spearheaded Madrid's remarkable 5–2 comeback victory in the Champions League knockouts after falling two goals behind in the 2022–23 season. 

Tuesday's encounter also provides Alonso's men an opportunity to avenge last season's 2-0 loss at the same venue. Madrid will be licking their lips at the prospect, as Arne Slot's men have lost six of their last eight games.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The ATP and TikTok have officially launched the Tennis Creator Network, a global creator initiative that debuts this week at the 2025 Nitto ATP Finals.

The programme brings together a selection of dynamic TikTok creators from around the world, giving them unprecedented behind-the-scenes access to the season finale in Turin and opportunities to connect fans with the sport's biggest stars.

Connecting Creators, Players and Fans
Representing the home markets of the nine ATP Masters 1000 tournaments, Tennis Creator Network members include leading voices such as @kanoaigarashi (Indian Wells), @jeannemm5 (Monte-Carlo), @rafaelescrig (Madrid), @sespo, @luca.campolunghi (Rome), @yuvirayz (Toronto/Montreal), @gabesco (Cincinnati), @之昊Will (Shanghai) and @championsdudigital (Paris), among others, with Miami to be confirmed. Collectively, the group reaches more than 25 million followers across TikTok.

Each creator will follow a stacked itinerary across the Nitto ATP Finals, from media day and red-carpet moments, to practice sessions and post-match content opportunities – interacting with players and capturing the Finals through their unique storytelling lens.

A Fresh Take on the Nitto ATP Finals
Throughout the week, creators will share content across both their own channels, ATP Tour's official platforms and tournament platforms, including TikTok takeovers and mini TikTok documentaries. The initiative aims to deliver authentic, creator-driven perspectives that bring new energy to tennis storytelling and connect with emerging audiences.

“These creators represent a global community who live and breathe digital culture,” said David Slade, Senior Director, Digital Strategy and Content, ATP Tour. “By opening up access at one of our sport's biggest stages, we're creating a powerful bridge between tennis and the next generation of fans.”

“We're thrilled to see the ATP Tennis Creator Network come to life,” added Rollo Goldstaub, TikTok's Global Head of Sports Partnerships. “With players like Alcaraz, Shelton, and Djokovic, and a community of dedicated fans on the platform, tennis is booming on TikTok. Together with ATP, this program empowers creators to show the sport from their perspective and help make it an even greater part of global culture.”

Continuing the Journey
The Tennis Creator Network forms a core part of the ATP and TikTok's ongoing global content partnership, launched in August 2025. It builds on ATP's creative storytelling initiatives, including collaborations with Overtime and the “It All Adds Up” brand campaign, developed with Wieden+Kennedy.

In 2026, the selected creators will also collaborate with the ATP Masters 1000 tournaments they represent, extending the storytelling and connecting with fans across the ATP Tour season. Additional creators will collaborate with select ATP 500 and ATP 250 tournaments to maximize promotion across the full ATP ecosystem.

Ordinarily, a loss like the one Swiatek suffered to Rybakina—a 3-6, 6-1, 6-0 thumping in which she actually lost 15 of the last 18 games despite having a one-set lead—would be enough to leave a player reeling.But instead of lingering on what went wrong against the Kazakh, and the 36 unforced errors that she hit in sets two and three combined, Swiatek said she had no plans to ""over-analyze"" just her second loss from a set up this year.As a veteran of the WTA Finals in her fifth appearance, Swiatek knows she doesn't have the time to—because ""the tournament still goes on.""I'll just focus on playing Amanda next, and that's it,"" the 2023 WTA Finals champion said.

28 times F1 drivers made incredible saves

F1 drivers guess the circuit, but they can only see the steering wheel!

From Lando Norris' disco ball to Alex Albon's Miami orange, special edition helmets have been everywhere this season. We take a look back at where it all began.

Special edition helmets are a relatively recent addition to Formula 1's long history – what was once purely a piece of safety equipment has become a canvas for drivers and sponsors to showcase their personality, pay tribute or have some fun.

The journey from mostly plain lids to glittering, custom-designed works of art has been full of experimentation over the years – including design restrictions and concerns about the weight of paint. Here's a look back at how special edition helmets became a beloved part of F1's identity.

In a sport where faces are hidden behind visors, a helmet has always been a driver's signature. For decades, drivers such as James Hunt, John Surtees, and Sir Jackie Stewart kept the same design throughout their entire careers.

Back then, helmets weren't nearly as protective, and their main purpose besides safety was for the fans and marshals to tell the drivers apart. Even so, individuality did shine through at time. Hunt's name stretched boldly along the side of his helmet, while Stewart paid homage to his Scottish roots with a tartan band around the crown.

Few designs, however, are as instantly recognisable as Ayrton Senna's yellow, green and blue helmet – an enduring Brazilian icon that once fetched nearly $1million at auction.

For much of F1's history, a helmet represented the driver but not the team. That began to change when Michael Schumacher moved to Ferrari and decided to replace the German flag on his helmet with a bright red design to match his new team's colours. This marked the start of a new, more flexible era, one where creativity and collaboration between driver and team became the norm.

Helmet designs don't come out of thin air, and every special edition helmet begins with an artist – both a designer and engineer. Two of the best-known names in this profession are Jens Munser and Mad 56.

Munser, the mastermind behind Schumacher's Ferrari-era lids, Lando Norris's squiggles, and Sebastian Vettel's 2024 Imola Senna tribute explained to Motorsport Tech Magazine: “The process hasn't changed much – we still start with sketches – but we now use printed stickers for logos instead of hand-painting every detail. We've improved the pigments to make paint lighter and more resistant to stones. Michael always wanted to save weight, even if it meant a less glossy finish.”

Mad 56, real name Massimo Dante, works primarily with Red Bull and has also collaborated with Williams driver Alex Albon for more than a decade. Though artists have creative freedom, they must balance aesthetics with FIA regulations and sponsor requirements, which is a tricky art in itself.

In 2015, the FIA announced that drivers must stick to a single helmet design during the entire season, as some of the constantly changing special edition helmets were starting to cause issues. The reasoning was simple: fans, commentators, and race officials were struggling to recognise who was behind the wheel!

The move came after a series of increasingly elaborate designs – most famously Sebastian Vettel's 2012 LED-lit helmet in Singapore. The glowing design, while undoubtedly eye-catching, raised safety concerns and was quickly banned, prompting the FIA to rethink just how far helmet customisation should go.

The single-design regulation remained in place until 2020, but even under those tighter rules, creativity didn't disappear. Designers found clever ways to work within the limits – for example, Lewis Hamilton's special edition Mexico City Grand Prix helmets, or Sebastian Vettel subtly changing the colour of his usual helmet at the Monaco Grand Prix in 2017.

When the ban was lifted at the beginning of 2020, a wave of colour and creativity returned to the grid – and it hasn't slowed down since.

Today, F1's grid is awash with one-off designs, each a reflection of personality, heritage, and at times – humour. Amongst his many iconic special edition helmets, Lewis Hamilton collaborated with Japanese artist Hajime Sorayama for a chrome-inspired Japanese Grand Prix special in 2023, Valtteri Bottas once ran a pre-season helmet modelled on his own head, and Albon's designs often pay tribute to his pets and his home nation of Thailand.

The 2025 season has also seen plenty of eye-catching limited-edition designs – from bold artistic statements to heartfelt tributes. One standout came from the youngest designer yet, Thea, the young fan behind Carlos Sainz's unofficial mascot “Sparkles” the unicorn. The Spaniard wore Thea's design as a sticker on his helmet for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix and, while it was meant as a one-off, after his P3 finish in Baku, there's no wonder he'd want his new mascot to stick around!

While some special edition helmet designs are lighthearted, others carry deep personal significance. One of the best examples of this was Romain Grosjean during his return to the Haas garage for Pirelli tyre testing, where he was finally able to wear the helmet that his children had designed for his planned 2020 farewell race – one he never got to use after his terrifying Bahrain crash.

It was a very sentimental helmet and reaffirmed that special edition helmets can be much more than just a marketing tool when they hold such meaning for the drivers.

28 times F1 drivers made incredible saves

F1 drivers guess the circuit, but they can only see the steering wheel!

As Gabriel Bortoleto enters into the final races of his rookie season in F1, Kick Sauber boss Jonathan Wheatley has given his take on what has particularly impressed him about the Brazilian.

Jonathan Wheatley has admitted that Gabriel Bortoleto's level of maturity is the aspect of the rookie's debut season in F1 that he has been “most surprised by”.

Bortoleto was one of a number of new arrivals on the grid this year, having made the step up from his championship-winning F2 campaign to join Kick Sauber in the top echelon.

Since then the Brazilian has gone on to score points on five occasions – which included a career-best P6 in Hungary – while his partnership with veteran team mate Nico Hulkenberg has so far brought home a total of 60 points.

Sharing his thoughts on Bortoleto's rookie season during the Mexico City Grand Prix weekend, Wheatley – who joined Kick Sauber as the squad's new Team Principal in April – praised the 21-year-old for how he has approached his first campaign in the sport.

“I think it's the maturity that I've been the most surprised by,” said Wheatley. “When you consider his age, the way he handles things – the frustration, the natural things you'd imagine from a driver in his first season – he handles them with such maturity.

“I've talked before about his work ethic; if he can be in the simulator, he's in the simulator – if he can be on a simulator, he's on a simulator. And I think on top of that, the way he's knitting his engineering team around him – the way they're working together – is hugely encouraging as well.

“And the final piece in the puzzle for me is when he's at a tricky circuit, he builds up to it. Monaco, he built up to it – his only contact with the barrier was in the race. Same in Baku, same in Singapore.

“He just has such a mature approach, so I'm hugely encouraged by his performance so far.”

Entering into the final races of Bortoleto's maiden F1 season, much of the focus for Kick Sauber will be on the tight midfield battle in the Teams' Championship, with only 12 points covering those placed between sixth and ninth.

Pushed on whether he feels that climbing up to that P6 spot – currently occupied by Racing Bulls – is feasible, Wheatley responded: “We're taking it a race at a time. Ayao [Komatsu, Team Principal at Haas] taught us a lesson a few races ago. It's so close. The margins are so close.

“I feel like I'm always saying the same thing, but it's nip and tuck all the way down the line, and it'll come down to who makes the fewest mistakes, I think, at the end of the day.

“But honestly, I'm loving our racing at the moment. I'm loving coming into this competitive environment where the margins are so tight, and the calls are so close. I'm just enjoying the season.”

28 times F1 drivers made incredible saves

F1 drivers guess the circuit, but they can only see the steering wheel!

Charles Leclerc has been celebrating some happy news away from the track, with the Ferrari driver announcing his engagement to partner Alexandra Saint Mleux.

Charles Leclerc has announced his engagement to long-time partner Alexandra Saint Mleux, with the Monegasque confirming the news to his social media followers over the weekend.

Leclerc took to Instagram on Sunday night to share photos of the couple holding their much-loved pet dog, Leo, alongside the caption “Mr². & Mrs. Leclerc” plus a ring emoji and several heart emojis, while Saint Mleux modelled a new ring.

While Leclerc did not share details of the proposal, the photos also show a dog tag for Leo featuring the words “Dad wants to marry you!”, as well as pictures of the celebrations including a display of red petals designed in a heart shape surrounded by candles.

The couple, who have been together since 2023, received plenty of well-wishes from the F1 community, with Leclerc's fellow Ferrari driver Lewis Hamilton commenting on the post: “Congratulations to you both”

Former team mate Carlos Sainz simply wrote “Yesssss”, while others including Oscar Piastri and Esteban Ocon also sent messages to congratulate Leclerc and Saint Mleux.

The news comes during what has seemingly been a positive few weeks for Leclerc both on and off the track, with the 28-year-old recently claiming back-to-back podiums in Austin and Mexico.

A newly-engaged Leclerc will be hoping to extend this run of form when F1 heads to Brazil for the Sao Paulo Grand Prix on the weekend of November 7-9.

28 times F1 drivers made incredible saves

F1 drivers guess the circuit, but they can only see the steering wheel!

With Mercedes recently confirming that Kimi Antonelli will remain with the team in 2026, Toto Wolff is confident about the youngster's progression into next season.

Toto Wolf believes that Kimi Antonelli will show the “real Kimi” in 2026, with the Mercedes boss feeling confident that the rookie will be better prepared to deal with various aspects of the sport during his sophomore campaign.

It was confirmed ahead of the United States Grand Prix in October that Antonelli and team mate George Russell will remain as the Silver Arrows' line-up into 2026, a season in which a wave of new technical regulations will be introduced into the sport.

Antonelli's rookie year in F1 has witnessed various highs and lows, with a good start followed by a tricky spell during the European leg of the season. The Italian has since enjoyed a stronger run of form since finishing fourth in Baku, having also claimed a P5 in Singapore and a P6 in Mexico.

Looking ahead to 2026, Wolff feels that the 19-year-old will take another step forwards.

“Kimi has a long-term future,” the Team Principal explained after Antonelli's place at the team for next season was confirmed. “I think it's very tricky to come into this generation of cars without having driven them against all of the guys that know ground effect cars.

“Next year's a reset. He now knows all the tracks, he knows about the media pressure and how to work within the team, so we're going to see the real Kimi next year.”

Asked if he has confidence that Antonelli can be a future World Champion from what he has shown already, Wolff responded: “Yeah, absolutely.”

While Antonelli has faced some highs and lows in 2025, Mercedes have also seen dramatic performance swings with their car across different tracks.

Pushed on whether this is also an area that the squad need to get on top of ahead of 2026, Wolff answered: “It's so difficult to find correlation between the simulator and the wind tunnel, then you come to a track and it's all different.

“We didn't expect to be that competitive in Singapore [where Russell won], but we have been... It's a bit of a surprise box with the regulations, and all the front-running teams seem to suffer from correlation issues.”

F1 drivers guess the circuit, but they can only see the steering wheel!

Aston Martin CEO and Team Principal Andy Cowell has shared an insight into the squad's “big, big goals”.

Andy Cowell is confident that Aston Martin will achieve the goal they have set of one day winning back-to-back championships, with the team boss stating that the squad's vision is to “get to the top and then stay at the top”.

Since the former Racing Point outfit became Aston Martin in 2021, the team have made changes as they aim to work their way forwards in the pecking order. This has seen a number of high-profile signings join, including Managing Technical Partner Adrian Newey and new Chief Technical Officer Enrico Cardile.

The squad also opened a brand-new factory at their Silverstone base, housing facilities including a new wind tunnel which became operational earlier in 2025.

As such, Cowell – who joined as CEO in October 2024 before also becoming Team Principal in January – spoke about Aston Martin's “big, big goals” during an interview on the team's YouTube channel.

When asked about the secret to keeping all members of the outfit happy, Cowell listed the factors involved in this.

“Honesty, and don't overpromise, and make sure we've got a single focus – the race car,” the Briton said. “It all comes back to the race car, so what are we all going to do for the race car?

“Set big, big goals – set goals that everybody thinks are impossible, but then make it possible, and that's teamwork. The vision to get to the top and then staying at the top. Coming up with those tough targets – ‘BHAGs', I like to call them.”

Pushed on what the ‘BHAG', or ‘Big Hairy Audacious Goal', was, Cowell answered: “To win multiple championships, back-to-back.”

And when asked if he believes that will happen, the team boss added: “That's what we're striving to do, and yes, it will happen.”

While achieving consecutive titles remains the goal, Cowell also shared an insight into what greatness looks like for the team in terms of the process.

“Teamwork,” he explained. “It's an engineering business, working as a team, for the good of that race car.”

Cowell admitted that he understands if those working for the team might be impatient about achieving success, with the CEO admitting that he welcomes this quality.

“Let's have that hunger,” Cowell added, before acknowledging that he also feels this too. “There isn't a single day where I feel like I've achieved enough.”

Aston Martin currently sit in seventh place of the Teams' Standings on 69 points, just three away from sixth-placed Racing Bulls in a tight midfield battle.

Barber succeeds longtime domestic distribution boss Chris Aronson, who didn't survive the Skydance-Paramount merger.


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


David Ellison‘s Paramount Pictures has found its new head of domestic theatrical distribution: Shaun Barber.


	He succeeds longtime domestic distribution boss Chris Aronson, who didn't survive the Skydance-Paramount merger.




	Barber officially arrives on the Paramount lot Dec. 1, and will work closely with international distribution chief Mark Viane. They'll both report directly to Josh Goldstine, the studio's newly installed president of global marketing and distribution. In turn, Goldstine reports to Paramount Pictures co-chairs Dana Goldberg and Josh Greenstein, who were hand-picked by Ellison to run the rearranged studio.

					Paramount's No Good Very Bad Week		
			









	The announcement of his hire comes just day after massive layoffs across the entire Paramount conglomerate, which Ellison said were necessary to facilitate changing priorities.

	Barber, a nearly 29-year industry veteran, will join Paramount from Lionsgate, where he served as co-president of worldwide theatrical distribution alongside Kevin Grayson (in separate news, THR has confirmed that Mike Viane — Mark Viane's brother — will be joining Lionsgate as executive vp of worldwide theatrical distribution and operations, reporting to Grayson). 


	In his new gig at Paramont, Bauber will be in charge of North American distribution strategy and operations for all Paramoun releases.


	During his 18 years at Lionsgate and Summit Entertainment, Barber was instrumental in handling such blockbuster franchises as John Wick, The Hunger Games and Twilight, as well as critically acclaimed films including Knives Out, La La Land and The Hurt Locker (the latter won the Oscar for best picture). Under his leadership, films released through Lionsgate and Summit amassed over $9.3 billion in box office revenue.

	











	Barber began his career at 20th Century Fox in New York before moving to Los Angeles in 1998 to join Warner Bros., where he spent nearly a decade in theatrical distribution.


	“Shaun is a deeply respected leader who has spent his career building meaningful partnerships across exhibition and the industry at large. He brings extensive expertise in domestic distribution strategy and will help us strengthen our theatrical business and deliver exceptional experiences for moviegoers,” Goldstine said in a statement.


	Added Barber, “I'm honored to join Paramount Pictures at this defining moment in its storied history. I look forward to collaborating with the exceptional team guiding the studio's next phase of growth. Together with our exhibition partners, we're committed to championing and elevating the power of the theatrical experience for audiences everywhere.”


	While the word “distributuion” couldn't be more boring, many of these execs are anything but, especially those working at a major studio side. Historically, they are the ones responsible for dealing with box office reporters on a movie's opening weekend and pushing a particular narrative, whether in good times or bad. And, depending on the structure, they are the ones interfacing directly with studio bosses, filmmakers, agents and talent when grosses start flowing in.

The union, which reps staffers, says the move was ""clearly designed"" to blunt the journalism of the brand, which has leaned in to progressive politics.


							By 

	Katie Kilkenny


Labor & Media Reporter


	The union representing writers at Teen Vogue is slamming the youth-focused publication's merger with the Vogue website and raising concerns about impacts on staff diversity and political coverage.


	In a statement obtained by The Hollywood Reporter on Monday, Condé United and parent union The NewsGuild of New York said they “strongly condemn Condé Nast's consolidation plans for Teen Vogue.” The labor groups claim the move was “clearly designed to blunt the award-winning magazine's insightful journalism at a time when it is needed the most.”

Vogue announced that the 22-year-old brand would be folded into the flagship brand's website on Monday. Though the title is set to continue as a “distinct editorial property,” the magazine's current editor-in-chief Versha Sharma is leaving the company and Vogue head of editorial content Chloe Malle will take the reins.

	In a statement, Malle said she was dedicated to “continuing and supporting its point of view and sensibility.” The announcement added that, on Vogue.com, Teen Vogue will focus on “career development, cultural leadership and other issues that matter most to young people.”


	The newsroom union claims the change is throttling staff diversity and muting the magazine's progressive political bent.


	“Management plans to lay off six of our members, most of whom are BIPOC women or trans, including Teen Vogue's Politics Editor — continuing the trend of layoffs at Condé disproportionately impacting marginalized employees,” the organizations stated. They added, “Teen Vogue now has no writers or editors explicitly covering politics.”

	











	The groups continued, “As of today, only one woman of color remains on the editorial staff at Teen Vogue.”


	Established in 2003, Teen Vogue began as a fashion- and celebrity-focused publication under the direction of former Vogue beauty director Amy Astley. Its first cover star was Gwen Stefani, followed by Beyoncé one month later. The clothes on display weren't all couture, but they did represent an aspirational lifestyle: It was common to see individual items priced at hundreds of dollars, from Prada subsidiary Miu Miu or French luxury label A.P.C., on the magazine's pages.


	The magazine's focus took a turn under the leadership of former editor Elaine Welteroth, who was named editor-in-chief in 2016. The publication amped up its coverage of politics, immigration, labor and climate change. Even after Teen Vogue ceased print publication in 2017 and Welteroth departed a year later, its site kept jumping into the fray on President Donald Trump, the war in Gaza, even progressive New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani.


	In their statement, Condé United and the NewsGuild of New York vowed to get more clarity on Teen Vogue's trajectory moving forward. 


	“Condé leadership owes us answers – and Teen Vogue's readership. We will get those answers,” they said. “And we fight for our rights as workers with a collective bargaining agreement as we fight for the work we do, and the people we do it for.”


	Read the union's full statement below.

	











The NewsGuild of New York and Condé United strongly condemn Condé Nast's consolidation plans for Teen Vogue, a move that is clearly designed to blunt the award-winning magazine's insightful journalism at a time when it is needed the most.

In its announcement today, Condé management said as a “dedicated pillar” on Vogue, Teen Vogue will “focus its content on career development, cultural leadership and other issues that matter most to young people, according to the publication.” Teen Vogue now has no writers or editors explicitly covering politics.


There was no mention in the announcement of the coverage that has earned Teen Vogue massive readership and wide praise from across the journalism industry. Gone is the political-cultural criticism of the fashion and culture industries by the Black women writers laid off today. Gone are the incisive and artful depictions of young people from the Asian and Latina women photographers laid off today. Gone, from the lauded politics section, is the work that made possible the blockbuster cover of Vivian Wilson, one of Condé Nast's top performing stories of the year, coordinated by the singular trans staffer laid off today. Nearly all of these staffers identify as LGBTQ. As of today, only one woman of color remains on the editorial staff at Teen Vogue.

After a major backlash in 2024, Coke and the L.A. studio it hired have produced a new synthetic spot they believe viewers will like a lot more; ""The craftsmanship is ten times better."" Will they?


							By 

	Steven Zeitchik


Senior Editor, Technology and Politics


	For a few weeks last November, no villain loomed larger over Madison Avenue and the social media that polices it than Coca-Cola.


	The company's “The Holidays Are Coming” spot, an homage to a classic 1995 ad, featured the original's rhythmic anthem as trucks drove through various snowy landscapes. Only now the ad was filled with AI-generated objects, animals and people — a fact that did not go over well with creatives and many others on the Internet. “Coca-Cola is red because it's made from the blood of out-of-work artists,” decried Hollywood writer Alex Hirsch, one of many such negative comments noting both the spot's labor ethics and its aesthetics. (Despite or because of the backlash, the ad racked up billions of impressions.)

					Is Netflix a Friend or Foe to AI?		
			









	On Monday, Coke is trying again, releasing a new generative AI holiday ad with the globe-trucking concept. Once more, the company has hired the Los Angeles-based AI studio Secret Level to produce the spot. This time, though, the ad features just animals — the only person seen is a Santa Claus at the end, based on the company's original drawings. (Coca-Cola inaugurated the modern depiction of Santa.)


	The company believes enough has changed in a year, in both the tech and society, to evoke a different response.


	“Last year people criticized the craftsmanship. But this year the craftsmanship is ten times better,” Pratik Thakar, global vp and head of generative AI at Coca-Cola, tells The Hollywood Reporter. “There will be people who criticize — we cannot keep everyone 100 percent happy,” he adds. “But if the majority of consumers see it in a positive way it's worth going forward.”

	











	In a culture where Hollywood creators worry about an AI takeover while a video-watching citizenry braces itself for a wave of synthetic media from Sora 2 and others, an AI commercial at this level is no small thing. Coca-Cola is one of the world's most dominant brands and the holidays one of Madison Avenue's sacred human spaces. The unleashing of a spot by the former into the space of the latter could prove a litmus test for consumers' appetite for AI video — while also, perhaps, further normalizing its consumption.


	The ad features the now-famous Coca-Cola trucks driving through different locales as animals from seals to pandas look on, suggesting a globetrotting trip. It ends as a truck door swings open and Santa appears. The image of the icon was generated exclusively by the archival paintings of Haddon Sundblom which the Coca-Cola company owns; the artist in the 1930s created the original Coke ads for The Saturday Evening Post that gave rise to our conception of the mythic St. Nicholas as a girthful bearded man in a red-and-white suit.


	While the current generation of AI videos can often take on a disconcertingly stylized quality, Coca-Cola sought to lean into that bug by choosing to portray not people but anthropomorphic animals, which they say they couldn't do before. “Last year it was difficult to get those expressions from animals so we had to use human faces. Now technology has evolved to where we can,” Thakar says.


	The desired effect is that of a Madagascar or other modern CG animated movie. Those films use artists working from scratch instead of the approach here, in which a model trained on thousands of earlier images generates, with human prompting and shaping, the animation in question. Jason Zada, Secret Level's founder and chief creative officer, says he hopes viewers cannot distinguish this spot from a traditional Hollywood animated movie.

	











	 “The best compliment I get is when people say a video doesn't look like AI,” he tells THR.


	The company used several Large Language Models to generate the creative. (Two other versions of the “holidays are coming” ad were also made this year, an AI one with another studio, Silverside, and a traditionally shot one without the stylized animals, for some Latin markets.)


	AI is a perhaps unexpected focus for Coke, given the company's history of playing with a kind of schmaltzy humanism in its marketing. In addition to the Sundblom Santa paintings, which also had the rosy-cheeked character holding a Coke bottle in the likes of Ladies Home Journal and the New Yorker, the company is of course famous for its 1971 “I'd Like to Buy the World a Coke” ad, in which a panoply of people from different backgrounds stand atop a mountain singing.


	Thakar says Coca-Cola is going through a “major marketing transformation, a companywide transformation” with AI at the center of the effort. The company was indeed one of the first to use the tech in a major ad when in 2023 it released “Masterpiece,” which brought the subjects of museum paintings to life catching and tossing Coke bottles, in creative that did not cause the backlash of last year's holiday spot.


	Zada believes social media gives a skewed impression of how some AI ads are going over.


	“The haters on the Internet are the loudest, he says. “A lot of the people complaining last year were from the creative industry who were just afraid — afraid for their jobs, afraid for what it did. But I think the spot tested really well and average people really enjoyed it.”

	











	Zada says labor fears are misplaced; while the Coke ad this year required fewer people to make it — he estimated it at 20, compared to the at least 50 an ad of this complexity might typically entail — such efficiencies mean that more could be done in a short amount of time. Brands will allocate the same budgets, Zada believes, leading perhaps to smaller teams on a given ad but more creative overall. “You could do 10 times as much at scale,” he says.


	Whether Madison Avenue and Hollywood respond by doing more or just try to save money, however, remains to be seen. Coca-Cola's AI push can be seen as a way to increase its appeal among younger, more zeitgeist-y consumers as the company faces competition from boutique sodas and other upstart beverages. But it also, in the long run, could save the company cash, trimming at least some dollars off its reported $5 billion advertising budget. Madison Avenue executives of course generally are bracing for a potential significant downsizing in budgets  as AI is deployed in areas from creative to research.


	Thakar, who says the company won't spend less money on advertising overall in the AI age, says he's taking a long view of what the tech can do, backlash and all.


	“Last year we decided to go all in, and it worked out well for us,” he says, noting that “consumer engagement was very high. Yes, some parts of the industry were not pleased we were using a 100 percent Generative AI film, but that's part and parcel of doing something pioneering,” he adds. “We understand that concern. But we need to keep moving forward and pushing the envelope.” Thakar says the company was open to using it for activations in other times of the year, even high-impact ones like March Madness.”

	











	“The genie is out of the bottle,” he says, “and you're not going to put it back in.”

The vote comes after both the musicians, as well as the actors and stage managers, had threatened to strike. 


							By 

	Caitlin Huston


Business Writer


Broadway musicians have voted to ratify their new contract with the Broadway League. 


	The vote comes after the musicians were on the verge of strike two weeks ago, vowing to strike the next day if a deal could not be reached by Oct. 23 as part of a mediation session. A tentative agreement was reached in the early morning hours of Oct. 23, which AFM Local 802, which represents the union, said includes “meaningful wage and health benefit increases.”




	The deal comes after Actors' Equity had also threatened to strike if they could not reach a deal with the Broadway League, which represents producers and theater owners. Actors' Equity reached a tentative agreement with the League Oct. 18 over a new contract, as part of a mediation session, and members voted to ratify the contract Oct. 30.

	Increased healthcare contributions had been a sticking point for both unions. 


	The Local 802 ratification vote was tallied Monday with an “overwhelming majority” voting yes.


	 “After a hard-fought contract negotiation, Broadway musicians overwhelmingly ratified their new three-year contract, preserving industry-leading standards for the artists who power Broadway's success. United in solidarity, Broadway musicians doubled down on their collective power with a 98% strike authorization vote. Ultimately, AFM Local 802's Broadway musicians, together with the actors and stage managers of Actors' Equity Association, have proven that organized labor remains a potent force on Broadway,” Bob Suttman, president of Local 802 AFM said in a statement.

	











	Musicians had been working without a contract on Broadway since Aug. 31, 2025.

Xania Monet, who becomes the first AI-powered artist to debut on an airplay chart this week, is one of several AI-driven acts to chart over the past two months.


													By
												

	Xander Zellner



	AI music is no longer a fantasy or niche curiosity among internet sleuths — it's here, and it's already beginning to have an impact on Billboard's charts.


	In just the past few months, at least six AI or AI-assisted artists have debuted on various Billboard rankings. That figure could be higher, as it's become increasingly difficult to tell who or what is powered by AI — and to what extent. Many of these charting projects, whose music spans every genre from gospel to rock to country, also arrive with anonymous or mysterious origins.


	How do we know these charting titles are AI or AI-assisted? For some, their artist pages on DSPs claim their music was made with the help of AI. For others, Billboard cross-checked the songs using Deezer's AI detection tool, which adds a flag to all AI-generated content on the platform.


	One of the most prominent examples is Xania Monet, an artist with an animated avatar created by Mississippi-based songwriter Telisha “Nikki” Jones. Jones writes the lyrics and has used Suno — along with help from some other humans — to create the songs. Monet made headlines in September when she debuted on multiple Billboard charts: Hot Gospel Songs with “Let Go, Let Go” (which climbed to No. 3 on the chart dated Oct. 25) and Hot R&B Songs with “How Was I Supposed to Know?” (No. 20 peak).


	There was a bidding war to sign Xania Monet with offers reaching $3 million. Hallwood Media, led by former Interscope executive Neil Jacobson, ultimately signed Monet to a multimillion-dollar deal.


	Monet has since become the first known AI artist to earn enough radio airplay to debut on a Billboard radio chart, debuting at No. 30 on the Adult R&B Airplay chart dated Nov. 11. She's also topped R&B Digital Song Sales (with “How Was I Supposed to Know?” on Sept. 20) and debuted on Emerging Artists (reaching No. 18).


	Notably, at least one AI artist has debuted in each of the past five chart weeks, a streak suggesting this trend is quickly accelerating. Below is a recap of the AI artists who've appeared on Billboard's charts, in order of their debuts.




	Debuted at No. 14 on Christian Digital Song Sales (dated Aug. 16) with “The Only Thing I Can Take to Heaven” (thanks to 1,000 downloads sold that week, according to Luminate). The song is credited to songwriter Cindy Hugo. To date, the artist's catalog has earned 1.2 million official U.S. streams, according to Luminate.


	Created by Jones using the AI platform Suno, Monet's blend of gospel and R&B has made her perhaps the most visible AI artist to date. Jones writes about 90% of Monet's lyrics herself, with the rest inspired by stories from her friends and community. Monet has charted on Hot Gospel Songs, Hot R&B Songs, Adult R&B Airplay and Emerging Artists, among other charts, and her catalog has amassed 44.4 million official U.S. streams.


	Earlier this month, Billboard estimated that five of her songs had generated $52,000 in just over two months.


	The AI-assisted project by songwriter Terrance LeDoux debuted at No. 47 on the Emerging Artists chart dated Oct. 11, powered by “You Got This.” The song reached No. 10 on Rock Digital Song Sales that week with 1,000 downloads sold. Unbound's artist bio states that its releases “combine human creativity with artificial intelligence,” with varying degrees of AI involvement. Its catalog has earned 5.5 million official streams.


	The AI-assisted project by songwriter Thong Viet debuted at No. 44 on the Emerging Artists chart dated Oct. 18, thanks largely to “Through My Soul.” The song debuted at No. 15 on Rock Digital Song Sales that week with 1,000 downloads sold. Enlly's artist bio says that the artist is “an independent blues artist” whose music blends “acoustic music, production, recording and AI-powered creativity.” Its catalog has earned 5.3 million official streams.


	The contemporary Christian AI-powered artist, whose songs are credited to Nguyen Duc Nam, debuted at No. 44 on the Emerging Artists chart (dated Oct. 25), largely thanks to “Lord, You Are My Strength,” which tallied 1,000 downloads that week. Juno's catalog has earned 1.6 million official streams.


	Breaking Rust, an AI-powered country act, debuted at No. 9 on the Emerging Artists chart (dated Nov. 1), driven by two charting songs: “Livin' On Borrowed Time”(No. 5 on Country Digital Song Sales and No. 13 on Digital Song Sales) and “Walk My Walk” (No. 14 on Country Digital Song Sales). The former debuts with 2,000 downloads sold, while the latter debuts with 1,000 sold. The project, credited to songwriter Aubierre Rivaldo Taylor, has generated 1.6 million official U.S. streams.


	While the recent wave of AI-charting artists feels sudden, their presence on Billboard's charts isn't entirely new.


	In 2023, Trump The Don — a parody AI project created by the rapper Hi-Rez — reached No. 5 on both the Rap Digital Song Sales and R&B/Hip-Hop Digital Song Sales charts, and hit No. 45 on Digital Song Sales, with “First Day Out.” The song used AI-filtering technology to mimic Donald Trump's voice to make it sound like he was rapping. It was released after his Fulton County arrest and subsequent viral mugshot, and received a boost in attention from several right-wing pundits.


	That same month, BOI WHAT debuted at No. 14 on Hot Hard Rock Songs with “PLAN Z.” The artist creates music inspired by the Nickelodeon show Spongebob Squarepants. “PLAN Z” uses AI-filtering tools to mimic the voice of the character Plankton.


(Updated as of the Nov. 8, 2025-dated charts)


	The AI-assisted country artist, whose songs are credited to Dallas Little, debuted at No. 41 on the Nov. 8-dated Emerging Artists chart thanks to “Don't Tread on Me.” The song sold 1,000 downloads in the tracking week, helping it debut at No. 7 on the Country Digital Song Sales chart.

""Boston I'm gonna be honest with ya, after the show last night I was in the ER till 6 this morning,"" Halsey wrote.

	Jessica Lynch



Halsey is on the mend after spending the night in the emergency room following her Nov. 2 show in Boston.


	The singer-songwriter, who had a two-night stop in Boston for her international Back to Badlands tour, took to Instagram Stories on Sunday (Nov. 3) to share that she experienced a “minor medical emergency” after her concert at MGM Music Hall. Despite the overnight ER stay, she confirmed she would be returning to the stage for her second Boston performance as scheduled.


	“Boston I'm gonna be honest with ya, after the show last night I was in the ER till 6 this morning,” Halsey wrote. “Minor medical emergency but I am A-Okay now and ready to rock tonight! But if I'm pacing myself, that's why!” She added a thank you to the hospital staff, calling them “the absolute best team I've ever met.”

	The 31-year-old artist has been open about her ongoing health journey. In 2022, Halsey revealed she had been diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and a rare T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder, conditions that she says are now being managed or are in remission. “Both of which I will likely have for the duration of my life,” she wrote in a June 2024 Instagram post. She also lives with endometriosis and previously shared she suffered a miscarriage while on tour at age 20.


	This latest health scare comes amid a particularly prolific era for the genre-blurring star. The Great Impersonator, released in October 2024 via Capitol Records, debuted at No. 2 on both the all-genre Billboard 200 and Top Album Sales charts. It also debuted atop Billboard's Top Rock & Alternative Albums and Top Alternative Albums charts. The set earned 93,000 equivalent album units in the United States in the week ending Oct. 31, according to Luminate. 

	











	Halsey previously ruled Top Alternative Albums for a week each with If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power in 2021 and Badlands in 2015.


	Halsey has charted 20 songs on the Billboard Hot 100, including two No. 1 hits: her 2016 Closer collaboration with The Chainsmokers, which topped the chart for 12 weeks, and 2019's “Without Me,” her first solo No. 1. She's also earned multiple top 10 albums on the Billboard 200, including Badlands (No. 2), Hopeless Fountain Kingdom (No. 1), Manic (No. 2), and If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power (No. 2).

Harlow received some backlash for dressing up as the late singer, who struggled with drug addiction.

	Mackenzie Cummings-Grady



	Winnie Harlow has responded to criticism of her Whitney Houston Halloween costume, saying she never meant to insult the late singer.


	Harlow recreated Houston's appearance at the 2001 BET Awards, and posted a subsequent video of her reenacting the icon's famous Lifetime Achievement Award speech. After some blowback, Harlow addressed the situation on her Instagram Story.


	“My video wasn't mocking Whitney. That clip has always been one of my favorite of hers,” Harlow wrote, via People. “She was radiant, funny, confident and captivating. She was being awarded. The way she moved across that stage with flair and swag? Iconic.”

	She continued, “People are more than headlines. A woman who could command a room, make you laugh & carry herself like royalty. If all you see when you see Whitney are her struggles, you're missing her charisma, humor, talent, personality & wit. She was hilarious & magnetic. THAT is and what should always be highlighted. The light that made us all love her. Attention to positivity.”


	Celebrities had mostly praised Harlow's costume in her Instagram comments, with Naomi Campbell, Halle Berry, Ciara, Tracee Ellis Ross, Rita Ora and Law Roach showering Harlow in praise.


	Houston struggled with drug addiction throughout most of her adult life. She died from an accidental drowning in 2012, with an investigation concluding that heart disease and cocaine were contributing factors. The report also found that the singer had marijuana, Xanax, Benadryl and other meds in her system.


	Whitney Houston's impact on the Billboard charts is both historic and unmatched. With 11 No. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, she stands among the top 10 most successful solo artists in U.S. chart history. From 1985 to 1988, she made history as the only artist ever to land seven consecutive No. 1 singles, a record that still stands in 2025. 

	











	Her signature ballad “I Will Always Love You” spent 14 weeks at No. 1, setting a then-record for the longest-running No. 1 by a solo female artist and topping multiple Billboard charts simultaneously. She earned 16 Billboard Music Awards, including a record-breaking 11 wins in a single year (1993), and remains the most awarded female artist in history.

	The film's synopsis reads: Following the tragic death of her twin sister, Eve (Woodley) enters into the most intense athletic endeavour on the planet: the Badwater 135 Ultramarathon, a 135-mile race through Death Valley, where temperatures reach 54°C. As Eve takes on the unforgiving elements and intense physical and psychological strain of the race, she finds herself pursued by an unknown runner in white, consistently closing the gap between them as they surge through the desert. Trying to outrun the ominous presence, Eve will face the darkest parts of herself and uncover what she is made of.

	“Tragic circumstances, for better or worse, are transformative, and Ultra is a film born from that experience,” Negri said of the film. “My father was a distance runner, left paralyzed by a stroke. Running, the thing that gave him life, was taken from him. He suffered and finally succumbed. While finding my emotional footing, I grew to become an ultrarunner, since completing two 100-mile races, numerous 50 milers, and many marathons. It's through testing my limits in each of these epic races that I process loss — physical pain being the greatest metaphor for the emotional.” 


	Negri added that Ultra will be a “visceral descent into inner turmoil, as our protagonist Eve is unable to confront the loss that chases her down in the unforgiving desert of Death Valley, during the world's toughest footrace: the monumentally challenging Badwater 135 Ultramarathon.”

Associate Editor


	With a third Predator film under his belt, Dan Trachtenberg included a subtle Alien crossover with his latest entry in the franchise.


	At Monday's premiere of Predator: Badlands, the 2x Emmy-nominated writer and director explained how the worlds continue to merge in the movie, which premieres Nov. 7 in theaters, also noting how it differs from previous crossovers Alien vs. Predator (2004) and Aliens vs Predator – Requiem (2007).


	“I would say, Badlands itself is definitely a crossover in that we have the Weyland-Yutani corporation as a huge part of the movie,” he said on the red carpet at TCL Chinese Theatre. “Elle Fanning plays a Weyland-Yutani synth.”

	Trachtenberg continued, “And I think, sometimes there's a tendency for a ‘versus' movie to be grabbing all the action figures and smashing them together, and I thought it was really cool to just take an element from one franchise and fuse it with this one. So yeah, they're a huge part of the movie.”


	In Predator: Badlands, a young Predator from the Yautja clan named Dek (Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi) is cast out, teaming up with a damaged synth named Thia (Fanning) to prove himself and defeat the ultimate adversary.

	Producer Ben Rosenblatt explained adding an element from the Alien universe was a “super organic” decision, given the franchises' “spiritual connection.” They also didn't want to put a human in the film, since the audience would immediately identify with that character, whereas Dek is supposed to be the protagonist.

	











	“So instead, [Trachtenberg] was like, ‘I would love to have humanoid characters without having humans,' and he was like, ‘I think we need robots.' And then, of course Dan was like, ‘I know who makes robots: Weyland-Yutani,'” he explained. “And then it was a natural collision of the two worlds.”


	Rosenblatt also teased that Arnold Schwarzenegger has met with Trachtenberg multiple times about potentially reprising his role as Dutch from the original Predator (1987) in an upcoming sequel, after the character made an animated cameo in Predator: Killer of Killers earlier this year.


	“Obviously, the holy grail of Predator movies would be getting Arnold back in there,” he said. “And it's always been something in the back of our minds that it would be really great to see him come back to this franchise that he's made iconic, and that's made him iconic.


	“So, he's been really wonderful. Arnold and Dan have met a couple of times now. He's been really interested in what we're doing, he's a real fan of what we've done so far, from what I understand. And we're really excited. After Predator: Badlands comes out, we'll see and have more conversations. Hopefully, we'll have a chance to do something with Arnold, because that would be awesome,” added Rosenblatt.

EXCLUSIVE: The Miniature Wife has found new partners around the world. The high-concept Matthew Macfadyen and Elizabeth Banks show is for Peacock in the U.S. It had a glitzy screening for the international set at the MIPCOM market in Cannes last month. Sony Pictures Television is handling distribution and has secured new deals in the wake of the preview showing.


	HBO Max has stepped up and acquired the series for its service across Latin America. The streamer has also snapped up the show for the Central and Eastern Europe region. Elsewhere, pay-TV platform beIN has bought the ten-part drama for the Middle East and North Africa.

	The deals were cut by SPT, which had already pre-sold the comedy-infused drama to Sky in the UK and Ireland, streaming service Stan in Australia, and Canadian TV and streaming giant Bell Media. In all, the deals mean The Miniature Wife has now sold into over 70 countries, which is a good start for a high-concept drama that has not even premiered yet. The series is slated to launch on Peacock in the U.S. in early 2026.

	Macfadyen and Banks play Les and Lindy in the drama, a couple trying to keep their marriage together. The wrinkle is that he has accidentally shrunk her to six inches high, adding a high-concept twist to the relationship drama.


	Deadline moderated the Q+A after the Cannes screening with Macfadyen speaking alongside two of his co-stars, Sian Clifford, and O-T Fagbenle. “Because it's so heightened you can play it really life and death,” Macfadyen said at the time.

	











	The series is based on author Manuel Gonzales' short story and was created by Jennifer Ames and Steve Turner (Boardwalk Empire, Goliath), who are showrunners and executive producers. Media Res (Pachinko) produces.


	“The series has huge star power—led by Elizabeth Banks and Matthew Macfadyen—a wildly unique and inventive concept and razor-sharp writing,” said Mike Wald, Co-President of Distribution & Networks, SPT. “These sales are a testament to the strong commercial appeal of the series Media Res has produced. We believe audiences around the world will relate to the wit and honesty of these flawed yet funny characters.”

					By Katie Campione 

TV Reporter


UPDATED with coroner confirmation and production information: A crew member was killed on the set of a New Orleans-area production on Monday, Deadline has confirmed.


	The cause of death for James “Trapper” McEvoy, a grip who was also a member of IATSE Local 478, has not yet been confirmed, but he is suspected to have died by electrocution. An autopsy was being conducted Tuesday morning at the Jefferson Parish Coroner's Office in Harvey, LA, about six miles south of New Orleans, a coroner's office spokesperson told Deadline.


	Sources tell Deadline that McEvoy was working on a feature film that was set to begin production on Tuesday, November 4. That production is believed to be Kill Me Now, an independent slasher thriller that was set to film in and around New Orleans from November 4 to December 5.

	Several friends spoke of McEvoy's death in social media posts on Monday evening, one of whom said that he was killed in “a tragic accident while working on set.” 


	In the comments of that post, Deven Schruff, a NOLA locations manager whose recent credits include Sinners and Your Honor, also confirmed that McEvoy had died. 


	“Heartbreaking, I have been so saddened by this news all day,” Schruff wrote. “Hugs love and light to all of my film brothers and sisters. Praying for comfort for his family and all who loved our sweet Trapper.”


	In a statement to Deadline, IATSE affirmed that a crew member had died but did not disclose details about the victim, the accident, or the production on which it occurred.

	











	“Today we grieve the loss of one of our fellow members who was killed in a tragic incident on a production shooting in Louisiana,” IATSE International President Matt Loeb said in a statement. “Our deepest condolences are with the family who lost a loved one, and the crew who lost a friend and colleague. All workers have a right to safety on the job. We have engaged the Entertainment Community Fund to provide counseling for crew members, and are sending an IATSE representative to Louisiana to support the members and Local Unions on the ground there.”


	Deadline has reached out to IATSE Local 478 as well as the local film office. This post will be updated as more details are available.

What happened?

Trapper's loss to the local film community is immeasurable. When the facts are laid out we need to act to ensure this never happens again. It's what Trapper would want and demand of us all. If something doesn't feel right on set use your voice and say no. There's nothing worth dying for on production. If it's in our power to control a situation then it must be. Take care of each other, and call your hall if something is unsafe. Our rules, and safety regulations are written in blood. I just never thought it would be his. Stay safe out there, and reach out to your local for grief support.

just because something tragic and accidental happened doesn't mean you need to finger point and lay blame immediately that some faceless producer or production is at blame here. typical union and mob mentality. sometimes unfortunate and tragic things happen and not everything is a witch hunt to put some filmmakers head on a stake for it. RIP and prayers to his family.

Like the other person said, electrocution sounds like faulty equipment and/or negligence. Also productions don't always have the greatest reputation for following proper safety protocols (like the Rust shooting).

Accidents are tripping over a crack in the sidewalk.  Dying of electrocution is not an accident.  It's evidence of negligence on someone's part.  Hopefully we will find out who did not do their job in keeping crew and the public safe.

Typical union and mob mentality? Weird comment.

Blake Lively filed a new motion demanding “It Ends With Us” producer Jamey Heath hand over footage of his wife fully naked during a home-birth that she claims was shown to her “without her consent or any warning in the workplace.”

Lively, 38, accused Heath of showing her and an assistant the “inappropriate” home-birth video of his wife, Natasha — which the actress described as “pornography.”

The producer and her co-star/director, Justin Baldoni, allegedly showed the video in order to relay their vision of the birthing scene in the film.

The actress accused Heath of not abiding by an August court order that required him to produce the video in question, according to new court docs obtained by the Daily Mail.

Advertisement

In her motion filed on Oct. 30, Lively accused Heath of instead turning over a three-minute clip that was not the one she was shown on set.

Lively demanded that a judge force him to hand over every version of the home-birthing video within three days of the court's order and to ban him from discussing it at trial if he doesn't comply. 

Both Lively's rep and Heath's rep didn't immediately respond to Page Six's request for comment.

Heath and Baldoni previously hit back at her claims surrounding the video. In the now-dismissed complaint, they accused the actress of making an “outrageous and knowingly false suggestion that she was shown pornography or naked images of Heath's wife on set.”

“To characterize this image that captures such a beautiful moment with their newborn baby, shared with the consent of his wife for purposes of the Film, as a naked photo, or worse, ‘porn,' is deplorable,” the complaint read.

On Friday, Baldoni's $400 million defamation and extortion countersuit against Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, was officially ended by U.S. District Court Judge Lewis Liman. 

The judge's final judgment stated that Baldoni and his Wayfarer Studios co-plaintiffs declined to file an amended complaint, according to court documents obtained by Page Six.

But Baldoni's legal team tells us he opted not to file an amended complaint so that he has the option to proceed with an appeal. 

Baldoni, meanwhile, remains focused on Lively's case, which will be tried in March 2026.

Lively made accusations surrounding the birthing scene in “It Ends With Us” in her initial complaint and the amended version filed in February, both of which Page Six obtained. 

She said she was “disturbed” by many of Baldoni's actions on set, including “new scenes” he chose to have in the film, such as a “violative birthing scene for which he cast a friend as her OBGYN.”

“Ms. Lively felt that the selection of Mr. Baldoni's friend for this intimate role, in which the actor's face and hands were in close proximity to her nearly nude genitalia for a birth scene, was invasive and humiliating,” the complaint further alleged.

But actor Adam Mondschein, who played the doctor in the scene, told Page Six that she never expressed discomfort while filming the scene, which he described as “entirely professional.”

“Her costume included a full hospital gown, black shorts and torso-covering prosthetic to make her appear pregnant in addition to whatever personal garments she chose,” he also alleged.

Blow out the Kandles!

Kendall Jenner celebrated her 30th birthday with an extravagant beach bash featuring plenty of tequila and a massive firework display. 

The 818 Tequila founder was joined by her mom, Kris Jenner, and sisters Kim Kardashian, Khloé Kardashian and Kylie Jenner for her seaside soirée Monday night.

Kendall's fellow models, Hailey Bieber and Justine Skye, were also in tow.

Guests at the star-studded fête dressed to the nines in neutral tones, with the birthday girl opting for a pink and beige silk top paired with a cool geometric-print skirt.

Kim, 45, went with a hip-hugging brown leather maxi, Kylie, 28, wore a little black dress, Khloé, 41, stunned in a pink halter gown and the momager, 69, showed off her curves in a sheer zebra-striped number.

The family members posed barefoot in front of a massive silver balloon display that spelled out “Happy Birthday Kendall,” and they also snapped a few fun selfies.

Attendees commemorated Kendall's milestone birthday with shots of her 818 Tequila as well as a bottle of Chateau Haut-Brion French red wine from the model's birth year, 1995 (which retails for $595). 

Family and friends sang “Happy Birthday” to Kendall as she was presented with a beautiful, vintage-inspired white cake decorated with black bows, long candles and several mini bottles of 818 Tequila.

There was also a bonfire in the sand that was surrounded by chic Moroccan-style seating featuring cozy pillows, blankets and rugs, as well as twinkling string lights.

A beautiful show of fireworks exploded over the ocean to cap off the night. 

“Happy 30th Birthday @kendalljenner,” Kim wrote in a sweet Instagram post. “May this decade bring you the kind of love and joy you so freely give to everyone else. 🤍I love you more than you'll ever understand!

“Here's to 30 Kenny,” she added.

Khloé also raved about her “baby sister” in a lengthy tribute post. 

“I can't believe you're thirty. It feels impossible and yet, here you are; more radiant, grounded, and beautifully you than ever before,” the Good American founder wrote.

“Something I've always admired and respected about you is how deeply and unapologetically you live in your truth,” she continued. “In a world where so many try to fit in or please others, you've always just been yourself. Effortlessly, courageously, authentically YOU.” 

Kendall thanked her loved ones for celebrating with her by posting an Instagram Story photo of herself dancing in front of the fireworks, writing, “Thank you for all the birthday love.” 

It's unclear if Kendall's other siblings, Kourtney Kardashian and Rob Kardashian, were at the event, though they weren't seen in any photos.

Tom Brady's “beloved” dog Lua died in 2023 — and the canine's blood was used to make a clone.

On Tuesday, the retired NFL player revealed his new dog Junie's origins in a joint statement with Colossal Biosciences, with whom he worked to clone Lua.

The former quarterback, who is an investor in the company, gushed over the “second chance” his family has with Junie, according to People.

“I love my animals. They mean the world to me and my family,” the ex-athlete, 48, explained. “A few years ago, I worked with Colossal and leveraged their non-invasive cloning technology through a simple blood draw of our family's elderly dog before she passed.”

Brady's reveal comes as Colossal Biosciences acquires Viagen Pets and Equine, the company that twice cloned Barbra Streisand's dead dog Samantha, as well as Paris Hilton's missing dog Diamond Baby.

“[I'm] excited how Colossal and Viagen's tech together can help both families losing their beloved pets while helping to save endangered species,” the former New England Patriots player concluded.

Brady and his ex-wife, Gisele Bündchen, adopted Lua during their time together.

The Victoria's Secret Angel, 45, shared the pit bull mix's death with her Instagram followers in an emotional tribute in December 2023.

“Our little Lulu, our guardian angel is gone to heaven,” the model wrote at the time. “She will forever live in our hearts. We already miss her sooooo much! #unconditionallove RIPLua 💔.”

Brady, for his part, wrote, “We love you Lua, RIP.”

In a separate Instagram Story post, the Fox Sports commentator added that the “sweetest and cutest” canine would be “forever in [their] hearts.”

He and Bündchen both shared sweet snaps of Lua with their two kids, Benjamin, 15, and Vivian, 12.

Brady is also the father of 18-year-old son Jack, whom he welcomed with ex Bridget Moynahan early into his romance with Bündchen.

As for the Bündchen, she made headlines in February for giving birth to a baby boy with her boyfriend, Joaquim Valente.

Bündchen sparked romance rumors with Valente, her jiu-jitsu trainer, on the heels of her 2022 split from Brady — and the duo went public with their relationship the following year.

He's wicked hot.

A source tells Page Six that Jonathan Bailey, who dazzled audiences with his dance moves playing Fiyero in the hit movie “Wicked,” has been named this year's “Sexiest Man Alive” by People magazine.

A source tells us the big news will be announced Monday on “The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.”

Bailey was on People's reader's choice list last year, when the mag allowed fans to vote on men by different categories, including “Sexiest Fiyero.”

Along with defying gravity with his singing voice,  Bailey also won hearts with his role on “Bridgerton” as Lord Anthony Bridgerton.

Fans have also loved the chemistry between Scarlett Johansson and Bailey, who is openly gay, as the two pals and co-stars smooched on the carpet and gave charismatic interviews for their flick “Jurassic World Rebirth.”

This year marks the 40th Anniversary of People's special cover issue. 

Past winners have included Patrick Dempsey, John Legend, Channing Tatum, Ryan Reynolds, Dwayne the Rock Johnson, Denzel Washington, David Beckham and Matthew McConaughey.

Fallon himself has gotten in on saucy fun. Last year, the late night host was nominated in the Reader's Choice poll, putting out a parody attack ad on his competition, “Live With Kelly and Mark” star Mark Consuelos.

“Mark Conseul-who?” said the joke ad. 

“Earlier this week, I asked Mark Consuelos to drop out of the race,” Fallon said on his show at the time. “He doesn't need this. He's sexy every day. I don't even get on these lists at all.” 

Fallon finally got a win this year, being named “Sexiest Game Show Host,” in the poll.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","The Diplomat sings by doubling down on its goofiness","https://www.avclub.com/the-diplomat-season-3-double-down-on-goofiness","Tue, 04 Nov 2025 14:00:00 GMT","

[Editor's note: This piece contains spoilers for The Diplomat.]  

Everyone is in a frenzy in The Diplomat‘s third-season premiere, which picks up minutes after the POTUS' untimely demise in season two‘s finale. “Emperor Dead” tracks VP Grace Penn's (Allison Janney) rushed swearing-in ceremony in the U.K., where she's visiting Ambassador Kate Wyler (Keri Russell). Putting aside their differences, Kate focuses on the minutiae of the event at the Embassy—if only someone could find a robe for the judge (suggestions include grabbing one from a church or a Harry Potter store) and an actual “adult-sized Bible, written by Jesus,” as Kate deadpans. Hunting down the Holy Book becomes a comical subplot in a major crisis. And the punchline arrives in the form of PM Nicol Trowbridge (Rory Kinnear), who, previously in the episode, straightforwardly retorted to Kate that “Jesus did not write the Bible.” He strolls into the inauguration with the 1455 Gutenberg Bible, using this “gift” to position himself right behind Grace on camera as she takes the oath in an oddly funny scene. 

Humor has always been a part of this Netflix hit, which darkly mines laughs from Kate and Hal's (Rufus Sewell) marital woes. Series creator Debora Cahn (The West Wing, Homeland) wields it as a tool to diffuse the tension of political conflicts as well. But as evidenced by its opening installment, season three doubles down on goofiness. The Diplomat is as ridiculous as it is compelling, with pivotal turns landing in the same melodramatic vein as Scandal, Madam Secretary, and Designated Survivor. While it boasts a prestige-TV sheen thanks to its pedigree, the series actually operates as a tightly packaged network drama, relying on familiar beats to keep the action moving. In this case, there's no time to mourn President Rayburn (Michael McKean), considering Hal and Stuart (Ato Essandoh) are busy pitching Kate as the new VP, Grace is worrying about the optics of being in a different country, and devoted White House staffers are struggling to manage the situation from afar. Even the final “Emperor Dead” twist—Grace chooses Hal as the VP instead of Kate, as they look on in stunned silence—screams soapy, not serious. 

This curveball adds to The Diplomat‘s enjoyability factor. The show uses the Wylers' latest strife to elevate its theatrics (probably to the disappointment of those hoping for a more earnest take on the subject matter, as seen in Russell's previous hit, The Americans). Kate's disdain for Grace's decision is written all over her face. So even when Hal promises she won't be stuck as the Second Lady and makes a bid for her to be a Special Envoy to Europe, she doesn't bite. By the end of episode two, Kate abandons her husband at the tarmac when he's leaving for Washington, D.C., opting to remain a diplomat in London and launching a “secret divorce” with him. This kicks off a new level of toxic back-and-forths between them that's reminiscent of Scandal‘s Olivia Pope (Kerry Washington) and Fitzgerald Grant (Tony Goldwyn), two people who often found themselves on opposing ends but couldn't stay away from each other either.



In Shonda Rhimes' series, Olivia and Fitz's juicy affair launched plenty of ludicrous arcs. (He went to war for her and sent an old military pal to spy on Liv, while she rigged an election for him and later became the campaign manager for his ex-wife.) Scandal stopped caring about any grounded, nuanced political stories as it went on to spin in circles around the ruckus their romance caused. Accepting this made it easier to put logic aside to buy into Rhimes' increasingly wild plotting. Here, too, suspending rationale is key to enjoying inane storylines that tie the crisis of the moment to Kate and Hal's relationship status. The Diplomat joins a lineup of shows that make little sense but are entertaining because of it, including Apple TV's Hijack and Netflix's The Night Agent.

Season three ups the ante by putting physical distance between the pair, leading to Kate kissing Foreign Secretary Austin Dennison (David Gyasi) after two seasons' worth of buildup. Then, a five-month time jump reveals she's secretly banging the British spy who's informing her about a nuclear weapon. This complex triangle gives The Diplomat further ammunition for soapy hijinks. And they aren't the only turbulent couple dialing up unnecessary drama. After welcoming TWW‘s Janney, Cahn reunites with Bradley Whitford, who plays the exasperated First Gentleman. And boy does he hate the close bond his wife and her new VP have formed. He assumes they're sleeping with each other when, in reality, they've stolen a weapon from Russia. Kate puts two and two together, immediately regretting her decision to reunite with Hal in the finale. And with both couples barreling toward doom, it looks like The Diplomat has teed up an even sillier fourth season.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Former Vice President Dick Cheney dies at 84","https://www.avclub.com/dick-cheney-dies-vice-president-george-bush","Tue, 04 Nov 2025 15:39:00 GMT","

Former Vice President Dick Cheney, who served under George W. Bush and stood as a key figure in the administration's response to the 9/11 attacks and ensuing “war on terror,” died Monday night. According to a statement from Cheney's family (via The Hollywood Reporter), the Republican politician's death was caused by complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease. “His beloved wife of 61 years, Lynne, his daughters, Liz and Mary, and other family members were with him as he passed,” the statement read. “Dick Cheney was a great and good man who taught his children and grandchildren to love our country, and to live lives of courage, honor, love, kindness, and fly fishing. We are grateful beyond measure for all Dick Cheney did for our country. And we are blessed beyond measure to have loved and been loved by this noble giant of a man.” He was 84.

Cheney is widely considered to be one of the most powerful vice presidents in history. After beginning his career in public service under President Nixon in 1969, Cheney would go on to serve under Gerald Ford, spend a decade in the House of Representatives, and serve as George H.W. Bush's secretary of defense, before joining the younger Bush's ticket in 2000. Cheney played a larger role than many VPs before him, especially in the wake of 9/11. The VP “was, in effect, the chief operating officer of the younger Bush's presidency,” AP writes. He was a key architect of the Bush administration's response to the attacks and helped implement multiple policy decisions—including the expanded use of surveillance and detention—that set the stage for the invasion of Iraq in 2003. 

While Cheney's political career came to an end when Bush left office in 2009—by then the VP's approval ranking had sunk to 13 percent, People reports—he remained in the public eye in the years following. More recently, he joined his daughter, former Republican Representative Liz Cheney, in denouncing Donald Trump. “In our nation's 246-year history, there has never been an individual who was a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,” he said in a television ad for Liz. “He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him. He is a coward.”

In 2018, Cheney became the subject of Adam McKay's Oscar-nominated film Vice, in which he was played by Christian Bale. Bale was also nominated for his performance.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Seth Meyers responds to being called a ""deranged lunatic"" by President Trump","https://www.avclub.com/seth-meyers-responds-trump-post-deranged-lunatic","Tue, 04 Nov 2025 15:32:00 GMT","

On Monday's episode of Late Night With Seth Meyers, the host took a Closer Look at President Donald Trump's obsessive bathroom renovation, completed while the government is shut down and millions of Americans are about to lose their SNAP benefits. That issue matters, Meyers said, adding, “What matters far less is when the president posts about me, which he did over the weekend, saying among other things that I ‘may be the least talented person to perform live in the history of television,' calling me a ‘deranged lunatic,' and commenting that I ‘talked endlessly about electric catapults on aircraft carriers.”  

Nevertheless, the Saturday Night Live alum took a little time to address Trump's petty post. “Look, in general, I try to live by the New Yorker's creed: When someone is ranting and raving about you, ignore them. Chances are, they're just going to move on and rave about something else. But there's one thing I simply have to address,” he said. “You can say I'm untalented. You can say I'm deranged. But I'm not the one who talks endlessly about catapults on aircraft carriers!” Cue clips of Trump speaking engagements going back to 2019 talking about the catapults—it seems he's almost as obsessed with catapults as he is with bathroom renovations. “Until you said something, I didn't even know aircraft carriers had catapults,” Meyers said indignantly.

The host acknowledged that Trump's insults and complaints about the show (which included that Meyers' criticism is “PROBABLY ILLEGAL!!!”) are protected as a first amendment right—”Which I have too, right? We all have it, right?” Meyers double-checked. He noted that the president's recent post claimed he had just watched Late Night for the first time in “years,” when 10 months ago Trump posted that he “got stuck” watching the show for the first time in “months.” If there's something that obsesses Trump more than bathrooms and catapults, it's his enemies in the media. 

“I say this with sincerity, I don't wanna talk about catapults. I don't wanna talk about bathrooms. And I'm realizing that I'm starting to sound like a deranged lunatic, but that's what you do to us. You make us talk about what you're talking about, and then we all sound crazy,” Meyers said. “But what we should be talking about instead is the government shutdown you're not solving or the food assistance you refuse to fund. Working families are struggling while you renovate your bathroom and you build your ballroom and that's why your approval ratings are in the toilet.”

The news of legendary actress Diane Ladd's death on November 3, 2025, prompted an outpouring of love from Hollywood peers and admirers. Among those grieving Ladd's passing at 89 are her many Hallmark Channel co-stars and fans. 

Ladd appeared on all six seasons of Hallmark's “Chesapeake Shores” from 2016 to 2022, playing beloved family matriarch Nell O'Brien, mother to the late Treat Williams' character, Mick O'Brien. Members of her Hallmark family quickly began paying tribute to the Golden Globe-winning actress after her real-life daughter, actress Laura Dern, announced her death. 

Meghan Ory, who played Abby O'Brien on “Chesapeake Shores,” posted an Instagram photo of her, Ladd and Barbara Niven on the set and wrote above it, “Love you Diane … You had the best advice and the best stories. A true Icon. Rest in peace my friend.” 

With Sarah McLachlan's “Angel” playing in the background, Ory reiterated in her caption, “A true icon @rosedianeladd You will be greatly missed. Rest in peace 🪽❤️”

Emilie Ullerup, who played Bree O'Brien on the show, posted a photo in her Instagram Stories of Ladd with her on set, gently rubbing her temples. 

“We lost a warrior today. Funny, wise, strong and full of light and life,” Ulleup wrote, and continued beneath the photo, “Here trying to heal my migraine between setups. Always one to help. 🤍 Rest easy my friend. You have earned it. (Though I'm certain you're already busy up there)” 

In June 2023, when Williams died in a tragic motorcyle accident, Ladd paid tribute to him on Instagram, posting a photo of them together and writing, “Treat Williams is one of our greatest actors and human beings. He was my Co-star in Hallmark's TV series, ‘Chesapeake Shores' and a loved friend of mine & my daughter (co-starred in ‘Smooth Talk') who will be missed by us more than words can say!” 

Upon learning of Ladd's death, Williams' family shared two photos of her. Over one, they wrote, “Sending love❤️❤️” and over another, of her with Williams, they wrote, “‘With the gifted Diane Ladd' – T.W.”  

A “Chesapeakes Shores” Instagram fan page that's still very active for its nearly 45,000 followers posted a tribute to Ladd that said, “It's with heavy hearts that we share the news of the passing of our beloved Diane Ladd. Let's keep her family in our thoughts and prayers. Forever our Nell O'Briend.” 

In the account's stories, the administrators shared the post in their Stories and wrote, “Forever our Gran!  🤍” 

Many fans commented on the post, including one who wrote, “I am sad she is gone but relieved she is out of her earthly pain. She was a superb actress and I loved her in Chesapeake Shores!”

Another fan shared, “Beautiful lady. May she rest in peace. Treat will be there to meet her at heavens gate 🙏💕🌸”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Mary-Kate & Ashley Olsen Make Rare, Matching Appearance Together: VIDEO","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/mary-kate-and-ashley-now-cfda/","Tue, 04 Nov 2025 16:11:03 GMT","

Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen thrilled their fans last night, November 3, by making a joint appearance in matching outfits at the 2025 CFDA (Council of Fashion Designers of America) Awards. The 39-year-old twins, famous for their iconic '90s and early 2000's videos such as “To Grandmother's House We Go” and “New York Minute,” skipped the red carpet, but appeared onstage together and made a speech to accept the American Accessory Designer of the Year award for their luxury brand The Row.

Rihanna and A$AP Rocky also attended the ceremony, marking their first red carpet appearance since Rihanna gave birth their third child in September.

See a video Mary-Kate and Ashley's speech at the 2025 CFDA awards below.

The elusive twins, who have kept a super low profile since wrapping up their acting days, were photographed together this summer at their The Row store in the Hamptons. They were also seen side by side posing with Sara Moonves, the editor-in-chief of W Magazine, at New York Fashion Week in September. 

When Mary-Kate and Ashley stepped up to the microphone to accept their award, one of them thanked boutiques and individual buyers, saying, “You have been our guiding light for the last 20 years now.” She also dedicated the award “to our amazing customers, who truly give us the opportunity to do what we love.” She went on, “From the bottom of our hearts, thank you. And lastly, to our friends and family. Without your support, we would not be here today. So thank you for giving us the love and kindness that allows us to show up to work each day.

The girls smiled at each other before carrying their trophy off stage. One of the twins' hair was loosely pulled back and tucked under her black coat, while the other wore her golden locks flowing around her shoulders. 

Women's Wear Daily says the Olsen twins beat out Ana Khouri, Catherine Holstein for Khaite, Raul Lopez for Luar and Tory Burch in the category for American Accessory Designer of the Year.

Mary-Kate and Ashley became America's youngest sweethearts in their joint role as Michelle Tanner on “Full House,” a job they started in 1987 when they were just a year old.

Afterwards, they released their own series of adorable sing-along videos before cornering the teen and tween market in films like “Getting There” and “Holiday In the Sun.”

So why did they quit acting? Ultimately, they pivoted to fashion and seem hyper-focused on their high-end line, The Row. British Vogue says the brand, founded in 2006, allowed the young designers to “break into the upper echelons of the luxury fashion sphere is a feat that few new brands achieve.”

Why? We could have gone decades without thinking about them at all. Why ruin that for everyone by pushing PR pics?

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","'Sexiest Man Alive' Jonathan Bailey's Relationship History: From Rumored Boyfriend to Private Love Life","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/jonathan-bailey-boyfriend-relationship-history/","Tue, 04 Nov 2025 14:59:05 GMT","

Jonathan Bailey, People's newly crowned “Sexiest Man Alive,” has had a huge few years. The British actor stole hearts as Anthony Bridgerton on Netflix's “Bridgerton,” starred as Fiyero in 2024's “Wicked,” and will return this November in the sequel, “Wicked: For Good.”

Off-screen, Bailey has opened up about love, being “proudly gay,” and what it means to live authentically while guarding his private life.

Bailey is famously private about who he's dating, but he's shared glimpses over the years. In 2019, The Mirror reported that he was spotted kissing advertising executive James Ellis before the Olivier Awards, where he later won Best Actor in a Supporting Role. The two were seen together again in 2021 but never confirmed a relationship.

In 2023, Bailey told The Evening Standard he was in a relationship but wouldn't share details. “There's a lovely man,” he said. “It's not secret, but it's private. Having a private life is, for me, completely critical. I don't know if I would be able to be as confident to speak out on other things if I felt that my whole life was up for grabs.”

Bailey has also been candid about what it took to be open about his sexuality.

“Of course I thought that in order to be happy I needed to be straight,” he told GQ in 2022. “I reached a point where I thought, (expletive) this, I'd much prefer to hold my boyfriend's hand in public or be able to put my own face picture on Tinder and not be so concerned about that than getting a part.”

At the 2019 Olivier Awards, Bailey used his acceptance speech to talk about representation. “At a time where acknowledging the very existence of LGBTQ people in our schools is being questioned, we have been able to show a lovely and celebratory snapshot of gay love,” he said. “That LGBTQ people really aren't that different.”

Now 36, Bailey continues to balance fame and privacy. In a 2025 British Vogue interview, he admitted he's been thinking about fatherhood. “Yes, it's such a privilege for a man,” he said. “But I can't bring children into my lifestyle now. I want to make sure I'm going to be present. I'm reading books on adoption. I might coparent with a woman, but I'm thinking it will be with a man.”

Scarlett Johansson and Bailey are cozy costars. The British actor, 37, and the Marvel star, 40, appeared together at the New York premiere of their movie “Jurassic World Rebirth” on June 23, alongside castmates Mahershala Ali and Rupert Friend.

Johansson and Bailey turned heads when they shared a quick peck on the lips before posing for photographers. When asked about the moment, Bailey told Entertainment Tonight, “I believe in being able to show love in all different ways. And if you can't kiss your friends… life's too short not to.”

In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Bailey reflected on his role in the film and what it means to headline such a major project as an out gay actor. “There's moments where, yes, you have to be excellent to prove that you can do it,” he said. “And it's not like I haven't felt that. There's the weight of history. And there's endless brilliant people who have come before you who have changed the way that people see sexuality.”

He continued, “Any sort of sense of prejudice against sexuality is something to fight against, and what better way to do that than to go and play any kind of character. Being an out gay actor, historically, meant that you wouldn't be able to play straight and there weren't any gay parts to play anyway. That's obviously changed massively.”

Bruce Dern is honoring the memory of his late ex-wife, legendary actress Diane Ladd, with a moving tribute following her passing at age 89. “Diane was a tremendous actress and I feel like, a bit of a ‘hidden treasure' until she ran into David Lynch,” Dern, 89, shared in a statement to Us Weekly on November 3. 

“When he cast her as Laura's mom in ‘Wild at Heart,' it felt like the world then really understood her brilliance. She was a great value as a decades-long board member of SAG, giving a real actress' point of view.”

Ladd's daughter, actress Laura Dern, confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter that her mother had died peacefully at her home in Ojai, California. Her cause of death has not been publicly revealed.

With his heartfelt words, Dern honored not only Ladd's remarkable career but also her remarkable spirit as an artist, mother, and advocate for fellow actors. 

In his statement, Dern reflected on Ladd's grace, humor, and deep devotion to her family. “She lived a good life,” he said. 

“She saw everything the way it was. She was a great teammate to her fellow actors. She was funny, clever, gracious. But most importantly to me, she was a wonderful mother to our incredible wunderkind daughter. And for that I will be forever grateful to her.”

Dern and Ladd were married from 1960 to 1969 and shared two daughters: Laura and Diane. 

Their firstborn, Diane, tragically died in 1962 after a drowning accident at just 18 months old, a loss that would shape both parents profoundly.

Ladd spoke candidly about the heartbreak of losing her first child in her memoir Honey, Baby, Mine. “If you lose a child, it's very hard to cope,” she wrote. 

“We were struggling actors. We could hardly make it. We had to stay in the same house where she died because we couldn't afford to leave. His family could have helped us, but they didn't.”

Ladd later married William A. Shea Jr. from 1969 to 1977 and found lasting love with Robert Charles Hunter, whom she married on Valentine's Day in 1999. The couple remained together until Hunter died in 2023.

Despite their divorce, Ladd and Dern stayed close and even shared the screen multiple times, including in “The Wild Angels,” “The Rebel Rousers,” “Mrs. Munck,” and “American Cowslip.”

In 2010, Ladd, Dern, and their daughter, Laura, made history as the first family to receive adjoining stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

At the ceremony, Ladd's acceptance speech captured her signature grace and gratitude. 

“I ask the universe that these three stars right here — when I'm dead and gone or if I'm still alive — that whoever comes and looks at it or stands on it, may the energy of the three of our lives permeate into their foundation and help each and every one fulfill their destiny with joy and love,” she said.

The Dern couple are very talented character actor that made stars like Clint Eastwood look good. A real Hollywood family.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","The Beautiful Family Diane Ladd Leaves Behind","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/diane-ladd-daughter-family-laura-dern/","Tue, 04 Nov 2025 11:59:06 GMT","

Laura Dern is mourning the loss of her beloved mother, actress Diane Ladd. Ladd died on November 3. She was 89. This is a closer look at the beautiful bond the pair shared and a glimpse of a few happy times. 

Ladd had an incredible career, including earning three prestigious Academy Award nominations for her work in the films “Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,” “Wild at Heart,” and “Rambling Rose.” But she was also a mother. 

She had two daughters with actor Bruce Dern. Their first daughter, Diane Elizabeth Dern, tragically passed away in a drowning accident in 1962. She was under the care of a babysitter at the time and was just 18 months old. 

“She fell into the pool. She hit her head and knocked herself out. And it all happened instantly. And she died, and you will never get over that,” Ladd told CBS News in May 2023 of her first daughter's passing. “I don't care what you say to yourself. I don't care who says what. The child is not supposed to die before the parent.” 

Ladd and her then-husband later welcomed Laura, who was born in 1967. Ladd and Laura shared a beautiful, close relationship, and it was the actress who confirmed her mother's passing in a heartfelt statement.  

​​“She was the greatest daughter, mother, grandmother, actress, artist, and empathetic spirit that only dreams could have seemingly created,” Laura told The Hollywood Reporter in a statement. “We were blessed to have her. She is flying with her angels now.”

In April 2023, the pair even published a book, “Honey, Baby, Mine: A Mother and Daughter Talk Life, Death, Love (and Banana Pudding).” 

They were often photographed attending events together, and tender moments, like them embracing, were captured on film. The two actresses also shared the screen several times, usually playing mother and daughter, and Ladd was immensely proud of this. 

“I'm proud of Laura because she's an incredible talent and an incredible actress and, in my own opinion, she's an incredible, gracious human being who cares a lot about mankind,” Ladd said of working with her daughter, People reports. 

Ladd was also a grandmother to two grandchildren. Dern shares Ellery Walker and Jaya Harper with her ex-husband Ben Harper.

“Happy Birthday,” a gem out of the Tribeca Film Festival, has a real chance to become the first film selected by Egypt to make it onto the Oscar shortlist for Best International Feature, and IndieWire has an exclusive look at the film's trailer.

The drama about an eight-year-old girl desperate to share a birthday wish with her best friend Nelly, in spite of circumstances that are far too complicated for children their age, serves as the directorial debut of Sarah Goher, who most recently was a consulting producer on the Marvel Cinematic Universe limited series “Moon Knight” starring Oscar Isaac and Ethan Hawke.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






In addition to winning the awards for Best International Narrative Feature, Best Screenplay in an International Narrative Feature, and the Nora Ephron Award, meant to honor an exceptional female filmmaker who represents the spirit and vision of the legendary filmmaker and writer, at Tribeca this year, “Happy Birthday” is produced by Oscar-winning actor Jamie Foxx.

“Our hope is that more and more people will get to see this powerful film. It is masterful storytelling by a fresh new voice in film,” said Foxx and his producing partner Datari Turner, president of Foxxhole productions, to IndieWire via statement. Some of their company's recent successes include dual documentaries “Number One on the Call Sheet,” Netflix blockbuster “Back in Action,” Sundance favorite “Luther: Never Too Much,” and “They Cloned Tyrone” from debut feature director Juel Taylor.

“Happy Birthday” was written by Goher and her frequent collaborator Mohamed Diab, whose own film “Clash” was submitted by Egypt for Oscar consideration in 2016. The film is based on her experience visiting her grandmother in Egypt, and tackles the subjects of class, empathy, and the fragile bonds that connect us, through the eyes of a young domestic worker in Cairo. It has also earned the film the Audience Award for the Mind the Gap section at the Mill Valley Film Festival, and the Grand Narrative Prize at the Heartland Film Festival.

While Egypt has been submitting films for consideration in the Best International Feature category since 1958, starting with Youssef Chahine's “Cairo Station,” which is in the Criterion Collection, “Happy Birthday” would be the first film from the North African country to make the shortlist, should all go in its favor come December.

 










Watch the trailer for “Happy Birthday,” a IndieWire exclusive, below.

“Happy Birthday” premiered at the 2025 Tribeca Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Earlier this year, IndieWire shared a report that an enormous amount of AI production companies have launched within the last three years. Not all of those were created equal, but the ones that stand out — and potentially have staying power in Hollywood — have noticeably been backed by other major industry players.

On Tuesday, November 4, Obsidian Studio announced its launch with a goal of blending live-action film projects with AI-powered digital production. And it will be kicking things off with a big name behind it, care of a creative partnership with Brian Grazer and Ron Howard's Imagine Entertainment.

 










Obsidian co-founders Wes Walker and Louis Gheysens, in a conversation with IndieWire, said they'll be producing several long-form projects, including a feature film project, for Imagine and in partnership with Howard, with whom Walker developed a friendship over the last year. Obsidian has, throughout 2025, quietly been working with various brands, including Louis Vuitton, Longchamp, Crayola, Aramco, Amazon, NBA, and ESPN, but the partnership with Imagine will allow Obsidian to expand into original narrative projects.

“Advertising moves at an incredibly rapid pace. This year we were really blessed to do really high budget, beautiful commercials. And the speed at which we move, the pace at which we're able to create, the openness to technology, the openness to try things, that's really what's incredible about advertising: we can really push boundaries together alongside some of the best teams in the world,” Walker said. “We're taking and researching and studying what we're learning in advertising, bringing that into the entertainment space, and then using that to serve Imagine Entertainment projects.”

“At Imagine, we are committed to emotionally resonant, human storytelling and we have already seen the ways AI can be a beneficial tool in that mission. Obsidian's artist-led approach is exactly the kind of collaboration we stand behind to amplify human creativity and we're excited to be working with them,” said Justin Wilkes, President of Imagine Entertainment, in a statement.

Obsidian has two proprietary tools it uses, one called EchoChrome that is designed to enhance image quality of low bit depth AI video and bring it into high-level VFX productions. Walker said, for campaigns for Cadillac and Mercedes, they've been able to incorporate AI into 3D volume stage backgrounds in order to blend live action and AI-generated CG.

 










The other is called DigitalForge, and it refers to how Obsidian uses AI by integrating it into the production workflow. The company has recruited two storyboard artists, Marc Vena and Tani Kunitake, who have worked on films like “Black Panther,” “Logan,” “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” and more, and will train models based on their work to then build further worlds based on those creations. Walker describes being able to prompt AI ideas in real-time on set, to edit in real-time, and that “AI is not post; AI is production.”

“Our approach is really about amplifying what artists can do, amplifying what DPs can do, amplifying what storyboard artists can do through the technology, and then creating worlds from that,” he said. 

Walker stresses that Imagine did not become fascinated with Obsidian's work just because of AI, but because of the work they're doing with VFX in other tools like Unreal Engine, Maya, Blender, and Houdini. He added that generative AI is not always the best tool for every project.

“We are artists working alongside artists. Everyone in the team is a high level artist, and we really believe that passionate, disciplined creatives are the world builders. We have the ability to to see,” Walker said. “That in service of other directors is really where the magic happens for us as directors. We know what other directors go through. We know the struggles that they have in bringing their visions to life… the tech and the tools don't matter. What matters is the audience experience. What matters next is the story and the emotion that the story is bringing about. And then we utilize the tech in service of that.”

Lauded British photojournalist Alisdair Macdonald was many things: A long-time employee of the Daily Mirror, a well-known documenter of The Beatles, and a celebrated falconer. He was also a beloved father, and when he suddenly passed away in 2007, his child, the writer Helen Macdonald (who identifies as non-binary) took the shock particularly hard.

In 2014, Macdonald published “H Is for Hawk,” a deep-feeling memoir about their grief, and how they attempted to heal it by adopting and training a young Eurasian goshawk, in the spirit of their falconer father. The book was a smash, a best-seller that won the Samuel Johnson Prize and Costa Book of the Year award.

Now, nearly 20 years after the loss of the man who inspired it, the story of Alisdair, Helen, and Mabel the goshawk has gotten the big screen treatment. Directed by Philippa Lowthorpe with a script by Lowthorpe and “Room” author Emma Donoghue, the film casts Claire Foy as Helen (and a clearly very talented raptor as Mabel). The film also stars Denise Gough, Sam Spruell, and Lindsay Duncan.Per the film's official synopsis, “‘H Is for Hawk' follows Helen (Foy), who, after the sudden death of her father (Brendan Gleeson), loses herself in the memories of their time birding and exploring the natural world together and turns the ancient art of falconry — rooted in European tradition — training a wild goshawk named Mabel to navigate her profound loss. But as she teaches Mabel to hunt and fly free, Helen discovers how deeply she has neglected her own emotions and life. What begins as an act of endurance transforms into an intimate journey of resilience and healing.”

The film premiered at Telluride in September, where our own David Ehrlich wrote in his review that the film “comes alive during the frequent scenes of Helen training Mabel to trust her, to come back to her when she calls, and eventually to hunt with her. The bond doesn't form overnight. At first, Foy plays Helen like someone who has an apache gunship-like killing machine strapped to her arm, and though the actress underwent extensive training for the role, you get the sense that it probably wasn't a struggle for her to get into character during these scenes. Like Tom Cruise driving a motorcycle off a cliff or Werner Herzog pulling a steamship over a hill (not personally, but you know what I mean), there's a visceral thrill to the undeniable fact of what Foy is doing.”Roadside Attractions will release “H Is for Hawk” in December for a one-week qualifying run, with a nationwide rollout to follow on January 23, 2026.

Most creator projects still live (and die) online. Creator Camp wants to change that.

The Austin-based creator collective distribution arm, Camp Studios, signed a three-picture theatrical deal with Attend Theatrical Marketplace, the Fithian Group company that connects filmmakers directly with movie theaters, streamlining the process of booking and releasing films.

The first title, rom-com “Two Sleepy People,” opens November 14 in 20 markets. It's directed by Baron Ryan, who co-wrote it with Caroline Grossman; they both star. (More here.) The premise is very TikTok-adjacent: Two distant co-workers wake up every morning as strangers, but every night they're married.

The real bet is if creators already know their audience, why can't that audience show up to a cinema?

Creator Camp says its network of 300 digital-native filmmakers accounts for over 3B annual views. They've already been pressure-testing theatrical demand: the film premiered at Creator Camp's flagship Austin event, where 1,000 attendees generated $150,000 in ticket sales. A four-city micro-tour followed in Seattle, Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York, averaging $10,429 per screen.

 










Attend is led by NATO veterans Jackie Brenneman, John Fithian, and Patrick Corcoran, with the ambition to use data and AI to directly match films with theaters and audiences.

So, in theory: Attend wants to make theatrical distribution transactional and demand-based; Creator Camp has creators who can actually deliver audiences.

“Today's filmmakers grew up online and they understand their audiences because they engage with them constantly, which has allowed them to build massive, loyal communities,” said Creator Camp founder and CEO Max Reisinger. “That direct connection solves a huge challenge in theatrical distribution. Instead of relying on outdated models that guess who will show up, our creators can bring fans to theaters they've already cultivated online, turning digital engagement into real-world box office success.”

Brenneman sees it as smart math. “Movie theaters are vital places for community. When the movies are there, so are audiences. In partnership with the innovative approach of Creator Camp, we can build on the enthusiastic followers of filmmakers online, connect them directly to theaters, and with Attend create demand-driven theatrical releases.”

For all the existential dread around the theatrical business, it's a forward-looking model that relies on conversion and community.

 










That's a little different from “finding an audience”; it's believing that the audience is already here; you just need to point them at a screen. It suggests that the future of filmmaking might not be “online vs theatrical”; it could be online to theatrical, when the community wants it.

“Two Sleepy People” opens November 14; more markets are contingent on demand signals. Tickets and theater requests at twosleepypeople.com.

Snocaps, the new indie-rock band led by twin sisters Katie and Allison Crutchfield, with accompaniment by MJ Lenderman and longtime Waxahatchee producer Brad Cook, have announced their first-ever tour. Check out their full list of tour dates below.

Days after surprise-releasing their debut self-titled album, Snocaps are rolling out the details on their first-ever concerts. Spread across three cities, Snocaps' mini tour begins at Chicago's Thalia Hall, on December 1 and 2, where they're joined by Cloakroom and Graham Hunt, respectively. Next, the band heads to Los Angeles' Teragram Ballroom, on December 4 and 5, with openers Slippers and Mike Krol. Snocaps then conclude the run at New York's Bowery Ballroom, on December 7 and 8, with Brennan Wedl and Ryan Davis & the Roadhouse Band.

Katie and Allison Crutchfield have a long history of playing music together. Before breaking out in their bands Waxahatchee and Swearin', respectively, the sisters recorded lo-fi music together in P.S. Eliot, which dissolved in the early 2010s, and Bad Banana, their similarly short-lived project. Both Cook and Lenderman have played music with Katie Crutchfield before, too, although not in those bands. Cook has spent years working behind the board on many Waxahatchee records, while Lenderman collaborated with Katie Crutchfield on Tigers Blood—most notably on the single “Right Back to It.”

She doesn't always emerge unscathed, but at least she's alive. Each new Florence and the Machine album opens on Florence Welch in the aftermath of a tsunami, attempting to make sense of her circumstances as she prepares to charge forth into the unknown. The London band's sixth album, Everybody Scream, is again dedicated to finding strength in release from physical and psychological inhibitions. If you're a fan of the band's arena-pop baroque, you'll get what you came for: horizon-spanning anthems of resilience furnished with cinematic strings, gargantuan drums, and, yes, the occasional scream. Nearly every song rests on this sturdy foundation, and Welch's voice ignites each into a raging wildfire.

“There's a feeling of dying a little bit, every time I make a record,” Welch told The Guardian earlier this year. “And, this time, I nearly died.” That's not hyperbole: While touring Dance Fever in 2023, Welch underwent life-saving surgery, which she's now revealed was due to massive internal bleeding caused by an ectopic pregnancy. The trauma of miscarriage is evident in the fury that fuels Everybody Scream: “Sometimes my body seems so alien to me,” Welch sings over the steady chug of “Kraken,” sounding despairingly numb before transforming into a creature of wrath. On “The Old Religion,” she dreams of immateriality, yearning to be free of her physical self so long as it means relief from pain.

Swelling strings, sweeping choruses, and Welch's mythical timbre abound. Idles' Mark Bowen and the National's Aaron Dessner handle the bulk of the album's production (though Mitski makes a cameo on the title track and “Buckle”). Bowen's influence suggests itself in a slightly more raucous approach, at least by Florence and the Machine standards. The opening title track springs from cascading harp to monstrous drones as it celebrates the safe haven of the concert hall, much like Dance Fever's “Free.” Perhaps Welch's whiteboard musings—notably one that read “Swans vs Adele”—inspired a batch of songs with a primordial edge. The clearest example, “Drink Deep,” drives a drill into the earth's core as Welch's quivering melisma becomes an incantation, somewhat like the ominous commands of Michael Gira.

Both of these songs expand on Welch's phantasmagoric catalog, though that titular scream does feel a bit too polished for a song that demands an animal wail. On several songs, Welch uses the hero's journey as a framework; once you recognize it in her writing, you begin to hear it in the instrumental arrangements, too. It works on “The Old Religion,” which opens with her voice alone over a dusty piano. A ticking guitar joins in as she details a fall from grace; layered vocals transform her declaration that “you can't outrun yourself” into a rallying cry. But later on “You Can Have It All,” the result isn't nearly as interesting, if only because you've heard it just a few songs before.

Surprisingly the album's most successful song is the six-and-half-minute-long “One of the Greats,” which builds and builds and finally bursts, only dropping in a layered chorus and Tom Moth's harp arrangement in its final act. As growling guitar and drums kick in, Welch purges, well, everything: creative insecurities; the itching dilemma that she's built a career on hysteria at the cost of perpetuating her pain; her grievances with male entitlement—how do they keep getting away with making subpar records? Vivid and free-associative, it sounds like an argument she's been having with herself for years.

On an album full of infernos, “One of the Greats” is one of the few songs to stand apart: Its ambition and vulnerability come closest to fulfilling Everybody Scream's mission to let it all out. Welch spends a sizable portion of the album ready to burn everything down, and she's been here often enough to know that she can always rebuild. “Come on, I can take it,” she howls on “Sympathy Magic,” ready to pounce on whatever disaster pummels her next, as scratchy horns morph into an elephant stampede. “Give me everything you got.” There's no fast track to healing: the only way is to get through.

You could hear in his voice that Big L knew he was destined to become a legend. Beneath the hunger, the anger, and the near-frantic aggression was the unshakeable confidence of the kind of person who slides on sunglasses while strolling away from an explosion. L had a preternatural talent, his slick, smarmy flow sluicing over beats, each verse a knotted rope of multisyllabic rhyme schemes and disturbingly clever punchlines. He was a heat-seeking missile, a force that left craters in freestyle sessions and struck fear in other rappers' hearts. Nas is on record saying as much: “Big L scared me to death. When I heard that on tape, I was scared to death. I was like, ‘There's no way I can compete if this is what I gotta compete with.'”

Born Lamont Coleman in 1974, the young Harlem MC rose quickly and burned bright. He joined Diggin' in the Crates in 1991 as a teenager, signed with Columbia in '93, and released his first album, Lifestyles Ov Da Poor and Dangerous, to critical acclaim in 1995. L was on the cusp of becoming New York rap royalty, getting cosigns from and trading verses with Jay-Z, touring Europe with O.C., and earning the adoration of nearly every DJ, radio personality, and culture carrier in the city. As the hype around his nascent career grew, L started a label, Flamboyant Entertainment, and began work on his second album, The Big Picture. There was talk of him signing to Roc-A-Fella. All signs pointed to a lengthy, storied career. Then, on February 18, 1999, L was killed in a drive-by shooting near 139th Street and Lenox Avenue, the area he referred to as “The Danger Zone.” He was 24.

The posthumous record is a tricky, seldom successful endeavor. Big L's first posthumous record, The Big Picture, was a rare exception, benefitting from the fact that he'd been working on it for two years before he passed. It was polished and nearly seamless; the guest appearances felt natural, the tone consistent. But L was young and didn't leave an enormous vault of material. There's a trove of his radio freestyles, but almost all have been circulating on Soulseek and YouTube for at least two decades. Whatever was left of his archive was picked over, remixed, or cut-and-pasted into “new” songs on 2010's 139 & Lenox and 2011's The Danger Zone. Harlem's Finest: Return of the King, Big L's fourth posthumous record, and the latest entry in Mass Appeal's Legend Has It series, shows that the well is running dry. It's a tonally confusing collection that sometimes scans as reverent homage but often comes across as hollow and perfunctory.

One of the strangest things about Harlem's Finest is how out of time it feels. The production team, overseen by Big L's estate and Royce Da 5'9"" (whose connection to L, aside from a stylistic influence, is unclear), doesn't hone in on a specific sound. Though he made music for less than a decade, L came up during a rapidly shifting rap landscape, as prevailing styles morphed from the jazzy, sample-collaged boom bap into the jiggy era's sleeker, more opulent sounds. There's a haphazard attempt here to reference the entirety of the '90s without digging into what made its movements interesting, giving Harlem's Finest the vibe of an iTunes playlist cobbled together from bootlegged MP3s. Some choices work, like the glowering, Conductor Williams-helmed “Fred Samuel Playground,” which underscores how formative L's music was for rappers like Rome Streetz and Conway the Machine, or “How Will I Make It,” a classic New York breaks-and-basslines jam which sounds rescued from the Lifestylez sessions' cutting-room floor. But rote noir-rap beats like “u ain't gotta chance” and “Doo Wop Freestyle '99” are limp and two-dimensional, drained of all color and pizzazz. Almost every song has multiple producers, and you get the sense that these tracks were crafted by a remote email committee.

Then there's the issue of L's vocals. Many of his verses are lifted from radio freestyles, necessitating some audio trickery to strip out the background and create usable a capellas. This gives them an uncanny character, full of the watery top-end you get from a screen recording, as on “u aint gotta chance,” or muffled and distant, like the verse used for “Grants Tomb '97.” It's distracting, especially when Nas or Joey Bada$$ come in, sounding expensive and sitting pristinely in the mix. Lyrically, L is mesmerizing, frozen in time at the peak of his technical powers. What felt cutting edge in '95 is still razor sharp 30 years later; aside from some era-specific tells that range from funny (“My clan plans to get Giuliani hung” from “7 Minute Freestyle”) to wincingly brutal (the not-infrequent use of the F-slur), the uninitiated might think Big L was currently active. He raps circles around every guest, all of whom (save Method Man and Herb McGruff, who both spit vigorous, spry verses, and Errol Holden, whose solo track “Big Lee & Reg” is clear-eyed and chilling) seem unsure of themselves, happy to be on a track with an icon but confined by this narrow view of L's oeuvre.

If you're already a fan, you've likely heard almost every verse here, either from low-quality rips or on another posthumous L record. It's intriguing to listen to him on more modern production, but most of it is too indistinct to hint at where he could have gone. If you're new to Big L, you won't leave with a profound understanding of his artistry; Harlem's Finest is more of a showcase for his pyrotechnics than the depth of his songwriting. There are some bright spots—it's a genuine joy to have a high-quality recording of “7 Minute Freestyle,” L and Jay-Z's breathtaking 1995 back-and-forth on the Stretch & Bobbito show, and “How Will I Make It” is an excellent example of L's ability to blend catchy hooks and dead-eyed nihilism. But the misfires are rough. “Forever,” the Frankensteined Mac Miller “collab,” is both saccharine and grotesque, naked anemoia bait that makes hackneyed use of the Honey Drippers break. The single-verse, unfinished-sounding “All Alone” casts itself as the record's ladies' jam (something L might have scoffed at), but its sunny beat and R&B hook butt heads with L's disconsolate lyrics.

The question becomes: Why does this exist? In the mid-2010s, Donald Phinazee, L's older brother and curator of The Danger Zone, sold the rights to that album and The Big Picture as well as L's rhymebooks. Mike Herard, who heads L's estate and helped put The Big Picture together, sees Harlem's Finest as a means to secure the rights to all of L's other recordings, specifically his freestyles. It reportedly took eight years to staple this record together, but the results feel so inorganic that it's difficult to gauge how it expands L's legacy. A compilation of those freestyle appearances would be more revealing of his explosive technique and livewire presence, but here, yanked from their original context, they feel thin and vacant. The posthumous releases now vastly outnumber L's original output, and all overlap slightly, which risks diluting his initial impact. Big L was a phenom who left an indelible mark on hip-hop history, but Harlem's Finest doesn't find a new way to tell that story.

People has named British actor Jonathan Bailey as their “Sexiest Man of the Year.” The news was revealed on The Tonight Show by host Jimmy Fallon, who called out Bailey's work this year in both Wicked: For Good and Jurassic World Rebirth.


	“It's an honor of a lifetime,” Bailey told Fallon. “And I want to say, Jimmy, thank you so much for turning it down so that I could be here.”


	Fallon asked Bailey if it was difficult to keep the news a secret, but Bailey said it was “surprisingly not.” 


	“Because not that many people are going, ‘Are you…?'” he said. “We're starting the Wicked press tour and I went away with some friends just before, just to get a bit of pal time. And we went out and we had a few drinks, and I was like, ‘Guys, guys.' I was like, ‘I'm the sexiest man alive.' And they were like, ‘Yeah, yeah, do your affirmations.'”


	Fallon noted that Bailey is known as “the Internet's boyfriend.” He told Bailey that fans are always trying to cast him in various roles, including as the next James Bond and the next Batman. “Only if you're by my side,” Bailey replied. “Will you be my Moneypenny?”

	The actor also mentioned Wicked: For Good, which comes out later this month. “It's like these extraordinary people who are utilizing a lifetime of craft,” Bailey said of the sequel. “And I think it will be one of my greatest honors to support Jon M. Chu. He's an incredibly visionary director. … It's going to be emotional for everyone, but it's going to be a beautiful thing, I think.”

	In his People cover story, Bailey shared his first celebrity crush (Prince Eric from The Little Mermaid) and said the last time he was moved to tears was watching Wicked: For Good. “But beyond watching my own work, in a good way I get moved to tears by family quite a lot,” he said. “Like my niece was pupil of the week, and I was just so proud of her. And she's the eldest of the next gen of Baileys. And that made me well up. In fact, all my sisters, when they send pictures of their kids—I do find family does make me really emotional.”


Wicked: For Good is set to arrive in theaters Nov. 21. It stars Ariana Grande as Glinda and Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba. Bailey plays Prince Fiyero, while Michelle Yeoh is Madame Morrible and Jeff Goldblum is the Wizard. The rest of the cast includes Marissa Bode, Ethan Slater, Bowen Yang, and Bronwyn James.

Bob Dylan has accepted an honorary Doctor of Music degree from the Berklee College of Music, marking the first time he's received such an honor from an American college or university since 1970.


	“Thank you, Berklee College of Music, for bestowing on me this prestigious honor. What a pleasant surprise,” Dylan says in a statement. “Who knows what path my career might have taken if I'd been fortunate enough to learn from some of the great musicians who taught at Berklee. It's something to think about.”


	The school says that they are recognizing Dylan's “extraordinary influence on modern music” and “lifelong commitment to creative exploration.” “This is an incredible moment for this institution,” said Berklee President Jim Lucchese. “Bob Dylan's music has shaped how the world hears itself. He's an artist who has never stopped evolving, who keeps chasing truth through sound and language. That's the spirit we try to cultivate here every day. Honoring him feels like a reaffirmation of the creative impulse that built this place.”

	











	Adds Berklee's American Roots Music Program artistic director Matt Glaser: “Bob Dylan has spent a lifetime learning, absorbing, and transforming every American song tradition, and Berklee strives to teach all the music that Dylan loves. His deep immersion in African American blues parallels much of Berklee's curriculum, which is rooted in the distinctly American variants of the music of the African diaspora.”

	“As anyone who has read his books or listened to his hundred-plus radio programs can attest, Dylan is also a great teacher and learner,” Glaser continues. “He shows us how to keep learning about music and the arts our whole lives through, and to embrace it all as one thing. I love the anecdote Dylan himself tells: he once went up to Thelonious Monk at the Five Spot in Greenwich Village, introduced himself, and said, ‘I play folk music down the street.' Monk replied, ‘We all play folk music.'”

	Dylan dropped out of the University of Minnesota in 1959 after spending just one semester on campus, where he barely attended any classes. He accepted an honorary degree from Scotland's University of St. Andrews in 2004, but hasn't received one from an American education institution since Princeton awarded him one in 1970. Dylan attended the ceremony in person alongside David Crosby, inspiring his 1970 New Morning song “Day of the Locusts.” (The event took place while cicadas were swarming the campus.)


	“Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,” Dylan wrote in the song. “The birdies were flying from tree to tree/There was little to say, there was no conversation/As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree/And the locusts sang off in the distance/Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody/Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance/Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.”

	In his 2004 memoir Chronicles, Dylan looked back on the day. “I was glad to get the degree, though,” he wrote. “I could use it. The very look and touch and scent of it spelled respectability and had something of the spirit of the universe in it. After whispering and mumbling my way through the ceremony, I was handed the scroll. We piled back into the big Buick and drove away.”


	This time around, there are no plans for Dylan to appear at any event commemorating the honorary degree from Berklee. But the school is staging a concert on Wednesday evening entitled Watching the River Flow: A Roots Salute to Bob Dylan. It will features students, faculty, alumni, and visiting artists performing Dylan classics like “Blowin' in the Wind, “The Times They Are A-Changin',” and “Chimes of Freedom.” It will culminate in a unique rendition of “It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)” where a hand-selected group of students will take turns singing each of the 20 verses.

Mike Johnson has a reflex. When asked about a major breaking news event that is dominating headlines and conversations around Capitol Hill's proverbial water coolers — usually the president's latest authoritarian endeavor or national humiliation — Johnson defaults to pretending he has no access to the internet, newspapers, or staff who are quite literally paid to keep him informed. 


	“I don't know about that.” 


	“I just saw a headline as I walked in.” 


	“I didn't see it.” 


	“I was a little busy.” 


	The House speaker wants you to believe he lives under a rock, that he's so busy refusing to swear in duly elected members of Congress and plotting ways to strip health care and food assistance from poor people that he simply cannot be bothered to keep up with the news. It's the least believable schtick in Washington, D.C. 


	On Monday, Johnson was asked to comment on a viral clip of Trump on 60 Minutes seemingly admitting to not knowing who crypto billionaire and convicted fraudster Changpeng Zhao was before issuing him a pardon. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Johnson — who like Trump and other Republicans has indulged spurious claims that former President Joe Biden relied heavily on the use of an autopen to run his government — was asked during a Monday press conference if Trump's admission “concerned” him. 


	“I don't know anything about that. I didn't see the interview. I'm not sure,” Johnson replied. 

	











	As a one off, it might have been believable, but Johnson has used the line several times recently, throwing into stark relief how often the speaker pleads ignorance to avoid commenting on the perpetual shitstorm in the White House.


	In October, Johnson told reporters he hadn't had a chance to learn the details of Trump's reported plan to have the Justice Department gift him $230 million as a “settlement” for the prosecutions brought against him over the last several years. The next day, when asked if he's had time to apprise himself of the looming ethics nightmare at the DOJ, Johnson replied that he was “not trying to dodge the question” and that getting up to speed was “on my list of things to do.”

	Last month, Johnson claimed not to have seen Trump's speech in front of military leadership at Quantico, Virginia, where he declared he views Americans who oppose him as enemy combatants and vowed to use American cities as training grounds for the military. In July, when asked about The Wall Street Journal's internet-breaking report on a lewd letter Trump wrote to Jeffrey Epstein, Johnson claimed not to have seen the news and thus could not comment on it. In May, the speaker told reporters that the battle over Republicans' health care-gutting reconciliation package had kept him from learning about Trump's acceptance of a lavish jet (read: flying bribe) from the Qatari government. The same month, he told CNN he had no idea that the president had hosted a pay-to-attend Mar-a-Lago dinner to boost his meme coin (read: digital bribes). 


	No one buys that the House speaker — second in line to the succession of the presidency and one of the most resource-endowed figures in American governance — lives in such deep ignorance of American politics. It must be hard for a man as publicly, perhaps performatively, committed to the rule of law, fairness, and moral governance to constantly be asked about the tsunami of amoral, unethical, and potentially illegal activities emanating from the West Wing and across the administration. Feigning ignorance feels a lesser sin than an outright defense.

	It speaks to the contempt Johnson and Republicans have for their own electorate and the American public. They're not gutting health care funding, they're saving it from couch-potato Joe. The president isn't funneling billions into his family's company coffers, he's crafting critical deals abroad. The economy is not slowing down and prices aren't spiking, the tariffs are ushering in a golden age of prosperity. ICE isn't abusing mothers and children in detention, they're detaining dangerous narcoterrorists. The speaker of the House isn't ducking  the question, he's just busy. 

	











	Republicans have largely given up on providing an earnest defense for Trump's actions — instead falling back on a rolodex of justifications that become less effective with the public with every poll. Some, like Johnson, aren't even bothering. In the end, with the levers of power and accountability squarely under their control, they don't have to listen to the questions, and they don't have to respond to concerns. They can simply continue to plow onwards, directed by the president's whims. Corruption? Ethics violations? Unconstitutionality? You may see it, but they haven't heard anything about that.

	Don't tell musicians what to do. Only hours after Halsey spent the night in the ER, she took the stage for her second night at Boston's MGM Music Hall. During the performance, as Halsey was addressing the crowd, a male audience member shouted, “Stop talking and play.” 


	“You think you're tough shit because you're from Boston?” the singer replied. “I'm from Jersey, baby. I'll whoop your ass. My dad's from Boston, my mom's from Jersey—that basically makes me a fucking demon. I'm gonna play whatever the fuck I wanna play. In case you didn't hear me correctly, I almost fucking died to be on this stage. I'm going to play whatever the fuck I wanna play.” 

Halsey claps back at rude fan @ Boston N2🤪😍 #halsey #backtobadlands #boston #badlands #mgmmusichallfenway 


	“I've been polite but won't be caught dead letting a man tell me what I should play in my set,” Halsey later wrote on X. She added, “There's always one.”

	Yesterday, Halsey updated fans on her health, explaining that she spent Sunday night in the emergency room after her first show in Boston. On Instagram Stories, the singer-songwriter said she had a “minor medical emergency” after her first of two concerts. Although she was in the hospital's ER until six in the morning, Halsey told fans, “I am A-Okay now and ready to rock tonight!”

	Halsey did not specify what put her in the emergency room, though she's been undergoing chemotherapy treatments recently after being diagnosed with lupus and a rare T-Cell lymphoproliferative disorder in 2022. On Instagram, Halsey thanked the doctors, nurses, and hospital staff who treated her at Mass General, calling them “the absolute best team I've ever met,” and adding, “I am so so grateful!” 

	











	The musician is currently celebrating the 10th anniversary of her debut album on her Back to Badlands tour, which kicked off last month. She has additional shows across the U.S. scheduled through mid-November, with a second North American leg kicking off next January. Shows in Europe, the U.K., and Australia will follow.

Wicked: For Good will begin its global premiere tour in São Paulo, Brazil, later this evening. It kicks off a run that will include stops in Paris, London, Singapore, and New York, leading up to the film's Nov. 21 theatrical release date. But the momentous opening will be without one of its stars. Ariana Grande will miss the premiere due to flight delays, she shared on Instagram.


	“I can't believe this is happening and I am beyond devastated to be sending this message,” Grande wrote. The singer and actress — who leads as Glinda in the film — boarded a plane with her team last night, but they were told to deplane for maintenance reasons with the crew citing safety concerns. This delayed the flight until 11 a.m., leaving insufficient time to make it to the premiere.


	“My team and Universal have tried every single thing possible to fix this, we've searched every other flight, overnight, early morning, connecting flights, commercial and also private options and absolutely nothing was available or possible that would get us there in time,” Grande said. “Even in attempting a private option, there is a permit necessary in order to fly from here that takes time to attain.”

	











	Grande will make her first appearance on the premiere tour in Paris on Nov. 7, while the rest of the cast, including Cynthia Erivo and Jonathan Bailey, will ensure that the show goes on in Brazil in her absence.


	“I am so heartbroken that i'm unable to be there with you all,” Grande said. “We sincerely tried everything we could and I apologize from the bottom of my heart. Please shower my incredible castmates with all of the love that I wish I could be showering you with and have the most beautiful celebration. And again, I am so, so very sorry.”

	











	Brazil's famously passionate pop fans voiced their disappointment online, but some remarks pushed Grande to release a second statement a few hours after the first. “Please don't wish danger on us,” she wrote. “We did everything we could and I promise you no one is more upset than I am, I promise. No matter how upset or disappointed you are, please please do not wish danger on us or assume that we didn't try.”

	Last week, the Federal Aviation Administration shared reports on extensive understaffing at airports and air traffic control centers, per the New York Times. Employees at these locations have been working without pay for the duration of the government shutdown that began over a month ago. The shortage has led to delays and stress that the head of the air traffic controllers' union said “makes the system less safe.”

	Grande reminded upset fans that her flight plans for the premiere of a multi-million dollar film were not scheduled on a whim. “There was no other time for me to leave and these plans have been booked for months,” she wrote. Grande noted that she wrapped filming on the upcoming Meet the Parents sequel, Focker In-Law, on Oct. 31, then spent Nov. 1 and 2 working, just as Erivo, Bailey, and Wicked director Jon M. Chu did. 


	“We were all scheduled to leave the same day,” she said. “It just so happened that this plane had a safety problem and I have explained why finding another option was impossible. I have been looking forward to this moment for a year, so please know how disappointed I am. Sending lots of love to you all. I hope it's a beautiful and safe night. I love Brazil, I always have, I always will.”

While the Trump administration announced on Nov. 3 that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) will be partially funded, it still remains unclear when SNAP benefits will be allocated, and that is having a negative impact on Native American communities, which is more than twice as likely to rely on the benefits.

                            Allegion plc's Q3 25 results reflect strong underlying momentum, with revenue growth fueled by effective pricing strategies, increased sales volumes across segments, and meaningful contributions from recent acquisitions. Allegion has further differentiated its security solutions platform with the strategic acquisition of UAP, expanding its residential hardware lineup.

                    at 04:33 am EST        - Modified on 11/04/2025
                    at 05:57 am EST

Allegion, which was founded in 2013 and headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, is a global leader in the security and access industry. The company is a global leader in security and access products, including mechanical and electronic locks, door closers and access control systems. Key brands include Schlage, Von Duprin, and Kryptonite. It operates through Allegion Americas and Allegion International.


On August 4, 2025, Allegion announced the acquisition of UAP Global Limited, a UK-based security products provider. This acquisition adds over 200 patents, trademarks, and designs to Allegion International, bolstering its presence in the UK and its non-residential portfolio. It enhances joint customer solutions, adds specialized mechanical products, strengthens market access through shared sales channels and supports faster growth.


Allegion has posted a revenue CAGR of 9.6% over FY 21-24, reaching $3.8bn, driven by strategic acquisitions and strong demand in Americas. Operating income rose at a CAGR of 13.5%, reaching $792.0m, with margins expanding from 18.9% to 21.0%.


Over FY 21-24, FCF reached $529m from $412m, supported by robust CFO growth, rising from $489m to $675m. This led to a rise in cash and cash equivalents from $398m to $504m. Its gearing ratio declined from 201.3% to 143.3%.


Over Q3 25, Allegion delivered double-digit revenue growth, driven by higher pricing, increased sales volumes across its core segments, and contributions from recent acquisitions. However, operating margins contracted by 40bp, due to increased costs.In comparison, ADT Inc., a local peer, reported a revenue CAGR of 5.2% to $4.9bn over FY 21-24. EBIT grew at a CAGR of 193.1% to $1.2bn, with margins expanding from 1.0% to 25.2%.


Over the past year, the company's stock has delivered returns of approximately 17.8%. In comparison, ADT's stock delivered 21.2% returns over the same period. Allegion is currently trading at a P/E of 21.8x, based on the FY 25 estimated EPS of $7.6, which is higher than its 3-year historical average of 20.1x and that of ADT (P/E of 11.7x). Regarding its EV/EBIT multiple, the company is currently trading at 16.7x, based on FY 25 estimated EBIT of $947.7m, which is higher than its 3-year historical average of 16.0x and that of ADT (10.9x).


Allegion is monitored by 12 analysts, with three having 'Buy' ratings and nine having 'Hold' ratings, with an average target price of USD 182.5, implying 9.1% upside potential from its current price.These views are further supported by an anticipated revenue CAGR of 6.4% over FY 24-27, reaching $4.5bn in FY 27. In addition, analysts expect an EBIT CAGR of 8.5% to $1.1bn, with margins expanding by 140bp to 24.2%. Net income is estimated to rise at a CAGR of 9.3% to $780.9m. Likewise, for ADT, analysts estimate an EBIT CAGR of 7.4% and a net profit CAGR of 18.3%.


Overall, Allegion has demonstrated consistent operational excellence and a strong track record of portfolio expansion, underpinned by revenue growth driven by strategic acquisitions and market leadership in security solutions. Allegion's outlook remains favorable amidst ongoing investments in innovation, integration, and channel expansion. However, it may face risks related to market competition, cybersecurity threats, and global economic instability, which could impact its growth and profitability.

As humans began to explore outer space in the latter half of the 20th century, radio waves proved a powerful tool. Scientists could send out radio waves to communicate with satellites, rockets and other spacecraft, and use radio telescopes to take in radio waves emitted by objects throughout the universe. 

However, sometimes radio telescopes would pick up the artificial radio signals from telecommunications. This interference threatened sensitive astronomy observations, causing inaccurate data and even damaging equipment. While this interference frustrated scientists, it also sparked an idea.

During the Cold War, a new field emerged at the intersection of radio astronomy and radio communications. It put forward the idea that astronomers could search for radio communications from possibly existing extraterrestrial civilizations. Astronomy usually dealt with observing the universe's natural phenomena. But this new field made the detection of technologically, or artificially produced radio waves, the object of a natural science. 

This field has continued today and is now called the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, or SETI. SETI encompasses all that scientists do to search for intelligent life beyond Earth. It includes one of the original uses of radio telescopes: to study signals from across the galaxy in hopes of detecting intelligent messages.

When the idea behind SETI was first proposed and pursued in the 1960s, only two countries, the U.S. and the USSR, had the technical capability for it. As the only space powers at the time, they were the key actors affected by radio frequency interference. 

As a historian of science, I've worked to make sense of what happened throughout the history of Soviet SETI during the space race by analyzing a range of primary sources. SETI captured the scientific imagination of many prominent Soviet astronomers in the 1960s and early 1970s.  

Astronomers have not yet confirmed any detection of radio signals – or any other kinds of signs – from extraterrestrial civilizations. But many scientists are still searching, even as their bold ideas run into obstacles. Some evidence suggests humans might be the only intelligent life in the universe. 

SETI is intertwined with the profound changes brought by radio astronomy. Up until the second part of the 20th century, scientists could see astronomical objects and phenomena only in optical or visible light. Optical light is the same kind of light that the human eye is sensitive to. 

After World War II, scientists figured out that they could peacefully use radar antennas, developed for use in that war, to detect radio signals coming from objects out in the universe. Deciphering these signals allowed researchers to study astronomical objects in the universe. They learned, for example, about the most abundant element: hydrogen. 

In the former Soviet Union, the prominent radio astronomy pioneer Iosif Samuilovich Shklovsky played a key role in detecting radio signals from hydrogen. 

Scientists knew that every chemical element would absorb certain wavelengths of light and reflect others, and the light signals that an object absorbed or reflected could tell astronomers what element it was. Most hydrogen could not be observed directly in optical light, so astronomers didn't spot it out in space until they started looking beyond the visible light spectrum. 

Shklovsky figured out how to detect hydrogen with radio waves, which helped astronomers map the distribution and motion of hydrogen gas in and between galaxies.

Historians generally consider the year 1960 the start of the golden age of radio astronomy. After the detection of hydrogen, astronomers discovered previously unknown types of stars, such as pulsars and quasars. These phenomena offered scientists new insights into the nature of astrophysical phenomena and fundamental physics. 

Shklovsky later grew fascinated with the possibility of using radio waves to contact other intelligent beings in the universe. In 1960, he published an article on this topic in one of the country's most prestigious scientific journals.

Shklovsky's article soon expanded into a widely popular book called “Universe, Life, Intelligence,” published in 1962. That same year, the USSR's Academy of Sciences sent its first radio message in the direction of Venus from a radar in Crimea. 

The experiment involved bouncing radio signals off the surface of Venus to transmit the following words using Morse code: Lenin, USSR and mir, which in Russian means both world and peace. Even though statistically increasing radio interference risk, this message was mainly symbolic. The Soviet Union wanted to depict its technological might and wasn't expecting to communicate with extraterrestrials. Soviet SETI was thus not yet a real pursuit. 

Shklovsky and the majority of other radio astronomers pursuing the search for extraterrestrial intelligence were all located in central Russia at the time. The USSR Academy of Sciences was also located there. But this group needed more formal measures to move their search from a few initiatives into a coordinated effort. 

Due to concerns over unwanted public attention, the scientists organized a conference far from Moscow, at the Byurakan Astrophysical Observatory in the Soviet Republic of Armenia, in 1964. At this conference, researchers formed a group specifically dedicated to studying artificial radio signals from space. With this group, SETI became a top-down, state-led activity. 

With this validation, scientists could now theoretically look for artificial signals, potentially from an alien origin. However, any discussions about artificial radio signals were subject to strict government surveillance, given the fact that military satellites depended on them, too. 

Soviet scientists faced several obstacles. For example, their own government's secrecy made coordination difficult. The Cold War also set limits on developing SETI internationally. However, they had a green light to search and study peculiar signals they suspected had artificial origin.

Efforts to collaborate internationally on artificial signals culminated in 1971 with a symposium, again at Byurakan. There, about 50 scientists – the majority from the U.S. and the USSR, but also some from Czechoslovakia, Hungary, the U.K. and Canada – agreed to disagree on how to best conduct SETI. 

Some in attendance compared this gathering to Noah's Ark, because an almost equal number of prominent scientists from East and West of the Iron Curtain managed to meet that year. And the gathering took place in Armenia at the foot of Mount Ararat, located in neighboring Turkey. This mountain is where archaeologists believe Noah's Ark may have beached.

After almost a week of discussion at Byurakan, the two geopolitical blocks designated an official SETI group. That group still exists today, and it still connects researchers all around the world who conduct SETI research. Given the secrecy around radio signals in space, this international SETI group marked a momentous diplomatic achievement at the height of the Cold War. 

SETI started in the Soviet Union with a few strong Moscow-based initiatives. It continued through group events in Armenia – from the first state-level Soviet conference to the international one. 

SETI is the first and only domain of astronomy to study artificial radio signals themselves. It indirectly addressed radio frequency interference during a time when these frequencies were highly unregulated. 

Stakeholder countries eventually addressed their radio frequency interference issues with international agreements on radio frequency usage and allocation. An international committee approved a feasible and comprehensive radio frequency allocation plan for the first time in the 1970s. This plan has been revised and renewed ever since. Today, space scientists and astronomers use an internationally agreed upon plan to minimize this interference.

Remarkably, SETI began even before this allocation plan. SETI continues its rich legacy today by continuing to search for signals – and along the way discovering new astrophysical objects and phenomena.

Strange glassy blobs strewn across the Australian desert are evidence of an ancient meteorite impact that scientists hadn't noticed until now.

According to a new analysis led by geoscientist Anna Musolino of Aix-Marseille University in France, tiny spheres of glass found in South Australia represent an impact-melt composition not found anywhere else in the world.

These newly named ananguites, the researchers say, formed in a giant impact that took place some 11 million years ago.

The sting in this particular tail is that geologists have yet to find any trace of a crater associated with this event – an event powerful enough to leave mineral traces that persist in detectable quantities for millions of years.

""These glasses are unique to Australia and have recorded an ancient impact event we did not even know about,"" says geochronologist and geochemist Fred Jourdan of Curtin University in Australia.

""They formed when an  asteroid slammed into Earth, melting surface rock and scattering debris for thousands of kilometres. These tiny pieces of glass are like little time capsules from deep in our planet's history.

""What makes the discovery even more intriguing is that, although the impact must have been immense, scientists are yet to locate the crater.""

The desert across southern Australia is positively strewn with tiny beads of impact glass called tektites. It's part of a region known as the Australasian strewnfield, the fallout created by a giant meteorite impact thought to have hit somewhere in Southeast Asia around 788,000 years ago.

The tektites from this fallout found in Australia are known as australites, and they're particularly abundant partly because the suspected impact took place a relatively short time ago.

Way back in 1969, scientists Dean Chapman and Leroy Scheiber of NASA made a chemical analysis of 530 australites. Among that number, they found eight with a mineral composition that did not match the rest of the sample.

They noted the strangeness of this, suggesting the eight beads may have formed in a separate impact, but no one ever really followed up.

Musolino and her colleagues decided to dive back into the oddballs to figure out what their deal is. The original eight samples were unavailable for re-analysis, but luckily Chapman and Scheiber had provided a detailed chemical description of the oddballs.

The differences of particular note include lower silicon dioxide content, but higher levels of the oxides of iron, magnesium, and calcium. They're also denser, with higher magnetic susceptibility, different bubble patterns, and different ratios of trace elements.

With this profile in hand, the researchers scoured the australite collection at the South Australian Museum, screening it for outliers consistent with the oddballs identified by Chapman and Scheiber. They found six new tektites in the collection that matched the mineral fingerprint of the earlier anomalies.

The composition of these ananguites strongly indicates that they formed in an impact that occurred on a different part of the crust from the Australasian strewnfield impact.

To confirm, Musolino and her colleagues performed argon dating on two of the six samples; Jourdan and other researchers had used the same technique in 2019 to date tektites scattered around Southeast Asia and Australia to 788,000 years old.

The team deduced that the newly identified ananguites are 11 million years old – significantly older than the tektites. This age clinches it; this handful of tiny glass blobs formed in a different, earlier impact.

Where that impact took place, however, is still a big mystery. That's not surprising given the source crater of the Australasian strewnfield tektites is still unknown, considered something of a ""holy grail"" for impact cratering science.

There are also a few reasons why the ananguite source crater might have vanished, including intense weathering and the aridification of central Australia that started around 33 million years ago. It may also have been mistaken for a volcanic feature in regions such as Papua New Guinea.

""Geochemical and petrographic systematic differences between western and eastern ananguites, which still need to be confirmed with additional samples, may help constrain the location of the impact,"" the researchers write in their paper.

""However, it is also possible that the crater has been buried during the past 11 million years.""

The findings have been published in Earth & Planetary Science Letters.","{'href': 'https://www.sciencealert.com', 'title': 'ScienceAlert'}","other"

About a month ago, TikToker Morgan (@trainingwilddogs) took her dog, Scout, to a pet psychic. Now, she's discussing everything that came up in her reading.

First of all, Scout brought up a tart flavor, like that of blueberries and raspberries. Morgan has tried to feed blueberries to Scout in the past, but she never liked them and would always spit them out. The pet psychic speculated that Scout just didn't like the sour berries.

So, Morgan purchased a carton of sweet, plump, and juicy blueberries so Scout could give them a try. The dog gobbled them up and was even excited for seconds. Morgan was also curious about what Scout thinks of Charlie, the other dog they live with.

“She was an only child for 10 years, so I know when I got my golden retriever, it was a big adjustment for her, and I feel like this love-hate relationship between them,” Morgan said.

The pet psychic asked Scout some questions and determined that Charlie was sometimes her friend. Additionally, Scout was unsure about whether she was the alpha dog or not.

She sees Charlie as a smaller creature, such as the size of a Shih Tzu, even though they are both about the same size. The psychic concluded that Scout and Charlie often took turns being the boss.

Then, Scout brought up duck in the context of food, which genuinely shocked Morgan. They had competed in hunting competitions before, and Scout would retrieve ducks. Apparently, Scout was ready to get back out there and compete.

However, Morgan stated that Scout was retired because she was 10 years old. But Scout did not identify as 10; she said she was seven. She wanted to participate in more exercises involving agility.

“I practice agility with my younger dog, and I have Scout watch, but I don't always let her participate because I don't want her to get hurt, but every now and then, I'll let her do a tunnel,” Morgan said.

“For the most part, I make her watch Charlie. Well, now I feel bad.”

Scout also loves pink and purple. Many people think Scout is a boy because of her name, which sometimes bothers her, depending on her mood. The pink and purple help identify her as a girl.

Overall, Morgan thoroughly enjoyed her experience with the pet psychic, saying that it was the best $35 she had ever spent. In the comments section, several other pet owners described their own stories about taking their pets to a psychic.

“I got a reading on my dog when I was at my peak of postpartum, and he was showing aggressive signs toward my baby, and the psychic said that he blamed ‘the girl' for my sadness and that he was worried when will I be back to normal. That reading changed me! I've taken care of my mental health so much more because of him, knowing that it affects him, and he's been super happy since then and gets along with my princess,” wrote one user.

“A pet psychic told me my dog was a very important doctor in my past life, and that's why he's so neurotic around me. It's because he's anxious and always worried about me,” commented another.

“My mom talked to a pet psychic, and they said that my male Shih tzu was the reincarnation of my dead great-grandma,” added a third.

Home » China » Psychic Predicts Coup to Oust Xi Jinping as Yu Menglong Death Mystery Deepens

Though nearly two months have passed since the tragic death of Chinese actor Yu Menglong, also known as Alan Yu, the 37-year-old's star's passing has become a “growing fire — the more it burns, the more questions arise.” Online, speculation among netizens continues to swirl as new details, eerie coincidences, and supernatural claims deepen suspicion and point to a possible cover-up.

On Sept. 11, Yu died after mysteriously falling from a high-rise building in Beijing. Authorities closed the case within 24 hours, ruling it an “accidental fall” following a “night of heavy drinking.” But a growing number of industry peers, fans, and human rights' advocates have called for an independent investigation, citing the suspicious circumstances surrounding Yu's death and the government's swift suppression of anyone who speaks about about it.

During a recent Dharma ceremony held in Yu's memory, attendees reported unusual “atmospheric phenomena,” including a rainbow that suddenly appeared under a clear sky, followed by a large fish-shaped cloud drifting overhead. Photos circulated across social media with captions that read: 

Meanwhile, Taiwanese entertainment manager Sun Derong, who has repeatedly spoken out on Yu's behalf, said he received numerous death threats from mainland Douyin (the TikTok version of China) users who predicted he would die on Oct. 25. On that day, Sun posted to Facebook that he was alive and well: “Today is Taiwan's Retrocession Day; some cursed me to die today,” said Sun. “Let's see how they planned to do it — I'm curious.”

He then assured followers that he would continue posting daily to confirm his safety. Meanwhile, British psychic Ty William, who has been following the case closely, later stated in a livestream that Sun would remain safe, despite the threats to his life.

Soon after the ceremony, videos emerged showing Changbaishan's Tianchi Lake in Jilin Province shrouded in a thick, swirling mist, in what locals dubbed as “Menglong boiling in rage.” A tour guide told “The Beijing News” that around 9 a.m., “the lake was covered in vapor moving across the surface like a giant cauldron.” Online users interpreted the phenomenon as a sign of the heavens' displeasure: 

Since Sept. 11, more than 600,000 people worldwide have now signed petitions demanding a full, independent investigation into Yu's death. “Justice may be late,” one fan wrote, “but it won't stay hazy forever.”

RELATED: Chinese Fans Outsmart Censors to Demand Justice for Yu Menglong

In an Oct. 28 livestream titled: “Any Update on Who Killed Yu Menglong?”, William alleged that Yu's killers were “being protected” and that some are “burning evidence.” She also claimed Yu's former agent — whom she called the “devil agent” — had fled to Taiwan and that the agency itself would soon face boycotts, financial collapse, and eventual closure.

William warned that those involved would suffer karmic retribution, adding that they had “used witchcraft or black magic” against her, but it had backfired, leaving them “prematurely aged.” Calling China's judiciary “too corrupt” to deliver justice, she predicted “street justice” and a public reckoning by November. 

Regarding Sun Derong, William reaffirmed that he is “safe under public protection in Taiwan” and reportedly battling bladder cancer. She also urged a global boycott of Yu's former company, accusing it of corruption and abuse.

Around the same time, Chinese netizens reported fires breaking out at several companies in Jiaozhou, Shandong, allegedly registered under Yu Menglong's name. The timing led many to suspect deliberate destruction of evidence.

Previous social media posts claimed that Yu and other entertainers had trademarks “tied to munitions and pyrotechnics” registered under their names. Following the Jiaozhou fires, many users said these records had vanished online. Others noted that the term “Jiaozhou fire” had become a banned keyword and hashtag on Chinese platforms.

“If it were just an accident,” one commenter noted, “Why rush to delete everything?”

Tai had previously claimed during an Oct. 23 stream that the culprits were planning to burn items stored inside Beijing's 798 Art Museum. With the new fires reported, supporters now fear that critical evidence could have been lost forever. William went further, alleging that Yu's remains had been stolen and were secretly stored in a museum.

William also alleged that three witnesses who saw the incident on the night of Yu's death were “eliminated” to prevent them from testifying. She further claimed Yu's remains are being kept in a museum filled with victims' bodies, shielded by a “powerful patron” whose identity has been scrubbed from the internet.

In a separate Facebook post, users alleged that gunshots were heard near one of the incident sites when a bystander reportedly tried to help an incapacitated Yu. Earlier videos appearing to capture the sounds were also circulating online, allegedly filmed near Beijing's Sunshine Upper East complex — the same area where Yu's body was found. 

On Oct. 17, an X account named “News Investigation” shared footage that appeared to show multiple bystanders at the scene. A woman's scream is heard in the background, with commenters speculating she was later killed. Analysts have compared the growing controversy to the 2012 Ling Gu car crash, which later implicated senior Party official Ling Jihua, with netizens calling the parallels “too striking to ignore.”

In her most recent livestream, Ty William made sweeping predictions about political turmoil inside China, declaring: “November will be a turning point for China.” She claims that a cascade of scandal videos involving major celebrities will erupt, followed by “unprecedented political chaos.” According to her, nine PLA generals have already been removed and eight key figures are secretly planning a coup to overthrow China's top leader: Xi Jinping. 

William predicted that “around Halloween or early November, events will flip dramatically,” with public anger surging and “a leader born for the people — upright and fearless — emerging to champion justice and reform.”

She concluded that when the tide turns, the Yu Menglong case will be reopened and true justice will be served. Still, she urged caution, acknowledging that not all predictions may come true, and that viewers should approach them “as references with skepticism.”

The General Staff of the Polish Armed Forces has warned of cognitive warfare that, in the context of peace talks aimed at ending Russia's war against Ukraine. The Polish army stated on X that an increase in psychological operations directed against Ukraine and being conducted on Polish territory.

The Polish military authorities noted that Moscow is carrying out operations aimed at putting pressure on Ukraine, designed to create an atmosphere of fear and a sense of threat supposedly linked to the presence of Ukrainians in Poland.

“A Russian psychological operation is underway that exploits Polish fears and historical legacy, as well as stirs up envy and resentment between both nations,” the General Staff of the Polish Armed Forces said in a statement.

The rise in anti-Ukrainian sentiment is being observed in places where there are hubs providing assistance for the transfer of weapons or support for Ukraine's war effort (for example, Gdynia and Gdańsk).

The General Staff of the Polish Armed Forces said in its statement that as part of this activity, Moscow is using, among other things, hate speech and incitement against Ukrainians in Poland, cyberattacks, arson, and GPS jamming.

In this context, the Polish Armed Forces also noted that Russia is trying to exploit the topic of the Volyn tragedy. Moscow is also attempting to portray Ukrainians as a greater threat to Poland than Russiaі . 

The aim of directing negative emotions against Ukraine, the statement added, is to pressure Polish citizens, who wish to return to their comfort zone, to exert pressure on the government to make decisions that contradict state policy.

The General Staff said acts of sabotage are part of coordinated operations by Russian intelligence services intended to undermine support for Ukraine and to facilitate Russian aggression.

“There are also factors such as fatigue from the excessive presence of Ukrainians in Poland, difficulties in adapting to cultural norms, and mistakes by the Ukrainian state regarding certain fundamental Polish postulates,” Łukasz Adamski, deputy director of the Mieroszewski Center, told Polskiej Agencji Prasowej. “These mistakes are indeed being corrected, but too late.”

He added that Russian disinformation nonetheless significantly influences Poles' attitudes toward Ukrainians.

Adamski elaborated that it is difficult for Russian propaganda to convince Polish society to adopt pro-Russian slogans. Therefore, Russians are investing significant resources in promoting hatred against Ukrainians in Polish social media, and the budget for Russian structures responsible for this activity has recently been further increased.

The deputy director of the Mieroszewski Center asserted that Poland's situation is unique because it is a country that still demonstrates a relatively high degree of resistance to pro-Russian slogans. This resistance stems from centuries of experience in relations with Russia. However, he noted, Poland has historical experience not only with Russia but also with Ukraine. History, in general, is important to Polish society. It plays a much greater role in public debate than in other European countries.

Previously, Poland had warned against the spread of Russian disinformation about alleged drone incursions into its airspace in early September. The authorities had also cautioned against false reports about an alleged planned attack by Poland, for which Russia would seek to blame Ukraine.

With a genre as old as country music, there are bound to be some rumors that circulate over the years. We found three country music conspiracy theories that have made the rounds, but they most likely are nowhere near the truth.

A post shared by Zach Top (@zachtop)

Alan Jackson is the proud father of three daughters, who are the only children Jackson has. But  earlier this year, what began as a humorous moment got out of control, with rumors flying that Zach Top is the son of Jackson. 

Country music radio host, Docc Andrews, posted that Top was born on September 26. 1997 in the state of Washington. Nine months prior, Jackson played a show in the state, with Andrews jokingly suggesting that Jackson is Top's father. 

To keep the rumor mill going, someone even went into Top's Wikipedia page, citing Jackson as his father. Of course, Top is not Jackson's son, but he did open for some dates for Jackson, on Jackson's Last Call: One More For The Road Tour.

Elvis Presley is not alive, although a rumor has been around for 48 years that he faked his death because of his global fame and notoriety. Presley, a rock and country music superstar, passed away on August 16, 1977. Almost immediately, fans would claim that they had spotted him alive, rumors that still circulate today.

But while it is one of music's greatest losses, Presley sadly is deceased. He was found unresponsive on the bathroom floor of his Graceland mansion. The official cause of death is listed as heart disease.

Shortly before Presley passed away, he had his final No. 1 hit at country radio, with “Way Down”.

Dolly Parton was married to Carl Dean for almost 59 years when he passed away earlier this year. Fans often commented that Dean was fictional, due to the fact that he never appeared anywhere with her.

But Dean was very much a part of the country music icon's life. Parton and Dean began dating when she was just 18 years old, marrying two years later. The reason fans didn't see Dean, nor did some of Parton's closest friends, is that Dean preferred staying out of the spotlight. But just because Dean didn't go to any of Parton's events doesn't mean he wasn't supportive of her and her career.

“I married a really good man, a guy that's completely different from me,” Parton tells Parade. “He's not in show business. He's not resentful of any of that. He loves to hear about the things I do. I love to hear about the things he does. So we enjoy each other's company. We get along good.”

Shortly after Dean passed away, Parton released “If You Hadn't Been There”, in tribute to her late husband.

As “wild conspiracy theories” make it harder to fight fires and get Canadians to safety, the majority of Canadians want the federal government to take action against disinformation.

A coalition of advocacy groups is urging [pdf] the federal government to sign the Global Initiative on Information Integrity on Climate Change, established ahead of the COP30 climate summit in Brazil to expose and dismantle climate-related disinformation.

In an open letter to Prime Minister Mark Carney and senior cabinet ministers, the coalition warns that online disinformation has real-world, harmful impacts on Canadians. “While forests, prairies, and communities burned across the country this summer, many online conversations were polluted with disinformation about arson and forest management and wild conspiracy theories,” the signatories write. The false claims hindered firefighters and evacuation efforts, with past research showing similar patterns of disinformation spreading during other climate disasters like floods and severe storms.

“By supporting the fight against climate disinformation, Canada can confront a system that has, for far too long, been free to delay climate action, endanger entire populations, and undermine our collective achievements, hard-won over decades,” Charles-Édouard Têtu, climate and energy analyst at Équiterre, said in a release.

The signatories say fossil fuel and digital tech companies are driving and profiting from disinformation. “New and longstanding research reveals that Meta, X, and YouTube are actively enabling and profiting from the spread of climate disinformation during extreme weather events,” they write, adding that oil majors, agrichemical, plastics, and automotive industries have also contributed to the confusion.

The overwhelming majority of Canadians want Ottawa to take action, said the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment (CAPE), a signatory to the open letter. In a recent poll by the Media Ecosystem Observatory at McGill University, 82% of respondents said they agree the federal government should join global information integrity initiatives, while 86% said governments should require social media platforms to ensure the accuracy of information and prevent disinformation during extreme weather events.

Overall, 78% expressed moderate to extreme concern about online disinformation related to climate change. Concerns are also mounting over other types of disinformation: 88% for public health, 81% over politicians and public policy, and 81% over trade and the economy.

“As physicians, we're left picking up the pieces when climate disinformation costs health and lives,” said CAPE President Dr. Melissa Lem. “During wildfires, floods, and heatwaves, false information spreads faster than facts, leaving people unable to protect themselves.”

Lem added: “Like toxic air and water pollution, information pollution threatens our health and safety. Canadians clearly want our government to tackle this threat.”

As “wild conspiracy theories” make it harder to fight fires and get Canadians to safety, the majority of Canadians want the federal government to take action against disinformation.

A coalition of advocacy groups is urging [pdf] the federal government to sign the Global Initiative on Information Integrity on Climate Change, established ahead of the COP30 climate summit in Brazil to expose and dismantle climate-related disinformation.

In an open letter to Prime Minister Mark Carney and senior cabinet ministers, the coalition warns that online disinformation has real-world, harmful impacts on Canadians. “While forests, prairies, and communities burned across the country this summer, many online conversations were polluted with disinformation about arson and forest management and wild conspiracy theories,” the signatories write. The false claims hindered firefighters and evacuation efforts, with past research showing similar patterns of disinformation spreading during other climate disasters like floods and severe storms.

“By supporting the fight against climate disinformation, Canada can confront a system that has, for far too long, been free to delay climate action, endanger entire populations, and undermine our collective achievements, hard-won over decades,” Charles-Édouard Têtu, climate and energy analyst at Équiterre, said in a release.

The signatories say fossil fuel and digital tech companies are driving and profiting from disinformation. “New and longstanding research reveals that Meta, X, and YouTube are actively enabling and profiting from the spread of climate disinformation during extreme weather events,” they write, adding that oil majors, agrichemical, plastics, and automotive industries have also contributed to the confusion.

The overwhelming majority of Canadians want Ottawa to take action, said the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment (CAPE), a signatory to the open letter. In a recent poll by the Media Ecosystem Observatory at McGill University, 82% of respondents said they agree the federal government should join global information integrity initiatives, while 86% said governments should require social media platforms to ensure the accuracy of information and prevent disinformation during extreme weather events.

‘I made a mistake,' says artist who included cloned archway on Halloween float for a Catholic school

A Pennsylvania artist's efforts to create a Halloween float for a local Catholic school went awry when he inadvertently included a replica of the gateway arch from a Nazi concentration camp, prompting a hasty apology from the diocese of Harrisburg.

In apologizing for the fiasco, Galen Shelly told PennLive that a lighted archway and lanterns he ordered to decorate a parade float he was building for Hanover's St Joseph's school did not arrive in time – so he searched the internet for images of cemetery gates to represent the idea that “none of us get out of this life alive”.

What he found, and replicated, was a photograph of the gates from the second world war Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland, among the most notorious of the Nazi death camps during the Holocaust in which at least 6 million Jewish people were systematically murdered.

The float, captured in images of the 30 October parade posted to Facebook by the Hanover Area Watch group, featured Shelly's cloned archway containing the German phrase Arbeit Macht Frei – work sets you free – a slogan the Nazis placed at the entrance of numerous concentration camps to mock those who passed through the gates to face brutality and extermination.

“I had no ill intent,” Shelly told PennLive. “I made a mistake and I am deeply sorry.

“I wanted to illustrate the idea none of us get out of this life alive. I never intended anything to be like this. I couldn't have anticipated it. I ask everyone's forgiveness.”

The bishop of Harrisburg, Timothy Senior, said he was “shocked and appalled” by the episode and issued an apology on behalf of the church, noting the Holocaust imagery was a late addition of which it had no knowledge.

“The inclusion of this image, one that represents the horrific suffering and murder of millions of innocent people, including six million Jews during the Holocaust, is profoundly offensive and unacceptable,” he said in a statement.

“While the original approved design for this float did not contain this imagery, it does not change the fact that this highly recognizable symbol of hate was included. On behalf of the diocese of Harrisburg, I express my sincere apology to our Jewish brothers and sisters and to all who were hurt or offended by this display.

“I strongly condemn the inclusion of this symbol on the float. As Catholics, we stand firmly against all forms of antisemitism, hatred and prejudice, which are rampant in our society.”

Senior added that the diocese would “work with the school community to ensure that this incident becomes an opportunity for education and reflection, and review approval processes so that such a grievous incident is never repeated”.

Leaders from St Joseph's Catholic church, which operates the school, also apologized for a “lack of vigilance” and failing to review the float before the parade, the Hanover Sun reported.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Canada must now go its own way","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/drive/culture/article-trump-is-turning-americas-auto-industry-into-a-global-backwater-canada/","Tue, 04 Nov 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

U.S. President Donald Trump talks with auto industry leaders, including General Motors CEO Mary Barra (L) and United Auto Workers (UAW) President Dennis Williams (R) at the American Center for Mobility in Ypsilanti Township, Michigan, U.S., March 15, 2017.Jonathan Ernst/Reuters

U.S. President Donald Trump is on track to turn North America's once dominant auto industry into a global backwater, a place where a couple of car companies churn out inferior, dirty vehicles for a captive consumer base that has no choice but to buy them. 

And, unless Canada acts quickly and carefully to diversify our auto industry and untie ourselves from the U.S., we'll be pulled down and mired in the same automotive mess as the Americans.

“Canadian consumers will not want to sit behind tariff walls driving [gas-powered] cars while the rest of the world benefits from the [electric vehicle] transition,” wrote the authors of a recent white paper by the Transition Accelerator, a prominent industrial policy think-tank. As it stands, however, that scenario is all too real.

The decisions by General Motors and Stellantis to cancel production of electrified vehicles at their Ontario plants in Ingersoll and Brampton respectively are, in large part, results of Trump's dismantling of pro-EV policies, putting up tariffs walls and attacking Canadian workers. He's succeeding in taking jobs from Canadians and slowing the inevitable EV transition.

The Transition Accelerator paper also says what every auto executive already knows: “Demand for electric vehicles in Canada and the United States has moderated over the past six months but the long-term trend is clear: EVs will be cheaper and more reliable than internal combustion engines.”

The rest of the world is driving forward on EVs as Trump is dragging America backward by putting up tariff barriers to shut out foreign competition, undoing fuel economy regulation as well as dismantling policies (namely former president Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act) that would've accelerated America's electric transition and helped the U.S. auto industry catch up and compete with China.

The incentives for U.S. automakers to invest in EVs have largely evaporated, while at the same time they are suffering massive consequences from tariffs. 

“We're kind of falling behind,” said Dimitry Anastakis, a prominent auto industry scholar and the LR Wilson and RJ Currie Chair in Canadian business history at the University of Toronto. “[EVs] are the future, and it's going to be much costlier and take much more time to get to what the industry knows is the future,” he said. “The industry knows it has to get there and the problem for them is managing this transition is hard enough at the best of times, and then you've got a madman in the White House.”

In her third quarter letter to shareholders, GM head Mary Barra thanked the president for “tariff updates” and a new discount on U.S. heavy-duty pickups, while also acknowledging, “with the evolving regulatory framework and the end of federal consumer incentives, it is now clear that near-term EV adoption will be lower than planned.” As a result, the company took a US$1.6-billion charge in the quarter and Barra warned of more to come.

If the Big Three American automakers – Stellantis, Ford and GM – continue to fall behind international rivals on EVs, particularly those from China, the only way for Trump to protect them without massive public spending will be for America to put up bigger tariff walls and keep out foreign competition. It'll turn North America's tightly integrated auto industry into an island with its own unique ecosystem, cut off from advances being made elsewhere, making cars that are uncompetitive anywhere but here.

Anastakis said you can never count American automakers out completely. But, he said, “The Americans are getting their lunch eaten on the technology side of things and their presence in the world – they shrunk and shrunk and shrunk. North America is going to be a gas-guzzling backwater.”

It's a problem for Canadian drivers, who could be denied more affordable cutting-edge EVs and frugal gas-powered vehicles because of our alignment with the U.S. But it's an even bigger problem for Canada's auto industry and especially the workers who depend on those jobs.

In the face of Trump's brutal attack on Canadian auto workers and the environment, building out our own globally connected EV manufacturing sector – from mining critical minerals, refining them into battery components and assembling vehicles – has become existentially important. 

Justin Trudeau's Liberals and Doug Ford's Conservatives have already made good progress in that direction (albeit at significant cost) by securing big investments and new jobs in the form of battery plants from Volkswagen and LG/Stellantis.

Prime Minister Mark Carney's government is continuing that push, reaching out to China, Mexico, India and Europe for trade talks.

Canada's auto industry has survived by tethering itself to the leading automakers globally, as Greig Mordue, an associate professor in the W Booth School of Engineering Practice and Technology at McMaster University, recently pointed out. In the 1960s, it was the Detroit brands. In the 1980s, it was the Japanese and today Toyota and Honda produce many more vehicles in Canada than their American counterparts. As Mordue suggests, Canada's old strategy of balancing sticks (tariffs) and carrots (duty remissions for local manufacturing) to attract manufacturers could potentially be used again to attract Chinese automakers.

Bringing in Chinese brands to set up factories and suppliers in Canada without provoking Trump's ire is a fine line to walk while he's in the White House, but we can start to lay the groundwork.

Charting a distinct path for Canada's auto sector, diverging from America, would need to involve additional measures too, perhaps allowing vehicles homologated for Europe to be sold in Canada. Another promising idea, proposed in a recent opinion piece published by the Toronto Star, suggests tweaking Canada's EV Availability Standard to reward automakers that build parts and/or vehicles in Canada. 

And, of course, by finally getting moving on mining the Ring of Fire for rare critical minerals, Canada can simultaneously reduce our reliance on American automakers while increasing their reliance on us.

None of this will be of any comfort to the thousands of families in Ingersoll and Brampton affected by GM and Stellantis job cuts. Those workers now face a grim reality. They deserved (and deserve) better.

Those job cuts are a warning – not to abandon the auto industry or the industrial policy that has built this sector into a powerhouse – but instead to diversify Canada's auto industry and double down on its strengths for the sake of the next-generation of Canadian auto workers, for Canadian sovereignty, and for a clean and growing economy.

Martin Scorsese has led the tributes to Diane Ladd after the three-time Academy Award nominee's death, aged 89.

Ladd, who was directed by Scorsese when she played the brash waitress Flo in Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, also featured in Wild At Heart and Rambling Rose.

Ladd's death was announced on Monday by her daughter Laura Dern, who said in a statement her mother and occasional co-star had died at her home in Ojai, California, with Dern at her side.

Scorsese said: “I have so many good memories of making Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, and my experiences with Diane are among the best.

“I felt that it was so important for the picture to let the actors run with their characters, and what an experience it was to watch Diane take the character of Flo and make something so vivid and funny and alive.

“Diane was a great improvisational actor – a matter of technique and discipline, but most of all instinct and artistry – and she had it all.

“You can really feel it in the sunbathing scene with her and Ellen [Burstyn], one of the best scenes in the picture.

“I loved my time working with Diane, a truly remarkable artist, and I wish we could have worked together again.”

Dern, who called Ladd her “amazing hero” and “profound gift of a mother”, did not cite a cause of death.

“She was the greatest daughter, mother, grandmother, actress, artist and empathetic spirit that only dreams could have seemingly created,” Dern wrote.

“We were blessed to have her. She is flying with her angels now.”

Ladd had already enjoyed an extensive television and stage career when she was handed her film breakthrough in Scorsese's 1974 release Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, which earned her the first of her Oscar nominations for supporting actor.

She was shortlisted for the same category for her roles in Wild At Heart and Rambling Rose.

The playwright Tennessee Williams was a second cousin of Ladd's and her first husband Bruce Dern, Laura's father, was also an Academy Award nominee.

Ladd and Dern achieved the rare feat of mother-and-daughter nominees for their work in Rambling Rose and they were memorably paired in David Lynch's Wild At Heart, a personal favourite of Ladd's and winner of the Palme d'Or at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival.

A native of Laurel, Mississippi, Ladd was born Rose Diane Ladner and was apparently destined to stand out.

In her 2006 memoir, Spiraling Through The School Of Life, she remembered being told by her great-grandmother that she would one day be in “front of a screen” and would “command” her own audiences.

Before Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, she had been working in television since the 1950s, with shows including Perry Mason, Gunsmoke and The Big Valley.

By the mid-1970s, she told The New York Times, she no longer denied herself the right to call herself great.

“Now I don't say that,” she said. “I can do Shakespeare, Ibsen, English accents, Irish accents, no accent, stand on my head, tap dance, sing, look 17 or look 70.”

Ladd's third marriage, to author-former PepsiCo executive Robert Charles Hunter, lasted from 1999 until his death in August.

 US President Donald Trump has defended his push to resume nuclear weapon testing, boasting that America's arsenal is powerful enough “to blow up the world 150 times” and should be maintained through active trials.

In a CBS interview aired on Sunday, Trump was asked why the US needs to test its nuclear weapons again after more than three decades of a Congress-mandated moratorium.

“Because you have to see how they work,” Trump replied. “I'm saying that we're going to test nuclear weapons like other countries do. We're the only country that doesn't test, and I don't want to be the only country that doesn't test.”

The US last conducted a full-scale nuclear test in 1992, and resuming testing would likely take years and cost hundreds of millions of dollars, according to the Washington Post. Energy Secretary Chris Wright clarified on Sunday that the testing ordered by Trump would not involve actual nuclear detonations.

“These are what we call non-critical tests,” Wright told Fox News, describing them as part of a broader modernization program. “No worries about [a mushroom cloud],” he added, when asked about the possibility of atmospheric or underground tests.

Despite Trump's claim that Russia and China are secretly conducting tests, both countries' last confirmed nuclear tests occurred decades ago – Russia in 1990 and China in 1996.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said Russia's recent trials of the Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile and the Poseidon underwater drone did not involve nuclear testing. President Vladimir Putin has stated that Russia would only “act accordingly” if other nuclear powers resume testing.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry also urged the US to honor its obligations under the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and to maintain the global moratorium on nuclear testing.

US Vice President J.D. Vance and several Republican lawmakers have supported Trump's initiative, arguing that non-detonative testing is necessary to ensure the reliability of America's aging nuclear arsenal.

“We have more nuclear weapons than any other country. And I think we should do something about denuclearization,” Trump said. “We have enough nuclear weapons to blow up the world 150 times. Russia has a lot of nuclear weapons, and China will have a lot.”

Andrej Babis' ANO party has signed a coalition agreement with two smaller parties in the Czech Republic, enabling the right-wing politician, who has been critical of aid to Kiev, to form a new government.

ANO won around 35% of the vote in last month's parliamentary election, becoming the largest party but falling short of a majority.

It opened talks with far-right anti-EU Freedom and Direct Democracy (SPD) and the Euroskeptic Motorists party, which took around 8% and 7% respectively. The three formally signed a coalition deal on Monday.

According to Czech media, the coalition will control 108 of the 200 seats in the Czech Chamber of Deputies. The deal also divides cabinet posts, confirming that the next prime minister will come from ANO – allowing Babis to return to the role he held from 2017 to 2021 – while the SPD will nominate the next speaker of parliament.

ANO will reportedly oversee nine ministries, including finance, industry, health, labor, education, interior, regional development, and justice. The SPD will run defense, agriculture, and transport, and the Motorists will oversee foreign affairs, culture, environment, and health.

Babis, 71, has long criticized the EU's handling of migration and environmental policy and opposed its military and financial support for Ukraine. During his parliamentary campaign, he vowed to reduce aid to Kiev, end austerity, and boost domestic spending.

Announcing the deal, Babis said his partners are “united by their shared goal of replacing the outgoing government” of Prime Minister Petr Fiala, a strong supporter of Ukraine whose coalition launched an EU ammunition initiative for Kiev.

SPD leader Tomio Okamura hailed the pact as “the end of a government that harmed Czech interests,” while Motorists chief Petr Macinka called it “the first step toward the change demanded by voters.”

Under the Czech Constitution, once a coalition with at least 101 seats is formed, the president appoints the prime minister and cabinet. The new government must still win a parliamentary vote of confidence within 30 days. Babis, an agriculture billionaire, said he plans to have the new government formed by the end of November.

The death toll from Typhoon Kalmaegi in the Philippines hit 46 on Tuesday, officials said, including six crew of a military helicopter that crashed during the powerful storm that unleashed heavy rains and floods across the central region.

The Huey helicopter went down in Agusan del Sur on the island of Mindanao, where it was conducting a humanitarian disaster response mission, the military said. Six bodies of the crew were recovered and an investigation was under way.

The crash took place before noon about 270 km from the island of Cebu, the worst-hit region, where local authorities said 39 people had been killed by drowning or falling debris. One person was reported dead on the neighbouring island of Bohol.

The Philippines, which is hit by an average of 20 tropical storms each year, is recovering from a run of disasters including earthquakes and severe weather events in recent months. In September, Super Typhoon Ragasa swept across northern Luzon, forcing schools and government offices to shut down as it brought fierce winds and torrential rain.

Although Kalmaegi, locally named Tino, has gradually lost strength since making landfall early on Tuesday, it continued to lash the country with winds of 120 kph and gusts of 165 kph as it swept across the Visayas islands headed for northern Palawan and towards the South China Sea.

Tens of thousands were evacuated across the Visayas region, including parts of southern Luzon and northern Mindanao, ahead of a storm that submerged homes and caused widespread flooding.

Cebu provincial information officer Ainjeliz Orong said the number of casualties in the province had jumped suddenly, from three reported earlier in the day, as rescue operations were under way and information had just started to come through.

“Search and rescue efforts continue and there are missing and unaccounted individuals,” Orong said by phone.

Floods in Cebu City had subsided late on Tuesday but power was still out in many places and telecommunications services were intermittent, a Reuters journalist said.

Verified videos circulating on social media showed cars and streets under water, with some vehicles carried away in the flow.

After the flood receded in one area of Cebu City, cars shifted by fast-flowing water were left piled up on top of each other, some overturned.

“We were really anxious because the longer the rains continued, the higher the floodwaters rose,” said John Patajo, a housekeeper in the area.

“When the waters rose, we went to our second floor. Yet, the waters kept rising so we decided to head up to our roof.”

The typhoon was expected to leave the Philippines late on Wednesday or early Thursday.

Photos and videos from the Philippine Red Cross showed rescue workers wading through knee-deep floodwaters in Cebu City, using boats to reach stranded residents. In a town on the city's outskirts, homes were submerged, with only rooftops and top floors visible.

More than 300 flights to and from the affected areas were cancelled on Tuesday, while boats at sea were advised to return.

State weather agency PAGASA had earlier warned of a high risk of “life-threatening and damaging storm surges” that could reach more than 3 metres high on coastal and low-lying communities in the central Philippines.

The Vietnamese government on Tuesday said that it was preparing for the worst-case scenario as it braced for the impact of Kalmaegi.

The typhoon is forecast to make landfall on Thursday night in Vietnam's central regions, which have already suffered heavy floods that killed at least 40 people and left six others missing over the past week.

“This is a very strong typhoon, which continues to strengthen,” the government said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","North Koreans left in the dark as foreign broadcasts cut","https://www.dw.com/en/north-koreans-left-in-the-dark-as-foreign-broadcasts-cut/a-74596803","Tue, 04 Nov 2025 05:56:16 GMT","

For decades, US and South Korean broadcasts were a critical source of information for North Koreans willing to learn about life beyond their borders. Now, the airwaves have gone silent. 

The US and South Korean governments have halted the operations of media organizations that were broadcasting into North Korea, leaving tens of thousands of residents of the world's most isolated country in the dark about what is happening in the outside world.

""This is very bad for the people of North Korea and a really serious setback for human rights there,"" said Kim Eu-jin, who fled the North with her mother and sister in the 1990s.

""The governments are denying the people of North Korea the freedom to access information and now all they will hear is Pyongyang's propaganda,"" she told DW.

Previously, North Koreans could surreptitiously tune in to Radio Free Asia (RFA) and Voice of America (VOA) from the US, as well as South Korea's ""Voice of Freedom"" broadcasts. Activists have said the broadcasts helped North Koreans endure hardship by allowing them to hear things the regime does not want them to know.

Kim said she never listened to foreign radio broadcasts before she defected because it was simply too dangerous to do so. The regime in Pyongyang was willing to to invest a lot of time and effort in catching and punishing people who accessed foreign media. In some cases, those caught would be tried publicly and sentenced to hard labor or, in some extreme cases, to death.

Kim said that the North Korean government fears those broadcasts, and warned that dangers for those who listen to foreign media have become significantly more serious in recent years.

Voice of America has been silenced effectively since Donald Trump returned to the White House earlier this year. The new administration quickly fired hundreds of staff and issued an executive order to eliminate VOA's and Radio Free Asia's parent agency, the US Agency for Global Media.

In late August, the South Korean government announced that it was halting broadcasts of Voice of Freedom into the North after 15 years.

Huge loudspeaker systems on the border that had blasted news and South Korean pop music into the North have also been dismantled.

The South Korean government said it was trying to reduce tensions with the North and expressed hope that the regime in Pyongyang might, in turn, be willing to reopen negotiations with the South. There have been no indications to date that the North is contemplating resuming talks with Seoul.

On October 29, a message from Rosa Hwang, executive editor of Radio Free Asia, stated her broadcaster was halting work due to ""uncertain funding"" — for the first time in RFA's 29-year history.

""The newsroom is dark. The microphones are off. Broadcasts have been silenced. Publishing is paused. On social media. On our websites.""

""Without RFA Korean, 26 million North Koreans isolated by the repressive regime's war on free speech and a free press will lack a critical link to independent information,"" she said, pointing to the broadcaster's award-winning coverage of the plight of North Korean defectors.

In October, the 38 North website, which analyzes North Korean affairs, held an event to explore the impact of the radio and television beamed into the North.

It showed that anti-regime radio broadcasts are down by 85% and television programming has disappeared entirely since the US and South Korean governments' cuts.

And while it is difficult to determine just how many people the broadcasts were reaching, the analysts emphasized again that the ""significant effort and resources spent by the North Korean regime to block them provides some indication of their penetration.""

The North has become more adept at jamming broadcasts and the coronavirus pandemic made it harder to smuggle USB sticks and memory cards into the country.

However, enhanced legal restrictions from Pyongyang — such as the Anti-Reactionary Thought and Culture Law, passed in 2020 — shows how seriously Pyongyang is taking this threat to its authority, according to the experts participating in the 38 North event.

""I am sure the government in Pyongyang is very happy at this development,"" said Lim Eun-jung, a professor of international studies at Kongju National University.

""Halting these broadcasts means the people there only have North Korean state media to listen to now and they will know less and less about what is happening in the outside world,"" she told DW.

""In one sense, I can understand the South Korean government's decision as it did not want tensions to escalate further and hoped to open lines of communication with the North, but at the same time this means that people living in a country that is already essentially a prison now have even less access to information.""

North Korean defector Kim said that, while foreign broadcasts did not play a large part in her own defection three decades ago, they later grew to become a critical tool against the regime.

""The broadcasts taught people in North Korea what human rights are,"" she said. ""It told them what freedom is. For some, it made them fight for that freedom by leaving the North. I cannot understand why we have done the regime's work for it by ending these broadcasts.""

Zohran Mamdani stood on stage basking in his victory.

Dressed in a trademark black suit, surrounded by his security detail, he vowed not to abandon the young voters who had helped him.

He had won against all the odds, mopping the floor with his establishment rivals.

No, this is not 2025. This is 2004, when Mr Mamdani, the rookie, viral idatsocialist mayoral cande now on the brink of a revolutionary mayoral victory in New York, was just 12 years old.

The setting was Bank Street School for Children, a progressive private school on Manhattan's Upper West Side.

The event was a mock election, but the signs were good.

“It was so obvious this guy was going to be some sort of leader of people,” Evan Roth Smith, who was Mr Mamdani's running-mate in the vote, recalled to The Telegraph.

“The people who are supposed to be running were totally out of touch with, particularly the younger people, and in walks Zohran Mamdani with his ‘not supposed to be campaign' and cleans up.”

The mock vote was set up by the now $60,000 (£45,000) a year school under the shadow of the presidential race between George W Bush and John Kerry.

Under the mock election's loose rules, only eighth graders, the eldest year group, could field a Republican and Democrat candidate to enter the race.

Mr Mamdani, who was a seventh grader at the time, was incensed. He and a group of friends convinced the school administrators to let them run a third-party candidate.

Twelve-year-old Mr Mamdani eventually “steamrolled” his older rivals in a dry run that almost perfectly foreshadows November's New York mayoral race.

Mr Mamdani's rise from nobody to firm favourite in recent months has been nothing if not meteoric.

He stormed the political stage earlier this year with a wide grin and a combination of viral TikTok videos and catchy campaign pledges.

The self-described Democratic Socialist quickly leapfrogged politicians who have spent decades in the trenches to become the star of the show, turning heads in New York and across the world.

He now stands on the precipice of becoming the first Muslim mayor of the metropolis, and the youngest in more than a century.

His hard-Left campaign has focused on affordability in a city that has priced out so many young people.

His pledges for city-run supermarkets, rent freezes, free childcare funded by tax hikes for the rich have seen panicked billionaires elbowing one another to throw cash at his main rival, Andrew Cuomo.

Mr Mamdani has already defeated Mr Cuomo once in the primary race to select the Democratic candidate. Mr Cuomo has since relaunched his campaign as an Independent.

Since his primary shock win Mr Mamdani has spoken with everyone from Barack Obama to Kamala Harris, and even Sir Sadiq Khan, the Labour Party mayor of London. At least two former Obama aides have been working on his campaign.

Mr Obama called Mr Mamdani on Saturday, apparently lavishing praise on his “impressive” campaign.

His commanding lead over his rivals even prompted the sitting US president to make an extraordinary intervention into the race himself.

Donald Trump has attacked the “little communist” from behind the resolute desk in the Oval Office and on Truth Social, setting the stage for Mr Mamdani to position himself as the Democrat willing to take on the US president at a time when many view the opposition as limp and lifeless.

“Communist” may be a touch too far, but Mr Mamdani has praised the “socialist Utopia” of high-tax New Jersey — which he wants to emulate, and some.

Born in Uganda to Mahmood Mamdani, 79, an author and academic, and Mira Nair, 68, an Indian-American Oscar-nominated director, Mr Mamdani had a privileged upbringing in Kampala.

He moved to the US aged seven when his father joined the faculty at Columbia University as an anthropology professor and the family moved into staff accommodation on the Upper West Side.

It was here Mr Mamdani enrolled into Bank Street, which one former pupil described as a “caricature of a progressive school”, where students called teachers by their first names and there were no grades.

His school friends remember Mr Mamdani as an Arsenal-obsessed boy who loved to play football in the park, the computer game Worms and had an impressive collection of TinTin books.

“Zohran was a very worldly person who had these experiences none of us did, like living abroad and he was just interesting”, Mr Roth Smith, Mr Mamdani's best friend at the time, said.

“He had charisma at an age where most people could barely get their words out,” John McAuliff, Mr Mamdani's former classmate who is the Democrat candidate for a state house seat in Virginia, said.

“I think at some level he, coming from out of the country, felt he probably needed to work harder to fit in, which I think is what breeds that skill”, he told The Telegraph.

Mr Mamdani was “incredibly kind”, he said, remembering how he had shared his goodie bag from a Harry Potter premiere he had attended with his mother with all his friends.

He was also popular with girls. Mr Roth Smith said he was “relieved” when Mr Mamdani got into the Bronx High School of Science because the girl they both had a crush on was going to a different school.

“Golden rule of Zohran is you're not gonna win that contest... everyone's in love with Zohran,” he said.

At high school Mr Mamdani continued his campaigning streak, running an unsuccessful attempt to become student body vice president by promising students fresh orange juice.

He didn't get into an Ivy League University, he was rejected from Columbia, instead going to Bowdoin College, a liberal arts university in Maine, where he received a degree in Africana Studies.

While at university he co founded a chapter of what is now the highly controversial group Students for Justice in Palestine.

Mr Mamdani went on to try and forge a career as a rapper called Mr Cardamom, releasing slick music videos featuring stars including chef Madhur Jaffrey and Lupita Amondi Nyong'o.

Mr Mamdani, who became a US citizen in 2018, was inspired by Bernie Sanders to become a socialist in 2016.

He worked as a foreclosure-prevention counsellor, helping South Asian and Indo-Caribbean immigrants who were at risk of losing their homes.

Before launching his successful bid to become a member of the New York State Assembly, he worked on several campaigns for progressive candidates.

Jen Gaboury, 54, a gender studies teacher and union vice president, said it was while working on Khader el-Yateem's campaign for city council in 2017 that Mr Mamdani realised “maybe politics was for him”.

“I remember the first time I met him... he sat outside with me on my stoop in Brooklyn and talked to me about fair, free transit and making the subway and buses free for like 25 minutes, and I have remembered that conversation for a long, long time”, she told The Telegraph.

Mr Mamdani met his wife, the Syrian-American animator and illustrator Rama Duwaji on Hinge in 2021, whom he credits with helping him “to better use social media”.

Friends said it was clear the couple, who live in a rent-stabilised apartment in Queens together, were “feeling pretty serious” within the first few months.

They got the subway to their understated New York wedding at the City Clerk's office in early 2025, and the bride wore a brown fur coat over a white lace dress and black boots. That summer they had a three-day celebration in Uganda.

A post shared by Kara 💫 nyc Photographer (@karamccurdy)

Mrs Duwaji, 28, has notably kept her distance from the campaign trail, other than the night he defied the odds to win the Democratic primary when she grinned on stage as her husband kissed her hand.

A few months after Mr Mamdani's primary win, when he quoted Nelson Mandela on stage, I had my first interaction with the politician outside a shoe shop in the Bronx on a sticky mid-August morning.

He had just delivered a speech as part of his five-borough anti-Trump tour and, between supporters honking their horns and haranguing him for selfies, I and a handful of journalists peppered him with questions as he hastily walked to his next meeting.

While struggling to keep pace with his stride, I asked him about his phone call with Sir Sadiq, the London Mayor.

Appearing unfazed, he looked at me with his trademark wide smile.

Mr Mamdani deftly dodged the question. He had inspiring conversations with people across the world, of course.

When I followed up, asking who had called who, he laughed until one of his press officers swooped in to distract me.

While his campaign appears organic and low-fi at times, his team is well-drilled, run by slick ad makers and political strategists, many of whom cut their teeth fighting against the Democratic establishment.

The second time I saw him was at Bernie Sanders' “fight oligarchy” rally in New York. It was a night of biblical rain coupled with winds so strong they flip your umbrella inside out.

Despite the abysmal weather hordes of supporters dutifully lined up in a queue that snaked around the side of the Brooklyn College.

Among the Mr Mamdani supporters who had braved the rain to see the Democratic candidate was Daniela Lapidous, 31, a graduate student and progressive organiser.

“New Yorkers love New York, it's obvious that he loves New York, and he's putting sun, fun and joy and realness back in politics”, she said when asked what she liked most about Mr Mamdani.

Does she see many similarities between Mr Sanders and Mr Mamdani?

“They're both extremely hot, in their own way”, she replied.

As the progressive crowd packed into the 2,000 capacity hall, a volunteer wearing a straw hat, a pleated skirt and red shoes adorned with gem hearts danced in the aisles.

When Mr Mamdani and Mr Sanders walked out, it was hard to hear Everyday People by Sly & The Family Stone blaring through the speakers over the screams of elation in the hall.

As the two men sat on stage, an older man wearing a shirt with the Cuban flag on stood up and shouted: “You are a communist. This is not Cuba, you fool,” before being swiftly removed.

Mr Mamdani quickly quipped: “You know that something has changed when it's not enough to call us democratic socialists anymore.”

The communist allegation is one that Mr Trump has leaned into, calling Mr Mamdani a “100 per cent communist Lunatic”.

Mr Trump has suggested Mr Mamdani will win, telling reporters in the Oval Office “looks like we're going to have a communist”.

Mr Trump is understood to have put pressure on Eric Adams, the incumbent mayor who had been indicted for corruption before the Trump administration had the charges quashed, to drop out of the race to clear the field for Mr Cuomo.

While extraordinary, Mr Mamdani's success did come at a time when Mr Adam's credibility was in tatters and his main Democratic challenger had resigned as the state governor amid a string of sexual harassment allegations.

The Republican leader, who is from Queens, where Mr Mamdani lives, has, in some ways, been a key catalyst of Mr Mamdani's ascent.

Mr Trump and Mr Mamdani, it should be noted, both came into the fold as political outsiders, offering a fresh alternative to candidates propped up by the old guard.

They both won support of traditionally hard-to-reach voters, harnessing the power of social media and catchy campaign slogans and sweeping pledges that speak to the struggles of everyday voters.

But large swathes of the Democratic party, including New York Senators Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, have refrained from endorsing a candidate who is as polarising as he is popular.

While his lifelong pro-Palestine views have helped win over swathes of voters who were left disillusioned by Joe Biden and the Democrats' continued support for Israel during the war in Gaza, it has also been a source of concern among some Jewish voters.

A week after Hamas launched its brutal, deadly attack on October 7, Mr Mamdani was arrested during a ceasefire demonstration outside Mr Schumer's apartment in Park Slope, Brooklyn.

He has been accused of being anti-Semitic, with critics pointing at his refusal to condemn the phrase “globalise the intifada”, later saying he would “discourage” the use of the term.

Mr Mamdani has said he recognises Israel's right to exist, but not as a Jewish state. He has vowed to arrest Benjamin Netanyahu if he steps foot in New York.

This week more than 650 rabbis across the US, including more than 60 from New York City, signed a letter warning of the perceived dangers of a Mamdani administration.

His previous comments calling the New York Police Department “racist, anti-queer and a major threat to public safety” in June 2020, during the George Floyd protests, have also sparked concern.

He has spent the last few months trying to distance himself from his statements demonising the police at a time when New Yorkers are concerned about public safety.

He has promised to build a new community safety agency so police don't respond to mental health calls, and in recent days suggested he would keep Jessica Tisch, the current police commissioner, who is tough on crime.

Since launching his bid for mayor Mr Mamdani has fielded attacks from the right over his race and religion.

Even Mr Cuomo has rolled out racist remarks, such as suggesting Mr Mamdani would cheer if New York suffered another 9/11.

While Mr Trump has tried to help engineer a win for Mr Cuomo, if Mr Mamdani wins the keys to Gracie Mansion, there is no doubt he will be a useful bogeyman for the Republican Party.

A fortnight ago, Mr Roth Smith met his old friend Mr Mamdani for breakfast, where talk inevitably swayed to the high chance Mr Mamdani will win next month's election.

Mr Mamdani said ‘‘‘can you believe we're here right now, having this discussion?'”, according to Mr Roth Smith, who said his friend's mayoral bid had started as simply wanting to offer people a progressive candidate.

“It's turned into him actually likely having to go be the mayor of New York City, which is tough for anyone, but he's genuinely excited”, he said.

Speaking on a podcast earlier this year about the period after university when he was exploring a rap career, Mr Mamdani said “there was a point at which my dad said, ‘I think it's time for a real job.'”

Now the young politician is one week away from potentially securing the biggest one in the city: New York Mayor.

Curtis Sliwa stands little chance of becoming New York's next mayor.

But when asked what it would take for him to drop out of the race, the red beret-wearing Republican left no room for ambiguity.

“A Mack truck hits me and I get turned into a speed bump, and they can't recover me in the ICU. That's the only way.”

Mr Sliwa has been behind in the polls from the outset and those desperate to keep Zohran Mamdani out of Gracie Mansion would prefer a two-horse race between the socialist and Andrew Cuomo.

Donald Trump and a raft of billionaire New Yorkers, including John Catsimatidis, who owns the radio station on which Mr Sliwa's has a show, have suggested the Republican drop out.

Mr Sliwa, who with his thick Brooklyn accent styles himself as a true man of the people, insisted the city's mayor isn't picked by “the billionaires or the professional political class.”

Recent polling shows Mr Cuomo, running as an independent, has halved the gap between himself and Mr Mamdani, the 34-year-old Democratic Socialist, to 11 per cent, a promising development for the former New York governor.

But Mr Sliwa, 71, has stuck his heels in.

“Sliwa is definitely polling worse than Cuomo, but he is the major party nominee,” said Sam Raskin, senior vice-president of Slingshot Strategies, a political consulting firm based in Brooklyn.

“It is kind of a strange situation that one of the major party nominees is being asked to drop out in favour of Cuomo, that is an unusual situation. So from his perspective [it's] ‘why don't you drop out Andrew Cuomo?... Why should I drop out to help you?'”

Mr Raskin notes that the outlier in this race is not Mr Sliwa, who ran unchallenged in the Republican primary, but Mr Cuomo who re-entered the race after he was trounced by Mr Mamdani in the Democratic primary.

“I think that first and foremost it's weird that Andrew Cuomo is running... The unusual thing is that Andrew Cuomo is running, not that Curtis Sliwa is,” he said.

Mr Sliwa's reluctance to acquiesce to pressure from the Republican leader follows years of tensions between the two New Yorkers, who were both firm fixtures of the New York tabloids in the 1980s and 1990s.

Mr Sliwa's journey to magazine covers was somewhat different to that of millionaire playboy Mr Trump.

Born into a working class Catholic family of Polish and Italian descent, Mr Sliwa was expelled from his Jesuit high school over a dispute about its dress code, before taking a job at McDonald's.

He first came to prominence in 1979 with the launch of his gang of crime-fighting vigilantes dubbed the Guardian Angels, who patrolled the subways at a time of heightened crime in the city.

He has been arrested around 74 times and, as he is always keen to remind the public at rallies or while debating his opponents, he was shot six times in the abdomen after speaking out against a powerful mafia family in 1992.

He has since helped launch more than 100 chapters of the Guardian Angels, including in the UK.

Mr Sliwa's notoriety means he is his own entity in New York — famous on his own terms.

He has also had his fair share of controversies. In 1992, he admitted that he and the Angels faked heroic rescues for publicity.

In December 2024, Mr Sliwa said his anti-crime crusaders resumed patrols on the network for the first time since 2020 after Debrina Kawam was fatally set on fire as she slept on a subway train to Brooklyn.

Mr Sliwa has known Mr Trump for decades. He still has a photograph of them from the 1986 New York State Conservative Party gala where they were both honourees.

“I said, ‘Don. You're not a conservative.' He said, ‘You're not a conservative,'” Mr Sliwa said.

“I have a love-hate relationship with Trump,” the mayoral candidate, who did not vote for the US president, previously told The Telegraph.

The Republican mayoral candidate has called Mr Trump a “manic depressive” and a “crack, a screwball”.

In a recent interview with the New York Times he said Mr Trump is “more of a populist. I consider myself a blue-collar, working-class populist”.

In recent weeks Mr Trump said Mr Sliwa wasn't “exactly prime time” and made fun of his love of cats: during his first bid for mayor in 2021 Mr Sliwa lived in his 320sqft studio flat next to Central Park with his third wife, animal rights activist Nancy, and 17 rescue cats. They now have six.

Mr Sliwa claims the last time the two men spoke was in 2013 when Mr Trump appeared on his radio show.

On the debate stage he has frequently said he knows how to negotiate with Mr Trump, and pledged not to go to war with him as Mr Mamdani suggested he would.

Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University, noted that while Mr Trump is the Republican leader, his interests and those of the party are not always aligned.

Mr Sliwa “is the candidate of one of the two major parties, not a third party candidate, so the party doesn't want him to drop out”, he said.

“That's not a good look for the Republican Party, that it doesn't even compete in the mayor's race of the nation's most important city.”

“The party has institutional norms and more lasting interests that go beyond this one person (Mr Trump), despite his reach, and I would think that plays a role in the conversations that take place away from media scrutiny,” Mr Reeher said.

GOP leaders of all five New York City boroughs have been unwavering in their support of Mr Sliwa and suggested Mr Cuomo should do a better job on the campaign trail if he wants voters.

So what could be next for the cat-loving Republican candidate who refuses to drop out of one of the most extraordinary New York mayoral races in recent history?

“I think the way this has shaken out, his window for city-wide office has likely closed. And it's also hard to imagine him running for something more local within the city at this point”, Prof Reeher said.

He added: “I'd say that his political career, in terms of elected office at least, is probably done.”

While his future career might be in doubt, one thing is for certain, Mr Sliwa has been enjoying the spotlight.

“He clearly loves the limelight and clearly loves the attention. He is extremely enigmatic on TV and good on radio and doing these interviews. I'm certain, I have not spoken to him, but I'm certain that he is having a fantastic time,” Mr Raskin said.

            Two men were arrested following an explosion this weekend at Harvard Medical School, according to the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force and the Harvard University Police Department.
    


            Logan David Patterson, 18, and Dominick Frank Cardoza, 20, both ofo Massachusetts, were arrested and charged with conspiracy to damage by means of fire or an explosive a building belonging to an institution that receives federal financial assistance, according to a criminal complaint. It's unclear whether the two have attorneys.
    


            They were arrested Tuesday morning at their homes, said Ted Docks, special agent in charge at the FBI's Boston division. Members of the public had called authorities to identify them after police released surveillance camera images, said Leah Foley, the US attorney for the district of Massachusetts.
    


            When asked whether there was a motive for the incident, Foley said, “The investigation is ongoing and it's just too early right now for us to speculate.”
    


            The incident came after a tense year for Harvard students, teachers and staff who were thrust into the national spotlight amid the White House's push to reshape higher education. Officials from Harvard and the White House have been in discussions for months about a high-dollar deal to restore all federal funding to the university and end its ongoing lawsuits against the administration.
    


            An officer responded to the Goldenson building just before 3 a.m. ET Saturday and saw two people fleeing after a fire alarm was activated, according to Harvard police.
    


            Surveillance footage circulated by police showed two masked people, one of them wearing what appeared to be a gray ski mask and the other a long face mask and black hoodie.
    


            “Surveillance video shows the two suspects lighting what appear to be roman candle fireworks at approximately 2:24 a.m.,” the complaint says, adding the two then climbed over the fence and ended up near a construction area surrounding the building.
    


            The pair then tried “to conceal or dispose of articles of clothing” that they had worn in the Goldenson Building, the complaint says.
    


            Docks called the incident “selfish” and “shortsighted.”
    


            “What's equally disturbing, these two men allegedly boasted about what they did to their friends,” he added.
    


            A message sent to the Harvard Medical School community Sunday afternoon said there was no structural damage to the building.
    


            “The small section of the fourth-floor hallway where the explosion took place has been cleared and is fully operational,” the message said. “There was no structural damage to the building, and all labs and equipment remain intact.”
    


            The Sunday message also said the building “will be fully open and accessible to all who work in the building.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","How phone calls, sessions at gun ranges and secret meetings in parks led the FBI to charge suspects in alleged terrorist plot","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/04/us/fbi-investigation-michigan-terrorist-plot","Tue, 04 Nov 2025 12:00:02 GMT","


            A series of encrypted phone calls – secretly recorded by a confidential FBI source – tipped off federal agents that a group was allegedly planning to carry out a terrorist attack in Michigan on behalf of ISIS, according to a criminal complaint unsealed Monday.
    


            Mohmed Ali, 20, and Majed Mahmoud, 20, face charges of “Receiving and transferring, and attempting and conspiring to transfer, firearms and ammunition knowing and having reasonable cause to believe that the firearms and ammunition would be used to commit a Federal crime of terrorism,” according to the criminal complaint.
    


            Federal officials have yet to charge a third person – a juvenile described throughout the complaint as Person 1 – in connection with the alleged plot.
    


            But the complaint details how agents doggedly surveilled the alleged co-conspirators for two months as they visited multiple gun ranges and held late-night meetings in local parks during what authorities allege was preparation for a possible terrorist attack.
    


            Then, based on what they believed to be references to a possible attack on Halloween, agents swooped in to seize the weapons and take the men into custody in the predawn hours of October 31.
    


            Here's what we know about how the investigation unfolded:
    


            According to an FBI affidavit supporting the criminal complaint, the agency began surveilling a man, described as “co-conspirator 1,” in 2024 as he traveled in the US and overseas.
    


            In June, agents allegedly tracked the man's phone to Dearborn, Michigan, and physical surveillance led them to Ali's home there, where he stayed for two nights.
    


            The following month, according to the FBI, the man joined a group call from overseas with five others – including an FBI confidential source, who recorded the meeting. Person 1, Mahmoud and Ali do not appear to have been part of this call.
    


5 key questions about how arrests in Michigan terror plot went down



            During the call, the group allegedly discussed “traveling together to Syria to join ISIS” and co-conspirator 1 said they were “gonna die there … unless,” he told the group, “the Amir sends you to Paris for a 2015.”
    


            A review of co-conspirator 1's cellphone allegedly revealed he had “Person 1's phone number saved in his phone under ‘Athari' and ALI's phone number saved in his phone as ‘Bukhari.'”
    


            According to the complaint, one of the participants on the call also stated, “Athari and Bukhari said they were going to stay back and do the ‘same thing as France.'”
    


            “Knowing Athari, it's (the attack) probably going to be at like a club, a disco,” co-conspirator 1 said, according to the complaint.
    


            The reference to Paris stood out to FBI counterterrorism experts. They concluded it was a thinly veiled nod to the coordinated ISIS-linked terrorist attacks that unfolded across Paris in November 2015. More than 130 people were killed in the attacks and scores more were wounded.
    


            After studying the call, the FBI concluded an attack could be imminent and began keeping close tabs on Ali and Mahmoud.
    


Suspects charged in alleged terror plot cited ISIS and may have tried to replicate Paris terror attack on US soil, FBI says



            According to the complaint, in the months following the June meeting with “co-conspirator 1,” Ali allegedly purchased a Beretta A300 Ultimata Black Shotgun, a “Sabre” Forged 16” rifle, as well as a holographic sight “built for close-quarter engagements with fast moving targets.”
    


            Mahmoud also allegedly purchased a rifle and two boxes of ammunition with more than 800 rounds in each box. In October, he allegedly purchased a red dot sight, which provides “the shooter a single point of focus during the aiming process,” according to the complaint.
    


            Then, in September and October, Ali, Mahmoud and Person 1 began practicing at local shooting ranges, under the watchful eye of FBI agents, the complaint states.
    


            Security footage obtained by the FBI shows all three men visiting local gun ranges over the course of several weeks.
    


            On multiple occasions, undercover FBI agents entered the range and surveilled the men from nearby as they practiced firing weapons. Although the agents did not identify themselves, according to the complaint they observed the men practicing with guns and ammunition like those they had previously purchased.
    


            Although Ali, Mahmoud and Person 1 are all under 21, the complaint noted in September they began traveling to a popular area in Ferndale, Michigan, known for its bars and clubs.
    


            “Many of the clubs and bars in this area intentionally attract members of the LGBTQ+ community,” the complaint states.
    


            The following month, FBI agents “observed three individuals appearing to match the physical description” of Person 1, Ali, and Mahmoud meeting at a local park in Dearborn, Michigan, around 9 p.m. They met up again the following week at another park.
    


            Since the men all live with their families, the FBI concluded the late-night meetups at the park “reflect their efforts to meet to plan an attack without being detected.”
    


            In September and October, the FBI received court-approved authorization to surveil communications between Person 1, Ali and Mahmoud.
    


            In calls and messages, they found multiple mentions of “pumpkin,” which agents concluded was a reference to “Halloween as the potential day for the attack they were plotting, an attack that they understood could result in their deaths and martyrdom.”
    


            “So ya, I talked to my brothers. We are going to do pumpkin,” Person 1 allegedly told Ali on October 24, according to the complaint.
    


            The FBI later notes in the complaint references to “brothers” likely mean “other ISIS supporters.”
    


            As the Halloween weekend loomed, a judge authorized the execution of search warrants on Ali and Mahmoud's homes.
    


            In the predawn hours of October 31, FBI agents descended on the Detroit suburb where the men lived and detonated smoke bombs before storming into their homes.
    


            Both Ali and Mahmoud were arrested.
    


            FBI Director Kash Patel later tweeted about the foiled terrorist plot but offered little additional detail. As a result, some Dearborn residents speculated whether the arrests were justified, or perhaps a way to profile the city's large Arab population, which has long been targeted for Islamophobic attacks.
    


            But on Monday, Attorney General Pam Bondi boasted on X the unsealed criminal complaint revealed “a major ISIS-linked terror plot.”
    


            “Our American heroes prevented a terror attack,” Bondi wrote.
    


            Both Mahmoud and Ali were shackled as they were escorted into court Monday, according to CNN reporters who attended the hearing. Both men acknowledged they had read the complaint against them and understood the charges.
    


            Attorneys for both of the men briefly spoke to reporters after the hearing, but declined to comment.
    


            Co-conspirator 1 has not been charged.
    


            If convicted, Ali and Mahmoud could face up to 15 years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine, a spokesperson for the US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan said.

Pizza Hut could soon be up for sale.

Yum Brands, Pizza Hut's parent company, said Tuesday it's conducting a formal review of options for the brand, which has struggled to compete in a crowded pizza market. 

Yum CEO Chris Turner said Pizza Hut has many strengths, including a global footprint and strong growth in many markets. Pizza Hut has nearly 20,000 stores in more than 100 countries, and its international sales were up 2% in the first nine months of this year. China is its second-largest market outside the U.S.

But Pizza Hut gets nearly half its sales from the U.S., where it has around 6,500 stores, and U.S. sales fell 7% in the same period. Pizza Hut was long saddled with large, outdated dine-in restaurants at a time when consumers wanted fast pickup and delivery. In 2020, one of Pizza Hut's largest franchisees filed for bankruptcy protection and closed 300 stores.

“The Pizza Hut team has been working hard to address business and category challenges; however, Pizza Hut's performance indicates the need to take additional action to help the brand realize its full value, which may be better executed outside of Yum Brands,” Turner said in a statement. “To truly take advantage of the brand we've built and the opportunities ahead, we've made the decision to initiate a thorough review of strategic options.”

Yum has not set a deadline for the completion of the review. The company said it will not make any further comments on the review.




Yum Brands shares were up nearly 7% in morning trading Tuesday. The company also owns KFC, Taco Bell and Habit Burger & Grill. Yum said Tuesday that its third-quarter revenue rose 8% thanks to strong sales at both KFC and Taco Bell.

Pizza Hut was founded in 1958 in Wichita, Kansas, by two brothers who borrowed $600 from their mother to open the store. They chose the name because their sign only had room for eight letters.

Pizza Hut's familiar red roof debuted in 1969 and by 1971 it was the top pizza chain in the world by sales. PepsiCo acquired Pizza Hut in 1977 but spun off its restaurant division — which became Yum Brands — in 1997. 

Domino's, with its focus on delivery and carryout pizza, has since become the world's largest pizza chain, with 21,750 stores.

The news of Pizza Hut's uncertain future comes the day after another 1950s-era dine-in icon, Denny's, announced it was being sold to an investor group and taken private. Like Pizza Hut, Denny's has also struggled with customers' shift to delivery and growing competition in casual dining options.

U.S. Special Envoy for Syria Thomas Barrack described Lebanon as a failed state and Iran-backed terror group Hezbollah had effectively supplanted the government. (Video: IISS Manama Dialogue 2025 via AP.)

As Hezbollah rebuilds its forces and Lebanon is accused of failing to enforce the ceasefire terms brokered last year, Israel's defense minister has fired off a warning to Beirut.

On Sunday, Defense Minister Israel Katz said, ""Hezbollah is playing with fire, and the president of Lebanon is dragging his feet,"" he said. ""The Lebanese government's commitment to dismantle Hezbollah's weapons and remove it from southern Lebanon must be realized. Enforcement will continue and deepen — we will not allow a threat to the residents of the north.""

His warning comes as Fox News Digital has learned that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) is weighing broader operations against the Iran-backed terrorist group after repeated violations of the truce.

A senior IDF officer stationed on the northern border told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview that Hezbollah remains fully armed and funded by Iran.

""Hezbollah didn't give up their heavy weapons,"" the officer said. ""They're still trained, still financed by Iran, and still trying to re-establish their positions. Our job is to make sure they don't succeed.""

On Monday, the IDF confirmed it had killed two Hezbollah commanders in southern Lebanon. Muhammad Ali Hadid, a senior member of Hezbollah's elite Radwan Force, was eliminated in Nabatieh, while another operative was struck in Ayta ash Shab after being seen collecting intelligence on Israeli positions.

""The terrorists' activities violated the understandings between Israel and Lebanon,"" the IDF said in a statement. ""The IDF will continue to operate to remove any threat to the State of Israel.""

The senior officer said the operations reflect Israel's new, proactive security doctrine. ""If somebody threatens us, we take control of the situation and make the threat go away,"" he said. ""We pushed Hezbollah back, so civilians could return. Now we're fortifying those gains and acting to prevent their recovery.""

That, he added, is the lesson Israel learned from Oct. 7. ""Until then, we sometimes looked the other way. That's over. We're not sitting and waiting for the next rocket.""

The officer said the IDF's 91st Division recently completed its largest exercise since the start of the war, designed to strengthen operational readiness for both defense and offensive operations along the Lebanese border — at sea, in the air, and on land.

""We tested our defensive systems, coordination, and rapid-response capabilities,"" he said. ""We're applying every lesson from Oct. 7 so our response next time will be immediate.""

According to Israel's Haaretz newspaper, intelligence officials believe Hezbollah is rapidly rebuilding its arsenal with Iranian assistance. The group has partially restored its weapons supply chain through Syria and Iraq, despite disruptions following the collapse of the Assad regime last year.

The Trump administration has also expressed frustration over Beirut's failure to curb Hezbollah. U.S. Special Envoy Thomas Barrack recently described Lebanon as ""a failed state"" because of its ""paralyzed government,"" and that Hezbollah pays its fighters more than the national army soldiers earns.

Responding to Israel's preemptive strikes last week, Lebanese Foreign Minister Youssef Raggi urged his visiting German counterpart on Friday to ""help pressure Israel to halt its attacks.""

""Only a diplomatic solution, not a military one, can ensure stability and maintain calm in the south,"" Raggi said, according to Lebanon's National News Agency (NNA).

He added that the Lebanese government ""is gradually moving forward with its decision to bring all weapons under state control.""

The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) on Thursday voiced ""deep concerns"", urging all parties ""to fully commit to the cessation of hostilities.""

UNIFIL added that it remains in contact with the Lebanese Armed Forces and emphasized that extending state authority ""is at the very core of Resolution 1701.""

Despite diplomatic criticism, Israeli commanders insist they will not allow Hezbollah to rebuild.

""We won't wait for another Oct. 7,"" the Israeli officer said. ""We're vigilant, we're rebuilding, and we're ready. The quiet we have now depends on Hezbollah's choices — not on our willingness to defend ourselves.""

FOX Business correspondent Grady Trimble breaks down electric vehicle sales as the deadline for prospective buyers to lock in federal tax credit approaches on 'Special Report.'

Driving an electric vehicle could soon mean charging as you go. A new wireless charging pilot in France is showing how coils built into the road can transfer more than 300 kilowatts of power to moving EVs. This breakthrough could make long trips possible without stopping at a charging station.

RESEARCHERS CREATE REVOLUTIONARY AI FABRIC THAT PREDICTS ROAD DAMAGE BEFORE IT HAPPENS

The technology comes from Electreon Wireless, working with Vinci Construction, Gustave Eiffel University and Hutchinson. Together, they've installed about a one-mile stretch of road near Paris that can transfer energy to EVs in motion.

So far, the system has powered a truck, van, car and bus — all equipped with special pickup coils. Early tests show the system can deliver peak power over 300 kW and more than 200 kW under steady conditions. That's strong enough to keep large cargo trucks rolling for miles without a pit stop.

If widely adopted, dynamic wireless charging could change how America powers transportation. Heavy-duty trucks could use smaller, cheaper batteries. Delivery vehicles and buses could stay on the road longer with less downtime.

For drivers, it could mean never having to worry about range anxiety again. Instead of hunting for the nearest charger, the highway itself could be your power source.

WOULD YOU BUY THE WORLD'S FIRST PERSONAL ROBOCAR?

The big questions now are about cost and control. Who pays to install these power roads? How much will it cost to use them? Public-private partnerships may hold the key, but until those details are ironed out, large-scale rollout remains a challenge.

Still, with global momentum building, it's only a matter of time before dynamic wireless charging becomes part of everyday driving.

This innovation is not limited to Europe. In Detroit, Michigan, a public road on 14th Street already uses embedded charging coils that can send power to EVs as they move. In Indiana, Purdue University and the Indiana Department of Transportation are building a quarter-mile highway section designed to charge electric vehicles, including heavy trucks, while they travel.

For drivers, this technology could make owning an EV easier and more practical. Your vehicle could recharge during normal trips without the need to stop, plug in or wait. That level of convenience could help expand EV adoption across the United States, lowering emissions and fuel costs for millions.

THE ROAD TO PROSPERITY WILL BE PAVED BY AUTONOMOUS TRUCKING

The innovation could transform U.S. roads, cutting downtime for electric trucks and buses. (Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson)

Wireless charging roads are moving from concept to construction and showing real promise for a new era of electric travel. The idea that vehicles could charge while driving has the potential to transform how we move goods, commute and use energy. There are still big questions about who will fund widespread installation and how well the system will perform under real traffic and weather conditions. The technology is advancing fast, but scaling it will take time, collaboration and investment. If these challenges can be overcome, dynamic wireless charging could redefine the way we think about mobility and sustainability.

Students and professors are in a drawn-out battle over grade inflation. It may never end.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.

Harvard is worried about going soft. Specifically, about grade inflation, the name for giving ever higher marks to ever more students. According to an “Update on Grading and Workload” from the school's office of undergraduate education, released last week to faculty and students, this trend has reached a catastrophic threshold. Twenty years ago, 25 percent of the grades given to Harvard undergrads were A's. Now it's more than 60 percent.

For all those students, though, the mere release of this document could be taken as its own catastrophe. “The whole entire day, I was crying,” one freshman told The Harvard Crimson. “It just felt soul-crushing.” One of her classmates warned that stricter standards would take a toll on students' mental health—“I was looking forward to being fulfilled by my studies,” she said, “rather than being killed by them”—even as the report itself observed that deference to mental-health concerns has made the problem worse. A member of the men's lacrosse team lamented that the findings failed to account for “how many hours we're putting into our team, our bodies, and then also school.”

As a professor at another elite private university, who has been teaching undergraduates for more than 20 years, I have surely been guilty of inflating grades. I have also endured the confusing wrath of students who seem to think we professors are ruining their lives by awarding only 60 percent of each class with A's. The spectacle unfolding at Harvard is more visible, but the condition that underlies it is widespread and chronic.

Read: The perverse consequences of the easy A

On the surface, grade inflation might seem simple to address: Just reestablish, in clear terms, that the baseline mark for showing up is not an A, but something lower; then give special credit only to the students who demonstrate their mastery and achievement. But it's not so easy. Grade inflation has become a strange and wicked problem on campus—and it's one without a single cause or an obvious solution.

If the culture of grading has eroded, it has done so over years and decades. Not all of the reasons are bad. Lower standards help first-generation college students and others who might arrive on campus with less traditional academic preparation. They also accommodate more modern forms of teaching, such as the “creative assignments and group projects” mentioned in the Harvard report. In total, the change has been so slow and steady that even faculty can barely feel it. We've simply been adjusting the expectations of our students, year after year.

Back in the mid-aughts, I was teaching at Georgia Institute of Technology, a highly selective technical university. One of my classes involved many different types of student work, including software projects, essays, and formal exams. The exams were hard, but everything they tested had been covered in my lectures, and the answers were definitive; grading was straightforward. Assessing the projects and essays was more subjective, as I was looking for creativity and insight. The students found this difficult, because they were unsure of what I wanted.

The thing is, figuring out what I might have wanted was supposed to be part of the assignment! I was asking my students to interpret my instructions in unexpected ways that exercised their own interests, abilities, and perspectives. For example, if I'd asked for a nontraditional computer paint program, and a student made one that let a user toss virtual pebbles into an on-screen pond to simulate water ripples that swelled and vanished, that would have surprised and delighted me. If the student really pulled it off, they'd get an A.

But students were complaining, so I tried to be responsive: I started giving unambiguous requirements. I told the students that simply meeting those requirements on a written or creative assignment, and doing nothing more, would earn them a C. To get a B or even an A, they would have to go further—not just by doing more, but by demonstrating a synthetic grasp of the material, carrying out their creative vision, completing the work with special polish, and so on. As ever, students were invited to my office hours to discuss the details.

Read: College students have already changed forever

The students hated this. They raised complaints with me or my teaching assistants: Why was mine a B and hers an A? What more could I have done? Appeals to “effort” were also common—as if exertion were a stand-in for achievement. What I was asking for was well outside the established norm. Students complained. A few even posted anonymous threats against my family in an online forum. (Such threats are not entirely uncommon in academia.) In other classes, a grade of A might have been earned by having met requirements. To get anything less would represent having “points taken off”—a concept that for students had by then become a gross obsession. Sometime since then, it became an ideology.

Over the past 25 years, while grades were going up, college was also getting more expensive and harder to get into. In 2001, Harvard accepted 10.7 percent of its applicants—an all-time low at the time. Last year it took in 3.6 percent. As a result, today's average student may be of higher quality, and more deserving of an A, than ever before. But even if so, that's not the whole story. Over the same period, college administrators institutionalized a concept called “student success.” Originally intended to reduce churn and increase graduation rates, student success expanded into something much broader—a blend of traditional academic achievement, personal satisfaction, and even wellness. These and other factors helped transform students from scholars into customers.

College in America has always been confused, a combination of a coming-of-age facility and a credentialing service. But the customer-centric, professionalizing function of undergraduate life muddled matters even further. College wasn't just for discovering who you are or even meeting a future spouse, but for getting you into a career. The Harvard report notes this phenomenon: Many undergraduates see clubs, internships, and other extracurricular activities as necessary for getting jobs.

Meanwhile, the job of being a professor became more tenuous and provisional—some 75 percent of faculty are nontenured, many working term to term, with the fate of their employment determined, in part, by student course evaluations. Those surveys are, in turn, notoriously unsound as a measure of learning, but they do exert pressure to make students happy. And you know what makes a student happy? Giving them an A.

During the same period, due to changes in the university-accreditation process, a milkshake of new bureaucratic demands on classroom management was also served to the faculty. Failing to meet these requirements could put a school's federal funding, including Pell Grants, at risk. Administrators started urging professors and departments to connect classroom work directly to “measurable learning outcomes” through “evaluative rubrics,” as the lingo of the process calls them. These are the elements that would satisfy the accreditors, and thus help the school maintain its student-aid support and ability to award degrees.

Read: The most disrespected document in higher education

But isn't that what the grades are for? professors asked. Not anymore. We got the sense that as far as the accreditors were concerned, grades could not be trusted, because they sometimes varied by instructor, lacked diagnostic detail, or failed in other ways to provide sufficiently granular or reliable evidence of specific learning outcomes. In other words, the faculty was told—and has been reminded ever since—that grades do not prove mastery or achievement.

Amid and around this Kafkaesque affair, costs kept rising, students became even more like customers, and faculty came to accept that state of affairs. Constant pressure to perform and compete produced students so wound up with anxiety, they often came to office hours not for academic help but for therapy, despite our profound lack of qualifications for that role.

In the meantime, worries over students' mental health, and a reasonable desire to accommodate disabilities or disadvantages, made us ever more inclined to yield to the rising tide of grade-inflationary demands. Administrators, attuned to student gripes and terrified of the accreditors, were pressing us to avoid any ambiguity in what we asked of students. I can say this from experience: Even the faculty who resisted these changes would endure year after year of pressure to conform.

And let's not forget the computers. They've made it easier for undergrads to cheat on their assignments. But networked software services have also changed how classrooms work, and how students and professors relate to grades. By virtue of those changes, digitizing college life has led to grade inflation, too.

In the 1990s, when I was in college, your final grade in any class would be something of a mystery until you got it in the mail, or saw it taped to the professor's office door. Until then, you'd do assignments and take exams. You'd get your scores, and if you were obsessive or concerned, you could calculate how you were doing by referring back to the syllabus: If I get an A on the second paper and the final, I can still eke out an A for the semester.

These days, thanks to the “courseware” that has become ubiquitous in higher ed, students can see exactly how they are performing in every course all the time. The software can even project their final grade based on how they've done so far, in a data-dashboard sort of way. Students love this, or think they do, because they don't want to be surprised. But the courseware data dashboards have another clear effect: Like so many other aspects of the current college experience, they orient students' attention toward their grades above all else.

At some colleges and universities, courseware has been mandated. Schools have done this, in part, because students are accustomed to using the software and prefer to see all their work in one place. But the mandates also help colleges shovel heaps of bureaucratic muck—validating data for accreditation, carrying out enrollment, flagging troubled students, aggregating metrics of all kinds. Whether this IT-ification of university life makes teaching and learning any better is not important for the topic at hand. The point is, all of it together has reinforced the focus on graded performance, offering students and faculty more opportunities for anxiety and conflict.

I have tried to find ways to return to the old ethos of grading, in which I would judge a student as a whole person rather than as a series of assignment transactions. But in the age of courseware, I must give this holism a name and a value and a slot in the gradebook. Fine. I call it “Slush”—a grading category that I put into the system to account for whatever the rubric, the outcomes, and their computerized rigidity cannot. Slush is my gesture at an overall assessment of student performance and growth.

But, alas, my Slush is making students anxious, too. “What's Slush?” they sometimes ask, halfway through the course, because they didn't read my explanation in the syllabus. Some complain, “Yours is the only class where I don't know my grade.” Assessing overall performance and growth, it seems, might not be worth my trouble.

More students get A's, yet students are unhappy with their grades. Professors, too, have been worn out by the grading nightmare. We now plan with dread for all the ways our students might misconstrue our feedback or petition for the “additional points” that they are sure we have stolen from them. Grading was never fun, but now it is odious. The easiest answer is just to give the students what they expect, at least some of the time, so you can get on with the rest of your job—which has been made immeasurably harder in lots of other ways.

The knots tighten and multiply. The courseware grading system enforces the use of an unambiguous grading rubric, which furthers the bureaucratization of classroom life that helped to amplify grade inflation in the first place. Just as the students seek out easier classes for a certain A, the professors pursue simpler course designs that de-escalate the fighting over grades.

Everybody understands that, in the current state of things, grades say little about what students know or learn. But the machinery of grading churns on. The same students who scrabbled for achievement to gain entry into colleges like mine, where they clamber for the A's they believe they deserve, know that grades still matter—for medical- or professional-school admission, or to compete with their peers for limited slots at management-consulting internships, or even just to appease their parents, who may be just as prone as they are to mistaking assessment for achievement.

To demand a fix for grade inflation is to put multiple-choice answers on an essay question. It asks for something that cannot be marked as right or wrong. This, as it happens, is the type of lesson most professors yearn to impart in our classes: that process, not its product, is the goal. Many students learn that lesson much later, after they graduate, when they look back and wonder at their former obsession with grades. By then, however, they are no longer customers of higher ed. As for us professors, we never leave. Each year the grades rise a little more; each year we feel it less. And the bureaucratic strangle that leads to this inflation continues its creep.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","There Was One Dick Cheney All Along","https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2025/11/understanding-dick-cheney/684809/","Tue, 04 Nov 2025 16:38:13 GMT","

The end of the former vice president's career reflected its beginnings.

In Vice President Dick Cheney's later years, former detractors sometimes expressed puzzlement about his political trajectory. The onetime designated villain of the Iraq War had somehow mutated into a hero of the anti-Trump constitutional resistance. Had he changed? Or had they misjudged him?

People do change. Perspectives can shift. But oftentimes the secret to later-life decisions is encoded in early experiences.

Richard Bruce Cheney arrived in Washington in 1968 as a 27-year-old congressional intern. Within seven years, he rose to become White House chief of staff.

That spectacular ascent owed much to Cheney's talents and work ethic. It owed more to the catastrophes and traumas of Vietnam and Watergate. As more senior staff resigned in disgrace or faced indictment, the way lay open for a younger man untainted by previous failures and scandals. Early in the Nixon administration, Cheney formed a close bond with Donald Rumsfeld, another thrusting young man a few years his senior. The president who succeeded Nixon, Gerald Ford, named Rumsfeld his first chief of staff. Rumsfeld selected Cheney as his deputy. In November 1975, Rumsfeld moved to head the Department of Defense. Cheney succeeded him in the White House job.

Cheney's boyhood coincided with America's rise to global preeminence. At age 34, he found himself near the top of the U.S. government at a time of humiliation and defeat. The new Ford administration set to work restoring the government's credibility at home and America's position in the world.

After Ford's electoral loss in 1976, Cheney ran for Congress from his native Wyoming. He won his seat and rose rapidly in the House leadership. Along the way, he and his wife, Lynne, co-wrote an insightful analysis of congressional power.

The party of which Cheney was now a leader had been badly split by Ronald Reagan's challenge to Ford in the 1976 Republican primaries. Cheney was a Ford loyalist sympathetic to Reagan's ideas, and especially Reagan's faith in American power. The argument between Ford and Reagan was less about what America should do than about what America could do. Ford was most influenced by Henry Kissinger's deep pessimism about American capabilities. The most insightful analysis of Kissinger's thinking, Barry Gewen's The Inevitability of Tragedy argues that Kissinger did not believe that the United States was institutionally, ideologically, or temperamentally suited to global leadership. True statesmanship required the U.S. to reach the best deals it could get before its power ran out.

Cheney never accepted that view. His robust support of Reagan's self-confident policies elevated him to the No. 2 position among House Republicans in 1987. He was poised to become the next Republican speaker of the House but for another chance occurrence. In 1989, newly elected President George H. W. Bush nominated John Tower as secretary of defense. Tower, a U.S. senator from Texas, was a longtime Bush ally. He was also an alcoholic, a sexual harasser, and a man who had offended enough fellow senators that they felt little inclination to overlook the first two offenses in the list. When his nomination fell apart, Cheney got the appointment instead—and then efficiently organized the U.S. liberation of Kuwait from Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War of 1990–91.

Governments make mistakes, then overcorrect for those mistakes. The Bush administration halted its 1991 campaign at the Kuwait-Iraq border. The administration collectively assumed that the Iraqi military or the Iraqi people would finish off Saddam Hussein without direct U.S. intervention. Instead, Saddam brutally crushed rebellions against his rule, in great part because the U.S. loosened its “no fly” rules to allow Saddam to use helicopter gunships to massacre civilian demonstrators. Inside Iraq, this permission was interpreted as U.S. complicity in Saddam's survival. In fact, the decision seems to have been an unauthorized bungle by the U.S. commander in the region, Norman Schwarzkopf, who later told an interviewer that the Iraqis had “suckered” him.



The lesson Cheney took was that the Saddam problem would not solve itself. As Saddam resumed his aggressions and provocations after 1991, Cheney counted the end of the Gulf War as unfinished business. Like Ford, Bush lost reelection. Cheney entered private life as CEO of Halliburton, a major government contractor. He became a regular at events of the American Enterprise Institute. I got to know him a little in those days: a man who spoke little, listened deeply, and fitted everything he heard into a well-stocked and well-organized mind.

As conservative as he was on economics and national security, Cheney had little interest in the socially reactionary side of the conservative program. He voted in favor of the anti-abortion wish list in the House, but ignored the issue once he no longer faced a local electorate. (Later, he would endorse same-sex marriage during the election of 2004, at a time when the Bush-Cheney reelection campaign was hoping to use state referendums to ban same-sex marriage to energize voters against the Kerry-Edwards ticket.)

His indifference to the hottest of hot-button conservative issues doomed from the start any hope for a Cheney presidential run in 2000. Instead he offered the benefits of his deep experience to George W. Bush's campaign.

Bush organized his campaign and his administration on a lesson he had learned from his father's defeat in 1992.

The elder Bush delivered arguably the most successful foreign-policy record in U.S. history: not only the Gulf War victory, but also the peaceful end of the Cold War, the securing of the dangerously poorly managed Soviet nuclear arsenal, and more. None of it mattered much to the U.S. electorate in November 1992. The younger Bush concluded that his energy and attention in his first term would be focused tightly on the domestic agenda. Foreign-policy tasks, including the inherited Saddam problem, would await his second term, if he won it. Cheney's expertise on security matters buffered Bush from being distracted by non-crucial foreign-policy work. That plan exploded with the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, but it explains much about how the Bush administration found itself situated on the day of the al-Qaeda terror attacks.



By the end of 2001, the Taliban had been toppled in Afghanistan, but Osama bin Laden had escaped. The Bush administration faced a messy set of choices about what to do next. Reconstruct Afghanistan? That was the option urged by many Democrats. But nation-building in the world's least hospitable environment seemed a costly and doomed undertaking. Declare victory and return to the domestic agenda? There were many on the Bush team who favored that approach, but with Osama bin Laden still at large, who would believe that occupying Kabul counted as victory? There had to be something else the U.S. could do, equal to the horror of the attack the U.S. had suffered on 9/11.

Finishing Saddam seemed, to many, that “something.”

After the Iraq War went wrong, Bush and Cheney were often and angrily accused of lying about Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction. This seems to me a charge grounded in a deep misunderstanding of events. Before 9/11, the administration underestimated al-Qaeda. After 9/11, it overcorrected in the opposite direction about Iraq. Every ambiguous piece of evidence was interpreted in the most ominous possible way, less as a political device than out of sincere conviction. Never again would the administration repeat the undervigilance of September 10.

Saddam Hussein wanted for his own reasons to convince the world that he possessed—or soon could possess—terrible weapons. He succeeded. President Bush said in his 2002 State of the Union address, “Iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support terror. The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax, and nerve gas, and nuclear weapons for over a decade. This is a regime that has already used poison gas to murder thousands of its own citizens—leaving the bodies of mothers huddled over their dead children. This is a regime that agreed to international inspections—then kicked out the inspectors. This is a regime that has something to hide from the civilized world.”  I was part of the team that worked on that speech. In retrospect, there is a bitter irony in the last line of the quoted text. Saddam did indeed have “something to hide,” but it was precisely that his regime's plots to develop weapons had collapsed in corruption and incompetence. Saddam himself may not have understood the magnitude of the failure.

The Iraq War consumed the Bush administration—and, before it was over, undercut Cheney's standing within the administration. The U.S. did eventually stand up a successor regime, but not the strong and pro-Western regime hoped for in 2003. Iraq has returned to world oil markets, but it remains a violent and unstable place open to Iranian influence and intimidation.

Anger and resentment left behind by the war were an important source of support for Donald Trump's campaign for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. Trump flat-out lied when he pretended to have opposed the Iraq War in advance. But that lie did not matter much so long as his main opponent for the nomination was the brother of the president who had started the war. Trump won the nomination and then entered the presidency. Over the decade since, he has remodeled the Republican Party into everything that Cheney had always opposed and rejected.

Trump's Republicanism is deeply pessimistic about America's role in the world. It sees the United States as one great power among many, no better than the others.

Trump's Republicanism is radically statist and protectionist, in service to reactionary cultural politics.

And it is above all contemptuous of law and constitutional limits. The very week of former Vice President Cheney's death, the Trump administration will argue at the Supreme Court in favor of the president's power to impose limitless tariffs on his sole personal claim that some kind of economic emergency exists, without any right of anybody else to question or refute that claim—meaning that the president has effectively discarded and replaced Congress's Article I power to tax or refrain from taxing.

The young constitutional conservative elevated to the highest offices of government by the Watergate scandal would have been appalled and disgusted—and so was the old constitutional conservative who lived to see his cherished daughter a leader of the last band of principled conservative opposition to Trump's attempt to overthrow a presidential election by fraud and force.

“In my beginning is my end,” wrote T. S. Eliot. There was one Dick Cheney all along. Know him better as you tell and honor the life story of this great servant of the American people in all his strengths and weaknesses, triumphs and failures.

Why regime change is unlikely to bring a return to democracy

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

For many Venezuelans, this is a disorienting moment. For a quarter century, our government has been using the threat of an American military attack to justify more and more authoritarian control over the country. Venezuelans got accustomed to dismissing it all as noise, just a pretext the dictatorship employed to stamp out civil rights. Suddenly, it's not just noise. President Donald Trump is very visibly preparing to do what Nicolás Maduro spent decades swearing the Americans would one day do: use military power to put an end to Venezuela's socialist revolution.

The United States has been bombing Venezuelan fast boats, which it alleges are ferrying drugs north, while massing naval forces in the Caribbean. Trump has vacillated between hinting that air strikes inside Venezuela will be next and saying that he doubts the U.S. will go to war with Venezuela. The administration keeps portraying its actions as part of a counternarcotics operation—ostensibly the first such operation in history to require the use of an aircraft carrier. And yet, the White House doesn't seem to have committed anything like the number of ground troops necessary to invade a country the size of Venezuela. Rather than an old-fashioned ground invasion, then, the U.S. seems to be preparing a bombing campaign from the air.

In the absence of a spelled-out plan, we're left to try to infer one. Secretary of State Marco Rubio—a Cold War–style anti-Communist—describes Maduro as the leader of a designated narco-terrorist organization, rather than a government, leading many to conclude that the endgame here is to depose him. Perhaps the idea is to use military pressure to push somebody within the Venezuelan security apparatus to move against Maduro. Even if such a plan succeeds—which is very doubtful—it is likelier to deliver Venezuela to a different style of military dictatorship than it is to bring a return to democracy.

Contemplating an imminent American assault on my country of origin is painful. But the Venezuela about to be attacked has little in common with the place where I grew up. The messy, vibrant democracy of my youth is a distant memory, snuffed out by a quarter century of ever harsher authoritarianism. Even the combative Venezuela of eight years ago, where kids with homemade shields assembled in the streets day after day to battle the dictatorship's goons, is a fading memory.

Brutally put down by Maduro's thuggish regime, that protest movement gave way to a mass exodus. Nobody has reliable numbers, but one commonly cited guess is that about a quarter of the population has left in the past decade: a shocking 8 million people. The numbers tell only part of the story. The rest is about who left: young, ambitious, high-agency people, many of whom are now delivering meals on bikes in Bogotá, Madrid, and Washington, D.C.

Gisela Salim-Peyer: Authoritarianism feels surprisingly normal—until it doesn't

Mass migration has ripped the demographic heart out of Venezuela. Many of those left behind are, well, the mirror image of those who emigrated: too young or too old or too sick to face a brutal migrant journey. They stayed behind in an economy in ruins, many of them living off of the remittances sent by migrants, under the control of a hyper-corrupt state that is feeding parasitically on the few resources Venezuela still has.

We know that a large majority of the Venezuelans who remain in the country want to get rid of the government, because the opposition won last year's presidential election in a landslide—67 percent to Maduro's 30 percent, according to domestic monitors—before Maduro announced himself the winner. That brazen theft met with a scattering of protests that were quickly put down. The regime has become much more repressive: At checkpoints around the country, uniformed men now routinely stop drivers and go through their phones looking for anything that suggests anti-regime sentiment—a stray WhatsApp message, a photo, anything—and pack people off to jail if they find it. People in Caracas are now careful to delete any potentially offending message before they go out. The climate of fear would make organizing any type of resistance challenging even if most of the people who once led protests in Venezuela hadn't left. Many of those still there seem to have internalized long ago that the time for protests is over. This is the Venezuela that Rubio seems to expect to overthrow the regime.

The opposition, now mostly in exile, also seems to have internalized the impossibility of challenging the regime from within. Its leader—and the newly minted Nobel Peace Prize Laureate—María Corina Machado has assiduously courted the Trump administration, to the point of lending credence to the crackpot theory, already rejected by the U.S. intelligence community, that Maduro personally controls the notorious Tren de Aragua prison gang. The plan seems to be to goad the U.S. into military intervention—a shabby, desperate posture for a leader of stunning personal courage but questionable political judgment.

Maduro has in any case outwitted dozens of attempts to depose him over the years. Hanging on to power seems to be the only thing he's relatively competent at. His regime has spent lavishly on a huge, Cuban-backed military intelligence apparatus devoted to detecting any sign of disloyalty in the ranks. If and when American bombs start to fall, Venezuela's military counterintelligence system will certainly be put to the test. But it could very well pass that test.

Then again, it might not. One truism in Latin American politics is that nearly every revolt is fueled by the frustration of junior army officers. Maduro's junior officers must be nothing if not frustrated. A generation of senior officers has ignored army regulations and failed to retire on schedule, blocking their path to promotion. The classic case here is that of General Vladimir Padrino, a defense minister, who ought to have retired five years ago but has received special dispensation to remain in uniform year after year. Other generals have likewise stayed on past their retirement dates.

These generals stand to profit from the wide range of businesses, legal and illegal, that the armed forces now control. That includes drug trafficking but goes much further: illegal mining in the country's ecologically sensitive southern region, construction, retail, imports, and more. Generals capture by far the biggest share of those profits; the colonels and captains who serve under them likely get table scraps.

Anne Applebaum: Why María Corina Machado deserved the Nobel Peace Prize

Alarmed at the prospect of facing an American bombing campaign, junior officers could well calculate that they're better off pushing Maduro aside than dodging American missiles. The power play, if it came, would likely be bloody. And risky. But Rubio's supposed fantasy could conceivably happen: A brave young lieutenant colonel pushes Maduro aside, wrapping himself in the American flag and thanking Trump for liberating the country as he shows Hugo Chávez's successor the door.

Even if this happens, though, it's unlikely to herald a return to democracy—first, because in Venezuela's hyper-militarized society, Nobel Prizes count for a lot less than automatic weapons. No young officer who takes over from Maduro is likely to empower a figure as uncompromising as Machado. Second, because the American backers of this strategy are so palpably indifferent to democracy themselves.

Steeped in a culture of corruption, those who would take over from Maduro would continue to prioritize enriching themselves. If they needed to flatter Trump to get their chance at the spoils, they'd do so. A new government could then loot Venezuela hand in hand with the Trump administration. The Venezuelan oil industry could once again raise capital and market its product in the United States, opening up new vistas for extraction on both sides of the trade. That the Trump administration could be induced to do business with fellow kleptocrats rather than press Machado's suit seems too obvious a point to belabor.

But all of that assumes that a putsch does succeed, and this is dubious. There is virtually no known instance of air strikes alone forcing regime change anywhere in the world. Much will depend on how, exactly, the Americans conduct their campaign. And that, in turn, will depend on how long Trump can remain focused on it. If an assault doesn't yield immediate results, will he stay the course, or will his attention wander?

The maximally stupid outcome—which, by that very fact, seems all too probable—is that Trump gets bored of the whole affair and stops the air strikes after a putsch has been discovered, but before it's succeeded. An American assault would then be remembered mostly for helping Maduro identify the next set of tenants for his torture chambers. That's a grim prospect—but then, in Venezuela, yesterday's grimmest prospects become tomorrow's headlines with dreadful regularity.

When Sam Bankman-Fried prepared to testify in his own criminal trial, things didn't go according to plan.

Bankman-Fried wanted to tell jurors his side of the story. Part of that story, in his view, was that he received advice from company lawyers that made him think everything he did was OK.

US District Judge Lewis Kaplan, who oversaw Bankman-Fried's 2023 criminal trial, wasn't so sure. The judge had Bankman-Fried testify in court without a jury and allowed prosecutors to cross-examine him. Afterward, the judge ruled that the purported advice he got from lawyers was irrelevant to the case and would only confuse jurors.

On Tuesday, a panel of three judges is set to consider whether that hearing, which is at the heart of Bankman-Fried's appeal, is enough to overturn his guilty verdict.

Bankman-Fried still testified for the jury the following day, but he wasn't allowed to talk about everything he wanted to. Ultimately, the jurors convicted the former FTX CEO and cofounder of eight criminal counts, for several varieties of fraud and money laundering. Kaplan sentenced Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison.

In an appeal brief, Bankman-Fried's attorney, Alexandra Shapiro, described the preview hearing as a ""deposition"" and said it was ""unprecedented.""

""The government had obtained a free preview of Bankman-Fried's testimony, and a free practice session to better cross him when he testified before the jury,"" she wrote.

According to prosecutors, Bankman-Fried orchestrated an $11 billion fraud scheme. He took money belonging to depositors of FTX, his cryptocurrency exchange, and commingled it with Alameda Research, his hedge fund.

Bankman-Fried and his co-conspirators used that money for advertising, investments, luxurious Bahamas real estate, and political donations — all while lying to investors and lenders about where the funds were going.

At the trial, Kaplan forbade Bankman-Fried's lawyers from making the argument that FTX was always solvent and that depositors would get all their money back. His lawyers couldn't tell jurors what they argued in court papers, which was that Bankman-Fried's investments were just that — investments, not theft. In particular, FTX made a $500 million investment in the now-red-hot artificial intelligence company Anthropic. That 8% stake would be worth more than $14.6 billion today. (FTX's bankruptcy attorneys sold the Anthropic holdings at lower valuations to repay creditors.)

Bankman-Fried failed at risk management, not because he was a criminal fraudster, his lawyers said.

Prosecutors said in their appeal brief that Bankman-Fried's trial was fair. While his preview hearing may have been unprecedented, ""the absence of precedent cannot establish plain error,"" they wrote.

In fact, the practice might have even helped him, they said.

""It is equally plausible that Bankman-Fried benefited from first testifying outside the presence of the jury — in his trial testimony, he avoided the long-winded answers that had come across as evasive, and abandoned certain assertions that fell apart on the stand,"" they wrote in the brief.

Representing Bankman-Fried in Tuesday's appeal hearing will be Shapiro, an experienced white-collar appellate lawyer who clerked for former Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and who recently achieved legal superstar status after serving on Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' trial defense team. Shapiro has also represented other high-profile white-collar defendants on appeal, including Charlie Javice and Bill Hwang.

For the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, Nathan Rehn, also a former Ginsburg clerk, is expected to argue before the three-judge panel at the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.

In addition to arguing that Bankman-Fried didn't get a fair shot at defending himself, Shapiro has argued that Kaplan gave the jury incorrect instructions for deciding on Bankman-Fried's intent, and that the judge should have forced FTX's bankruptcy lawyers to turn over more discovery material to help him prepare for his defense.

Shapiro said the appellate court should order a new trial for Bankman-Fried, and with a different judge.

In the meantime, Bankman-Fried is serving his sentence in FCI Terminal Island, a low-security prison in the Los Angeles area, while fishing for a pardon from President Donald Trump. His co-conspirator, Caroline Ellison, who was the star witness at his trial, is serving a 2-year sentence.

President Donald Trump said he will withhold November food stamps until the government reopens.

""SNAP BENEFITS, which increased by Billions and Billions of Dollars (MANY FOLD!) during Crooked Joe Biden's disastrous term in office. (Due to the fact that they were haphazardly 'handed' to anyone for the asking, as opposed to just those in need, which is the purpose of SNAP!), will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before! "" the president wrote in a Tuesday morning Truth Social post.

Trump's announcement comes alongside rulings from federal judges in Rhode Island and Massachusetts calling on the administration to fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which 42 million Americans rely on to afford groceries each month.

In a November 3 court filing, the US Department of Agriculture said it ""is complying with the Court's order and will fulfill its obligation to expend the full amount of SNAP contingency funds."" The USDA said it has authorized states to begin dispersing benefits to eligible households, and it ""intends to deplete SNAP contingency funds completely and provide reduced SNAP benefits for November.""

This would cover 50% of eligible households' current food stamp allotments, the administration said. The money would be pulled from government emergency funds.

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins wrote in an X post on Tuesday that ""USDA sent SNAP guidance to States. My team stands by to offer immediate technical assistance."" She continued that ""If the government opens, families get their FULL benefit much more quickly,"" but did not say the administration will withhold funds.

Democracy Forward, a policy and legal advocacy group and plaintiff in the Rhode Island case, told Business Insider that they filed a motion Tuesday to compel the Trump administration to disperse benefits as soon as possible in accordance with the court orders.

Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island has told the administration it must respond by end of day tomorrow and set a new hearing for Thursday, November 6, Democracy Forward said.

""The Trump-Vance administration continues to play politics with people's lives through failing to ensure SNAP payments are expeditiously available,"" Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward,"" said. ""This is immoral and unlawful. The political posturing should stop now. The administration needs to fully fund SNAP benefits so people can eat, today.""

SNAP benefits were set to run out on November 1 after their typical funding sources lapsed. Patrick A. Penn, deputy undersecretary for US Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services, said in a letter to state leaders on October 24 that the Agriculture Department is ""suspending all November 2025 benefit allotments until such time as sufficient federal funding is provided, or until FNS directs State agencies otherwise.""

In documents seen by Business Insider, the US Department of Agriculture previously said it has money held in contingency funds to be used in case of emergency, but that those funds cannot be used for SNAP. Monday's court filing means that the Trump administration would have had to use these funds to pay for SNAP until the government reopens.

""This means that no funds will remain for new SNAP applicants certified in November, disaster assistance, or as a cushion against the potential catastrophic consequences of shutting down SNAP entirely,"" the administration said in the November 3 filing.

Tuesday's Truth Social post is a pivot from Trump's previous stance on SNAP. In a post on October 31, after the judges' rulings, the president wrote that ""I have instructed our lawyers to ask the Court to clarify how we can legally fund SNAP as soon as possible.""

It's unclear if Trump can use executive power to halt SNAP during the shutdown, especially with two cases pending in federal court.

The US Department of Agriculture and White House did not immediately respond for comment.

This is a developing story.

Oops, something went wrong

The cryptocurrency market extended Monday's losses on Tuesday morning as Bitcoin slipped below $104,000, dropping to levels not seen since late June.

At time of publication, the price of Bitcoin is $103,849, down 3.2% on the day, per data from CoinGecko.

The sudden drop stems from a combination of a deepening DeFi crisis and persistent macroeconomic fears that have triggered a broad risk-off move, analysts told Decrypt.

Bitcoin is now down 17.5% from its record high set in early October. The sell-off has spread across major altcoins, with Ethereum, XRP, BNB, and Solana posting 24-hour losses of between 5% and 9%.

Crypto liquidations over the past 24 hours have soared to $1.37 billion at the time of writing, per CoinGlass data.

Market sentiment has visibly soured, with the annualized futures premium on major exchanges dropping from roughly 7% to below 4% over the past week, according to Velo data, indicating investors are less willing to pay a premium for bullish bets.

Users reflected the bearish sentiment, as Greed dropped from 59% on November 1 to 51.9%, according to data from prediction market Myriad, launched by Decrypt's parent company Dastan. Myriad users also flipped bearish on the price of Bitcoin, placing a 71% chance of Bitcoin's next move taking it to $100,000 rather than $120,000—up from 44% on November 3.

The immediate catalyst is a crisis of confidence emanating from the decentralized finance sector, Derek Lim, Head of Research at market-making firm Caladan, told Decrypt. DeFi protocol Stream finance disclosed $93 million in fund asset losses Monday morning, he noted, while “total bad debt across lending markets is estimated at $284 million.”

Lim explained that the situation has triggered “contagion fears spreading through DeFi,” with multiple stablecoins and vaults facing exposure and forced redemptions.

The analyst pointed to a string of prior issues that eroded confidence, including the recent $128 million Balancer exploit and the lingering impact of October's historic liquidation event.

“Confidence was already shot before Stream imploded,” Lim said, adding that “any catalyst is going to amplify the risk-off” in a system that still contains very high amounts of leverage.

“The ongoing crypto market crash reflects a market-wide de-risking or risk-off sentiment as traders unwind leveraged positions amid macro uncertainty,” Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget, told Decrypt.

Bitcoin Price Outlook: What's Next After Red October?

Lim highlighted weak U.S. jobs data, a seemingly more hawkish Federal Reserve, and renewed uncertainty around the U.S. government shutdown, amplifying the aforementioned internal crypto issues. “Risk assets are getting dumped across traditional and crypto markets,” he said, with bond market volatility further unsettling investors.

Despite the short-term pain, Bitget's Lee sees a potential silver lining, suggesting that “this kind of flush-out often resets valuations, paving the way for stronger, more sustainable accumulation once liquidity and sentiment stabilize.”

The confluence of these factors suggests more volatility is likely.

The path to stabilization, according to the analysts' assessment, appears contingent on containing the DeFi contagion and achieving greater clarity on the macro front.","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) plummeted on Tuesday as investor concerns over the government shutdown and slowing economic growth led to a sell-off of the world's largest cryptocurrency.

The token declined more than 6% to hover near $100,000, its lowest level since June. Bitcoin is down roughly 20% from its all-time high north of $126,000 touched in early October.

Fundstrat head of digital assets Sean Farrell pointed out that ""whale selling,"" or investors with large holdings, had risen over the past few weeks, paving the way for weakness in the market.

""Whales — they continue to hammer price,"" Farrell said on Monday evening, noting billions in bitcoin have recently been moved from private wallets to exchanges, presumably to be sold.

Net sales from long-term holders have exceeded 1 million bitcoin since the end of June as wealth shifts to new owners, according to Compass Point analyst Ed Engel.

""While selling from Long-term Holders is a common feature in bull markets, retail spot buyers have been less engaged than prior cycles,"" Engel said in a note on Tuesday morning. He added that bitcoin ETF inflows have slowed in recent weeks.

""While we see support for BTC above $95k, we also don't see many near-term catalysts,"" he added. ""'Uptober' failed to materialize for the first time since 2018, which was followed by a 37% decline in November 2018.""

Data showing that the manufacturing sector contracted in October for an eighth straight month and a lack of breath in the overall equity market could also be spooking investors, along with Fed Chair Powell's noncommittal tone to a December rate cut following the central bank's policy meeting last week.

Strategists point to concerns about tightening market liquidity due to the government shutdown as spending from the Treasury General Account, essentially the government's checking account, remains stalled.

""The government shutdown's likely extension into December delays expected TGA drawdowns and stalls liquidity tailwinds that were expected to support risk assets into year-end,"" said Fundstrat's Farrell.

The strategist noted that an end to the shutdown would be a positive catalyst expected to drive crypto prices higher into year-end.

""I'm still optimistic for year-end,"" Farrell said. ""For now I think this is just some volatility that we're going to have to manage.""

Fundstrat predicts a price target range of $150,000-$200,000 for bitcoin by the end of the year.

Ethereum may be up 135,500% over the past decade, but its rate of growth appears to be slowing.

Ethereum is still best-in-class, but the competition is far greater than it was even five years ago.

If Ethereum can deliver growth rates of 20% annually, it could double in value by 2030.

10 stocks we like better than Ethereum ›

Since its launch back in July 2015, Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) is up a mind-blowing 135,500%. Suffice it to say, if you had invested in Ethereum a decade ago, you'd likely be set up for life right now.

But does Ethereum still have the ability to create life-changing wealth? Let's take a closer look at the numbers.

The two big years for Ethereum were 2020 and 2021. In 2020, Ethereum soared by 472%. And in 2021, Ethereum skyrocketed by 395%. But then came the crypto winter of 2022, when Ethereum lost 68% of its value and many patient long-term investors saw their crypto portfolios wiped out.

So, for the purposes of understanding what Ethereum's real upside potential is, it's best to focus on the period starting from 2023. That's when the next big crypto bull market cycle started, and that's also when Ethereum started to post blistering growth rates once again. In 2023, Ethereum rose by 93%. In 2024, Ethereum increased in value by 46%.

Which brings us to 2025. Year to date, Ethereum is up 9%. That's not exactly the type of growth that Ethereum has posted in the past.

The good news is that Ethereum is still the world's top Layer-1 blockchain platform. It has a dominant market share in nearly every key niche within the blockchain world, and many of the key innovations that have powered the growth of the crypto market -- such as smart contracts -- started with Ethereum. That gives it a clear first-mover advantage.

The bad news, however, is that Ethereum now has many more competitors than it did back in 2020-2021, when it was posting triple-digit percentage growth rates. For example, Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) launched in March 2020. Avalanche (CRYPTO: AVAX) launched in September 2020. Both now rank among the top 20 cryptocurrencies in the world by market cap.

And there are plenty more competitors throughout the list of the top 100 cryptocurrencies. These blockchains may be considerably smaller than Ethereum, but they are much more specialized. There's now a blockchain for artificial intelligence (AI) projects, for example. There's even a blockchain for meme coins.

So, it's easy to make the case that Ethereum's market share in every important blockchain niche is going to erode over time. There's simply too much competition. And, in some cases, these upstart blockchains have superior technology. Solana, for example, just showcased the ability to process 100,000 transactions per second. That's far faster than Ethereum, which still clocks in at 15 to 30 transactions per second.

Putting it all together, Ethereum is a solid, but not spectacular, crypto investment. It's easy to see how it could continue to post solid 20% growth rates during the next decade. That might help to build your wealth, but it's too much to say that it will set you up for life.

For the sake of argument, let's say that you invest $10,000 in Ethereum today. If Ethereum posts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20% during the next decade, that $10,000 will turn into about $60,000. That's a nice little profit, but likely not enough for you to quit your job and retire for life. At best, it might be enough money for you to take a break and travel the world for a year.

At one time, it was possible to find price predictions for Ethereum well in excess of $10,000. But top investment firms now appear to be pulling back. Last year, for example, VanEck revised down its 2030 price target from $22,000 to $7,300. Given a current price of $3,628, that implies that Ethereum may be able to double in value between now and 2030, but it certainly won't be tripling or quadrupling in value.

The bigger lesson in all this is that historical performance is no guarantee of future results. Just because Ethereum is up 135,500% during the past decade does not mean that it will be up 135,500% during the next decade. If you're thinking about investing in Ethereum, that's important to keep in mind.

Bitcoin has slipped deep into red territory, trading near $103,600 after losing over 10% in the past week. With traders bracing for a possible drop below the $100,000 mark, attention is turning to a different set of movers — altcoins that can benefit from a Bitcoin crash. 

While most tokens move in the same direction as BTC, a few are showing negative correlation or minimal, meaning they tend to rise when Bitcoin weakens. Here are three altcoins that could gain if the slide deepens this month.

Tezos is one of the first altcoins that can benefit from a Bitcoin crash. The smart contract platform, known for its self-upgrading blockchain and on-chain governance, has moved differently from most large-cap tokens this year. While many coins continue to mirror Bitcoin's direction, Tezos has shown signs of independence.

Over the past year, Tezos has held a –0.07 Pearson correlation with Bitcoin. This means it slightly moves in the opposite direction. The Pearson correlation coefficient measures how two assets move together, with +1 meaning they move the same way and –1 meaning they move opposite. With Bitcoin now hovering near $103,600 and facing pressure to stay above $100,000, Tezos's negative correlation suggests it could surprise traders if BTC breaks lower.

On the 4-hour chart, whale and smart money activity are turning positive. The Smart Money Index (SMI) — which tracks how informed or institutional traders position themselves — has started to rise, signaling renewed confidence. Similarly, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), a measure of large wallet inflows, remains below zero but is curling upward, hinting that accumulation may already be underway.

For price action, Tezos faces its first key resistance at $0.53. A move above $0.55 would confirm growing momentum, while a break past $0.58 could open the door to $0.60 and beyond. On the flip side, a drop below $0.51 would weaken the setup and invalidate the short-term bullish view.

If Bitcoin does slide below $100,000, Tezos's low correlation history and early accumulation trends make it one of the few altcoins likely to benefit.

Pi Network is another altcoin that can benefit from a Bitcoin crash, especially given its clear divergence from Bitcoin's trend. While Bitcoin has fallen nearly 10% this week, Pi has slipped by just 1%, indicating early signs of potential independence.

Over the past year, Pi Coin has shown a –0.30 Pearson correlation with Bitcoin, a much stronger negative correlation than Tezos. This suggests Pi Coin often reacts differently to Bitcoin's price swings, potentially rising when BTC weakens. If Bitcoin fails to hold above the crucial $100,000 level, PI's opposite movement pattern could help it attract rebound traders.

On the daily chart, PI shows a constructive technical setup. The Smart Money Index (SMI) remains above the signal line, meaning informed buyers haven't abandoned their rebound thesis yet. This suggests that despite broader bearish sentiment, smart money still expects a potential upside.

For price levels, Pi Coin must first reclaim $0.26 to confirm renewed strength. A breakout above $0.29 could then open the way for further gains. However, if Pi slips below $0.22, it risks testing $0.19, which would weaken the correlation-based bullish case.

Given its strong negative link to Bitcoin and early accumulation signs, Pi Coin remains one of the altcoins best positioned to benefit if Bitcoin crashes below $100,000.

Zcash rounds out the list of altcoins that can benefit from a Bitcoin crash, especially given how sharply its correlation with Bitcoin has shifted.

ZEC has long been one of the leaders in the privacy coin segment, often seen as a potential alternative to Bitcoin, per experts. Over the past year, its Pearson correlation coefficient with Bitcoin has averaged +0.28, meaning it has mostly moved independently. 

However, over the past month, that number has dropped to –0.55, showing that Zcash is now moving almost completely opposite to Bitcoin.

This negative shift suggests that if Bitcoin falls below $100,000, Zcash could be among the first to benefit.

On the price chart, ZEC has shown strong momentum. The token is up nearly 200% in the past month, while Bitcoin has dropped about 15.8%. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) remains well above zero at 0.18, signaling steady inflows from whales. CMF has been making higher highs since October 27, indicating that more large holders are adding positions.

If CMF crosses above 0.33, a level last seen on October 1, it would confirm aggressive whale accumulation. That would likely support another leg higher.

From a technical view, the Fibonacci extension pattern shows that Zcash's next key resistance sits near $594. A move above that would represent about a 23% gain from current levels and could keep the rally intact.

However, if ZEC falls below $341 or $245, it would weaken this bullish setup. That might also mean that Bitcoin may have avoided a deeper crash.

For now, Zcash remains one of the few altcoins with a clear negative correlation to Bitcoin. And it's supported by both strong inflows and a momentum-backed chart.

With the introduction of blockchain technology and the emergence of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), users can prove ownership of digital content by cryptographically tokenizing the content they create, and it becomes possible to trade digital content. As user-generated digital content is frequently traded online, many scholars have analyzed the factors of user transactions, but there is a limitation that they have not been able to analyze the direct relationship between the sentiments of users and price. Therefore, this study uses multi-layer perceptron so as to analyze the factors that affect the price of profile picture (PFP) NFTs by using not only collectable market indicators and technical indicators but also sentiment indicators. As a result, it was found that PFP NFTs are closely correlated with various indicators, and a model was developed to accurately predict the price fluctuations of PFP NFTs using these indicators. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed MLP model achieved prediction accuracies of 81.49% for BAYC and 93.39% for Cryptopunks. Furthermore, stock indices were found to exert a positive influence on NFT prices, whereas increases in cryptocurrency values, interest rates, and discussion volume acted as negative determinants. By contrast, the interaction of positive and objective sentiment contributed positively to price formation.

As all daily life shifted online due to COVID-19, anticipation for the future virtual world on social mediasignificantly boosted cryptocurrency prices1,2. Users' expectations of the metaverse's growth, coupled with corporate investments in the space, further accelerated this surge3,4,5. Yet, the metaverse remains merely an internet-based application, and digital content's inherent replicability limits its monetary value compared to physical goods4. The emergence of blockchain technology and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), however, enables users to tokenize and verify ownership of digital content, facilitating secure transactions6.

NFTs can prove ownership and be transferred to others6. Most transfers take place on the secondary market, where people pay for them in cryptocurrency7. Since COVID-19, NFTs have also become incredibly valuable, especially with celebrities owning them, which has attracted even more public attention7. For example, a celebrity's first tweet was traded for 2.9 million USD, and NBA basketball players purchased NFTs, which became a social sensation7.

Profile-picture (PFP) NFT is among the most commonly traded NFTs in the market. Both professionals and individual users can create PFP NFTs, claiming ownership and copyrights, and transferring these rights for financial gain8. Holders purchase PFP NFTs due to scarcity, with rarer NFTs commanding higher prices9,10. However, NFT scarcity extends beyond numeric rarity, encompassing psychological scarcity derived from how owners perceive others' views of their possessions11. Users primarily engage with NFTs for entertainment rather than Web 3.0 technology, but exaggerated hype around the meta-economy has left expectations unmet12. Scholars remain divided on the stability and price justification of NFTs due to speculative bubbles, driven largely by high consumer expectations of the metaverse (Scheiding, 2023).

Traditional financial assets are not the only factors influencing NFT prices and purchase intentions. NFT value consists of four dimensions: monetary value, functional value, emotional value and social value13. Social value, similar to art, reflects the buyer's perceived social status through NFT ownership14. This status is often expressed via social media, where traditional commodities endorsed by celebrities gain increased visibility, driving higher sales and prices14,15,16,17. Additionally, sentiment from social media discussions can predict stock price movements18,19. However, no studies have examined the impact of sentiment on social media on NFT prices.

Therefore, this study attempts to predict the price of PFP NFTs based on the sentiments of users in posts on social media. Specifically, to predict the daily price fluctuations of PFP NFTs, this study uses APIs to collect user comments from the official communities of each PFP NFT on the social media platform, Discord, and conducts sentiment analysis on the collected comments from Discord. To analyze the impact of cryptocurrency prices and stock market movements on PFP NFTs, the daily prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum were collected from EtherScan, and the daily data of the NASDAQ Composite Index (IXIC) was collected from Investing.com. In addition, to understand whether the movement of cash is related to the fluctuations in the PFP NFT market, yields on U.S. Treasuries, including short-term and long-term Treasury bonds were collected from the Federal Reserve Board (FRB). To predict the price of PFP NFTs, daily transaction data from BAYC and Cryptopunks was collected from April 1, 2022 to April 1, 2024 using the OpenSea for price data. This study utilizes a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), a method of deep learning, to train the impact of each feature on PFP NFTs and develop a model that uses the features to predict the price of PFP NFTs. The predictive model is then interpreted using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to determine which features influenced the price.

The rapid expansion of the metaverse and NFTs has raised questions about the sustainability and drivers of digital asset prices, particularly given the replicability of digital content and the speculative nature of NFT markets. While prior studies have mainly examined market and technical indicators, the direct influence of user sentiment on NFT pricing has remained underexplored. To address this gap, this study develops a MLP model that integrates market, technical, and sentiment indicators collected from social media platforms to predict the prices of PFP NFTs. The model not only demonstrates strong predictive accuracy but also leverages XAI techniques to reveal the relative contribution of diverse features, including financial assets, trading volume, and user sentiment. By doing so, this study provides an integrated framework for NFT price prediction and offers new insights into the economic, behavioral, and methodological implications of digital asset valuation.

The emergence of Web 3.0 made individuals be able to read and write about digital content, as well as own and trade digital content using blockchain technology20,21. With the transition to Web 3.0, users can tokenize user generated contents (UGCs) to prove their ownership, and these tokenized digital contents are called NFTs. With the advent of NFTs, users can cryptographically tokenize their own content to prove ownership and trade NFTs6. NFTs are a product of the evolution of the Web and have significantly changed user behavior in the digital environment. Holders of NFTs have built online communities on social media, and social media users have observed a significant amount of discussion about NFTs in the digital environment13,22.

Yilmaz et al.13 divides NFTs into four motivational value-driving dimensions, monetary, functional, emotional and social. Both groups of NFT holders and non- holders were most influenced by the emotional dimension during the liking phase before purchase, while both groups were most influenced by the monetary dimension during the purchase and holding phase13. Furthermore, consumers' attitudes towards NFTs are influenced by perceived usefulness, reliability and profit expectancy, while technology expectations influence purchase intention23. Consumers' trust in the NFT market and their trust in cryptocurrencies can facilitate NFT purchases24.

On the other hand, Griffiths et al.25 argue that NFT buyers are not simply buying to gain monetary benefits, but for the same intrinsic and extrinsic motivations as buying luxury goods, that is, they buy NFTs because they care about their confidence in their aesthetic sense and their social status in the view of others25. Furthermore, prior research suggests that PFP NFTs function similarly to artworks7. People believe that buying and displaying artwork is a social status statement26, meaning that by purchasing and displaying it, they are demonstrating that they care about what others think of them and are confident in their aesthetic sense26.

Social media increases consumers' purchase intentions for NFTs. Social media has provided NFT holders with a space to express their identity 14, and online communities allow holders to showcase their identity by setting PFP NFTs as their profile picture13. NFT creators and holders have established discord channels to form online communities, where creators and holders can have instant conversations in real time on a daily basis, and holder-to-holder discussions about NFTs are common27. It has also been found that event announcements on social media affect the purchase intentions and prices of NFTs (Luo et al., 2023). It has also been shown that social media comments made by certain individuals can influence the sales volume of NFTs28.

The price of cryptocurrencies and virtual assets in particular are highly influenced by the sentiment of discussions on social media29,30. Previous studies predicted the price of cryptocurrency with the sentiment of social media discussion29,30,31. Yet, there has been no research on price prediction using social media sentiment analysis for PFP NFTs. A comprehensive understanding of the price of NFTs or the price trends of NFTs is essential to accurately determine and predict user behavior in the digital environment.

Price prediction is not limited to stocks; it can also be done for cryptocurrencies. According to32 and Yasir et al.33, future cryptocurrency prices can be predicted using historical trading volume, historical price volatility, and sentiment on social media. However, most of the previous studies have predicted the price of fungible tokens (FTs) rather than NFTs32,33. The fundamental difference between FTs and NFTs is that FTs are literally fungible and divisible, and FTs can be utilized to purchase NFTs34,35. FTs also differ from NFTs in that NFTs are not divisible and each NFT has a different price34,35. Therefore, there are limitations to applying existing studies analyzing FTs to NFT price prediction.

Previous studies have utilized various algorithmic methods to predict the price of NFTs. Seyhan and Sefer36 utilized deep learning to predict the price at which NFTs will be traded on the secondary market based on the price of the first release directly from the creator of the NFT. However, this method relies too heavily on the price of the initial release and is not able to predict the various variables that may occur during subsequent trading on the secondary market. Other prior studies have predicted the price of NFTs based on factors intrinsic to the NFT, such as the rarity of the trait9,37. These studies measured the rarity of each NFT and concluded that the rarer the trait, the more expensive it is9,37. Some studies have suggested that the price of NFTs fluctuates with the price of FTs38,39, but none have predicted prices based on community sentiment.

Predicting the price of NFTs allows investors and traders to make better decisions40. Not only for investment purposes, NFT price prediction technology promotes the advancement of blockchain and digital asset-related technologies, which means it can lead to new technological innovations and further developments in various applications7. Furthermore, price predictions for NFTs can help consumers and artists better understand the market and ensure fair transactions. For example, artists can ensure that their work is being appropriately valued, and consumers can be protected from investing in overvalued artwork40.

Previous studies have used different methodologies to predict the price of assets for different purposes. For example, price prediction using various models for stocks41, cryptocurrencies31, NFTs36, and so on are listed in Table 1. Jing et al.41 analyzed the sentiment of investors' discussions about the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) on social media using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and used the sentiment analysis data to predict the price of the stock using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) method. Jung et al.31 used several models to predict the price of Bitcoin based on the sentiment of Bitcoin discussions in the news and social media, and the best performance was achieved by XGBoost. In comparison, Pant et al.42 conducted community emotion analysis and price prediction using CNN models of deep learning. Seyhan and Sefer36 used the primary sale price of each NFT to predict the secondary trading price, and Ghosh et al.38 used an ensemble algorithm to predict the price of NFT coins.

Previous studies have utilized various methods to predict the price of NFTs, but they are limited in that they do not comprehensively examine value dimensions such as monetary, functional, emotional and social as proposed by Yilmaz et al.13. Therefore, this study aims to predict the price of PFP NFTs by utilizing social media sentiment scores and various economic indicators. Based on the analysis of existing studies, the research questions of this study are as follows.

RQ1: Will the sentiment of PFP NFT discussions on social media affect the price of PFP NFTs?

RQ2: Which of the following metrics had the most influence on the price prediction of PFP NFTs: stock price, cash flow, FT price, PFP NFT price volatility, and discussion sentiment on social media?

To conduct sentiment analysis of online communities, this study used Discord API to collect all postrecords of users from April 1 in 2022 to April 1 in 2024 in the official online communities of each PFP NFT. The API allows us to collect six pieces of information per post including “AuthorID”, “Author”, “Date”, “Content”, “Attachments”, and “Reactions,” and a total of 143,119 posts were collected for Cryptopunks and 3,234,166 posts were collected for BAYC. To activate the API it is necessary to apply for the issuance of an API Key by going to the Discord developer website, which will require a Discord account and filling in the details of the purpose for which the API is to be used.

To predict the price of PFP NFTs using other financial assets, this study collected data on Bitcoin, Ethereum, IXIC, and US Treasury long and short maturity yields from April 1 in 2022 to April 1 in 2024. The average daily price of Bitcoin was collected from Investing.com and the average daily price of Ethereum was collected from EtherScan. The daily average index value of the IXIC was collected from investing.com and the Selected Interest Rates (Daily)—H.15 file, which contains yield data for US Treasuries from 1 month to 30 years, was utilized from the FRB.

To predict the price of PFP NFTs, the data of actual transactions of BAYC and Cryptopunks from April 1 in 2022 to April 1 in 2024 was collected using the OpenSea API. The OpenSea API allows users to track transactions using the “Get Events” command, and the data utilized in this study are actual sales of PFP NFTs with “event_type” categorized as “sale”. To collect these data, we first obtained an API key from OpenSea. Figure 1 presents the prices of BAYC and Cryptopunks from April 2022 to April 2024. The y-axis represents the price, with the unit in USD, while the x-axis indicates the date. It can be observed that the prices fluctuate on a daily basis and that the magnitude of these fluctuations is substantial.

Before performing sentiment analysis on user posts collected from online communities, the data needs to be preprocessed. Sometimes users post a photo or a uniform resource locator (URL) link with their post, or sometimes they post only a photo or a link without a text. So that non-textual content, emoji, and special characters (e.g., “@”, “#”, “$”, “%”, “^”, “&”, “*”) are removed. The preprocessed posts are 2,838,641 in BAYC and 64,622 in Cryptopunks.

After preprocessing the data, the sentiment analysis is performed using the TextBlob package. TextBlob is a package dedicated to natural language processing and has strong performance for text sentiment analysis. It measures polarity, which is a score of positive and negative for a sentence, and is divided into negative for sentences closer to -1 and positive for sentences closer to 1. It also measures subjectivity, which indicates whether the speaker of a sentence is speaking objectively in line with the factual information or expressing subjective information that does not match the factual information, and the range of subjectivity is [0,1], and the closer to 1, the more subjective the content. The method of calculating polarity and subjectivity can be shown as the following Eqs. (1) and (2).

Equation (1) tokenizes each word in a sentence, calculates a polarity score for each word, sums the scores of all words, divides by the number of words in the sentence, and calculates the polarity of the sentence.

Equation (2) tokenizes each word in a sentence, calculates a subjectivity score for each word, sums the scores of all words, divides by the number of words in the sentence, and calculates the subjectivity of the sentence.

After the sentiment analysis is completed for each post, the daily sentiment score is calculated as the average of the polarity and subjectivity intensity of all posts within a day, respectively, and two daily sentiment average scores called “Polarity_Avg” and “Subjectivity_Avg” are used to train the model.

This study uses the following technical indicators to train the model for price prediction: Simple Moving Average (SMA), Standard Deviation (STD) and Bollinger Bands. This study calculates the SMA, STD and Bollinger Bands for different time windows (5, 10, and 20 days) on the PFP NFTs' prices dataset.

The SMA is a widely used indicator in time series analysis and financial markets. It represents the unweighted mean of the previous \(n\) data points. This can be mathematically represented as Eq. (3).

where, \({SMA}_{n}\left(t\right)\) is the SMA at time \(t\) over a window of \(n\) periods, \({P}_{t-i}\) is the price at time \(t-i\).

The STD is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values. In the context of financial time series, it quantifies the volatility of the asset. The STD can be mathematically represented as Eq. (4).

Bollinger Bands are a type of statistical chart characterizing the prices and volatility over time, using a formulaic method. They consist of three lines: middle band, upper band and lower band. The middle band is the SMA of price, the upper band and lower band are each representing the upper and lower limit of the price. The Equation for the upper and lower Bollinger Bands can be represented as shown as follows:

This study investigates a neural network model, specifically using MLP, applied to predict PFP NFTs' prices. The MLP is a feedforward neural network that includes one or more hidden layers, allowing it to learn complex non-linear relationships between input and output data 43. The model discussed here comprises three fully connected layers and two dropout layers.

The input layer consists of normalized data, where the data is normalized between 0 and 1 using MinMaxScaler. This speeds up the convergence during the training process and prevents the value of a particular feature from becoming too large or too small, enabling stable training. The “input_dim” parameter defines the number of features in the input data, which corresponds to the number of features after polynomial features transformation.

The first hidden layer consists of 128 neurons and uses the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function. The ReLU function is a non-linear activation function that output zero for negative input values and the input value itself for positive input values. This can be mathematically represented as Eq. (7).

ReLU introduces non-linearity into the model and helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem during training, allowing the model to learn complex patterns 44. The second hidden layer is configured with 64 neurons and the ReLU activation function.

Dropout layers are used to prevent overfitting by randomly disabling neurons during each training iteration 45. In this model, a dropout rate of 0.3 is employed, meaning 30% of the neurons in each dropout layer are randomly deactivated during training. This technique ensures that the model does not overly rely on specific neurons and can generalize better. The dropout layers are strategically placed between the hidden layers.

The output layer consists of a single neuron without an activation function, suitable for regression tasks where continuous output values are predicted. The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and the mean squared error (MSE) loss function. Adam optimizer adapts the learning rate dynamically, providing fast and stable training 46. Adam optimizer performs moment calculation, adaptive scaling, bias correction, and parameter updates in stages such as the following Eqs. (8), (9), (10), (11) and (12) 46

where \({m}_{t}\) is the momentum at time step \(t\), \({g}_{t}\) is the gradient at time step \(t\), and \({\beta }_{1}\) is the momentum coefficient.

where \({v}_{t}\) is the adaptive scaling value at time step \(t\), and \({\beta }_{2}\) is the scaling coefficient.

Equation (10) functions to compute bias-corrected first moment estimate, and (11) functions to compute bias-corrected second raw moment estimate.

where, \({\theta }_{t+1}\) is the updated parameter, \(\eta\) is the learning rate, and \(\epsilon\) is a small constant to prevent division by zero.

The MSE loss function minimizes the average squared differences between the predicted and actual values, which can be represented as shown in Eq. (13)

where \({y}_{i}\) are the actual values and \(\widehat{{y}_{i}}\) are the predicted values.

Model training uses the ‘EarlyStopping' callback to prevent overfitting. If the validation loss (‘val_loss') does not improve in 1000 epochs, training is stopped and the model is restored with the best performing weights. The training process runs for up to 10,000 epochs, with a batch size of 32.

After training, the prediction performance on test data is evaluated through metrics such as MSE, Root MSE (RMSE), R2, Theil's U Index (U), Directional Accuracy (DA), and Index of Agreement (IA). These metrics can be used to verify and improve performance to ensure that complex patterns in price are effectively learned and predicted.

RMSE is the square root of the MSE. It is calculated as follows:

The RMSE provides the error measurement in the same units as the target variable, making it more interpretable than MSE.

R2 Score, or the coefficient of determination, quantifies how well the predicted values approximate the observed values. It is given by:

where \(\overline{y}\) is the mean of the observed values, an \({R}^{2}\) value closer to 1 indicates a better fit.

IA measures the degree to which the predicted values match the observed values. It is calculated as:

The IA ranges from 0 to 1, where a value closer to 1 indicates a better agreement between observed and predicted values.

U is used to evaluate the accuracy of predictions by comparing the predicted values to the observed values. A lower U indicates better predictive accuracy. It is defined as:

DA measures the proportion of correctly predicted directions of change between the observed and predicted values. It is given by:

where \(1\) is the indicator function that equals 1 when the condition is true and 0 otherwise. DA ranges from 0 to 1, with a higher value indicating better directional prediction.

Prior to implementing the full MLP, we assessed predictive performance with simpler models. Specifically, we applied XGBoost and logistic regression to price prediction, but both models performed poorly. The detailed results for these models are presented in Table 2. As the table shows, incorporating multiple indicators into these simpler models is insufficient for accurately predicting price fluctuations, indicating the necessity of employing more complex deep-learning approaches.

In this study, 70% of the data was split to train the model and remained 30% of the data was for prediction. The model performance of the prediction is shown in Table 3. Figure 2 shows the loss trained by using data from Cryptopunks into the model. At about the 5000th epoch, the loss stopped decreasing and an early stopping cut-off was applied. Figure 3 depicts the loss resulting from feeding BAYC data into the model. The loss ceased decreasing around the 3400th epoch, triggering an early stopping cut-off.

As shown in Table 3, Cryptopunks analysis results show that the model explains and predicts price volatility relatively well. The R2 Score is 0.7473, which can explain approximately 74.73% of the variability in the data. The Index of Agreement is high at 0.9339, indicating that the predictions and actual values ​​match well, and Theil's U Index is low at 0.1983, meaning that the error in the predicted values ​​is small. Directional Accuracy is 0.8786, indicating that the direction of price rise and fall can be predicted with approximately 87.86% accuracy.

The results of the BAYC analysis show that it has lower predictive performance than Cryptopunks. The R2 Score is 0.2539, and it suggests that either BAYC's price volatility is more erratic, or the model does not capture that volatility as well as Cryptopunks' price prediction. The Index of Agreement is 0.8149, indicating that the predicted and actual values are relatively consistent, but the Theil's U Index is high at 0.6670, indicating a large error in the predicted value. In addition, the Directional Accuracy is 0.8380.

In the analysis results of Cryptopunks and BAYC, the main reasons for the difference in model performance can be seen as differences in the features of the data and the suitability of the model. In the case of Cryptopunks, the model was able to explain and predict price volatility relatively well, while in the case of BAYC, performance was likely relatively low due to data irregularity or model limitations. As shown earlier in Fig. 1, the price fluctuations of BAYC were greater than those of Cryptopunks, and the trading volume and the number of social media posts related to BAYC were significantly higher, leading to data imbalance and irregularity. Because this study focused on predicting the average price, there was a substantial deviation from the actual prices, which emerged as a limitation of the model.

In this study, deep learning was used to predict the price of PFP NFTs and the results were analyzed using eXplainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods to interpret the model and how each feature affected the price. XAI is useful for understanding the process that the model went through to get the result and how each feature contributed to the model47. Therefore, this study utilizes shapley additive explanation (SHAP)48 to interpret the results by measuring the SHAP value of each feature's contribution to the prediction model.

Figure 4 displays the most significant features for predicting Cryptopunks, listed in descending order of importance. Figure 5 shows a visualization of the impact of each feature on the model's output, with each feature positively and negatively labeled. In Fig. 5, higher values (red) tend to increase the predicted price, while lower values (blue) show a negative impact.

Top 10 most important features in Cryptopunks' price prediction.

Feature contribution explanation for Cryptopunks' price prediction.

Analyzing the features that contributed to Cryptopunks' price prediction, in order of importance, the 10-day moving average of Cryptopunks' price was the most influential, and as the 10-day moving average increased, the price of Cryptopunks increased. The “Discussion_Count” attribute shows that as the amount of discussions per day in Cryptopunks' online community increases, the price is negatively affected, but the interaction term with “SMA_5” has a positive effect on the price. The interaction term between “Discussion_Count” and “US6MT” means that the interaction term between the amount of discussion in the online community and the 6-month US Treasury yield had a positive impact on the price. “US6MT” denotes the U.S. 6-Month Treasury yield, with MT standing for “Month Treasury yield”. The standalone effect of “Discussion_Count” is negative, because excessive discussion can provoke FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) and depress prices. By contrast, when “Discussion_Count” interacts with “SMA_5”, which signals an upward market trend, or with “US6MT”, which reflects an accommodative short-term interest-rate environment, high discussion volume acts as a cue for trend confirmation or heightened risk appetite, thereby exerting a positive impact on price.

On the other hand, the features that influenced BAYC's price were completely different from Cryptopunks. Figure 6 shows the top features that contributed to the model predicting the price of BAYC. In particular, the price of BAYC was strongly influenced by the interaction term between Bitcoin's price and US long-term bond yields.

Top 10 most important features in BAYC's price prediction.

As shown in Fig. 7, the interaction term between US long-term bond yields and the price of Bitcoin had a negative impact on the price of BAYC. In addition, the interaction term between US short-term Treasury yields and the 10-day lower band also had a negative impact on the price of BAYC. On the other hand, the Nasdaq Composite Index had a positive impact on the price of BAYC. However, the interaction term between the subjective sentiment score and the 10-year US Treasury yield is negatively related to the price of BAYC, suggesting that the sentiment of social media users' comments about the PFP NFT in the online community and the yield of long-term Treasuries collectively influence the price. The variable name for the subjective sentiment score is “Subjectivity_Avg,” and the 10-year US Treasury yield is labeled as “US10YT”.

Feature contribution explanation for BAYC's price prediction.

In this study, PFP NFT prices were predicted using various indicators, but this study used sentiment analysis of online communities, which was not included in previous studies to predict the price of PFP NFTs. In addition, sentiment was not just divided into positive and negative, but subjective sentiment was analyzed to evaluate the impact of subjective or objective remarks on the price. Also, by predicting the price not only by sentiment alone, but by predicting the sentiment score and the interaction term with other features, the price can be predicted more accurately through complex and diverse relationships with other features.

Figure 8 shows the contribution of polarity to Cryptopunks' price prediction in terms of SHAP value. From this figure, it can be seen that polarity alone has a negative impact on price, but the interaction term with other attributes may have the opposite effect.

Polarity contribution explanation for Cryptopunks' price prediction.

This study used the same methodology to predict the price of these PFP NFTs, but found that the results for BAYC were different from those of Cryptopunks. As shown in Fig. 9, the polarity of BAYC was the opposite of that of Cryptopunks, which means that polarity had a positive effect on the price of BAYC, and most of the interaction terms with other features had a positive effect on the price.

Polarity contribution explanation for BAYC's price prediction.

This study utilized the degree of subjective attitude and polarity of sentiment to predict the price of PFP NFTs. Figure 10 shows the relationship between the price of Cryptopunks and sentiment scores, and Fig. 11 shows the relationship between the price of BAYC and sentiment scores. Figure 10 is a three-dimensional scatterplot of the scores that influenced the price increase and decrease of Cryptopunks, and Fig. 11 is a three-dimensional scatterplot of the scores that influenced the price increase and decrease of BAYC. By contrasting the two figures, it is able to see that positive emotional and objective attitudes influenced the price increase, while relatively subjective attitudes influenced the price decrease.

Overall, the sentiment scores exerted a comparatively smaller influence on price than the technical and interest-rate indicators, yet their impact was not negligible. In particular, Figs. 5 and 7 show that the interaction effects between sentiment scores and technical indicators made a substantial contribution to price prediction. The table containing the specific SHAP values for BAYC is presented as Table 4, while the detailed SHAP values for Cryptopunks are summarized in Table 5.

The cross-correlation analysis revealed that both the BAYC and Cryptopunks collections exhibit numerous statistically significant relationships between sentiment indicators and NFT prices. For BAYC, Polarity_Avg showed significant correlations at both negative and positive lags, with the strongest effect observed at lag -8 (Corr: -0.193, p < 0.001), suggesting that changes in price tend to precede shifts in sentiment polarity by about eight days. Other significant values for Polarity_Avg and Subjectivity_Avg were observed at lags -24 and -23, although the correlation coefficients were relatively low. Subjectivity_Avg demonstrated significant positive and negative associations at various lags, most notably a positive correlation at lag -8 (Corr: 0.163, p < 0.001) and a negative correlation at lag 25 (Corr: -0.149, p < 0.001). These results indicate that price and sentiment interact in a complex manner across different time horizons. Notably, for BAYC, the results for Polarity_Avg and Subjectivity_Avg correspond to Fig. 12(a) and Fig. 12(b), respectively.

Cross-correlation test.

In the case of Cryptopunks, there were significant positive correlations between Polarity_Avg and price across a variety of lag intervals, with the most pronounced association at lag -22 (Corr: 0.149, p < 0.001), implying that a rise in price may forecast an increase in sentiment polarity after a considerable period. Additional significant correlations were observed for Polarity_Avg at both negative and positive lags, underscoring the highly dynamic nature of sentiment-price interactions in the NFT market. For Subjectivity_Avg, significant negative correlations were found at lags 13 and 26, though the magnitude of these associations was modest. Overall, these findings demonstrate that sentiment indicators and NFT prices are interrelated in both the short and long term, and that the direction and strength of these associations can vary substantially depending on the lag considered. For Cryptopunks, the results for Polarity_Avg and Subjectivity_Avg correspond to Fig. 12(c) and Fig. 12(d), respectively.

The purpose of this study is to predict the price of PFP NFTs by utilizing various metrics and reveal how each feature affects the price of PFP NFTs. In particular, this study is unique in that it analyzes the sentiment of social media users and shows that sentiment scores affect the price of PFP NFTs. The study also utilized various economic and technical indicators to predict the price of PFP NFTs. In addition, this study uses deep learning to develop a model to predict the price of PFP NFTs, which is more accurate than existing price prediction studies using social media, and uses XAI to analyze the model and results on how each characteristic affects the price. Based on these results, this chapter will discuss the implications of this study and how it differs from existing studies.

First, this study suggests that the price of PFP NFTs is influenced by a variety of technical indicators. The most influential feature in Cryptopunks price prediction was the moving average of the price over a five-day period. This result is similar to that of Ghosh et al.38, however, the latter study predicted the price of a payment token utilized in a metaverse game rather than a PFP NFT, and did not utilize social media sentiment scores38. Nevertheless, the fact that the moving average of the price over a five-day period was highly influential in predicting the price of PFP NFTs using technical indicators lends credence to the use of technical indicators to predict the price of PFP NFTs, and demonstrates that there is definitely an intrinsic price driver for PFP NFTs.

Second, PFP NFTs interact closely with other financial instruments, suggesting that they can be used to predict prices. In particular, the models that predicted the price of BAYC and Cryptopunks together show that they are highly influenced by the price of cryptocurrencies and US Treasury yields. This suggests that the price of PFP NFTs is also affected by the price waves of other financial instruments due to the liquidity of cash, suggesting that the price of PFP NFTs is subject to fluctuations due to exogenous factors.

A third implication is that the performance of our prediction model is more accurate than previous studies that utilize social media sentiment analysis to predict price movements of commodities. Previous studies have analyzed user sentiment on social media to predict future price trends of stocks19 or cryptocurrencies42, but the accuracy is significantly lower than the model proposed in this study. In particular, when IA and DA are examined together, it is found that the accuracy is not only higher than previous studies predicting the price of NFTs, but also higher than previous studies on sentiment analysis and previous studies predicting the price of traditional assets. Therefore, the results of this study have methodological implications.

Fourth, this study reveals how two dimensions of sentiment affect the price of PFP NFTs. In existing studies, sentiment is often studied using a binary categorization, such as positive and negative42. However, it is difficult to explain many complex human emotions using only positive and negative. A comprehensive look at subjective or objective attitudes, both positive and negative, can help to more accurately analyze consumers' sentiments and thus analyze their consumption characteristics49. The results of this study confirm that the higher the intensity of subjective attitude, the more negative the impact of price, while positive emotions have a positive impact on price. Therefore, the results of this study not only methodologically improve the accuracy of existing studies, but also demonstrate the existence of the phenomenon that emotional and social values affect the purchase intention of PFP NFTs proposed by Yilmaz et al.13 by predicting the price of PFP NFTs using sentiment analysis.

This study analyzes PFP NFTs and social media content, and demonstrates that there is a close relationship between UGCs and suggests that social media affects PFP NFTs' prices. In addition, although PFP NFTs are UGCs, they also have a close relationship with existing financial instruments and various economic indicators, which means that PFP NFTs are affected by large-scale economic trends, once again showing that the digital environment is closely intertwined with the real world. Although many scholars criticize the metaverse and NFTs, this phenomenon is a stage where the complete infrastructure has not yet been built due to current technological limitations, and the feasibility of the metaverse is high as technology improves over time. Therefore, this study analyzes the characteristics of consumers in the digital environment and predicts the price of content, so that it is possible to learn about consumer characteristics and content prices in the future metaverse in advance.

This study analyzed the price of PFP NFTs through market indicators, technical indicators, and sentiment indicators using deep learning to understand the consumption characteristics of digital environment users. In particular, this study designed a model using the MLP method to predict the prices of BAYC and Cryptopunks with 81.49% and 93.39%, respectively. In addition, this study found that the model's most contributing indicator was the interaction with other financial assets, and that the flow of cash plays a large role in determining the price of NFTs. When the index of stocks increased, the price of NFTs increased, while the rise of cryptocurrencies and the rise of interest rates were factors that decreased the price of NFTs. In terms of discussion volume alone, this study found that an increase in volume was a negative factor for the price of NFTs, but the interaction of positive and objective sentiment was a positive factor for the price of NFTs. Therefore, this study utilizes multiple indicators to predict the price of NFTs and draws economic implications, implications for user characteristics, and methodological implications.

However, this study has the following limitations. First of all, this study is limited to predicting the average price and cannot accurately predict the specific price. However, since IA and DA are relatively outstanding, it is possible to make predictions about the direction of prices. In future research, the error will be reduced by comprehensively analyzing all listed items and all items that have actually been traded, rather than the average price, for more accurate price prediction. Secondly, this study has a limitation in that it did not employ the latest large language models (LLMs). In particular, future research could leverage models specialized in financial domains, such as FinBERT, which demonstrate strong performance in contextual understanding, to achieve more accurate sentiment classification and uncover associations with prices. Nevertheless, this study offers valuable insights by identifying that the subjectivity scores provided by TextBlob are associated with NFT prices.

In summary, this study analyzed the sentiment scores of user comments collected from the official Discord channels of BAYC and Cryptopunks, examined the relationship between these sentiment scores and price, and attempted to predict price using the sentiment data. However, the limitations of this study are not only that it focused exclusively on BAYC and Cryptopunks, but also that the predictive model's performance was uneven across the two collections. The prediction models showed different levels of accuracy and consistency for BAYC and Cryptopunks, indicating that the relationship between price fluctuations and sentiment may vary considerably by collection. These findings suggest that each PFP NFT possesses unique characteristics shaped by various factors such as market, technical, and sentiment indicators. Future research should expand the analysis to include a wider range of PFP NFTs and further refine the predictive models, in order to draw more generalizable insights into market behavior that also account for potential imbalances in model performance.

On October 31, 2025, the UK Information Commissioner's Office (“ICO”) launched a public consultation on its draft Data Protection Enforcement Procedural Guidance (the “Guidance”).  The draft Guidance sets out the ICO's updated procedures for investigations and enforcement under the UK General Data Protection Regulation (“UK GDPR”) and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 (“DPA 2018”).  Amongst other things, it reflects changes introduced by the UK Data (Use and Access) Act 2025, such as the expansion of the ICO's investigatory powers.

Once finalized, and alongside the ICO's existing Data Protection Fining Guidance, the Guidance will constitute updated statutory guidance regarding regulatory action that the ICO is required to publish under section 160(1) of the DPA 2018. It will replace earlier guidance regarding information notices, assessment notices, enforcement notices, penalty notices, and privileged communications set out in the 2018 Regulatory Action Policy.

The draft Guidance offers a comprehensive roadmap of the ICO's approach to investigations and enforcement, including:

The ICO invites feedback on the draft Guidance through a 12-week public consultation, open until January 23, 2026 (view the consultation).

He also was afraid that terrorists could hack his heart.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

This story is a collaboration with Biography.com

For nearly as long as Dick Cheney held public office, the scrutiny of his legislative actions was nearly matched by that of his cardiac health. The former Vice President, who died November 3 at the age of 84, had his first heart attack in 1978, the same year he was first elected to the House of Representatives.

When it happened, Cheney, then 37, wasn't even that surprised; as he would later chronicle in his 2011 memoir In My Time, Cheney had a family history of heart issues.  Indeed, the extent of Cheney's father's cardiac concerns wasn't known until the elder Cheney underwent a six-way heart bypass operation in 1988, during which it was discovered that he had already had two previous heart attacks. (Knowledge of heart health was limited in the elder Cheney's time. The first heart attack in a living patient had been diagnosed just three years prior to his birth).

Dick Cheney suffered a second and third heart attack in the 1980s, but it was his fourth, in November of 2000, that prompted the most serious concern and intervention. After all, his heart health was now a matter of national security. Cheney was soon to be sworn in as Vice President of the United States—one proverbial heartbeat away from the presidency.

As the New York Times once noted, “Mr. Cheney's medical history could almost be the history of medical progress against heart disease.” And given the time during which he was most prominently in the public eye—his 2001-2009 tenure as Vice President amidst the post-9/11 anti-terrorism hysteria—it is also a history of how emerging technologies of the time could represent both new hope and new threats.

In 2001, Vice President Cheney's continued cardiac concerns prompted a procedure to implant an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)—a device differing from a typical pacemaker insofar as it is also capable of delivering shocks “intended to restore a normal heart rate and rhythm when the heart falls too far out of beat for regular artificial pacemaker pulses,” according to Avive, an AED company.

For the nearly 800,000 Americans who have an ICD implanted, the device represents a powerful tool to fight back against heart health issues, which are collectively still the number one killer in the United States. But as technology progressed alongside the Bush administration's Global War on Terror, and American intelligence began to conceive of new ways the country could be attacked, Cheney's team felt that his life-saving device could pose a threat.

As reported by ABC News in 2013, Cheney's implanted device required maintenance back in 2007 (his June physical of that year had noted that the device needed a battery replacement). While the procedure was publicly reported, it was not known to most at the time that a special precaution was taken for Cheney's ICD, one that isn't typically undertaken for the average patient: his doctors disabled the device's wireless capabilities.

Their reasoning? To prevent a terrorist from hacking into the device and hijacking the Vice President's heart.

Now, if that sounds more like something out of an over-the-top cable TV thriller series than real-life politics, the truth is, it's both. 

This very real concern over the cyber-vulnerabilities of the vice president's ventricles later became a storyline in the second season of the Emmy-winning Showtime series, Homeland. In the episode “Broken Hearts,” the show's chief antagonist, a terrorist named Abu Nazir, obtains the serial number for the show's fictional Vice President Walden's pacemaker. This allows him to wirelessly manipulate the device, which he uses to cause the VP to have a heart attack.

“I found [the depiction] credible,” Cheney told ABC News in 2013, “[...] because I knew from the experience that we had assessing the need for my own device that it was an accurate portrayal of what was possible.” It should be noted that, back when the episode aired, the FDA issued a statement assuring Americans that attacks via pacemaker hacking were not a cause for concern for the average citizen, and they were “not aware of any patient injuries or deaths associated with these incidents.”

But a TV plot line wasn't the only impact Dick Cheney's heart health had on the American popular consciousness. After leaving office, Cheney underwent a procedure that prompted the headline “Does Dick Cheney Have a Pulse?” and in doing so, the then-69-year-old conservative politician may have unintentionally became a cardiac health influencer.

Though he would ultimately have a heart transplant in 2012, in the summer of 2010, the former Vice President was outfitted with a device that would act as a sort of stop-gap before the intense procedure could be undertaken (waitlists for heart transplants can stretch for years, even for former Vice Presidents). That device was an LVAD, or left ventricular assist device—a device which is “implanted next to the heart to help its main pumping chamber, the left ventricle, pump blood through the body.”

Because these devices facilitate the continuous flow of blood, which ABC News likens to “water circulating in a fish tank rather than pumping like a heart,” it can sometimes create the sensation of no longer having a pulse while a patient is still very much alive. Experts at the time noted that this phenomenon is commonly exhibited in patients who rely on the LVAT for 100 percent of their circulation, but Cheney's device was “likely doing 30 to 60 percent of the heart's work,” so a faint pulse was likely still present.

The headlines around Cheney's device and the pulse it produced (or, rather, the possible lack thereof) provided more than just fodder for late night comedians. A 2014 study showed that reports of Cheney's LVAD actually increased public awareness of the device's existence, prompting not just search engine inquiries, but a slew of social media explainers discussing the device and its benefits.

In effect, Dick Cheney's cardiac health saga, for all its national security concerns, may have raised public awareness about the dangers of heart disease and prompted others to take more pro-active measures for their own heart health.

Adding even a modest number of steps to your daily routine may help delay the advancement of Alzheimer's disease, especially among those most vulnerable to it, according to new research. In a study published in Nature Medicine, scientists from Mass General Brigham found that greater physical activity was linked to slower cognitive decline in older adults who had higher levels of amyloid-beta, a protein strongly tied to Alzheimer's.

On average, people who walked between 3,000 and 5,000 steps a day experienced about three years of delay in cognitive decline. Those who walked 5,000 to 7,500 steps per day saw that delay extend to around seven years. In contrast, participants who were largely inactive showed faster accumulation of tau proteins in the brain, which is associated with Alzheimer's progression, and more rapid declines in thinking skills and daily functioning.

""This sheds light on why some people who appear to be on an Alzheimer's disease trajectory don't decline as quickly as others,"" said senior author Jasmeer Chhatwal, MD, PhD, of the Mass General Brigham Department of Neurology. ""Lifestyle factors appear to impact the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that lifestyle changes may slow the emergence of cognitive symptoms if we act early.""

Long-Term Study on Activity and Brain Changes

Researchers examined 296 individuals aged 50 to 90 who showed no cognitive impairment at the start of the Harvard Aging Brain Study. Participants wore waistband pedometers to track physical activity and underwent PET scans to measure amyloid-beta plaques and tau tangles in the brain. They completed yearly cognitive assessments over a period ranging from two to 14 years (average = 9.3 years), and a subset received additional brain scans to monitor changes in tau over time.

The results showed that participants with elevated amyloid-beta who took more daily steps experienced slower cognitive decline and a slower buildup of tau proteins. Statistical modeling indicated that the primary benefit of physical activity came from its association with slower tau accumulation. Among participants with low amyloid-beta levels, there was little evidence of either cognitive decline or tau buildup, and no significant link to activity levels.

Building Cognitive Resilience Through Movement

""We are thrilled that data from the Harvard Aging Brain Study has helped the field better understand the importance of physical activity for maintaining brain health,"" said co-author Reisa Sperling, MD, a neurologist at Mass General Brigham and co-principal investigator of the Harvard Aging Brain Study. ""These findings show us that it's possible to build cognitive resilience and resistance to tau pathology in the setting of preclinical Alzheimer's disease. This is particularly encouraging for our quest to ultimately prevent Alzheimer's disease dementia, as well as to decrease dementia due to multiple contributing factors.""

The team plans to further explore which types of physical activity are most beneficial, including how intensity and long-term exercise patterns might influence brain health. They also aim to uncover the biological mechanisms that connect physical activity, tau buildup, and cognitive function. The researchers believe these insights could inform future clinical trials that test whether exercise-based interventions can slow cognitive decline in older adults, particularly those at elevated risk for Alzheimer's.

Empowering People to Take Action

""We want to empower people to protect their brain and cognitive health by keeping physically active,"" said first-author Wai-Ying Wendy Yau, MD, a cognitive neurologist at Mass General Brigham. ""Every step counts -- and even small increases in daily activities can build over time to create sustained changes in habit and health.""

Key Research Findings

Mapping the Brain's Hidden System for Pain

Researchers at the University of Sydney have revealed a brainstem network that manages pain differently depending on where it occurs in the body. Using placebo pain relief, they discovered a map-like system that fine-tunes pain control for specific regions, such as the face, arms, or legs. The findings could lead to safer and more precise pain therapies that avoid the risks of opioid-based treatments.

The brainstem functions as the main communication pathway between the brain and spinal cord, directing signals that control thought, sensation, and survival responses. It also produces most of the brain's vital neurochemicals, making it a central hub for regulating both physical and emotional states.

Published in Science, the study used 7-Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (one of the most advanced brain scanners available, with only two in Australia) to identify how two major regions of the brainstem coordinate pain relief through placebo responses.

Dr. Lewis Crawford, lead author and research fellow at the School of Medical Sciences and the Brain and Mind Centre, explained, ""This is the first time we've seen such a precise and detailed pain map in the human brainstem, showing us that it tailors pain relief to the specific part of the body that's experiencing it.""

This breakthrough builds on decades of research led by co-author Professor Kevin Keay, Deputy Head of the School of Medical Sciences, who has long studied the brain's role in pain regulation.

How the Placebo Effect Reveals the Brain's Pain Control

To explore how the brain organizes pain relief, researchers tested 93 healthy volunteers by applying heat to different parts of their bodies. A placebo cream was used on some areas, but scientists secretly lowered the temperature to convince participants that the cream was reducing pain.

Each participant's heat level was personalized to reach a moderate level of discomfort, based on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 100 (worst pain imaginable), typically between 40 and 50 degrees Celsius.

When the same heat stimulus was later reapplied, participants continued to feel less pain in the areas where the placebo cream had been used, even though the temperature was no longer reduced. About 61 percent reported this effect, a strong indication of genuine placebo-driven pain relief.

Dr. Crawford noted, ""We found that upper parts of the brainstem were more active when relieving facial pain, while lower regions were engaged for arm or leg pain.""

Pinpointing the Brain's Pain-Relief Centers

Two major brainstem regions, the periaqueductal grey (PAG) and the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), were identified as central to this system. Each showed distinct patterns of activity depending on where the pain occurred. Upper sections of the PAG and RVM responded to facial pain, while lower sections activated for pain in the limbs.

According to Dr. Crawford, ""The brain's natural pain relief system is more nuanced than we thought. Essentially, it has a built-in system to control pain in specific areas. It's not just turning pain off everywhere; but working in a highly coordinated, anatomically precise system.""

A Blueprint for Targeted Pain Therapies

Understanding which brainstem areas are linked to different parts of the body may open new avenues for developing non-invasive therapies that reduce pain without widespread side effects.

""We now have a blueprint for how the brain controls pain in a spatially organized way,"" said Professor Luke Henderson, senior author and Professor in the School of Medical Sciences and the Brain and Mind Centre. ""This could help us design more effective and personalized treatments, especially for people with chronic pain in a specific area of their body.""

The study also challenges long-held assumptions about how placebo pain relief works. Instead of relying on the brain's opioid system, experts say a different part of the brainstem -- the lateral PAG -- is not only responsible but works without using opioids and could instead be linked to cannabinoid activity.

""Opioid-based pain relief typically activates central areas of the brain and can affect the whole body, whereas the cannabinoid circuit that we identified appears to operate in more targeted regions of the brainstem,"" said Dr. Crawford. ""This supports the idea that cannabinoids may play a role in localized, non-opioid pain control.""

""Knowing exactly where pain relief is happening in the brain means we can target that area or assess whether a drug is working in the right place,"" said Dr. Crawford. ""This could lead to more precise treatments for chronic pain that don't rely on opioids and work exactly where the brain expects pain relief to occur -- a huge step forward for pain management.""

You've seen the headlines: This battery breakthrough is going to change the electric vehicle forever. And then … silence. You head to the local showroom, and the cars all kind of look and feel the same.

WIRED got annoyed about this phenomenon. So we talked to battery technology experts about what's really going on in electric vehicle batteries. Which technologies are here? Which will be, probably, but aren't yet, so don't hold your breath? What's probably not coming anytime soon?

“It's easy to get excited about these things, because batteries are so complex,” says Pranav Jaswani, a technology analyst at IDTechEx, a market intelligence firm. “Many little things are going to have such a big effect.” That's why so many companies, including automakers, their suppliers, and battery-makers, are experimenting with so many bit parts of the battery. Swap one electrical conductor material for another, and an electric vehicle battery's range might increase by 50 miles. Rejigger how battery packs are put together, and an automaker might bring down manufacturing costs enough to give consumers a break on the sales lot.

Still, experts say, it can take a long time to get even small tweaks into production cars—sometimes 10 years or more. “Obviously, we want to make sure that whatever we put in an EV works well and it passes safety standards,” says Evelina Stoikou, who leads the battery technology and supply chain team at BloombergNEF, a research firm. Ensuring that means scientists coming up with new ideas, and suppliers figuring out how to execute them; the automakers, in turn, rigorously test each iteration. All the while, everyone's asking the most important question: Does this improvement make financial sense?

So it's only logical that not every breakthrough in the lab makes it to the road. Here are the ones that really count—and the ones that haven't quite panned out, at least so far.

The big deal battery breakthroughs all have something in common: They're related to the lithium-ion battery. Other battery chemistries are out there—more on them later—but in the next decade, it's going to be hard to catch up with the dominant battery form. “Lithium-ion is already very mature,” says Stoikou. Lots of players have invested big money in the technology, so “any new one is going to have to compete with the status quo.”

Why it's exciting: LFP batteries use iron and phosphate instead of pricier and harder-to-source nickel and cobalt, which are found in conventional lithium-ion batteries. They're also more stable and slower to degrade after multiple charges. The upshot: LFP batteries can help bring down the cost of manufacturing an EV, an especially important data point while Western electrics struggle to compete, cost-wise, with conventional gas-powered cars. LFP batteries are already common in China, and they're set to become more popular in European and American electric vehicles in the coming years.

Why it's hard: LFP is less energy dense than alternatives, meaning you can't pack as much charge—or range—into each battery.

Why it's exciting: The increased nickel content in lithium nickel manganese cobalt batteries ups the energy density, meaning more range in a battery pack without much more size or weight. Also, more nickel can mean less cobalt, a metal that's both expensive and ethically dubious to obtain.

Why it's hard: Batteries with higher nickel content are potentially less stable, which means they carry a higher risk of cracking or thermal runaway—fires. This means battery-makers experimenting with different nickel content have to spend more time and energy on the careful design of their products. That extra fussiness means more expense. For this reason, expect to see more nickel use in batteries for higher-end EVs.

Why it's exciting: Usually, battery electrodes are made by mixing materials into a solvent slurry, which then is applied to a metal current collector foil, dried, and pressed. The dry electrode process cuts down on the solvents by mixing the materials in dry powder form before application and lamination. Less solvent means fewer environmental and health and safety concerns. And getting rid of the drying process can save production time—and up efficiency—while reducing the physical footprint needed to manufacture batteries. This all can lead to cheaper manufacturing, “which should trickle down to make a cheaper car,” says Jaswani. Tesla has already incorporated a dry anode process into its battery-making. (The anode is the negative electrode that stores lithium ions while a battery is charging.) LG and Samsung SGI are also working on pilot production lines.

Why it's hard: Using dry powders can be more technically complicated.

Why it's exciting: In your standard electric vehicle battery, individual battery cells get grouped into modules, which are then assembled into packs. Not so in cell-to-pack, which puts cells directly into a pack structure without the middle module step. This lets battery-makers fit more battery into the same space, and can lead to some 50 additional miles of range and higher top speeds, says Jaswani. It also brings down manufacturing costs, savings that can be passed down to the car buyer. Big-time automakers including Tesla and BYD, plus Chinese battery giant CATL, are already using the tech.

Why it's hard: Without modules, it can be harder to control thermal runaway and maintain the battery pack's structure. Plus, cell-to-pack makes replacing a faulty battery cell much harder, which means smaller flaws can require opening or even replacing the entire pack.

Why it's exciting: Lithium-ion batteries have graphite anodes. Adding silicon to the mix, though, could have huge upsides: more energy storage (meaning longer driving ranges) and faster charging, potentially down to a blazing six to 10 minutes to top up. Tesla already mixes a bit of silicon into its graphite anodes, and other automakers—Mercedes-Benz, General Motors—say they're getting close to mass production.

Why it's hard: Silicon alloyed with lithium expands and contracts as it goes through the charging and discharging cycle, which can cause mechanical stress and even fracturing. Over time, this can lead to more dramatic battery capacity losses. For now, you're more likely to find silicon anodes in smaller batteries, like those in phones or even motorcycles.

The battery tech in the more speculative bucket has undergone plenty of testing. But it's still not quite at a place where most manufacturers are building production lines and putting it into cars.

Why it's exciting: Sodium—it's everywhere! Compared to lithium, the element is cheaper and easier to find and process, which means tracking down the materials to build sodium-ion batteries could give automakers a supply chain break. The batteries also seem to perform better in extreme temperatures, and are more stable. Chinese battery-maker CATL says it will start mass production of the batteries next year and that the batteries could eventually cover 40 percent of the Chinese passenger-vehicle market.

Why it's hard: Sodium ions are heavier than their lithium counterparts, so they generally store less energy per battery pack. That could make them a better fit for battery storage than for vehicles. It's also early days for this tech, which means fewer suppliers and fewer time-tested manufacturing processes.

Why it's exciting: Automakers have been promising for years that groundbreaking solid state batteries are right around the corner. That would be great, if true. This tech subs the liquid or gel electrolytes in a conventional li-ion battery for a solid electrolyte. These electrolytes should come in different chemistries, but they all have some big advantages: more energy density, faster charging, more durability, fewer safety risks (no liquid electrolyte means no leaks). Toyota says it will finally launch its first vehicles with solid state batteries in 2027 or 2028. BloombergNEF projects that by 2035, solid state batteries will account for 10 percent of EV and storage production.

Why it's hard: Some solid electrolytes have a hard time at low temperatures. The biggest issues, however, have to do with manufacturing. Putting together these new batteries requires new equipment. It's really hard to build defect-free layers of electrolyte. And the industry hasn't come to an agreement about which solid electrolyte to use, which makes it hard to create supply chains.

Good ideas don't always make a ton of sense in the real world.

Why it's exciting: Park your car, get out, and have it charge up while you wait—no plugs required. Wireless charging could be the peak of convenience, and some automakers insist it's coming. Porsche, for example, is showing off a prototype, with plans to roll out the real thing next year.

Why it's hard: The issue, says Jaswani, is that the tech underlying the chargers we have right now works perfectly well and is much cheaper to install. He expects that eventually, wireless charging will show up in some restricted use cases—maybe in buses, for example, that could charge up throughout their routes if they stop on top of a charging pad. But this tech may never go truly mainstream, he says.

Netflix is reportedly in talks to license video podcasts distributed by iHeartMedia, according to Bloomberg. iHeartMedia's podcast portfolio includes shows like “The Breakfast Club,” “Las Culturistas,” “Jay Shetty Podcast,” and “Stuff You Should Know.”

Netflix is looking for exclusivity, which means video podcasts that it licenses from iHeartMedia could no longer be uploaded to YouTube. It's worth noting that if a deal does come together, iHeartMedia might not license its entire podcast catalogue to the streaming service.

The news comes a few weeks after Netflix signed a similar deal with Spotify that will bring a curated selection of sports, culture, lifestyle, and true crime podcasts from Spotify Studios and The Ringer to Netflix. 

Under the Spotify deal, podcasts available on Netflix will be removed from YouTube but remain on Spotify. Some of Spotify's biggest shows, including “The Joe Rogan Experience,” will remain on YouTube.

For Netflix, these video podcast deals will give it a new way to better compete with YouTube, which is the most-watched platform for video podcasts after surpassing 1 billion monthly active podcast viewers earlier this year.

More than two months ago, Tesla published its fourth “Master Plan,” a gauzy post about how the company wants to spread “sustainable abundance” via its future products. Details remain woefully absent, but that hasn't stopped Tesla from making it the central prop in its bid to convince shareholders to hand CEO Elon Musk a compensation package worth $1 trillion at the company's annual meeting on Thursday.

If that vote passes, the world's richest man would receive the biggest pay package in corporate history.  

When the “Plan” released, it was so vague that it drew criticism from some of the company's biggest fans. Even Musk, who said that criticism was “[f]air” and claimed Tesla would “add more specifics,” acknowledged the plan's lack of details.

The post remains unchanged, despite the fact that it's a centerpiece of Tesla's relentless campaign.

Musk has maintained he cares less about the money and more about retaining control over Tesla and the “robot army” he wants to build — and he has threatened to leave if the vote fails.

Master Plan 4 lies in stark contrast to prior “Master Plans” released by Tesla. Each of those included concrete goals and tangible ideas, though some were so lofty that Tesla has still not yet accomplished them. The third Master Plan, released in 2023, focused on creating a sustainable energy economy and came in the form of a 41-page white paper.

Tesla and Musk didn't respond to a request for comment.

Musk teased the fourth Master Plan back in June 2024. “Working on the Tesla Master Plan 4,” Musk wrote on X at the time. “It will be epic.”

In August of this year, he wrote in another post that “Master Plan 3 was too complex for almost anyone to understand,” and said “Master Plan 4 will be concise.” Tesla published the plan just a few days later.

Despite its imprecision, essentially all materials Tesla has sent to shareholders about the vote promote the fourth Master Plan as a reason to approve the compensation package. It is highlighted on the pamphlets that instruct shareholders how to vote. It got a shoutout in Tesla's third-quarter shareholder letter. It's been referenced in interviews by board chair Robyn Denholm and design leader Franz von Holzhausen.

“A few days ago, Elon unveiled an inspiring next chapter for Tesla with Master Plan, Part IV, which is focused on creating a Sustainable Abundance for all,” Denholm and fellow board member Kathleen Wilson-Thompson wrote in a September letter to shareholders, again without going into further specifics. “We are, and have always been, a company that thinks bolder, acts faster and strives for a better future. Master Plan, Part IV builds on that, by reimagining labor, mobility and energy and bringing AI into the physical world through products and services like FSD, Optimus and Robotaxi.”

Denholm has been on a media blitz drumming up support for the $1 trillion pay package vote, but she has not been asked to lay out a clearer vision for Master Plan 4. She's instead remained focused on the milestones Musk needs to meet to unlock the full $1 trillion of his pay package — almost all of which are watered down versions of the outrageous promises he's made through the years.

Musk himself has not directly brought up Master Plan 4 on X since his September 2 post about adding more specifics. He has spent much of the days before the shareholder vote promoting the compensation package, fear-mongering about immigrants, and spreading misinformation about the New York City mayoral election.

It was only during an interview that von Holzhausen did with the Ride the Lightning podcast in October that someone brought up the vagueness of the plan.

“[M]y initial reaction to it as a Tesla shareholder, Tesla owner, Tesla fan, and I saw a lot of this in the Tesla Community, was that it seemed like it was a little lacking in details compared to the previous Master Plans, which were pretty concrete,” host Ryan McCaffrey said, who then quickly pivoted to a more positive set of questions for the chief designer.

“So, why are you excited about Master Plan Part 4 and sort of how is Tesla going to get this done? And that's a big question,” McCaffrey asked.

“We'll do it in Tesla fashion of course,” von Holzhausen responded.

Spotify says its video podcasts are seeing increased consumer adoption. In its third-quarter earnings report, the company shared that its video podcast catalog has expanded to nearly half a million shows, and more than 390 million users have now streamed a video podcast on the platform.

That figure is up 54% year-over-year, and it also reflects Spotify's increased investment in the format. In June 2024, the company said it had some 250,000 video podcasts as it rolled out tools that let non-hosted podcasters upload their videos to the platform. The streaming giant also lets users engage with podcasts through comments, Q&As, and polls, making the app feel more like a social network.

As a result, Spotify says that users' time spent with video content on Spotify has also more than doubled year-over-year, largely driven by video podcasts. In addition, video podcast consumption has increased by more than 80% since the launch of the Spotify Partner Program, or SPP, in January, which gives qualifying creators the ability to monetize their shows in new ways, including audience-driven payouts from Spotify Premium user engagement.

The company also recently announced a partnership with Netflix to distribute its video podcasts to a broader audience starting in 2026 in the United States, with more markets to follow. Investors didn't ask about the specifics of the revenue-sharing agreement on the earnings call; however, investors did want to understand how distributing podcasts off the platform would ultimately benefit Spotify.

According to incoming co-CEO Alex Norström, the move is meant to center Spotify as a creators' distribution hub.

“We think … that when the creator wins, we win, and as creators optimize to create their best shows and interviews, which is really what they're focused on,” Norström told investors and analysts. “They wanted to syndicate everywhere. And we believe, of course, in helping them to reach audiences in as many places as possible, which is consistent with our core philosophy on being creator-first.”

Later, co-CEO Gustav Söderström suggested that allowing creators to be both on Spotify and Netflix gives the company further “revenue opportunities.” 

“This is the way to think about it: It's part of our ubiquity strategy, and it's really important that while we build a good user experience, we also need to have a very strong creator offer[ing],” he noted.

Norström pointed out that having Spotify podcasts on YouTube increased awareness about the shows and their origins, which then resulted in net incremental usage on Spotify. The company expects the same with Netflix.

In addition, Spotify said the TV opportunity was a part of this equation — hence the recent upgrade of its Apple TV app. The more people can use Spotify across platforms, the more their usage increases, and that helps Spotify's ads business.

The company also noted that it has given advertisers programmatic access to its audio and video inventory, though it admits that 2025 is a “transition year” for its ads business, and it doesn't expect to see growth improve until the second half of 2026.

The streamer also announced its monthly active users increased 11% year-over-year to 713 million, and revenue was up to €4.27 billion (~$4.9 billion), beating Wall Street's expectations. The company saw an €899 million net profit (~$1 billion) during the quarter.

However, the stock slipped after the opening bell on Tuesday, due to Wall Street's concerns over Spotify's mixed guidance for its fourth quarter.

I love notebooks, I use them all the time for teaching, writing (all of my books are written in notebooks), EDA, model development, and more. I've spoken at Jupytercon.Having said that, I've never played around with other notebook implementations (ok, I've used IPython Notebook, Jupyter Notebook and Lab, Google Colab, ein (emacs), Jupyter in Vscode, and Notebook (.py) files in Vscode).I've seen Joel's rant about notebooks, and they do have drawbacks.But I would rather push better programming practices (chaining pandas, using functions, rearranging cells) than have dependent cells written in the horrible piecemeal style that I see all around the industry.My biggest issue with notebooks is JSON. I've used Jupyter to get around it for years, and now many LLMs are decent at writing Jupyter JSON.

So what pain point are these new entrants trying to solve?Sure there is an issue of .ipynb basically being a gnarly json ill suited for git but it is rare that I need to track down a particular git commit. Even then that json is not that hard to read.Also I'd like an easier way to copy cells across different Jupyter notebooks, but at the end of day it is just Python and markdown not very hard to grok.

From the nearby perspective of building GFQL, an embeddable oss GPU graph dataframe query language somewhere between cypher and duckdb/pandas/spark, at an even higher-level on top of pandas, cudf, etc:It's nice using higher-level languages with rich libraries underneath so we can focus on the foundational algorithm & data ecosystem problems while still achieving crazy numberscudf gives us optimized GPU joins,  so jumping from cheap personal CPU or GPU boxes to 80GB server GPUs and deep 2B edge whole-graph queries running in a second without work has been nice :) we want our focus on getting regular graph operations fully data parallel in the way we want while being easy for users,  figuring out areas like bigger-than-memory and data lakes, etc, so we want to defer lower-level efforts to when the rust etc rewrite is more merited. I do see value in starting low when the target value and workload is obvious for building our (eg, vector indexes / DBs), but when breaking new ground at every point, value to going where you can roll & extend faster.

Yes, they shouldn't be dependent on Alphabet, they should back up their content and diversify platforms, but because we decided to allow monopolization of monetization of the web, and to vigorously encourage the surveillance based adtech of Google and Facebook, they control the full stack and effectively hold audiences hostage; you have to play on their platforms in order to engage with the audience you build, and a vast majority of the consumers of content are ignorant of the roles platforms play.

Some of that would be alleviated if we separated hosting/serving videos from the frontend and indexing, perhaps with a radio-like agreement on what the host gets paid for serving the video to a customer of the frontend.  Frontend/index makes money off ads, and then pays some of that back to the host.  Creators could in theory be paid by the video hosts, since views make the host money.Then heavy handed moderation could be a disadvantage then, because they would be lacking content other sites have (though some of that content would be distasteful enough most frontends would ban it).

I ask this in good faith, because my observation of the last few years is that the incidents still occur, with all of the harms to individuals also occurring. Then, after N number of incidents, the company pays a fine*, and the company does not necessarily make substantive changes. Superficial changes, but not always meaningful changes that would prevent future harms to individuals.*Do these fines tend to be used to compensate the affected individuals? I am not educated on that detail, and would appreciate info from someone who is.

Two scientists argue that the growing commercial efforts to counter climate change by reflecting away sunlight will thwart responsible research in the field.

Last week, an American-Israeli company that claims it's developed proprietary technology to cool the planet announced it had raised $60 million, by far the largest known venture capital round to date for a solar geoengineering startup.

The company, Stardust, says the funding will enable it to develop a system that could be deployed by the start of the next decade, according to Heatmap, which broke the story.

MIT Technology Review's guest opinion series, offering expert commentary on legal, political and regulatory issues related to climate change and clean energy. You can read the rest of the pieces here.

As scientists who have worked on the science of solar geoengineering for decades, we have grown increasingly concerned about the emerging efforts to start and fund private companies to build and deploy technologies that could alter the climate of the planet. We also strongly dispute some of the technical claims that certain companies have made about their offerings. 

Given the potential power of such tools, the public concerns about them, and the importance of using them responsibly, we argue that they should be studied, evaluated, and developed mainly through publicly coordinated and transparently funded science and engineering efforts.  In addition, any decisions about whether or how they should be used should be made through multilateral government discussions, informed by the best available research on the promise and risks of such interventions—not the profit motives of companies or their investors.

The basic idea behind solar geoengineering, or what we now prefer to call sunlight reflection methods (SRM), is that humans might reduce climate change by making the Earth a bit more reflective, partially counteracting the warming caused by the accumulation of greenhouse gases. 

There is strong evidence, based on years of climate modeling and analyses by researchers worldwide, that SRM—while not perfect—could significantly and rapidly reduce climate changes and avoid important climate risks. In particular, it could ease the impacts in hot countries that are struggling to adapt.  

The goals of doing research into SRM can be diverse: identifying risks as well as finding better methods. But research won't be useful unless it's trusted, and trust depends on transparency. That means researchers must be eager to examine pros and cons, committed to following the evidence where it leads, and driven by a sense that research should serve public interests, not be locked up as intellectual property.

In recent years, a handful of for-profit startup companies have emerged that are striving to develop SRM technologies or already trying to market SRM services. That includes Make Sunsets, which sells “cooling credits” for releasing sulfur dioxide in the stratosphere. A new company, Sunscreen, which hasn't yet been announced, intends to use aerosols in the lower atmosphere to achieve cooling over small areas, purportedly to help farmers or cities deal with extreme heat.  

Our strong impression is that people in these companies are driven by the same concerns about climate change that move us in our research. We agree that more research, and more innovation, is needed. However, we do not think startups—which by definition must eventually make money to stay in business—can play a productive role in advancing research on SRM.

Many people already distrust the idea of engineering the atmosphere—at whichever scale—to address climate change, fearing negative side effects, inequitable impacts on different parts of the world, or the prospect that a world expecting such solutions will feel less pressure to address the root causes of climate change.

Adding business interests, profit motives, and rich investors into this situation just creates more cause for concern, complicating the ability of responsible scientists and engineers to carry out the work needed to advance our understanding.

The only way these startups will make money is if someone pays for their services, so there's a reasonable fear that financial pressures could drive companies to lobby governments or other parties to use such tools. A decision that should be based on objective analysis of risks and benefits would instead be strongly influenced by financial interests and political connections.

The need to raise money or bring in revenue often drives companies to hype the potential or safety of their tools. Indeed, that's what private companies need to do to attract investors, but it's not how you build public trust—particularly when the science doesn't support the claims.

Notably, Stardust says on its website that it has developed novel particles that can be injected into the atmosphere to reflect away more sunlight, asserting that they're “chemically inert in the stratosphere, and safe for humans and ecosystems.” According to the company, “The particles naturally return to Earth's surface over time and recycle safely back into the biosphere.”

But it's nonsense for the company to claim they can make particles that are inert in the stratosphere. Even diamonds, which are extraordinarily nonreactive, would alter stratospheric chemistry. First of all, much of that chemistry depends on highly reactive radicals that react with any solid surface, and second, any particle may become coated by background sulfuric acid in the stratosphere. That could accelerate the loss of the protective ozone layer by spreading that existing sulfuric acid over a larger surface area.

(Stardust didn't provide a response to an inquiry about the concerns raised in this piece.)

In materials presented to potential investors, which we've obtained a copy of, Stardust further claims its particles “improve” on sulfuric acid, which is the most studied material for SRM. But the point of using sulfate for such studies was never that it was perfect, but that its broader climatic and environmental impacts are well understood. That's because sulfate is widespread on Earth, and there's an immense body of scientific knowledge about the fate and risks of sulfur that reaches the stratosphere through volcanic eruptions or other means.

If there's one great lesson of 20th-century environmental science, it's how crucial it is to understand the ultimate fate of any new material introduced into the environment. 

Chlorofluorocarbons and the pesticide DDT both offered safety advantages over competing technologies, but they both broke down into products that accumulated in the environment in unexpected places, causing enormous and unanticipated harms. 

The environmental and climate impacts of sulfate aerosols have been studied in many thousands of scientific papers over a century, and this deep well of knowledge greatly reduces the chance of unknown unknowns. 

Grandiose claims notwithstanding—and especially considering that Stardust hasn't disclosed anything about its particles or research process—it would be very difficult to make a pragmatic, risk-informed decision to start SRM efforts with these particles instead of sulfate.

We don't want to claim that every single answer lies in academia. We'd be fools to not be excited by profit-driven innovation in solar power, EVs, batteries, or other sustainable technologies. But the math for sunlight reflection is just different. Why?   

Because the role of private industry was essential in improving the efficiency, driving down the costs, and increasing the market share of renewables and other forms of cleantech. When cost matters and we can easily evaluate the benefits of the product, then competitive, for-profit capitalism can work wonders.  

But SRM is already technically feasible and inexpensive, with deployment costs that are negligible compared with the climate damage it averts.

The essential questions of whether or how to use it come down to far thornier societal issues: How can we best balance the risks and benefits? How can we ensure that it's used in an equitable way? How do we make legitimate decisions about SRM on a planet with such sharp political divisions?

Trust will be the most important single ingredient in making these decisions. And trust is the one product for-profit innovation does not naturally manufacture. 

Ultimately, we're just two researchers. We can't make investors in these startups do anything differently. Our request is that they think carefully, and beyond the logic of short-term profit. If they believe geoengineering is worth exploring, could it be that their support will make it harder, not easier, to do that?  

David Keith is the professor of geophysical sciences at the University of Chicago and founding faculty director of the school's Climate Systems Engineering Initiative. Daniele Visioni is an assistant professor of earth and atmospheric sciences at Cornell University and head of data for Reflective, a nonprofit that develops tools and provides funding to support solar geoengineering research.

The postage stamp pixel images are also limited by their 64 shades of gray. Well done, though.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A 3D printing enthusiast has made a cute, functional digital camera using an optical sensor salvaged from a discarded mouse PCB. This is an admirable recycling-inspired maker project to see completed, and you can witness it in action in the embedded Reddit post below. However, don't set your recycling old rodents into digital cameras' hopes too high, as the results are definitely lo-fi.

After a quick 360 degree tour of the unchristened device – let's call it the magical mouse camera (MMC) – Dycus turned it to face their workbench, and powered on the device using the black button atop. Subsequently, we get to see the electronic viewfinder power up and, despite its tiny size, it is still evident that the images are going to have a Minecraft-esque blocky flair, putting it kindly.

According to Dycus, the lo-fi results are simply due to the mouse sensor doubling as a photographic sensor. The ADNS-3090 sensor is only capable of capturing a native 30x30 pixels, and it is limited to 64 shades. That doesn't mean this device will be without its uses, only that you must be aware of them.

Dycus says that the whole MMC camera project took just 65 hours from getting the project itch to the satisfying completion, with a finished camera in hand. Despite the minimal timescale, the fit and finishing look great, and there is quite a bit of maker tech packed into that camera body.

In addition to the 3D printed structural components, Dycus used:

The camera is claimed to be capable of shooting video, but the 32KB memory installed incapable of holding anything worthwhile.

Dycus seems to be most pleased with the software behind the MMC, though. Making liberal use of “a few standard Arduino libraries” the maker “wrote support for the sensor, UI code, code to talk to the external memory chip, code to draw the images to the display, and other misc stuff.”

The work on the software side, also completed in those few 65 hours, delivered multiple shooting modes (single shot, double shot, quad shot, ‘smear' shot (panorama), and cowboy), plus a bonus draw-on-the-screen mouse mode that uses the touch sensor as intended. Users can also pick from multiple color palettes, not just gray.

Dycus wrote what they call a “rudimentary photo dump to computer via Python script and serial port.” If it works, for archiving the camera's precious lo-fi cargo, then it is fit for purpose.

Last but not least, Dycus compares their MMC to what is probably the most famous lo-fi image-capture device around, the Nintendo Game Boy Camera. While Nintendo still wins the resolution race, the MMC trumps it for color depth with its 64 vs 4 shades superiority.

This isn't the first optical mouse-to-camera project we have reported on at Tom's Hardware. Last year, we showcased the Doctor Volt Mouse Camera with its extremely coarse 18x18 pixel resolution. In contrast to Dycus's work, the good doctor didn't bother to redesign the camera housing, so it looked like a mouse on a tripod.

The rate of antiviral prescriptions in emergency departments (EDs) for children at a high risk for severe influenza decreased by more than half during the late pandemic vs pre-pandemic period, despite increased proportion of children undergoing clinical testing.

“These findings highlight that antiviral prescription management in the ED is lacking. Understanding reasons behind these trends is important to protect especially vulnerable pediatric patients from avoidable influenza morbidity,” the authors wrote.

“[The] discrepancy between testing and treatment underscores the need to promote guideline-concordant antiviral prescribing, since timely initiation of treatment has been shown to reduce the severity and duration of influenza illness, thus lowering the risk of complications and hospitalization,” they added.

The study was led by Tess Stopczynski, MS, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee. It was published online on October 22, 2025, in JAMA Network Open.

The authors did not examine data on prescription fills or caregiver acceptance. Some sites had restrictions on age (< 5 years) and symptom duration (< 10 days of illness), and potential unmeasured confounders could have included pandemic misinformation, workload in the ED, medication costs, and parental concerns about adverse effects.

This study was supported by the cooperative agreement IP16-004 with the CDC. Several authors reported receiving personal fees, grants, and travel support from and serving on advisory boards of various pharmaceutical companies, institutions, and universities.

Ultrasound-based foetal weight estimation accuracy varied significantly by foetal characteristics; foetuses estimated to be severe small for gestational age (SGA) had the poorest accuracy, which was even more pronounced when the ultrasound examination was performed at an earlier GA.

""It is essential to keep in mind the uncertainty and potential error of fetal weight estimation when basing clinical decisions on EFW. Knowledge of the weaknesses of the chosen formula, especially in the extremes of standardized EFW, is of great importance in clinical decision-making,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Michaela Granfors, Division of Clinical Epidemiology, Department of Medicine (Solna), Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. It was published online on October 24, 2025, in Ultrasound in Obstetrics & Gynecology.

Pregnancies at a high risk for abnormal foetal growth were overrepresented, which may have limited the generalisability of the findings. This study lacked detailed information on the competence of the ultrasound examiner. Foetal presentation was recorded only at birth rather than at the time of ultrasound examination, which may have led to misclassification.

This study was funded by the Swedish Infant Death Foundation. No information regarding conflicts of interest was provided for this study.

Moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was associated with a twofold higher risk for cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) over an 8-year follow-up than not having OSA in middle-aged and older adults, even after accounting for APOE-ε4 genetic status, a population-based, prospective cohort study showed.

“To our knowledge, no [other] study to date has investigated the association between OSA and risk of incident CMBs longitudinally,” the investigators of the study wrote.

Because OSA is a modifiable risk factor, the findings suggest that “moderate-to-severe OSA should be a potential target for early diagnosis and treatment to prevent incident CMBs and potentially prevent future strokes and dementia in aging populations,” they added.

The study was led by Ali Tanweer Siddiquee, PhD, College of Medicine, Korea University Ansan Hospital, Ansan, South Korea. It was published online on October 28 in JAMA Network Open.

Study limitations included the low prevalence of APOE-ε4 carriers (n = 234), which restricted genetic analyses; the small number of cases of incident CMB; and the use of less sensitive MRI sequences, which may have underestimated CMBs. Potential selection bias due to participant dropouts and deaths, along with a possible healthy cohort effect from long-term follow-up, may have limited the generalizability of the results.

The study was funded by grants from the National Institute of Health in South Korea, the National Biobank of Korea, and the US National Institutes of Health. One investigator reported receiving equity from and serving as cofounder, scientific advisor, and consultant for Beacon Biosignals. Another investigator reported owning a patent with royalties from MyCardio, LLC, and receiving personal fees from Guidepoint and GLG Councils. The other 11 investigators reported having no relevant financial relationships.

Watching Tyler Adams on the field for Bournemouth against mighty Manchester City on Sunday felt like a microcosm of the U.S. men's national team's roller coaster current reality.

In the first half, Adams scored his first English Premier League goal against Pep Guardiola's Sky Blues. Late in the second half, the USMNT's beating heart of a midfielder caught a stud to the knee, forcing him to limp out of the match injured. 

There was no official word on Adams' status yet. And although the USMNT's medical staff is ""optimistic it's not bad,"" as a source texted me on Monday morning, there's no guarantee that the 2022 World Cup captain will be available for selection when coach Mauricio Pochettino names his final roster of 2025 later this week ahead of two friendlies.

Star forward Christian Pulisic has yet to return for AC Milan since injuring his hamstring on Oct. 14 while representing the U.S. in its 2-1 exhibition win over Australia. Even if he returns for the Rossoneri for next weekend's Serie A contest against Parma (which features Miami-born U-20 World Cup Golden Boot winner Benjamin Cremaschi), Pochettino could grant Milan's wish to let Pulisic remain in Italy this month.

With two friendlies this month (vs. Paraguay on Nov. 15 and another on Nov. 18 against Uruguay), Pochettino's squad is shaping up to be severely shorthanded. The absences figure to open the door for others as the countdown to the 2026 World Cup continues. 

Here are the players that could make the cut when Pochettino drops the roster on Thursday:

JUMP TO: Goalkeepers | Defenders | Midfielders | Forwards

Predicted in camp (3): Matt Freese, Matt Turner, Patrick Schulte

Injured: Chris Brady

No room for: Zack Steffen, Roman Celentano, Jonathan Klinsmann, Ethan Horvath, Diego Kochen

Although penalty specialist Freese lost on spot kicks to Charlotte in Game 2 of NYCFC's first-round MLS playoff series (with U.S. assistant coach Miguel D'Agostino in attendance), he'll arrive in this camp as the USMNT's clear No. 1 even if the Pigeons fail to advance. Turner's season is already done; the Americans' 2022 starter and his New England Revolution didn't qualify for the postseason, but his experience should get him an invitation. Schulte was involved last month; he and the Columbus Crew meet rival FC Cincinnati in a decisive Game 3 this weekend.

Predicted in camp (9): Noahkai Banks, Chris Richards, Tim Ream, Mark McKenzie, Miles Robinson, Max Arfsten, Sergiño Dest, Alex Freeman, Kristoffer Lund

Injured: Antonee ""Jedi"" Robinson, Tristan Blackmon, Cameron Carter-Vickers

No room for: Joe Scally, DeJuan Jones, Shaq Moore, John Tolkin, Auston Trusty, Walker Zimmerman

All-world left back ""Jedi"" Robinson didn't suit up for Fulham on Saturday, the fourth straight Premier League game he's missed because of lingering problems with his surgically repaired right knee.

Dest and Richards are locks. Ream, who has served as Pochettino's first-choice captain, isn't far behind. Arfsten scored the winner for the Crew on Sunday in MLS Cup playoff action and is in line to start both November games with Jedi missing.

Lund hasn't played for the USMNT since the 2-0 loss in Mexico in October 2024, but he's started seven of FC Köln's nine Bundesliga games and four straight — including 90 minutes in Sunday's 4-1 win over Hamburg.

The uncapped, 18-year-old Banks rebounded from his worst outing as a pro with a fine performance for Augsburg in last Friday's narrow loss to Borussia Dortmund. With four consecutive Bundesliga starts, he's in line to make his debut this month. Meanwhile, Miles Robinson (who started against Ecuador and Australia in October) and McKenzie (who went the full 90 minutes vs. the Socceroos) should both return. And Zimmerman could have a case after helping Nashville survive Lionel Messi and Inter Miami's furious late comeback attempt in Saturday's series-tying 2-1 victory. Scally started for Borussia Mönchengladbach a week after serving as a sub in a 3-0 loss to Bayern Munich.

Qatar 2022 veteran Cameron Carter-Vickers suffered an Achilles injury last week that could keep the central defender shelved until after the March international window.

Predicted in camp (8): Tyler Adams, Sebastian Berhalter, Johnny Cardoso, Diego Luna,  Weston McKennie, Yunus Musah, Cristian Roldan, Tanner Tessmann

Injured: Jack McGlynn, Malik Tillman

No room for: Paxten Aaronson, Benjamin Cremaschi, Gianluca Busio, Luca de la Torre, James Sands,  Aidan Morris, Gio Reyna

Weston McKennie has undergone another coaching change at Juventus. (Photo by Robin Alam/ISI Photos/ISI Photos via Getty Images) 

Despite another coaching change at Juventus, McKennie kept his spot for Luciano Spalletti's debut, going 85 minutes in a 2-1 win over Cremonese. Spalletti is the fourth full-time manager McKennie has played under in his six seasons with Juve. 

The inclusion of Cardoso and Musah could seem strange; the central midfield pair aren't playing regularly for Atlético Madrid and Atalanta, respectively. Still, the November window represents Pochettino's last chance to see both players for four months. Cardoso, who was on Atléti's bench this weekend for the first time since August, has been bothered by ankle issues since the Gold Cup. On Saturday, Musah was an unused substitute for the third time in four Serie A games. He's logged just 281 minutes across all competitions this season. 

Johnny Cardoso is also returning to full fitness. (Photo by Catherine Ivill - AMA/Getty Images) 

However, Musah missing out this month would mean a full calendar year away from the national team for the 22-year-old who started all four World Cup games in 2022 and scored the first goal of the Pochettino era last fall. Musah and Atalanta, where he's on loan from AC Milan, meet Tim Weah and Marseille Wednesday in the Champions League action.

Like Pulisic, Gold Cup standout Malik Tillman hasn't played for his club since picking up a hamstring ailment of his own while on international duty. There's no word on if Tillman will travel to Portugal ahead of Bayer Leverkusen's Champions League tangle with Benfica on Wednesday. 

The rugged Morris could benefit if either Cardoso or Musah aren't called, having recently won back his starting job with a Middlesbrough side that is aiming for Premier League promotion.

In San Diego, Gold Cup starter De la Torre has been supplanted in former USMNT interim boss Mikey Varas' XI by 35-year-old Panamanian Anibal Godoy for the MLS playoffs. The expansion darlings host the Portland Timbers in Sunday's decider.

Sands had a rough outing in St. Pauli's Bundesliga loss to Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday. Reyna came off the bench for the final 11 minutes for 'Gladbach, and has played just 131 total minutes during the 2025-26 campaign so far. 

Predicted in camp (6): Brenden Aaronson, Tim Weah; Patrick Agyemang, Folarin Balogun, Ricardo Pepi, Haji Wright

Injured: Christian Pulisic, Brandon Vazquez, Brian White,  Alex Zendejas

No room for: Damion Downs, Josh Sargent

Ricardo Pepi could be finally back in a USMNT camp this week. (Photo by Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images) 

Pepi hasn't played for the U.S. in almost year following knee surgery, and he's made just two starts this season for Dutch titans PSV. Yet his strike rate remains scary — the rangy striker celebrated Halloween with his fourth goal in just 372 Eredivisie and Champions League minutes this term. He also found the net in each of his three appearances under Pochettino in 2024, which the Argentine surely hasn't forgotten. 

Balogun still returns as the incumbent frontrunner for striker position after his standout performances in September and October. He also has three goals in 12 appearances for Monaco, which heads to Norway's FK Bodø/Glimt in the Champions League on Tuesday. Wright's a no-brainer following his spectacular brace vs. the Aussies last month.

Zendejas (knee) remains out for Mexican champion Club América. But Aaronson has earned his way back into Pochettino's plans with a string of fine showings in the Premier League, including his first goal of the season in Leeds' recent 2-1 win over West Ham. Could he step in for Pulisic against Paraguay for just his second USMNT start of 2025?

Alexi Lalas has said it would be a ""bad look"" if Christian Pulisic played for AC Milan this weekend and then skipped U.S. men's national team duty.

Pulisic has not played since suffering a hamstring injury in the USMNT's match against Australia on Oct. 14. But the 27-year-old appears set to return for Milan's game against Parma on Saturday.

Despite Pulisic's impending return, Milan has been weary of sending him to play two friendlies with the USMNT after only just returning from an injury that cost him several games.

A report from Gazzetta dello Sport last week said that Milan and U.S. Soccer had reached an agreement for Pulisic to stay in Italy over the November international window, missing USMNT matches against Paraguay and Uruguay.

Though Lalas understood Milan's perspective, the longtime USMNT defender said the optics of missing the international break would not be good for Pulisic.

""I recognize that travel or additional games can lead to fatigue,"" Lalas said on the ""State of the Union"" show.

""I completely understand and I respect that when it comes to [USMNT head coach Mauricio] Pochettino, or any head coach of a national team for that matter, there always is this give and take and this bartering that's going on.

""I hope he plays for AC Milan, Christian Pulisic. I hope he gets back. I hope he's healthy. I hope he scores goals. I hope he plays the whole game [against Parma], and I hope he's fit.

""But then what's the story going to be? Well, we just saw him running around. He looks great, and yet he's not with the national team. I don't know. It would be a bad look.""

Various pundits have questioned Pulisic's commitment to the USMNT over the past year, most notably when he opted out of the Gold Cup this summer to rest.

Pulisic also drew criticism when he missed an October 2024 friendly at Mexico over workload concerns. Mexico defeated the U.S. 2-0 in that friendly, which was Pochettino's second game in charge.","{'href': 'https://prosoccerwire.usatoday.com', 'title': 'Pro Soccer Wire'}","soccer"

Max Dowman came on for Arsenal in the Champions League on Tuesday MICHAL CIZEK

This is an updated version of an article published last month when Max Dowman became Arsenal's youngest-ever starter in the Carabao Cup tie against Brighton.

Max Dowman has become the youngest player to feature in a Champions League match after coming on in the 72nd minute for Arsenal against Club Brugge on Tuesday night.

Dowman, who is 15 years and 308 days old, has beaten the previous record set by Youssoufa Moukoko, who came on for Borussia Dortmund in December 2020 at the age of 16 years and 18 days.

The latest record broken by the teenager comes a week after he became the youngest to start a match for Arsenal in their Carabao Cup tie against Brighton at the Emirates.

Mikel Arteta, the Arsenal manager, knows he has an exceptional talent at his disposal and has shown he believes Dowman, who is yet to finish secondary school, can compete at the highest level.

It was yet another milestone in Dowman's rapid rise, having already become the second-youngest player in history to play in the Premier League.

The Athletic explains why Dowman is one of the most exciting young players in Europe…

If becoming the youngest player to play in the Champions League is not enough of an indicator, then the simplest way to describe Dowman is to say he is one of the most talented teenagers in European football.

His 16th birthday is not until the end of December, but Dowman, who typically plays on the right wing, is already showing he is the type of player who puts supporters on the edge of their seats, excited about what he might do next.

He joined Arsenal's academy in 2015. His quality has been well-known within the club for years, and supporters are seeing why there has been so much buzz.

Dowman began training with Arteta and the first team last season before making his unofficial first-team debut against Milan in a friendly this July.

Versatile with a multifaceted skill set, he has been deployed as a right-winger, central midfielder and in the No 10 role throughout his time in the club's academy.

He made his first appearance at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium for the under-18s against Manchester United in the FA Youth Cup, two months after turning 15, and often found himself being triple-marked. That is how good he is for his age.

Arteta spoke about Dowman several times last season and made it clear he would be taking the teenager on the club's pre-season tour to Singapore and Hong Kong.

Already playing three years above his age at the club's Hale End academy, he soon found himself being double-marked by Tottenham Hotspur's Djed Spence and Son Heung-min (now at Los Angeles FC) during one of the friendly matches in Asia.

Dowman was arguably Arsenal's best player on tour and it came as little surprise when Arteta included him in the squad for their 5-0 win against Leeds United in the Premier League on August 23.

He came off the bench against Leeds and stole the show, winning a penalty and showing his confidence.

At 15 years 235 days, he became the second-youngest player in Premier League history to make their debut after Ethan Nwaneri, his Arsenal team-mate who made his top-flight bow at 15 years and 181 days against Brentford in September 2022.

Following his performances for Arsenal, Dowman was selected to play for England U19 in September. He has now made five appearances for the under-19s, three of them starts, and scored in their most recent match, a 7-0 win against Wales.

After Arsenal's 3-2 friendly defeat against Villarreal on August 6, Arteta praised Dowman's “efficiency that he shows in every attack and action”, describing it as “incredible”.

“It's been so fast,” Arteta said of Dowman's development. “Even last year, when he was training with us, he was doing this kind of thing in training and now he's doing it in the game consistently.

“They (his team-mates) have the ball and they give it to him, so that tells you how much they trust him and the relationship he's building within the team.”

Following his excellent cameo against Leeds, Arteta told Sky Sports: “It is great to change the energy in the stadium by bringing him in and he had an impact. He won a penalty on his debut at the Emirates. That's incredible.

“It's credit, first of all, to his family; the way these kids have been raised and the environment created. They are not overwhelmed by the environment and context.”

As well as playing above his age group in Arsenal's academy, and for the first team, Dowman has also been playing higher up in the England setup.

Back in May, before representing Arsenal's first team, Dowman was playing for England at the Under-17s European Championship, and his dribbling ability stood out as he made several mazy runs.

When he played for England's under-19s against their Spanish counterparts in San Pedro del Pinatar in September, our correspondent Guillermo Rai was at the game and noted that Dowman was “fouled at least nine times during the game, with anger at the treatment he received spilling over into a confrontation between players from both sides after the final whistle”.

He still cannot change in the same dressing room as the first-team squad due to his young age, but Dowman's ceiling looks to be incredibly high.

To have played in the Premier League and the Champions League and to have started for the club before even turning 16 and finishing secondary school is quite the achievement, and a testament to the belief Arteta has in his qualities.

The Arsenal manager, however, will want to protect him and ensure that his development continues responsibly.

Boasting a strength in depth that few clubs can match, Arteta can continue easing in Dowman slowly, rather than rushing his progress — but it seems inevitable that at some point over the next couple of years, the teenager will cement his name in Arsenal's starting XI.

Alonso was appointed Madrid manager in May (Oscar Del Pozo/AFP/Getty Images)

Alonso was appointed Madrid manager in May (Oscar Del Pozo/AFP/Getty Images)

The Athletic has live coverage of Liverpool vs. Real Madrid from Tuesday's Champions League action.

Real Madrid lead Barcelona by five points in La Liga, having won 10 of their 11 matches so far. In the Champions League, they have three victories from three before Tuesday's trip to Liverpool.

It's been an impressive start for coach Xabi Alonso — who was appointed as Carlo Ancelotti's replacement at the end of last season.

Advertisement

Yet over the past week, The Athletic has reported on tensions between the 43-year-old and some of his squad — with several first-team players unhappy with his style of management.

The complaints from some Madrid squad members came as something of a surprise, given how Alonso's close and positive relationships with players led to outstanding successes in previous senior roles with Real Sociedad B and Bayer Leverkusen.

After retiring as a player at Bayern Munich at the age of 35 in 2017, Alonso's first steps in coaching came during the 2018-19 season, when his Under-14 Real Madrid team went unbeaten as they won regional league and cup titles.

In the summer of 2019, he took over Real Sociedad's reserve side in Spain's regionalised third tier, finishing fifth in their league, just outside of the play-off spots, in his debut season. The following campaign they were promoted to the second division — but they immediately came back down.

That squad of mostly local Basque youngsters all had huge respect, if not awe, for Alonso, who came through at Real Sociedad himself in 2000, before going on to win Champions League titles at Liverpool and Real Madrid, and a World Cup and two European Championships with Spain.

“There is nobody better than (Alonso) to convince these players, not just what it means to play well, but to be part of our model,” former Real Sociedad sporting director Roberto Olabe, now at Aston Villa, told The Athletic in November 2021.

Alonso's charges over three years with Real Sociedad's reserves included future first-teamers Ander Barrenetxea, Benat Turrientes and Martin Zubimendi, who is now with Arsenal and a regular in Spain's midfield.

“We had a pretty strong relationship,” Zubimendi told El Pais in 2023. “He came in with a very clear idea which suited me a lot, I learned so much from him. He spent more time with me than others, because he wanted someone in that position who could do the things he liked to do.”

Next, Alonso moved to Leverkusen in October 2022. He came into a squad where spirits and confidence were low, with the team second-bottom in the Bundesliga, but quickly reorganised and revitalised the team as they finished sixth and qualified for Europe.

The following season, they pulled off the tremendous achievement of overcoming Bayern Munich's 12-year monopoly to win the Bundesliga title. They also won the German Cup and reached the Europa League final but lost to Atalanta — their only defeat in 53 games over a remarkable 2023-24. It was clear that Alonso built a strong relationship with his players.

“What I care about in a manager, and all the managers I've had, is how they are, how they treat people,” Lukas Hradecky, Bayer Leverkusen and Finland goalkeeper, told the Bundesliga website in April 2024.

“Xabi is phenomenal in that sense — he brings the right mentality day-to-day, and how he treats the players that aren't playing that much, as well as the ones that are; he takes them as they are.”

Such a close relationship with his players did not mean that Alonso was not strict about what he wanted from them,  however, as Leverkusen left-back Alex Grimaldo told The Athletic in March that year.

“Xabi is very demanding, but with respect,” Grimaldo said. “If you misplace a pass at training, he says: ‘Come on, come on, you can't make that mistake'. That motivates you and I love it. I have experience and I'm relaxed about (being corrected). I like to see how he also encourages the younger players. I'd have loved to have a coach like him when I was 20 years old.”

When Alonso arrived at Madrid in May this year, there was a lot of interest in whether he would be able to transfer the methods that served him so well in his past jobs, given the different challenges involved when dealing with a dressing room full of superstar talents and egos.

In his first six months in the job, Alonso has looked to implement a lot of what worked for him previously. Training sessions now feature a lot of thorough tactical work, both individual and collective. Players are given detailed videos to study what is expected of them during games.

In response to a feeling that standards had dropped towards the end of Ancelotti's four years in charge, the new boss has also imposed further sharpness and discipline around training — including players having to drop for press-ups if they did not react quickly enough during drills during the Club World Cup.

Speaking to The Athletic in July, a source close to a squad member wondered whether such intensity and specific instruction would be “sustainable” over the long term, and whether established players would have the “humility” to accept Alonso's ideas.

The evidence has been mixed so far. Vinicius Junior is among the players to feel that Alonso does not show him the respect he feels his career achievements merit — with the Brazilian very publicly displaying disappointment at being substituted in the recent Clasico against Barcelona, and then pointedly excluding his coach from an otherwise wide-ranging apology.

Another to show discomfort at Alonso's management is Federico Valverde, who has spoken publicly about his frustrations at not being able to show his best form in the team's new midfield setup, and his dissatisfaction at playing right-back, where Alonso has been using him because of injuries to Dani Carvajal and Trent Alexander-Arnold.

Others in the dressing room are enjoying Alonso's regime much more — with Kylian Mbappe, Arda Guler, Aurelien Tchouameni, Eder Militao and Alvaro Carreras among those thriving under his management.

During his 18-year career, Alonso played under many of the top managers of the past two decades — including Ancelotti, Vicente del Bosque, Pep Guardiola, Jose Mourinho and Rafa Benitez — who all had different ways of working.

At his Bernabeu presentation in late May, Alonso paid tribute to Ancelotti's influence on the squad he was inheriting. He also said he had learned a lot from all his past coaches but added: “You need to have your own ideas and your own personality.”

Following the situation closely is ex-Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher, who told The Athletic that it looks like his former Anfield team-mate Alonso is closer to Guardiola and Mourinho than Ancelotti or Del Bosque.

“Real Madrid fascinate me,” Carragher said. “They have had problems with managers who have tried to come in and say, ‘This is what I want to do'. It looks like Xabi is that type of manager, it's his personality. It'll be really interesting to see if his way can work.

“The greatest success they have had has been with managers like Ancelotti and Del Bosque, who are not seen as stuck to a certain system or formation or philosophy. They are seen as getting the best players on the pitch, keeping them happy, letting them do their stuff and police themselves. They're different to a Pep (Guardiola) or a Jose (Mourinho), who have their way, and they get the players to fit into that.”

During his time as a player at Liverpool, Alonso and then-manager Benitez did not have the warmest relationship, leading to his transfer to Real Madrid in 2009, a situation which Carragher now says was “daft” and could have been resolved better by both parties.

Benitez is among those coaches who look to control many details, an approach that did not work out well for him in a six-month spell at Madrid that ended in January 2016.

Asked by The Athletic whether Alonso the player liked to be told what to do out on the pitch, Carragher reflected that most managers at most clubs want to monitor their players closely, but then Madrid are not most clubs.

“Xabi was not a player who needed the manager to tell him what to do,” Carragher said. “But he did like the team to have structure and organisation, on and off the pitch, and he felt that was the best way to get the best out of any football team.

“That would be the case with most people in football. From the outside, Real Madrid is a little bit different on that score.”

With midfielder injured, we'll soon find out","https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/46832321/barcelona-pedri-spain-injury-analysis-laliga-world-cup-qualifying-graham-hunter","Tue, 04 Nov 2025 11:02:37 GMT","

Marcus Rashford reveals which Barcelona players have impressed him since joining the club. (1:48)

Pedri's injury absence could hardly have come at a worse time for Barcelona or Spain. However, for everyone who's been arguing that Barça and the reigning European champions are far too dependent on their little midfield genius, it's come at the perfect time to test the contenders to his throne. It's also a great moment to examine how coaches Hansi Flick and Luis De La Fuente try to cope in the coming weeks while Pedri recovers from a thigh injury.

Here are the stark facts: Barcelona are five points behind LaLiga leaders Real Madrid and outside the Champions League top eight -- which means they'd have to enter the playoff round if they are still there at the end of the league phase -- but need to play Celta Vigo, Real Betis, Club Brugge and FIFA Club World Cup champions Chelsea away from home without their best player this season. In fact, he's arguably been Europe's best midfielder this season.

Spain, for whom Pedri has been man of the match in each of their last two wins, need good results away against Georgia and at home to Turkey to ensure they win Group E and qualify directly for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. A draw (or defeat) in Tbilisi with Turkey winning their last two fixtures, including against Spain in Seville later this month, would leave La Roja second in the group and needing to sweat it next March against other runners-up.

Unlikely? Yes, but more likely without Pedri.

- Yamal paid Clásico price for outburst, but others let him down
- Barça's Yamal the youngest named to FIFPRO World XI
- Flick asks Rashford to make more from chances

If you've been watching the darting, daring, delightful Canary Islander who turns 23 in a couple of weeks, then you'll already be nodding in agreement. He's a special footballer; a problem-solver, an unpicker of midfields. The ball loves him so much, it seeks him out. Pedri is a man of solutions, a player tailor-made to complement forwards who crave being given the ball in advantageous situations. He's a cool drink in the desert.

With Pedri dictating things in midfield in their first two home games of the season, they had 71% possession of the ball in the 3-0 win against Getafe and in the 6-0 over Valencia -- their biggest win this season -- the stat was 72%. But that was the norm. Even in defeat away to a superior Madrid in the Clásico, Flick's team had the ball nearly 69% of the time at the Bernabéu. It partly explains why a more threatening, competitive, quicker Madrid only scored twice instead of the six or seven they threatened to. After all, you need the ball, even if not extravagant amounts of it, to score when you're outplaying your rivals.

With Pedri absent at the weekend for the home game against newly promoted Elche, Spain's champions ""lost"" the possession battle, 49% to 51%. A really dramatic drop-off; Elche used that ball gain not only to score, but to hit the woodwork twice, although they still lost 3-1 (stream a replay on ESPN+ in the U.S.). Elche's own match report on their official website even said: ""Pedri's absence obliged Frenkie De Jong to 'multiply himself' and when he tired in the final third of the match, Barcelona weren't able to keep the ball, threaten us or play consistently."" Their rivals know.

LaLiga lists Pedri as the guy who's made most passes (893) this season even after missing 90 minutes on Sunday. Football publication Marca list him as the third-best in LaLiga at ""recuperating"" possession (behind Álvaro Carreras and Luis Milla, who've each played a game more) with 65 successes. And in Europe, UEFA's Champions League stats show that Pedri is just outside the top five midfielders for successful/accurate/completed passes this season (193), but that he's got a higher pass accuracy (94.3%) than each of the players who have completed a higher number of passes than him. It means that they've been on the pitch more and passed the ball more but, pound-for-pound, Pedri is still the most successful and accurate of any Champions League midfielder this season.

Those who care about Barcelona will wince at the memory of Xavi's last season in charge, and how they tried defending their LaLiga title without Pedri. The midfielder had three long injury absences during the 2023-24 season, costing him 131 days and 25 matches for club and country. Barcelona lost both Clásicos that year -- one when he was out injured and the other when he was just back but nowhere near fully match-fit.

Indeed, the number of points surrendered when Pedri was either absent or returned to play minor minutes match, exactly, the margin by which Carlo Ancelotti's Madrid won the title (10). And just to tie a ribbon on all this, the only two matches De La Fuente has lost as Spain coach in 90 minutes (a Euro 2024 qualifier in Scotland and a friendly against Colombia) both took place when Pedri was out injured.

Coincidences? Judge for yourselves.

While Pedri recovers, the natural new partner for De Jong is Marc Casadó. You remember him? He had utterly brilliant assists for Robert Lewandowski and Raphinha against Real Madrid and Bayern Munich at this stage last season -- plus a five-star, man-of-the-match performance on his full debut for Spain in a 3-2 win against Switzerland in Tenerife.

The 22-year-old Catalan is different from the sorcerer to whom he is apprentice. He tends to play as a deeper-lying midfielder -- someone who's on the ball less often, but is more dedicated to defensive organisation. He's clever in the speed of his distribution, and a Tasmanian devil of a tackler. All-round, Casadó is fun to watch and a fanatical fan of the club he plays for.

When picked in the XI, Casadó will liberate De Jong -- or Dani Olmo, Fermín López or Marc Bernal, all of whom can play No. 8 in the midfield double pivot -- to surge forward, break lines and associate with the strikers. It's a big opportunity. one for which he's yearned, and one for which he needed the help of a sports psychologist in order to wait patiently.

Casadó told Mundo Deportivo: ""I'm very ambitious, and that can sometimes backfire. You get frustrated and nervous when playing opportunities don't come to you. My family and friends calm me a lot, and finding a sports psychologist helped when I was working my hardest, but not getting game time. That frustrated me quite a lot.

""In my head, I kept telling myself that if I wasn't getting the opportunity, it was because I wasn't really giving it my all. So frustrating to know that I was giving it my all, but at the same time, to hear the subconscious voice that I could give more!

""Working with professionals helped me stay calmer because not everything depends on you. You can be giving your best, and the coach doesn't trust you, doesn't use you. You have to stay calm in your work and keep doing the same thing.""

I'll bow to no one in my view that while Pedri's a whole different creative force and, on his day, the best midfielder in the world, Casadó is genuinely exceptional. Smart, quick, tough, talented and competitive -- so many clubs would bite Barcelona's hand off to have him.

Whether there's enough time for Casadó to oust others in the Spain national team depends on how fit and available legends like Fabián Ruiz and Rodri are, having suffered difficulties in the last few months. Mikel Merino and Martín Zubimendi would be ahead in the queue too, with Olmo and Fermín (now fit) firm De La Fuente favourites.

Opportunity beckons for individuals, but there is also a heightened level of uncertainty for Barcelona and Spain. It's time for club and country to demonstrate that despite appearances to the contrary, they don't suffer with dependency on Pedri at all.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Women's World Cup

 Sebastien Bozon/AFP via Getty Images

England will face defending champions Spain in their UEFA Women's World Cup qualifying group.

The draw on Tuesday placed the pair in League A's Group 3 alongside Iceland and Ukraine, as, despite being European champions, England's Nations League placing meant they were not in Pot 1 — the top-seeded teams for the draw.

Advertisement

Qualifying will start next year for the 32-team tournament in 2027. Brazil will host the World Cup for the first time in 2027, becoming the first South American nation to do so after nine previous editions.

If they qualify, England will travel to South America hoping to become the sixth nation to win the tournament. The World Cup has eluded them so far, having lost out to Spain in the 2023 final. They then beat Spain in the European Championship final this summer, retaining their title after victory over Germany three years earlier.

Being in League A means that England cannot be knocked out in the first phase of qualifying and will be entered into the play-off phase if they do not win their group. If they come last in their group, however, they will get relegated from the top tier of the Nations League and find themselves in League B.

Analysis by football tactics writer Michael Cox

The entire point of the new format for Women's World Cup qualifying in Europe — essentially a continuation of the Nations League rather than a standalone process — is to throw together bigger nations for matches that are worth watching, rather than putting world giants against minnows.

And, at this point, Spain vs England is clearly the biggest match around. The two sides that contested both the Women's World Cup final in 2023, with Spain winning 1-0, and the Euro 2025 final, with England winning on penalties after a 1-1 draw, will face one another once again. They have also faced one another on two other occasions this year in the Nations League, a 1-0 England win at Wembley and a 2-1 Spain victory in Barcelona.

The important caveat here is that both sides will almost certainly qualify, eventually. The four-team group also features Ukraine and Iceland, and while one side qualifies automatically, the other three in this top tier of European qualification will all be guaranteed a play-off place, seeded according to their final place in the group. Whoever finishes second out of England and Spain will still have a very favourable path to Brazil.

While more matches between strong nations makes the process more exciting, some of these fixtures are starting to feel repetitive. Sweden, Italy and Denmark have been drawn in the same group for both the Nations League earlier this year and now the World Cup qualification process — with Wales before and Serbia now. Still, it is a better situation than the mismatches in the qualification process for 2023, which included England defeating Latvia 20-0.

League A:

League B

League C

The league-phase matchdays will take place across three international windows from February and June 2026.

The UEFA play-off phase will then take place across October-December 2026, before the last-chance inter-confederation play-offs take place in February 2027.

Qualifying is split into two stages, the league phase and the play-off phase. Out of the three leagues (A, B, C), only teams from League A are able to qualify from the league phase, if they win their group after home and away fixtures.

The remaining teams from the top league and nations from the lower leagues will compete for the remaining seven direct qualifying places in the play-off phase, with one team able to qualify for the inter-confederation play-offs in 2027.

There are two paths in the play-off phase, the winners of which will face each other in eight ties. The best-ranked seven of the tie winners, according to their league rankings, will qualify directly for the World Cup while the remaining winner will qualify for the inter-confederation play-offs.

Path One: Teams finishing second and third in League A groups will play the six group winners and two best-ranked runners-up in League C.

Path Two: The fourth-placed League A teams and four League B group winners will be drawn into eight ties against the teams finishing second and third in the League B groups.

The tournament will start on June 24, 2027, with the final just over a month later on July 25.

Reigning World Cup holders Spain and two-time European champions England have been drawn together in the same group of the European Qualifiers. See the full draw results here.

The draw for the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup European Qualifiers saw reigning champions Spain and beaten finalists England paired together in the group stage.

In one of the standout outcomes, holders Spain and two-time European champions England will go head-to-head in League A Group A3, which also features Iceland and Ukraine, after the draw was made in Nyon, Switzerland, today (Tuesday, 4 November)

The league phase for nations in Europe will be played across six matchdays between March and June 2026, with the four League A group winners qualifying directly for the finals in Brazil in two years, and additional spots determined through a two-round play-off system, with one additional berth available through the inter-confederation play-offs.

Europe has been allocated 11 direct qualification spots for the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup, with one additional potential place via the inter-confederation play-offs.

The UEFA Women's European Qualifiers are divided into three leagues — A, B, and C — based on Nations League rankings.

League A features 16 top-ranked teams split into four groups of four. Each team plays home and away, with the four group winners qualifying directly for the World Cup. All remaining League A teams proceed to the play-offs.

League B (teams ranked 17–32) and League C (teams ranked 33–53) provide additional routes to qualification. The League B winners, runners-up and third-place teams, and League C group winners plus the two best runners-up, all advance to the two-round play-off stage held between October and December 2026.

The seven best-ranked Round 2 play-off winners qualify for the World Cup, while one additional Round 2 winner goes on to the inter-confederation play-offs for a final berth in Brazil.

Promotion and relegation between the leagues will also shape seeding for the next UEFA Women's Nations League cycle (2027–29).

The headline result from the draw can obviously be found in group A3, where old rivals England and Spain meet once again.

England enter the campaign as reigning European champions, having defended their continental title under Sarina Wiegman in 2025. Spain, meanwhile, arrive as current world champions, still riding the momentum from their triumph at the 2023 World Cup and recent Nations League success. Their meeting in Group A3 sets up a high-profile rematch between two sides who have dominated the international stage in recent years — Spain defeating England in the 2023 World Cup final, before the Lionesses edged a dramatic shootout victory over La Roja in the 2025 UEFA Women's EURO final.

Real Madrid decide to sell attacker after latest controversy as 'friend' Florentino Perez turns against him","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/vinicius-jr-gone-too-far-real-madrid-decide-sell-attacker-controversy-friend-florentino-perez-turns-against-him/bltf30bae3b61fcedf5","Tue, 04 Nov 2025 15:18:16 GMT","

Real Madrid have reportedly decided to sell their forward Vinicius Junior following his outburst during El Clasico against Barcelona, marking a major shift in president Florentino Perez's stance on one of the club's biggest stars. The fallout with coach Xabi Alonso, coupled with repeated controversies, has pushed the Spanish giants to plan for a 2026 exit.

Madrid are preparing to part ways with Vinicius after the Brazilian's latest controversy reignited tensions inside the club. According to Sport Bild, the decision was made after the forward's emotional reaction during Real Madrid's 2-1 win over Barcelona in late October, when he angrily protested being substituted by Alonso. The club, insisting on discipline, demanded both a public and private apology.

What worsened the situation was the timing of an article in The Athletic, published the same day as Vinicius' apology, which criticised Alonso's leadership and discipline. The piece quoted an anonymous source close to the team saying that Alonso “thinks he's Pep Guardiola, but so far he's just Xabi.” The report, allegedly connected to the Vinicius camp, angered the club hierarchy.

For years, Florentino Perez has stood by Vinicius, seeing him as a long-term cornerstone for Madrid's future. But this time, the president's patience appears to have run out. After numerous off-field issues and flamboyant behaviour, the relationship between player and club is reportedly beyond repair.

The once-strong bond between Vinicius and club president Perez has cooled dramatically, known for defending his star players publicly, the president now seems intent on showing that ""none of his players are bigger than the club.""

The breaking point reportedly came when the 25-year-old disobeyed team instructions in the 4-0 victory over Valencia, insisting on taking a penalty meant for Kylian Mbappe, and missing it. Alonso admitted later that ""that bothered me”, before substituting the winger once again. For Perez, the repeated defiance and lack of discipline sent a clear message that it was time for decisive action.

Internally, the Spanish club agree that Vinicius will be sold in the summer of 2026, despite that, Madrid are reportedly still planning to extend Vinicius' contract temporarily to maintain his market value. The club fears further misconduct could drive down his worth in the transfer market. The extension, therefore, is a strategic move to safeguard a potential €150 million sale.

Speculation over replacements has already begun and Erling Haaland is viewed as the dream signing if Vinicius departs. The Norwegian forward has continued his prolific form this season, netting 17 goals in just 13 appearances across all competitions. His contribution has been crucial in City's recent upturn in form, with Pep Guardiola's men climbing to second in the Premier League after winning four of their last five games.

The striker, who penned a new long-term deal earlier this year, is said to be keen on securing more major trophies, especially the Champions League, and reports suggest a release clause in his contract could facilitate an exit.

According to journalist Jorge Picon, Haaland's interest in Real Madrid is genuine and longstanding. Speaking to El Desmarque, he said Haaland ""would very much like to play for Real Madrid"" and that an unknown release clause may boost his hopes of making the switch to the Spanish capital. The prospect of such a deal going through may be intertwined with that of Vinicius.

Madrid have long admired Haaland and are reportedly keeping close tabs on any developments at City. Should Vinicius's renewal talks stall, the door could open for the reigning European champions to pursue the Premier League's most lethal finisher.

While Vinicius' future appears increasingly uncertain, head coach Alonso has handled the situation with restraint. Despite the clear tension, both sides have since met to resolve their differences. Spanish media reported that Vinicius apologised to Alonso and the team, and the coach has since reintegrated him into the squad, aiming to preserve stability during the club's title challenge.

However, Alonso's trust remains fractured, the coach, known for his strict discipline and tactical precision, values harmony and commitment. The leaked criticism comparing him to Guardiola, allegedly from Vinicius' entourage, has made the situation difficult to overlook. Alonso has chosen to focus publicly on football, knowing that any escalation could disrupt Real's excellent form this season.

Real Madrid currently top La Liga with 30 points and have lost just once all campaign. Vinicius remains an integral part of their attack, but Alonso's tactical evolution and the arrival of Mbappe's true form have made his role less central than in previous seasons, further fueling frustration on the Brazilian's part.

For now, Vini continues to play an active role as Real Madrid chase domestic and European glory. Yet, the relationship between player, coach, and president remains strained beneath the surface. The Brazilian forward may finish the season, but the decision from the club's top hierarchy suggests an inevitable separation down the road.

Madrid's upcoming fixtures, including their Champions League clash against Liverpool at Anfield on Tuesday, will test not just their form, but their unity. The dressing room will need stability as Alonso balances success with discipline.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Spain manager Luis de la Fuente has played down concerns about a potential rift between Lamine Yamal and Dani Carvajal after their heated exchange following El Clasico. The Roja boss insists there is “no strange behaviour” in the squad and confirmed he has spoken to the Barcelona and Real Madrid players, stressing unity ahead of Spain's upcoming World Cup qualifiers.

Spain head coach De la Fuente has dismissed concerns of tension between Yamal and Carvajal following their on-field confrontation at the end of Clasico between Madrid and Barca. The incident occurred after Madrid's win at the Bernabeu, where Carvajal was seen confronting the teenage winger for comments he made in Gerard Pique's Kings League ahead of the clash.

Los Blancos' captain, appeared to tell Yamal that he “talks too much”, sparking a brief but highly public exchange between the pair. Given both players' crucial roles in Spain's setup, the altercation prompted questions about whether club rivalries might affect the national team's harmony.

However, De la Fuente quickly moved to downplay the matter during an appearance on the Resonancia de Corazon podcast. “There has never been any incident, no strange behaviour from anyone,” he insisted. “Because of a school fight? No, there is no school fight. Really, there is no fight. The feeling within the group is one of family and union.”

De la Fuente confirmed that he has spoken directly to both Yamal and Carvajal following the altercation but reiterated that there was no lasting issue. “I have spoken a lot with Lamine, as well as with Dani Carvajal,” he explained, confirming that both players had been addressed privately after the Clasico. When asked directly if he had spoken with Carvajal, De la Fuente simply replied: “Yes, I spoke with Dani.”

The Spanish coach was firm in maintaining that the matter should now rest with the players' clubs, signalling his intention to keep the national team's focus on collective goals rather than off-field controversy.

By taking this stance, De la Fuente made clear that he expects professionalism and maturity from his players, especially given the high stakes of Spain's upcoming international fixtures. His remarks also reflect his ongoing commitment to ensuring the national team remains unaffected by domestic rivalries, no matter how intense they may become.

The 63-year-old tactician repeatedly returned to one theme during the interview, unity. “In addition, the feeling within the group is of family, of union. The common good is prioritized over the individual, and that says a lot about this group of players,” he said.

To illustrate his point, De la Fuente recalled a memorable moment from Euro 2024, when Yamal assisted Carvajal for a crucial goal before the pair embraced in celebration. “I'll always remember the image from the Euros, Lamine's cross, Carvajal's finish, the hug they shared, their expressions... that's what happens in the national team,” he explained. “I am totally convinced that the only interest here is the general interest.”

De la Fuente's words carry weight not just because of his authority but because of his insistence on fostering a collective spirit within the squad. By framing his team as a “family”, he sends a clear message to both players and fans that Spain's ambitions come before any personal rivalries or egos.

Carvajal, who recently underwent knee surgery, will not feature in Spain's upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Georgia and Turkey. Yamal, however, is expected to be called up despite nursing a mild pubalgia issue that has limited his recent minutes for Barcelona.

Yamal's rise to prominence has been meteoric and at just 18, he has already become one of Spain's brightest attacking talents and a cornerstone of the post-Euro 2024 rebuild. Meanwhile, Carvajal remains a respected veteran and leader, a role that requires careful balance between rivalry and responsibility.

As Spain look ahead to their qualifying campaign, De la Fuente's management of personalities and locker-room dynamics could prove vital. With tensions between Barcelona and Madrid stars always simmering beneath the surface, his public show of calm and confidence suggests a manager determined to maintain unity at all costs.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Cristiano Ronaldo admits he plans to retire 'soon' & opens up on future after football as hopes of Man Utd return are dashed","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/cristiano-ronaldo-plans-retire-soon-future-football-man-utd-return/blt533e99d1657554f9","Tue, 04 Nov 2025 18:32:03 GMT","

Cristiano Ronaldo has revealed in a new interview with Piers Morgan that he doesn't expect to extend his history-making football career for that much longer, also admitting that his interests in retirement will ultimately lie outside the sport he has dedicated his life to. It comes after the Portuguese icon had been billed as ""perfect"" for a role upstairs at former club Manchester United.

Having chosen Piers Morgan for an incendiary interview marking his exit from Manchester United in 2022, Ronaldo again linked up with the divisive media personality, this time on YouTube channel Piers Morgan Uncensored.

The 40-year-old forward, who has a contract with Al-Nassr in the Saudi Pro League until the end of the 2026-27 season, was asked outright about eventual retirement. ""Soon,"" Ronaldo replied, revealing he has been thinking about how it will go for years. ""I think I will be prepared. It will be tough, of course. Will be difficult, yes. Probably I will cry, yes…

""It will be very, very difficult but I've prepared my future since [I was] 25, 26, 27 years old. So I think I will be capable to support that pressure.""

There will be lots of calls for Ronaldo to stay in football when he eventually does hang up his boots, with a wealth of expertise and experience to share. But coaching, management or executive roles within the sport don't appear to appeal to the five-time Ballon d'Or winner.

""Nothing will compare to the adrenaline we have for football to score a goal,"" Ronaldo explained, revealing that retiring from football will finally give him the time to pursue other things.

""But I have other passions. [When I retire] I'm going to have more time for me, have more time for my family, to raise my kids. I want to be more a family person, more present. Also, to have my own hobbies. I like to see UFC, the fights. I like padel. I like and I want to learn more about my companies.

""I'll never be a [full-time] YouTuber, of course, but I want to be there. I'm going to spend more time on that to learn. I think I'm going to do funny things and things I'm not used to doing before. Because I live football 24 hours [each day] to do the right things and perform.""

Ronaldo's desire to do things with his life other than football suggests leaving the sport altogether, which means recent speculation that he could consider a post-playing career in the boardroom, potentially even back at Manchester United, is quite unlikely to come to fruition.

Former team-mate Wes Brown, who won the Champions League alongside Ronaldo in 2008, had said he wouldn't put it past Ronaldo to remain involved in football that way. ""He could definitely move into the boardroom,"" Brown said. ""He's got the ability to swerve away from coaching and into the executive level, 100 per cent. Why not? If he's enjoying it, it'll be perfect for him.""

Ronaldo probably isn't going to call time on his career before the end of his Al-Nassr contract. Aside from it being incredibly lucrative – worth a reported €257m (£235m/$280m) per year – the veteran forward is still freely scoring for the club and continues to chase trophies.

The lack of a major domestic or international trophy since moving to Saudi Arabia – the 2023 Arab Club Champions Cup is the only silverware so far – is a notable blot on Ronaldo's record. Al-Nassr have seen both Al-Ittihad and Al-Hilal win the Pro League in recent seasons, while the King's Cup and wider continental success has also been beyond them.

So far in 2025-26, though, Al-Nassr lead the way in the domestic table with a 100 per cent record after seven games. They are only competing in the secondary AFC club competitions this season, but could feasibly be back in the Champions League Elite next year - potentially Ronaldo's last dance in football.

Next summer also comes Ronaldo's last crack at the World Cup with Portugal.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

28 times F1 drivers made incredible saves

F1 drivers guess the circuit, but they can only see the steering wheel!

With the Drivers' Championship continuing to hot up, as well as various battles in the Teams' Championship, here are the big stories ahead of the 2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix.

Following a change in championship leader with just four rounds still to run, there are now just 36 points separating the three title contenders. Heading into the final standalone race of the season, the pressure is only growing on multiple fronts, with an often-dramatic trip to Interlagos on the horizon.

Lando Norris held the championship lead for the first four rounds of this season, but in Saudi Arabia he was usurped by team mate Oscar Piastri. The Australian led the way heading into the following 15 rounds, but Norris' victory in Mexico saw him regain top spot by a solitary point.

The gap between the two McLaren drivers had grown to as much as 34 points after Norris' retirement from the Dutch Grand Prix, but he has outscored Piastri at every race since that point to put himself in prime position with four rounds to go.

Not only is it important to remember just how slender the advantage is, but it is also significant in the way it marks a different dynamic between the McLaren pair. No longer is Norris the one doing the chasing – having said after Zandvoort that “it's almost a big enough gap now that I can just chill out about it and just go for it” – but instead he has moved into the role of being chased by everyone.

For Piastri, the past two race weekends have been particularly tough, as he has struggled to match Norris' pace and has had to adapt his driving style, but the initial feedback from McLaren Team Principal Andrea Stella was that progress had been made in Mexico City. How Piastri builds on that, and how Norris handles the focus of being the championship leader, will be fascinating.

As tough as the Mexico City Grand Prix was for Red Bull and Max Verstappen, the defending champion actually managed to close the gap to the championship lead.

Verstappen arrived in Mexico off the back of three wins and two second places in the past five rounds, and had rapidly reduced Piastri's advantage to just 40 points. As the weekend unfolded at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, it became clear Verstappen did not have the pace to challenge for victory, but he was able to salvage a podium that further outscored Piastri, and leaves him 36 points adrift of Norris.

A year ago, the roles were somewhat reversed, as Norris was the one hunting down Verstappen, sitting 47 points back of the championship leader arriving at Interlagos.

After cutting that gap to 44 points after the Sprint, Norris started on pole with Verstappen in 17th due to a grid penalty, but a remarkable performance in the wet saw the Dutchman climb through the field to win. With Norris finishing sixth, the gap was extended to 62 points with three rounds remaining, and Verstappen was able to clinch the championship at the next round.

Although the gaps are smaller this year, it shows how one result can totally change the complexion of the championship picture at this stage of the season, and Verstappen will be keen to ensure he at least stays in the frame heading to Las Vegas to kick-off the final triple header.

Although a lot of the focus is on what is happening at the top of the Drivers' Championship, there are some thrilling battles ongoing when it comes to the Teams' standings.

Second place is currently occupied by Ferrari, but like Norris in the Drivers' standings, they are just one point ahead of the next team, with Mercedes sitting in third place. Red Bull are also right in the mix, with double points in three of the last six races allowing them to stay just 10 points back of Ferrari.

The fluctuating form between the front-running teams makes it tough to predict who will come out on top, although Red Bull will likely need some more wins from Verstappen to have a chance of moving further up the order.

While Williams appear relatively secure in fifth place overall, behind them there is another tense fight for sixth. Racing Bulls currently occupy sixth position on 72 points, but Aston Martin (69), Haas (62) and Sauber (60) are all very much in contention, following a big result for Haas in Mexico.

A year ago, Alpine secured a shock double podium to move from eighth to sixth in one go, so there's history of Interlagos offering up opportunities for significant scores.

The 2025 silly season has been far less dramatic than a year ago, but as we enter November there are still quite a few unknowns when it comes to who will be driving where next season.

The majority of those questions relate to the Red Bull driver line-up, across both Red Bull Racing and Racing Bulls.

Verstappen is secure at Red Bull, but the identity of his team mate remains unknown. Yuki Tsunoda currently holds the seat, but Isack Hadjar has been linked with a promotion, and with Arvid Lindblad pushing for a Racing Bulls chance, it could become a straight fight between Tsunoda and Liam Lawson for the remaining position.

Alpine have also yet to finalise their line-up for next year, with Franco Colapinto trying to retain his seat alongside Pierre Gasly. Colapinto will receive significant support from fans in South America during the Sao Paulo Grand Prix weekend, and it could mark a good time to confirm his future if he is to stay put.

Aside from the final results, if there is one thing that stands out when thinking back to last year's race, it is the weather.

The Sprint means there are an extra eight points on offer on the Saturday, and a year ago that race was followed by heavy rain and thunderstorms that pushed Qualifying back to early on Sunday morning. The race itself was also wet, providing the ingredients for a classic drive from Verstappen as he went from 17th on the grid to victory.

The long-term forecast suggests there could be rain and thunderstorms again during the race weekend, and that always opens up the opportunity for some unexpected results. But whatever the weather, the iconic Interlagos circuit and the passionate Brazilian fans often combine for a special race that could prove pivotal when it comes to the championship.

The adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' novel comes from Ryan Murphy Productions.


							By 

	Rick Porter


Television Business Editor


FX and Ryan Murphy Productions' drama series The Shards is adding to its cast.


	Jordan Roth, a Tony Award-winning producer, will have a recurring role in the series, an adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' novel of the same name. Details of Roth's role are being kept quiet for now. 




	Roth — who has produced Kinky Boots, Hadestown, Moulin Rouge!, and the 2021 revival of Company on Broadway, among numerous other shows — joins a cast that also features Kaia Gerber, Igby Rigney, Homer Gere, Wes Bentley, Graham Campbell and Hayes Warner.

	Ellis' novel is set in the early 1980s and contains some autobiographical elements from the author's life. It centers on Bret (Rigney), a student at an elite L.A. prep school whose world is upended by the arrival of a mysterious new student, Robert Mallory (Gere), which coincides with the murders of a serial killer.


	Ellis released The Shards as a serialized audiobook via his podcast in 2020-21, with a print version published in 2023. A different series project based on the novel had been set up at HBO but didn't make it out of development. As The Hollywood Reporter noted in February, he began talks with Ellis to develop the project under his Ryan Murphy Television, which is based at 20th TV (the latter will produce the FX show). FX gave the show a series order in July.

	











	Murphy executive produces The Shards with Ellis, Nick Hall, Kathleen McCaffrey, Brian Young and director Max Winkler.


	Roth is the creative director of ATG Entertainment and was president of Jujamcyn Theaters for 15 years prior to the two companies combining operations in 2023. He's also known for his collaborations with fashion designers (frequently showcased on his social media pages) and earlier this year debuted a performance piece titled “Radical Acts of Unrelenting Beauty” at the Louvre. He is repped by UTA and attorney Jordan Manekin.

Her Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran World Tour is the highest-grossing Latin tour ever by a woman.


													By
												

	Jessica Roiz


Assistant Editor, Latin


Shakira received the inaugural Billboard Global Touring Icon Award in honor of her historic Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran World Tour, and as part of the 2025 Billboard Live Music Summit held Monday (Nov. 3) in West Hollywood, California.


	“As your longtime tour manager, I am so proud and truly honored to present the first annual Billboard global icon tour award to you,” said tour director Marty Hom, who's also worked for Fleetwood Mac, Barbra Streisand and The Rolling Stones, among others. “We get to witness every day how hard you work to do the best show possible for all your fans.” 

	











	Shakira, who received the news backstage during the rehearsals of her recent show in Cali, Colombia, dedicated the award to her entire team, including dancers, band and crew, for “working as hard as I do,” she noted.


	The Live Nation-produced tour's first 64 dates (of 82) grossed $327.4 million and sold 2.5 million tickets, according to Billboard Boxscore, converting Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran into the highest grossing Latin tour ever by a woman and the second highest grossing Latin tour ever (behind only Luis Miguel's 2023-24 outing, which grossed $409.5 million).




	Additionally, the Colombian artist sold 65,000 tickets per night during her historic 12-concert run at Mexico City's Estadio GNP Seguros (formerly known as Foro Sol), according to promoter OCESA, for a total of 780,000 tickets sold.


	“It's encouraging and inspiring,” Shakira said to Hom. “I never thought, not even in my wildest dreams, that I would fill every stadium. It's incredible and motivating at the same time, I feel like I'm just starting my career, and it's crazy because it's been 30 years … This has been the best tour of my life, it's been just as we dreamt it.

The news came days after original drummer Simon Kirke enthused about reuniting with Rodgers at Saturday's (Nov. 8) 2025 event.

	With just days to go before this year's induction ceremony, one of the 2025 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees has sent his regrets. Bad Company singer Paul Rodgers posted a note on the band's socials on Monday (Nov. 3) revealing that his ill health will prevent him from participating.


	Bad Company are slated to be inducted into the Rock Hall this weekend at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles alongside Chubby Checker, Joe Cocker, Cyndi Lauper, OutKast, Soundgarden and The White Stripes in the Performer category and Salt-N-Pepa and Warren Zevon for Musical Influence.

	











	But, just days after the other surviving original member of the English rock supergroup – fellow former Free member drummer Simon Kirke — revealed that the two planned to reunite to play two songs on Saturday, Rodgers said he cannot participate.  


	“My hope was to be at the Rock & Rock Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony and to perform for the fans, but at this time I have to prioritize my health,” Rodgers, 75, said in a statement without providing any additional information on his condition. “I have no problem singing, it's the stress of everything else. Thanks for understanding. Simon along with some outstanding musicians will be stepping in for me – guaranteed to rock.”


	Rodgers, Kirke, late guitarist Mick Ralphs and late bassist Boz Burrell will be inducted this weekend for their roles in the 1970s rock juggernaut whose biggest hits include “Bad Company” and “Can't Get Enough” (1974), “Feel Like Makin' Love” and “Shooting Star” (1975) and “Rock ‘n' Roll Fantasy” (1979) among others.

	











	The group originally split in 1982 and have reunited several times over the years in a variety of configurations to tour and record albums, last performing together in 2019. But in 2023, Kirke said the band was likely done due to a variety of health issues suffered by Rodgers over the past few years, with the singer revealing to CBS Mornings that year that he'd suffered two major strokes — one in 2016 and another in 2019 — as well as 11 minor strokes.


	This year's RRHOF induction ceremony will stream live coast-to-coast on Disney+ Saturday (Nov. 8), at 8 p.m. ET, and will be available to stream following the ceremony. ABC will also air a primetime special with performance highlights and standout moments on Jan. 1, at 8 p.m. ET, available the next day on Hulu.


	This year's event will feature an impressive list of performers and presenters, including: Beck, Brandi Carlile, David Letterman, Doja Cat, Elton John, Flea, Iggy Pop, J.I.D, Killer Mike, Maxwell, Missy Elliott, Olivia Rodrigo, Questlove, RAYE, Sleepy Brown, Taylor Momsen, Teddy Swims and Twenty One Pilots.

	L.A. and Paris-based Vendôme Pictures, producer of Oscar Best Picture winner Coda, has unveiled the cast for previously announced drama Ibelin, based on the true story of disabled Norwegian gamer Mats Steen.


Charlie Plummer (The Long Walk), Graham (Adolescence)), Toni Collette (Little Miss Sunshine), Isabela Merced (The Last of Us), Maisy Stella (My Old Ass) and Anthony Hopkins (The Father) have signed to star.


	Born with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), which gradually saw him lose control of his limbs, Steen connected with the outside world through the gaming world, where he was admired by thousands for his humor, kindness, and courage.

	Behind the screen, he was living with a degenerative muscular disease that slowly took away his body, but never his spirit. At home, his loving family feared he was withdrawing from the world, but they would later discover that quite the opposite was happening.

	The film takes its title from Steen's heroic alter ego ‘Ibelin' in the World of Warcraft online game. 


	The production, which was first announced last year, sees Vendôme Pictures re-team with French mini-major Pathé, its partner on Coda.


	Morten Tyldum, who was previously Oscar-nominated for best director for The Imitation Game in 2015 is directing.


	The screenplay is by BAFTA nominee Ilaria Bernardini (Citadel: Diana) and Oscar nominee Hossein Amini (Drive, The Wings of the Dove) and based on the blog “Musings of Life” which Steen wrote until shortly before his death at the age of 25 in 2014.

	











	Vendôme Pictures' Philippe Rousselet and Fabrice Gianfermi are producing alongside Jérôme Seydoux at Pathé and Tyldum and Guri Neby for Neby-Tyldum AS. Vendôme and Pathé are financing the film.


	Sarah Finn (Everything Everywhere All at Once, Crash) is the casting director and serves as an executive producer.


Black Bear is representing international sales rights and will be introducing to buyers at the upcoming American Film Market.  CAA Media Finance represents the domestic rights.


	Principal photography will take place in Europe in Spring/Summer 2026. 


“Ibelin is a sensational story which will be told by a remarkable group of storytellers, first and foremost, Morten, who has a rare ability to evoke emotions with films like The Imitation Game and epics such as Passengers and Silo,” says Rousselet.


	“We have assembled a formidable cast, and with our frequent collaborators at Pathé, and the team at Black Bear, are confident this will be a film that will resonate with buyers and audiences everywhere.”

					By Damon Wise 

Film Editor, Awards


	Whatever happened to subtext? With regard to the Predator franchise, it seems weird to bring this up so late in the day, after six movies and two Alien tie-ins. But the question that bubbles up right at the very beginning of Predator: Badlands is very simple: what does the idea of the predator even mean anymore? Nearly 40 years ago, the sweaty, jungle-set original riffed on the Vietnam war, pitting Arnold Schwarzenegger and a crack team of paramilitary mercenaries against a formidable army of alien insurgents in Central America. It didn't matter who or what the predators were or where they came from; they were a waking nightmare: monsters from the id, coming to give the USA a kick in the ass.

					'Regretting You' Review: True Love Inevitably Prevails In A Ridiculous Romantic Drama		
			








	In that respect, the predator of Predator had quite a lot in common with the alien of Alien, a similar creature of such pure, ruthless intent that it seemed perfectly logical to pit them against one another in two standalone movies. But to what end? Both creatures have racked up seven movies of their own each, and, of the two, only Alien's xenomorph has — just about — kept its mystery and gravitas, despite Ridley Scott's best efforts in the bizarre attempt at an origins story in Prometheus. The predator, meanwhile, has long since gone the way of James Cameron's Na'vi — its people are the Yautja, and they have their unique codes and customs, plus their very own nonsense language, too.




			Watch on Deadline		







	To be fair, Predator: Badlands puts all this upfront with a title card that tells us the Yautja “are prey to none and friend to none”, which sounds impressive and leads us to a fight between fraternal predators Dek (Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi) and Kwei (Mike Homik). Dek is the weakest link in his warrior family, and the arrival of their father cements that fact; there is no sentimentality here as the elder predator orders Kwei to kill his brother and be done with him. But Kwei fights back, saving Dek's life at the cost of his own. Somewhat at odds with the Yautja's martial smarts, Dek bumbles into a waiting spaceship that takes him off to Genna (AKA “The Death Planet”) with his family's words ringing in whatever he has for ears: “Choose your prey, bring it home — or never return.”

	











	On Genna, Dek meets Thia (Elle Fanning), a Weyland-Yutani android who is missing both of her legs and her sister Tessa (also Elle Fanning). Thia is sassy (which is an acquired taste), upbeat about her missing limbs (“Humans wouldn't last a day on this planet”) and, being part supercomputer, is able to speak fluent Yautja to Dek, who is intent on taking home the scalp of the Kalisk, a fierce creature deemed “unkillable” and about as scary as the Gruffalo. Dek and Thia become an unlikely team, as Thia tracks down her lower body and the cold, calculating Tessa, and, in doing so, uncovers a sinister plot to capture and study extra-terrestrial wildlife, a trope instantly familiar from the Alien universe.  


	Unsurprisingly, nothing much is new here, but the chemistry between the two leads is somewhat refreshing, and Schuster-Koloamatangi in particular brings an unexpected amount of personality to what could have been a simple make-up job. Fanning, too, is quirky and broadly likable and very much at home as a sassy sci-fi lead, even when working from an overly cute script. 


	What's sorely missing, though, is a sense of danger in what is essentially a buddy movie with a lot of FX-heavy set pieces. In its place is a weird kind of family psychotherapy: What Dek and Thia have in common is that they are both outsiders, ostracized by their next of kin, giving the film an unexpected and potentially intriguing find-your-own-tribe vibe. But how can androids be sisters, and so different, and how predatory can a predator be if it's making friends?


	Returning director Dan Trachtenberg is clearly in a groove here, and his enthusiasm helps, notably in the film's impeccable world-building. But the action scenes never seem to galvanize, and somewhere along the line the predator, once a ruthless, unstoppable killing machine, has simply lost its menacing mojo. It all seems a bit, well, silly — like a long episode of Succession starring John Travolta's character in Battlefield Earth, or the adventures of Eric Trump in space — and that surely can't bode well for the inevitable next instalment.

					By Zac Ntim 

International Reporter


	Across his decades-long career, filmmaker Malik Hassan Sayeed has sat for only a handful of feature interviews, which is unrepresentative of both his unique ability to communicate and his openness to sharing stories from his life. 


	Indeed, when I meet Sayeed, we're in London, where he has chosen a quiet restaurant away from the stuffiness of traditional industry hotspots, and we speak, over herbal tea, for multiple hours.


	Sayeed is in town for the London Film Festival, where After The Hunt, his latest feature as a cinematographer, is screening for general audiences and awards voters. A crafty and complex drama with an A-list ensemble, After The Hunt is the exact kind of work we have come to expect from the film's director, Luca Guadagnino. The project also marks Guadagnino's third feature in two years. But After The Hunt is a return to the mainstream for Sayeed, marking the first fiction feature he has shot since Belly (1998), directed by Hype Williams.

	Beyond his work as a cinematographer with Williams, which has been well-documented (if you're unaware, the pair shot many of the most memorable music videos of the 1990s and 2000s, cultivating a visual language that dominated airwaves and has influenced everything since), Sayeed has shot films with Spike Lee, Beyonce, and Michael Jackson, directed Prince, and began his career on the second unit of Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Below, the veteran filmmaker speaks with us in depth about his eclectic career, why he took a two-decade-long hiatus from fiction films, and why Guadagnino was the director who brought him back. The pair have already finished their second collaboration, the Sam Altman feature Artificial. Sayeed also shares memories from his experience working on music videos with legendary artists like Prince and how he approached shooting After The Hunt, which is set in Connecticut, while filming entirely in the UK. 

	











Deadline: Malik, you don't do many interviews. Why? You've had such a unique career. 


MALIK HASSAN SAYEED: I've had terrible experiences. When I did Eyes Wide Shut, I interviewed with Entertainment magazine. They did a piece with me because both Eyes Wide Shut and Belly were coming out the same year. At the time, with Stanley Kubrick, they wanted to make him look like the crazy guy. So when I did the interview, they took my words and contextualized them around him being crazy, when what I really said was that he's a meticulous artist.


	I was praying that he wouldn't see it, but he did. He was irate, and I was devastated. I handwrote him a multi-page letter just explaining how much he meant to me and how my words had been taken out of context. He was extremely appreciative, and the only thing he said to me was, ‘This is why I don't do interviews.' That was triggering and made me realize the importance of owning my words. 


Deadline: I can imagine. People forget how Stanley was spoken about when he was alive. 


SAYEED: And then it happened again when Melina Matsoukas's film, Queen and Slim, came out. The New Yorker was hitting me up, and I was just ghosting them. But Melina asked me to speak with them, so I did, even though I was hesitant. They did the same thing. They took my words out of context again to make it seem like I said Beyoncé was controlling. This was around Lemonade. So, my thing is, you can't mess my words up if they don't have them. 


Deadline: After The Hunt is your first fiction feature since Belly (1998). I was born in ‘97, but that film was still so important for my generation. Why did you step away for so long? What were you doing?


SAYEED: I had a kid. I'm not a good multitasker. I need to focus on one thing at a time, so I sort of stopped working to focus on raising my family. I was also working a lot, directing commercials, which has its own demands that you need to develop. It requires its own kind of focus, so overall, it was beneficial for me to do these short-form projects because they're in and out, while other work can take time. I once did a pilot with Spike…


Deadline: The HBO show? 


SAYEED: Yes, the HBO show with John Boyega. It never came out. The producer was Doug Ellin. Traditionally, if HBO is doing a pilot, they're committing to the show. Ellin had three shows with them, ours, one with Michael Rapaport, and another. They all got killed. We had John Ridley writing and producing, with John Boyega starring, and Spike directing.  So I was away from home for a while working on that. When I got home, it was interesting to see how my daughter reacted. She had put up some boundaries. At that point, I was more deliberate about being precise about the work I did. It had to be worthwhile, and simply nothing presented itself as worthwhile. There had been some things that came, but the synergy also has to be right. 


Deadline: When I heard you were working with Luca, I thought that was so random. But then I remembered hearing him speak passionately about his admiration for the great Haile Gerima, whom you studied under at Howard Film School. 


SAYEED: Yeah, Luca is super sharp and smart. He has very good taste and broad interests, which are really aligned with my own. If you just look at the cinematographers he's worked with, you have Sayombhu Mukdeeprom, Arseni Khachaturan, and Yorick Le Saux, who works with Olivier Assayas. He's making precise choices. So actually, by the time he got to meet, I thought, ‘Wow, this is a bespoke list that I'm excited to be a part of.' 

	











Deadline: The film is set at Yale, but you shot at Cambridge University in the UK, right? 


SAYEED: We shot the whole movie in the UK. It was a six-week shoot. We shot one week at Cambridge, and then the rest was shot on stage at Shepperton. 


Deadline: How did you go about recreating New Haven in England? 


SAYEED: It's all craftsmanship. That's the great thing about years of experience. There are some interiors in the film with exterior light. And some day exteriors. The day exteriors are the quad and the Tandoor New Haven restaurant. We replicated the Tandoor restaurant. We built the whole thing on the studio backlog. I went to the actual restaurant. I spent hours in there, like I did with many of the real locations in the film, with my camera, studying the environment.  


	The film is also set in two time periods. There's 2019 and then the present day. 2019 is a Spring setting, and the present day is Winter with snow. The thing about England is that the weather changes on a dime, so we had to manage that with big construction cranes. 


Deadline: The film's opening shot. It's brilliant. When I was watching, I thought that had to be Malik. It's when Ayo's character is looking at the African statue in Julia Roberts' home. It sets the story up perfectly without saying a word. 


SAYEED: That's all Luca. He didn't mention that shot out loud, but when we set up, that's where he put the camera. Now, what's amazing about that is he dressed that space himself. He took a weekend and dressed the entire space, because it was critical for everything in the rooms to speak to who those people were, including that artifact. Luca had a backstory about Julia's character, working on research in Africa at some point in her life. You also see that in the scene where her husband makes Ethiopian doro wat.


	When I first read the script, Ayo's character was white. Her being Black was a layer Luca added. When casting started, Zendaya was going to play that part, a natural choice coming out of Challengers. And then Ayo was cast. Luca stays present in the moment. You can see it from that opening shot. It wasn't originally in the script, but he stays engaged and alive as a filmmaker. 


Deadline: The house shared by Julia Roberts and Michael Stuhlbarg's characters is lit so specifically. It's all warm light from those funky lamps. It feels like a real affluent space. 


SAYEED: That was the motive. Everything had to feel like it was from the lamps. We had two standing lamps that we used, depending on the framing, because they produced a certain quality of light that is difficult to replicate with film lights. Then we layered that with other lights to create that naturalistic environment. 


	That space represents a lot for the characters. Luca had a whole backstory about that space and how Frederick's [Stuhlbarg] grandparents had come over to the U.S. from Europe to escape the Holocaust. He tracked that journey through several eras of the family, who worked to make sure their kids went to college. They became lawyers and doctors. And then we get to Frederick, the grandchild, who is now a psychotherapist. And then Julia comes and adds her own history to the house. 


Deadline: After over 20 years, was it tough getting back into the saddle for fiction filmmaking? 


SAYEED: The only thing was the rhythm. The best way to describe it is if you're a sprinter, you don't run marathons, but you're still running. Everything is the same. You just adjust to the rhythm of your specific race. Whether you're working on fiction or commercials, you're still doing the same thing. You're looking for the nugget of the scene, meaning the most important thing in the scene. 

	











	When Hype [Williams] and I started doing music videos, we wanted to make the visuals look how the music made you feel. It had nothing to do with the lyrics. We got our 10,000 hours in doing that. We became proficient. My first experience was working on the lighting for the theater. On stage, you're designing the light around the emotion of the scene. And it's even more precise, because you only have lightning, you don't have photography on the stage. 


Deadline: During my research, I saw that you worked with Prince. You directed the music video for The Greatest Romance Ever Sold, one of his most underrated songs. What was that like? 


SAYEED: Prince was amazing. It was his first song or video back since he adopted the symbol moniker. We still couldn't call him Prince yet. I would just start talking to him without saying a name because we didn't know what to call him.


Deadline: Did you shoot After The Hunt on film? 


SAYEED: Yeah, we shot on film. Luca only shoots film. In fact, we worked on a commercial together where we had to fly a drone, and we still used a film camera. I just shot helicopter scenes for our new film with a film camera, and because there aren't many apparatus like gimbals that can handle a film camera, the particular gimbal we used just came off the Christopher Nolan movie and was on its way to Dune, so we had to catch it in time. I hope that film is coming back enough for the business side to support the continued development and innovation of the medium. 


	I know film is becoming increasingly popular with younger people. On the last four or five shoots I've been on, every time I'm on set, I see kids with the film cameras. They're either shooting stills or Super 8. I pray that's where we continue going. It's funny, everybody's worried about AI, but when humans are at their best, AI can't touch us because AI has to feed off of something we've done. I'm more worried about the humans behind AI, blaming AI for some stuff they've done. If we accept mediocrity, yes, AI can recreate mediocrity, but when we reach greatness, AI can't produce that. 


Deadline: Are you planning to work on more projects, or will you take another break? 


SAYEED: If I have another opportunity to be in a working space like After The Hunt, then yes. But you can just never predict that. 


Deadline: You have one project listed on your IMDb titled Compton's Finest. What is that project?


SAYEED: That's with Cle Sloan, a real L.A. legend. We've been doing that project for several years now. It started as a way of trying to understand Compton and why so many successful people come out of that piece of land. What is it about that land? And it just continued to grow into this sprawling project. It's going to be an episodic documentary. The first episode is just about in the can.

Malik is a legend and I'm glad this interview speaks to and about him in that context. Great interview and happy to see him back in the fiction world. His points about AI are valid. We need to stop being afraid of it and start being afraid of mediocrity.

Blow out the Kandles!

Kendall Jenner celebrated her 30th birthday with an extravagant beach bash featuring plenty of tequila and a massive firework display. 

The 818 Tequila founder was joined by her mom, Kris Jenner, and sisters Kim Kardashian, Khloé Kardashian and Kylie Jenner for her seaside soirée Monday night.

Guests at the star-studded fête dressed to the nines in neutral tones, with the birthday girl opting for a pink and beige silk top paired with a cool geometric-print skirt.

Kim, 45, went with a hip-hugging brown leather maxi, Kylie, 28, wore a little black dress, Khloé, 41, stunned in a pink halter gown and the momager, 69, showed off her curves in a sheer zebra-striped number.

The family members posed barefoot in front of a massive silver balloon display that spelled out “Happy Birthday Kendall,” and they also snapped a few fun selfies.

Attendees commemorated Kendall's milestone birthday with shots of her 818 Tequila as well as a bottle of Chateau Haut-Brion French red wine from the model's birth year, 1995 (which retails for $595). 

Family and friends sang “Happy Birthday” to Kendall as she was presented with a beautiful, vintage-inspired white cake decorated with black bows, long candles and several mini bottles of 818 Tequila.

A beautiful show of fireworks exploded over the ocean to cap off the night. 

“Happy 30th Birthday @kendalljenner,” Kim wrote in a sweet Instagram post. “May this decade bring you the kind of love and joy you so freely give to everyone else. 🤍I love you more than you'll ever understand!

“Here's to 30 Kenny,” she added.

Khloé also raved about her “baby sister” in a lengthy tribute post. 

“I can't believe you're thirty. It feels impossible and yet, here you are; more radiant, grounded, and beautifully you than ever before,” the Good American founder wrote.

“Something I've always admired and respected about you is how deeply and unapologetically you live in your truth,” she continued. “In a world where so many try to fit in or please others, you've always just been yourself. Effortlessly, courageously, authentically YOU.” 

Kendall thanked her loved ones for celebrating with her by posting an Instagram Story photo of herself dancing in front of the fireworks, writing, “Thank you for all the birthday love.” 

It's unclear if Kendall's other siblings, Kourtney Kardashian and Rob Kardashian, were at the event, though they weren't seen in any photos.

The Predator, as a fictional adversary, is irrepressibly cool. The invisibility, the radar vision, those harpoon spikes, the mandibles that glisten as it moves in for the kill—there's a reason why the alien creature endures as one of film's most iconic monsters. But design is only a part of its charm. In John McTiernan's 1987 jungle chop-a-thon Predator, its appeal came from the unknown. That its quarry—filled out by alpha machos like Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and Dillon (Carl Weathers), among others—had no idea what stalked them, only that it was faster and deadlier. A squad of Rambos up against an enemy who could best them at their own violent game, a sly B-movie subversion of the '80s action flick during its peak. Dutch's sole hope for survival boiled down to one piece of almost elemental logic: “If it bleeds, we can kill it.” 

The mystique of the Predator, what it was and where it came from, was best left to the imagination; the second you start pulling at that thread, the whole idea falls apart. What kind of ridiculous cosmic being would achieve interstellar travel for the sole purpose of hunting big game across the galactic expanse? From where does it hail? Does it go home to a spouse? File taxes? The less we knew, the better. All that mattered was that the Predator was awesome—and bug-nuts terrifying.

Dan Trachtenberg successfully remixed Predator with 2022's Prey, a historical action epic where the Predator hunted a Comanche warrior (Amber Midthunder) who lacked the efficiency of automatic weapons but shared Dutch's knack for self-preservation. In pitting these two unlikely foes against each other, Prey maintained the essence of the monster. Trachtenberg charts a wildly different course with Predator: Badlands, a lore-centric franchise expansion that flips the concept on its head by placing the Predator front and center as a hunter-hero with motivations that transcend its species' vicious reputation. Trachtenberg (with Prey screenwriter Patrick Aison) tosses us into the deep end with Dek (Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi), a young Yautja (the Predator's race, cooked up in a 1994 novelization of Dark Horse's Alien Vs. Predator comic), who is having a rough go proving himself worthy of his clan's legacy. We'll learn even more about him before his story's done.

From the jump, Badlands establishes Dek's personal stakes. His disapproving father believes he's weak and doubts his worth, and so his one shot at redemption lies in bagging the Kalisk, a notoriously unkillable beast that roams the so-called “death planet” Genna. After a lively inter-family brawl, where we see Predator fight Predator in the first of many choreographed-to-the-gills and cozily PG-13 battles, Dek sets off to Genna with the burden of tragedy as well as duty to keep him company. However, despite the planet's foreboding nickname, there is a surprising amount of activity on its surface, with the ever-slimy Weyland-Yutani Corporation (of the Alien franchise) setting up a synthetic-staffed research outpost for purposes that threaten Genna's natural order. Their endgame ends up clashing with Dek's, though the ensuing strife between these entities, polished with a squeaky-clean “good versus evil” finish, doesn't pack the subtextual, anti-corporate punch the film is feinting at. Considering who's paying the bills, it can't.

Giving a face to the corporation is Thia (Elle Fanning), an unusually chipper android who's lost her legs to the Kalisk yet maintains a positive disposition and a subversive anti-boss streak as Dek's unlikely companion. Fitted with a universal translator (Dek initially calls her “Tool”), Thia is often strapped to Dek's back like C-3PO on Chewbacca during the climax of The Empire Strikes Back, cataloging Genna's many flora and fauna, among them, razor grass, worms that spit acid, grenade grubs, and a googly-eyed mascot creature in the Stitch mold who tags along to complete Dek's oddball family unit. From there, their fates intertwine and play out precisely how they must in a frictionless glide towards the film's sequel-baiting finale, where Badlands fuses iconography from two franchises that haven't had the best of luck sharing space in live action. The action is kinetic and frequent, buoyed by Wētā Workshop's digital sorcery and a notably propulsive score (from Sarah Schachner and Benjamin Wallfisch) that booms over IMAX sound systems and blends alarmingly well with Dek's frequent bursts of primal rage. Yet it's hard to shake the feeling that something is woefully absent from all this Saturday morning frenzy.

And speaking of Threepio: That Star Wars echo can't be an accident. In both structure and family-friendly cadence, Predator: Badlands can often come off like a bootleg Mandalorian, with Dek as an (admittedly more belligerent) antihero, meekened somewhat by his adorable misfit sidekicks. Between this, Prey, and this summer's Killer Of Killers, Trachtenberg seems to be forging his own Dave Filoni-esque cinematic universe for the Predator—only with its edges sanded down where they were once barbed and nasty. In fact, the movie feels downright toyetic: Dek's wee alien pal is plush-ready, he has a sword that glows red, he slices up animated beasties who regenerate limbs at will, and when he dispatches synths, they don't spill viscous milk like in the very R-rated Alien movies but short-circuit and collapse in a tidy heap of mannequin limbs. Dek doesn't do much here that might send his new buddies, or his audience, running in the opposite direction in terror. Few will accuse him of being sedentary, yet this Predator, once that brutal embodiment of macho-decimating death, now has something new driving his carnage: a sense of belonging. The hunt goes on, but the thrill is gone.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pitchfork.com","No Limit Rapper Young Bleed Dies at 51","https://pitchfork.com/news/no-limit-rapper-young-bleed-dies-at-51/","Tue, 04 Nov 2025 16:26:23 GMT","

Young Bleed, the Louisiana rapper who became one of No Limit Records' success stories, has died. His eldest son, Ty'Gee Ramon Clifton, shared the news in an Instagram Reel, stating that the musician died on Saturday, November 1. Young Bleed had been hospitalized for a brain aneurysm following an appearance at a Verzuz event featuring members of No Limit and Cash Money Records. Young Bleed was 51 years old.

Young Bleed was born Glenn Reed Clifton Jr. in Baton Rouge, and he started rapping when he was nine years old. He sold his own tapes as a teenager and, in the mid-1990s, joined Concentration Camp, the local hip-hop group founded by fellow Louisiana rapper C-Loc. It was Young Bleed's verse on C-Loc's “A Fool” that got the attention of No Limit founder and label head Master P, who remixed “A Fool” for the soundtrack to his 1997 film I'm Bout It, changing the title to “How Ya Do Dat,” and signed Young Bleed to No Limit.

Young Bleed's major label debut, My Balls and My Word, arrived the following year. The album sold half a million copies and topped Billboard's Hip-Hop/R&B chart. For its follow-up, 1999's My Own, Young Bleed jumped to No Limit's distributor, Priority Records. He was let go from his contract, however, shortly thereafter. The rapper temporarily rebranded to Young Bleed Carleone's and, in 2002, dropped Vintage as the first release on his own label, Da'tention Home Records.

Across the rest of his career, Young Bleed remained prolific, continuing to hop between labels while becoming a mentor to a new generation of hip-hop. He put out two projects—Rise Thru da Ranks from Earner Tugh in 2005 and Once Upon a Time in Amedica in 2007—on C-Bo's West Coast Mafia Records, as well as several full-length collaborations with younger rappers. In 2010, Young Bleed also founded the record label Trap Door Entertainment, where he released four total albums leading up to the last of his lifetime, 2022's Dare' Iza' God.

“Preserved could easily describe Young Bleed's loyalty to the reliable sound of his earliest work,” David Drake wrote in the Pitchfork review of the musician's 2011 album, which came out on Tech N9ne's Strange Lane. “Bleed emphasizes the individualism, agency, and nobility of the street soldier, weaving a universal story of hustle and struggle through implied, writerly details and a sixth sense for style.”

	David Fear



	He's part of a race of extraterrestrial hunters who take pride in their stalking prowess and being the “killer of killers.” She's an android programmed to collect alien specimens and, apparently, offer a cheerful running commentary whenever disaster looms. Along with an adorable creature blessed with the agility of a Rhesus monkey and the scrunchy face of a pug, they've got to navigate dangerous environment rife with deadly obstacles. We don't want to say that hilarity necessarily ensues when, you know, one of the characters splits a massive beast in half with a laser sword and holds its bloodied, severed spine up as a spoil of victory. But it's pretty obvious you're watching a buddy comedy. One in which the co-lead is a Predator. [Cue theme to The Odd Couple]


	Once upon a time, this stone-cold killer from a galaxy far, far away was merely another threat that stood between Arnold Schwarzenegger and survival in the jungles of Central America. Thanks to Stan Winston's extraordinary design and the need for endlessly franchised creature features, the interstellar intruder with the mandibles and dreadlocks kept coming back to Earth, hunting everyone from 18th century Native American tribes to future-shocked L.A. cops. Sequels, comic books, video games, action figures, and an animated feature followed. It even got to go toe-to-toe with Xenomorphs. A star was born. 

	











	The sixth film in the series — eighth if you count the Alien vs. Predator offshoots — Predator: Badlands retains the mix of B-movie action and pulpy horror, with a lot of hard sci-fi elements thrown in. Most of the dialogue is in the title character's native language, which we believe is called “Predatorese,” and everything takes place on two planets that answer the question, “What if Frank Frazetta and Roger Dean had a baby?” But it's really a comedic road movie at heart, with as much yuks over a mismatched pair trying to get along as yucks involving the goopy innards of cosmic mastodons. Finally, the Predator cinematic-universe remake of Midnight Run that no one knew they, er, needed?

	Things kick off with a bit of inter-family strife, involving a young predator named Dek (Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi). He's attempting to go through the traditional Yautja rituals of manhood, which will earn him his invisibility cloak. Those involve besting a fellow warrior in battle. The one testing his mettle happens to be his brother, Kwei (Mike Homik). Dek is soon marked for extinction by his dad, the tribal leader, because “weaklings” must be culled from the herd. Long story short, our hero escapes and vows to bring back the ultimate trophy: the head of a Kalisk, an indestructible monstrosity with regenerative healing powers that lives deep within the harsh terrain of Genna. If you're already confused or bewildered, leave now — it's only going to get wonkier from here.


	Once he lands on Genna, Dek fights off a number of indigenous flora, fauna, and the odd hungry behemoth. He also discovers Thia (Elle Fanning), a synthetic made by the Weyland-Yutani corporation — yes, that Weyland-Yutani corporation — who was also sent to capture and retrieve the Kalisk. Congratulations, AvP fans, the franchise crossover is now officially canon! Their meet-cute involves a pterodactyl, a number of plants that shoot paralyzing needles, and a nest in which Thia has been imprisoned. Once she is freed, Dek discover the robot is missing her bottom half. Help her retrieve her legs, Twia says, and she may be able to aid him in finding a Kalisk. He straps her to his back and, along with that aformentioned monkey-dog hybrid who Twia names Bud, they set off to meet their destiny. [Cue “Movin' Right Along” from The Muppet Movie]

	There are thrills and chills and spills and a lot of cross-lingual back and forth; you'd be surprised how much banter you can get out of English-to-Predatorese bickering. Fanning knows exactly to add a slightly Pollyanna-ish aura to her opportunistic yet optimistic synthetic, as well as a cold, menacing vibe when playing her evil synth twin. Director Dan Trachtenberg has given us both the franchise's undisputed masterpiece Prey (2022) and this year's animated anthology Predator: Killer of Killers, and his third time up now makes him the series' resident go-to ringmaster. He knows how present paperback-cover vistas, yowling monster attacks, and a set piece involving Twia and her still-disembodied gams respectively fighting off Weyland-Yutani thugs. Everything bops breezily along, stopping occasionally to have Dek growl maxims about strength through domination, and observe a decapitation or two.

Badlands does have something close to a message that makes itself apparent before the triumphant final-boss fight (there's one more Alien-related bit of business in store), the Greek-tragedy climax, and a post-credits stinger, in which you're reminded there's a difference between the cosmic killer clan you're born into and the cosmic killer clan you choose, yadda yadda yadda. Or maybe its that the real apex-predator hunt is the friends we made along the way. Regardless, this detour into a genre not previously associated with clacking mandibles and righteous kills suggests the brand's braintrust wants to diversify its portfolio a bit. To which we can only reply: Bring on the raunchy teen-musical Predator rom-com!

A team of astronomers monitoring interstellar object 3I/ATLAS have found something a little surprising. Our third confirmed interstellar visitor appears to have changed color for the second time. Meanwhile, another team finds that the comet has begun to show signs of non-gravitational acceleration as it approached perihelion.

For those of you who haven't been following the story of our third interstellar visitor, on July 1, astronomers at the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) spotted an object hurtling through our Solar System on an escape trajectory. Given its velocity and its eccentricity between 6.1 and 6.2, it was confirmed to be an interstellar object, the third we have seen after 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.

Astronomers have kept a close eye on the object, now known to be a comet due to its distinctive outgassing behavior. They have found a number of unusual features of the object, which may well be a 10-billion-year-old time capsule from an earlier age of the universe. Studying it could tell us the exotic environment it grew up in, though astronomers are still attempting to pin down exactly which part of the galaxy it came from. 



Unfortunately, while the object was approaching perihelion, or the point in its path where it was closest to the Sun, it was behind our host star from Earth's perspective. Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb has made a big hoo-ha about this fact, suggesting that an alien spacecraft attempting to view our Solar System or destroy the Earth may choose to be out of our view at perihelion in order to disguise a maneuver, redirecting it towards Earth. 

It's a hypothesis which nearly all astronomers reject, given the cometary behavior, including astronomers at the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) and NASA. Nevertheless, as the comet approached the Sun, it was a key moment to test this highly unlikely hypothesis (aliens have been suggested as an explanation for cosmological mysteries many times, and so far, we have found zero).



So, what have we learned as the object approached perihelion? In a new study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, astronomers report that the comet appears to have changed color (for the second time). Using Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO), SOlar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), and weather satellite GOES-19, the team was able to observe 3I/ATLAS as it approached perihelion on October 29.

The team found that the object has brightened significantly, to around magnitude 9, making it brighter than many Herschel 400 galaxies, and visible with a small telescope or a decent pair of binoculars. They add that ""color photometry shows the comet to be distinctly bluer than the Sun"". However, as yet there is not a satisfactory explanation for its rapid brightening, which is far in excess of the rate of brightening seen in more-frequently-seen Oort cloud comets.

Meanwhile, observations reported by Davide Farnoccia, a navigation engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, indicate that the comet appears to exhibit signs of ""non-gravitational acceleration,"" or acceleration not caused by gravity alone. 

""The non-gravitational acceleration was measured at the perihelion distance of 1.36 times the Earth-Sun separation (defined as an astronomical unit or `au'), equivalent to 203 million kilometers,"" Loeb explains in a blog post, adding that it showed a ""radial acceleration away from the Sun of 135 kilometers (=9x10^{-7}au) per day squared"" and a ""transverse acceleration relative to the Sun's direction of 60 kilometers (=4x10^{-7}au) per day squared"".

Before you scream ""DARK FOREST ATTACK"" and start building a bunker world around Jupiter, non-gravitational acceleration does not mean that the object moved by itself. In fact, this may be further evidence of its cometary behavior; its acceleration changed as it approached the Sun and began outgassing, losing mass as it did so.

""For a thermal ejection speed of a few hundred meters per second, the evaporation half-life of 3I/ATLAS is 6 months,"" Loeb writes. ""This implies that over the month it takes 3I/ATLAS to cross a spatial scale of order its perihelion separation from the Sun, 3I/ATLAS would lose about a tenth of its mass. Such a massive mass loss should be detectable in the form of a large plume of gas surrounding 3I/ATLAS during the upcoming months of November and December 2025.""

The European Space Agency's (ESA's) Juice spacecraft may be able to detect such mass loss during early November. But according to the pre-print paper using solar observatories, significant outgassing is likely to have taken place, pointing once again to interesting, though unusual, cometary behavior.

""Our cursory analysis of this data indicates the comet will likely emerge from conjunction considerably brighter than when it entered, with an extrapolated geocentric V magnitude of ∼9 at perihelion, perhaps driven by prominent, visible gas emission,"" the team explains, though they add that there are several mysteries to clear up (this is only our third confirmed interstellar object, after all).

""The reason for 3I's rapid brightening, which far exceeds the brightening rate of most Oort cloud comets at similar r (C. E. Holt et al. 2024), remains unclear,"" the team adds. ""It is possible that its H2O sublimation had been held down earlier by cooling from its CO2 sublimation, which remained unusually dominant at r ∼ 3 au, perhaps related to its rapid approach toward the Sun compared to other comets.""

Now it really is a waiting game to see what happens as we get a view of it once again. 

""Without an established physical explanation, the outlook for 3I's postperihelion behavior remains uncertain, and a plateau in brightness—or even a brief continuation of its preperihelion brightening—appears as plausible as rapid fading past perihelion,"" the team concludes. ""Continued observations may help provide a more definitive explanation for the comet's behavior.""

The study is posted to pre-print server arXiv.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Conspiracy+Theories","Chemtrails and dubious cancer cures: Florida is a bizarre conspiracy theory haven","https://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/editorials/article312758860.html","Tue, 04 Nov 2025 18:47:44 GMT","

Opinion articles provide independent perspectives on key community issues, separate from our newsroom reporting.

Floridians have long been known to have a healthy skepticism of government and embrace personal freedom. But now the state is experiencing the toxic combination of these values with the anti-scientific-establishment movement that's grown since the pandemic.

The problem isn't that Floridians may have diverging opinions on COVID-19 vaccines or the pharmaceutical industry. It's that the state's leaders — mainly the governor and surgeon general — are endorsing dangerous public health decisions, such as ending childhood vaccination mandates for highly-contagious diseases like measles.

And they are expanding their reach with the growing popularity of the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement led by U.S. Secretary of Health and known vaccine skeptic Robert. F. Kennedy, Jr.

And it just keeps getting more bizarre. A recent event in Venice shows there's no fantastical, absurd thinking that's too much for MAHA.

The Oct. 2 event in Sarasota County — “The 3 Big C's: Courage, Censorship & Cancer” — honored Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo and his wife, plus “an unlicensed Canadian radiologist who treats cancer with horse paste,” KFF Health News reported. The event was sponsored by a clinic founded by a “Jan. 6 marcher,” according to KFF.

There's no more notable intersection of today's conspiracy theories — from vaccine to election denial — than this. Anti-science sentiment is not new in American history, but now it is rubber-stamped by people in some of the highest positions of power in the nation's third-largest state.

And who are they listening to?

Radiologist William Makis, a keynote speaker at the event, lost his medical license in 2019, the KFF story said, and now uses antiparasitic drugs such ivermectin as a cancer treatment. Ivermectin was also pushed as a treatment for the coronavirus, including by Ladapo, but studies have shown it was not effective.

After listening to actor Mel Gibson talk about the benefits of ivermectin on a podcast, Florida First Lady Casey DeSantis, a cancer survivor, has announced some of the state's new $60 million cancer research fund will go into researching the drug. Studies have shown ivermectin could have anticancer effects, but there is no evidence yet that it is effective to treat the disease in humans, the Washington Post reported. Florida has not announced who will conduct the research, which will certainly affect whether the results can be trusted. There's plausible concern that the desired outcomes will dictate the process.

Ladapo's wife, Brianna Ladapo, who chaired a panel at the Venice event, says she listens to angels and has written that “sinister forces” created the pandemic to “frighten the masses to surrender their sovereignty to a small group of tyrannical elites,” the story said. On a recent podcast, she claimed “chemtrails” — another favorite topic of conspiracy theorists — shaped like a pentagram were “outside our house for the last few weeks” and had made her and her sons sick, KFF reported.

To be clear, Joseph Ladapo hasn't publicly endorsed his wife's views. He did appear in a 2020 news conference on the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court organized by a fringe group called “America's Frontline Doctors” that included another doctor who previously claimed some female medical issues are caused by having sex with demons. The group pushed for hydroxychloroquine as a cure for the coronavirus (clinical trials have found the drug doesn't work.)

Demons, pentagram-shaped chemtrails and unproven treatments for cancer may sound like the stuff that only tinfoil-hat wearers would believe. But public distrust in American institutions, including healthcare, has pushed many regular people to look for alternative views on medicine.

We understand why Americans distrust “Big Pharma” and the medical establishment. Their record is far from spotless. Pharmaceutical companies, for example, helped create the opioid crisis by flooding the market with addictive prescription drugs. That's enough to shake anyone's trust.

But Florida has now moved to the other extreme, where treatments like vaccines, that have been studied and proven, are dismissed. Those that haven't — or have been proven not to work — are upheld as a silver bullet that an obscure elite has supposedly hidden to keep us sick.

Ladapo and others may say they are protecting medical freedom, but Florida is looking more like it's pandering to dangerous and bizarre conspiracy theories.

Recent observations of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS show that it has developed a faint blueish hue, hinting at a potential color change. This is the third time experts have seen the comet's coloring shift since it was discovered.

Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS may be developing a blueish hue after undergoing a rapid and unexpected brightening event while hidden behind the sun, new observations reveal. This is the third time that experts have noted a potential change to the comet's color — but, so far, none of them have stuck.

3I/ATLAS, the third-known interstellar object to visit our solar system, was spotted shooting toward the sun at more than 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h) in early July. The comet is potentially the oldest of its kind ever seen and was likely ejected from its home star system, somewhere in the Milky Way's frontier, more than 7 billion years ago. Since then, it has sailed through interstellar space, before making its current rendezvous with our solar system.

Following a close approach to Mars at the start of October, the interstellar comet has spent the last few weeks on the opposite side of the sun to Earth, making it largely unobservable from our planet (although a handful of orbiting spacecraft could still see it). But it is now starting to become visible to Earth-based telescopes once again.

The comet reached its closest point to the sun, known as perihelion, on Oct. 29, when it was mostly hidden from us, reaching a minimum distance of 130 million miles (210 million kilometers) from our home star — around 1.4 times farther from the sun than Earth. The day before, a pair of researchers analyzing data from spacecraft that could still see 3I/ATLAS revealed that the comet had brightened by several orders of magnitude after disappearing from view, which can't be fully explained by its proximity to the sun.

In the same paper, the researchers also wrote that the comet appears to be ""distinctly bluer than the sun,"" which came as a surprise given that this color had not been seen in the comet until now. This color change is likely the result of a specific gas, such as carbon monoxide or ammonia, leaking from the comet, they argued. (This study has not yet been peer-reviewed, and no other observations have thus far confirmed the blue coloration.)

 




The researchers noted that the blue coloration is in sharp contrast to the initial red hue given off by the comet during early observations in July, which was likely the result of an abundance of dust coming off its surface. Then, in September, the comet briefly appeared to be turning green, likely due to the presence of dicarbon or cyanide within its coma.

But these changes of coloration were only temporary, and it's currently unclear why that is. Only time and continued observations will tell if the comet's new coloring will stick.

Over the next few weeks, the comet will become increasingly visible to stargazers in the Northern Hemisphere as it moves northward in the night sky. However, it will not be visible to the naked eye, meaning you will need a decent telescope or a pair of stargazing binoculars to see it for yourself.

 




3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to our planet on Dec. 19, coming within a minimum distance of 168 million miles (270 million km) — around 1.8 times the Earth-sun distance. Between now and then, researchers will get a much better look at the comet, enabling them to study it in even greater detail. Two ESA spacecraft may also fly through the comet's long tail before it begins its journey back out of the solar system.

—New photos of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS reveal its tail growing before our eyes

—NASA telescope spotted rare interstellar comet 2 months before it was officially 'discovered'

The extrasolar entity has displayed several unusual traits since it was first discovered, including an abundance of carbon dioxide, high levels of water leakage and a puzzling anti-tail. Researchers also believe that its icy shell may have been transformed by billions of years of cosmic ray bombardment, potentially making it harder to track the material of its home star system.

As a result of these anomalous characteristics, some researchers have controversially proposed that 3I/ATLAS may be a piece of alien technology in disguise. However, there is no solid evidence to support this theory, and most experts maintain that the object is behaving exactly as a comet should.

The New York Jets agreed to trade star cornerback Sauce Gardner to the Indianapolis Colts on Tuesday for two first-round draft picks and wide receiver Adonai Mitchell, according to a person with knowledge of the deal.

The Jets will receive the Colts' first-round selection in 2026 and in 2027, the person told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the teams hadn't announced the trade. 

NFL Network and ESPN first reported the stunning deal, which came less than three hours before the NFL's trade deadline and sends one of the Jets' most popular and accomplished players to the Colts.

Gardner, an All-Pro selection in his first two seasons, signed a four-year, $120.4 million contract extension with the Jets in July.

“New York it's been real,” Gardner posted with a green heart emoji on X.

Gardner was the No. 4 overall pick in the 2022 NFL draft out of Cincinnati and quickly established himself as one of the league's top cornerbacks during his first two seasons with the Jets. He was selected the AP Defensive Rookie of the Year and made the All-Pro team in consecutive years — the only cornerback to do so in his first two seasons since the 1970 merger — for then-coach Robert Saleh and defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich.

He had a slightly down year, by his standards, last season and was excited to play for new coach Aaron Glenn and defensive coordinator Steve Wilks. Gardner said during minicamp in June that Wilks was trying to get him to reach another level.

“I know I'm not perfect,” Gardner said then, “but the fact that he's trying to get perfection out of me is what I need.”




The Jets rewarded Gardner with the big extension in July that made him the NFL's highest-paid cornerback. It came just 24 hours after New York also gave a massive extension to wide receiver Garrett Wilson, who was selected by the team six picks after Gardner, with the team envisioning them being cornerstones of the future.

Gardner got off to an up-and-down start this season, but was mostly solid since before missing the team's win at Cincinnati with a concussion.

Glenn said Monday that Gardner was among three players who were completing the concussion protocol coming out of the Jets' bye-week break and was expected to return to practice this week.

Gardner now goes from a Jets team that is coming off winning its first game after opening with seven losses to a Colts squad that has been one of the NFL's biggest surprises with a 7-2 start that ties Indianapolis with New England and Denver for the most victories in the AFC.

Indy scrambled to plug holes in its injury-riddled secondary even before the regular season started. They signed free agents Charvarius Ward and Cam Bynum during the offseason to revamp a unit that struggled last season. The Colts even tried cornerback Xavien Howard, a two-time NFL interceptions champ who did not play in 2024, after losing two promising rookies — safety Hunter Wohler and cornerback Justin Whaley — with season-ending injuries in training camp.

Howard retired after playing just four games. Ward is now on injured reserve after suffering a concussion in a collision during pregame warmups on Oct. 12.

Indy's latest attempt to find a solution came last weekend when third-year cornerback Jaylon Jones was activated off injured reserve. He played reasonably well in a loss to Pittsburgh, but the defense's performance in that game demonstrated the Colts still needed to reinforce their biggest weakness on the team — the secondary.

Gardner could fit the bill.

It's the first major trade by new Jets general manager Darren Mougey and it evoked memories of the deal New York made in 2012 when it sent Darrelle Revis – to whom Gardner was often compared for his ability to shut down receivers – to Tampa Bay in 2013 for two draft picks, including a first-rounder. 

New York is shuffling its secondary in the middle of its poor season. The Jets traded for cornerback Jarvis Brownlee Jr. last month, acquiring the 2024 fifth-rounder from Tennessee in September, and dealt nickel cornerback Michael Carter II to Philadelphia last Wednesday.

The addition of Mitchell, the Colts' second-round pick last year out of Texas, gives the Jets a boost to their thin wide receiver group. Wilson has been dealing with a knee injury that has sidelined him the past two games. New York has been looking for someone else among a group that includes Josh Reynolds, Tyler Johnson, Allen Lazard and rookie Arian Smith to step up as a clear No. 2 to help quarterback Justin Fields.

The Colts had high hopes for Mitchell when they drafted him and thought he could push another young receiver, Alec Pierce, to fulfill his potential.

Pierce responded by averaging a league-high 22.3 yards per catch last season and is second in the NFL this season at 20.9 yards.

Mitchell, however, disappointed. He had a reputation for dropping passes but appeared poised to play a bigger role in the offense this season. But just when Mitchell appeared to be emerging, his progression was stalled by a big blunder — dropping the ball before crossing the goal line against the Los Angeles Rams, costing him the first score of his career and resulting in a touchback. Indy lost the game 27-20.

Since then, Mitchell has been virtually invisible. 

In the Colts' five games since that embarrassing blunder, Mitchell has appeared in four and hauled in two of his four targets for 15 yards. Mitchell has 32 catches for 462 yards, four carries for 6 yards and has completed his only pass attempt for 24 yards in two seasons.

BOSTON (AP) — Two Massachusetts men were arrested Tuesday in connection with a weekend explosion at Harvard Medical School, authorities said.

Esta fotografía, proporcionada por el Departamento de Policía de la Universidad de Harvard, muestra a una persona que las autoridades buscan en relación con una explosión ocurrida en la Facultad de Medicina de Harvard en Boston, el sábado 1 de noviembre de 2025. (Departamento de Policía de la Universidad de Harvard vía AP)



Logan David Patterson and Dominick Frank Cardoza face charges of conspiracy to damage by means of fire or an explosive, according to the charging document. Patterson, an 18-year-old from Plymouth, and Cardoza, a 20-year-old from Bourne, were arrested Tuesday morning and were due to be arraigned in federal court later in the day.

The explosion occurred early Saturday on the fourth floor of Harvard Medical School's Goldenson Building, which houses labs and offices associated with the school's neurobiology department. No one was injured.

“Anxiety levels naturally rise when the public learns that an explosion was intentionally caused. I would say those levels may rise even higher in the Boston area,” U.S. Attorney Leah B. Foley said at a news conference, noting that the investigation is ongoing but that there's no further threat to the university.

According to the charging document, witnesses said the men were visiting Wentworth College for Halloween activities, including parties at area schools. On the day of the blast, surveillance footage captured the two walking toward Harvard's medical school. Witnesses said the pair chose the building because it looked abandoned and got into it via the roof, the charging document states.

Witnesses said the pair lit a roman candle outside of the building and placed a cherry bomb inside of a locker in the building that then exploded, according to the charging document.

“Let me be clear: Setting off an explosive device inside a locker at an institution geared toward higher education is not some harmless college prank. It's selfish, it's short-sighted, and it's a federal crime,” said Ted Docks, the FBI's special agent in charge.

Neither Foley nor Docks would speculate as to the motive.

Medical school officials said the explosion caused no structural damage and that all labs and equipment remained intact. The Boston Fire Department determined that the explosion was intentional. Police said officers did not find additional devices during a sweep of the building.

An officer who responded to a fire alarm that morning encountered two people running from the building, university police said.

The ongoing U.S. government shutdown is about to become the nation's longest federal funding lapse ever.

The shutdown is poised to hit that milestone on Wednesday, marking its 36th day and surpassing the previous record, which was set in early 2019.

The latest attempt to break the logjam, by getting a Republican-backed stopgap measure passed by Congress, failed in the Senate for the 14th time on Tuesday.

There are no further votes scheduled Tuesday on the GOP's short-term continuing resolution, or on an alternative proposal put forward by Democrats, which includes additional spending on health care and other priorities.

Both of the longest government shutdowns in U.S. history occurred while President Donald Trump was in office.

Bitcoin BTC$100,944.52 continued to slide on Tuesday U.S. hours, falling below $102,000 and taking out the lows of the October 10 crash.

The largest crypto plunged 4.5% over the past 24 hours and 11.8% over the past seven days to near $101,900, its weakest since late June.

Ethereum's ether ETH$3,269.01 also fell below the crash lows at around $3,410, the lowest in three months and down nearly 6% today. XRP$2.1921, BNB BNB$923.68, Solana's SOL SOL$155.20, DOGE$0.1588 and Cardano's ADA ADA$0.5174 declined 5%-7% during the same period. The whole group is down by 15%-20% over the past week.

Crypto-related stocks weren't spared either. Strategy (MSTR), the largest corporate BTC owner, tumbled another 5% to its weakest price since April. Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) and digital asset investment firm Galaxy (GLXY) declined by similar amounts.

Investor sentiment deteriorated alongside the price action. The well-followed sentiment indicator, the Fear & Greed Index, fell to 21, indicating ""extreme fear"" on the market. That's the metric's most depressed reading since early April, when BTC fell below $75,000 during the tariff tantrum.

The collapse of the bitcoin treasury company bubble continues to reverberate, with those previous accumulators of BTC having begun turning sellers. Paris-based Sequans early Tuesday announced the sale of 970 BTC in order to help pay down previously accumulated debt.

As bitcoin has fallen almost 20% from its record high above $126,000 less than a month ago, the market is at a crucial inflection point, Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33, said in a Tuesday note.

""BTC has closed above $100,000 for 180 consecutive trading days, but is now dangerously close to this material psychological price level,"" he wrote.

He argued that the current price action is typical of consolidations that followed major liquidation events of the past few years — ""slow, heavy, and frustratingly choppy."" However, the research firm's proprietary derivatives signals resemble both prior bottoming patterns and early bear market regimes from late April and mid-December in 2021, he added.

Amid mixed signals, Lunde suggested that it's too early to call October 6 the market top. Positive catalysts — such as expected monetary easing, retirement accounts potentially opening for crypto, growing institutional participation and regulatory softening — don't support the idea of a cyclical peak yet, he said.

""Our outlook remains bullish, but we will hold a nimble approach should the structure materialize further to the downside."" he said.

Edited by Devyani Gholap

 November 04, 2025  

In patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), the occurrence of pulmonary exacerbations requiring intensive therapy (PERITs) was associated with marked decline in lung function that was not always reversed by intravenous antibiotic therapy. The magnitude of the decline and the pattern of subsequent recovery were similar regardless of using CF transmembrane conductance regulator modulator therapy.

“This [study] underscores the need for clinicians to approach the management of PERITs in people receiving CFTR [cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator] modulators with the same vigilance and therapeutic intensity as they would for those not receiving modulators,” the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Parveen Fathima, Health and Clinical Analytics, Sydney School of Public Health, The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia. It was published online on October 09, 2025, in European Respiratory Journal.

Some patients had more than one exacerbation, which may have affected the independence of data. Incomplete spirometry data at all timepoints might have biased the recovery analyses. The study did not adjust for confounding factors and could not establish causal inferences. It included only exacerbations treated with intravenous antibiotics and did not capture clinicians' rationale for treatment decisions, and thresholds for intravenous therapy may vary across clinical settings. 

This study received support from the BHP Blue Sky Award, the MTPConnect Project Fund Program, and the Australian Medical Research Future Fund. The authors reported having no conflicts of interest.

PORTLAND, Ore. (November 4, 2025) – The Portland Thorns announced today that Olivia Moultrie has agreed to a multi-year contract extension which will link the young U.S. Women's National Team midfielder with the Rose City through 2029.

“Portland isn't just where I play, it's home,” Moultrie said. “The community, fans, energy at Providence Park, it's all part of who I am now. To be able to keep representing this city means everything. From day one, this organization has believed in me and supported my development in ways I'll always be grateful for. I grew up in this league wearing Thorns colors and that's shaped me and my expectations. Top to bottom, this organization expects greatness and that's exactly where I want to be.”

Trailblazer, phenom, historic, and a relentless desire to succeed are just a few of the many phrases used to describe Moultrie's professional journey since she officially signed for Portland in 2021, at the time becoming the youngest NWSL player at 15 years old. Now 20, Moultrie — who paved the way for the influx of young talent now present in the NWSL —continues to raise the standard for success and exemplifies what it means to be a Thorn. 

""We are thrilled to extend Olivia as a Thorn for the foreseeable future” said President and General Manager of Soccer Operations Jeff Agoos. “We have seen her playing arc see tremendous growth over the course of her development in Portland. Her on-field capabilities, her sheer competitiveness, and the maturity off the pitch has established her as one of our nation's brightest young stars.   We are proud of her commitment to remain in an environment that will continue to shape her into a world class player and compete for championships each year. She has worked hard to become a leader on this team, and we are happy that Portland will be her home.""

Moultrie's extension arrives during a career season for the five-year pro, fresh from helping Portland secure their league leading ninth-consecutive playoff appearance (2016-19, 2021-25) and 11th overall postseason appearance. In 2025, she set new single-season highs in goals (8), appearances (26, a club single-season record), starts (24) and minutes (2,163, third highest for a single season in club history). She finished as Portland's top goal scorer and became the NWSL's highest scoring teenager this past September. Moultrie was also awarded the 2025 Supporters Player of the Year by the Rose City Riveters, Portland's passionate and league-leading supporters group. 

As a Thorn, Moultrie has appeared in 95 NWSL matches with 65 starts, accumulating 18 goals and 11 assists whilst being a major contributor to the 2022 NWSL Championship, 2021 NWSL Shield and 2021 Challenge Cup winning campaigns (still holding the honor of being the youngest player to win a league championship at 17 in 2022). 

“Every time I step on the field at Providence Park, I feel the energy of this city and these fans, there's nothing like it,” Moultrie added. “I want to pay back the loyalty that this community has shown me with as many wins and trophies as possible. This is where I became who I am, and getting to keep writing my story here is something really special. The Thorns have an impressive history and winning in our DNA. I want to live that as well as add to its legacy.”

In addition to her success with Portland, Moultrie has continued her climb as a rising star for the U.S. Women's National Team. The 2023 U.S. Soccer Young Female Player of the Year is fresh off a stellar October window with the USWNT, having scored her second international brace in a 2-1 victory over Portugal. She currently has (10) caps with the USWNT since making her senior international debut in 2023, tallying four goals and an assist for the Stars and Stripes while also lifting the Concacaf W Gold Cup and SheBelieves Cup in 2024. 

By reaching a multi-year extension agreement with Moultrie, the Thorns showcase their commitment to retain top young talent and construct a squad capable of competing for championships to ensure Portland remains the most successful in the NWSL, evident in the Club's league record three NWSL Championships (2013, 2017, 2022), two NWSL Shields (2016, 2021) and NWSL Challenge Cup (2021).

“I think I played a good match,” Blockx said after the win. “It wasn't my best tennis, but I was efficient. I served well, and with just two breaks in the match, it was pretty tight. I managed to take advantage of a few of his errors. Physically, I didn't have as much energy as in the previous days, which is normal after four tough matches. My semifinal [against top seed Raphael Collignon] was one of the best matches I've ever played, so it's not easy to keep that level. I'm happy I managed to finish strong.”The young Belgian faced a major challenge as early as the first round, where he was just two points away from defeat against Germany's Jan-Lennard Struff.“Honestly, I was just happy to get through that first round,” Blockx admitted. “That gave me confidence, and I played better with every match. The field was very strong. This was one of the toughest and best Challengers I've played. Everything here in Bratislava was great—from the organization to the ball kids. I play my best tennis where I feel good, and here in Bratislava, it felt like home.”

I was good at the important points and improved throughout the match,” Giustino said.For Giustino, born in Naples and now based in Barcelona with his Spanish wife and baby daughter, the victory marks another highlight in a long and dedicated professional journey that began in 2007.

EXCLUSIVE: Ian McKellen and Tramell Tillman are set to join Ebenezer: A Christmas Carol, Paramount and Ti West‘s new take on the classic Charles Dickens novel with Johnny Depp starring in the titular role. West is directing. Andrea Riseborough has also signed on, with the studio dating the film for November 13, 2026. Nathaniel Halpern penned the script, with Emma Watts producing.


	The classic Dickens story has seen its fair share of retellings over the years with its tale of an elderly miser visited by the ghost of his former business partner and the spirits of Christmas Past, Christmas Present and Christmas Yet to Come. This also marks the second Christmas Carol pic announced this year after Warner Bros put in development an adaptation from Robert Eggers with Willem Dafoe in line to play Scrooge.

	











	The Depp version, a thrilling ghost story set in Dickens' London, follows one man's supernatural journey to face his past, present and future and fight for a second chance. While not confirmed, sources say Tillman will play the Ghost of Christmas Present. It is unknown who McKellen will play.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Stephen Deuters and Jason Forman are executive producers. Adam Bohling and David Reid are also exec producing. 


	Tillman is coming off his acclaimed performance in the most recent season of Apple's Severance, which won him an Emmy for best supporting actor this year. He is currently in production on Sony's Spider-Man: Brand New Day alongside Tom Holland. He recently wrapped production on the Amazon MGM Studios film Your Mother Your Mother Your Mother and Lena Dunham's Netflix film Good Sex. This spring, Tillman starred opposite Tom Cruise in Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, which had its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival.

	











	For McKellen, the Oscar-nominated actor is no stranger to high-profile IP starring in such hit franchises as X-Men and Lord of the Rings.


	McKellen is repped by Independent Talent Group and CAA and Tillman is repped by UTA, Principal Entertainment LA and Jackoway Austen Tyerman Wertheimer.
