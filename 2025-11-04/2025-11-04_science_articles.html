Even if people do test positive after using a home antibody test, there is no way to report a positive result in the community, says Antonia Ho, a clinical epidemiologist at the University of Glasgow, UK. Without high-quality surveillance data, Ho warns that health organizations are not well-prepared to recommend corresponding vaccine formulations and time their roll-out. “Surveillance is critical to really understand what's circulating,” she says. But we also have wastewater surveillance, which is quite a useful indicator of what's happening in the community,” Ho says. Stratus accounts for 76% of reported cases and is dominant in Europe and the Americas, whereas Nimbus is dominant in the Western Pacific region, accounting for 15% of cases, says Van Kerkhove. Researchers overlooked airborne diseases for centuries — then COVID-19 changed everything Researchers overlooked airborne diseases for centuries — then COVID-19 changed everything Stratus and Nimbus have similar symptoms to previous variants including a fever, cough and runny nose, but the Nimbus variant has one distinct symptom: a ‘razor blade' sore throat.

Nature Astronomy (2025)Cite this article Since their discovery more than 60 years ago, accreting supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been recognized as highly variable sources, requiring an extremely compact, dynamic environment. Their variability is related to several phenomena, including changing accretion rates, temperature changes, foreground absorbers and structural changes to the accretion disk. Spurred by a new generation of time-domain surveys, the extremes of black hole variability are now being probed. Here we describe the discovery of an extreme flare by the AGN J224554.84+374326.5, which brightened by more than a factor of 40 in 2018. The source has slowly faded since then. The total emitted ultraviolet and optical energy to date is ~1054 erg, which represents the complete conversion of approximately one solar mass into electromagnetic radiation. This flare is 30 times more powerful than the previous most powerful AGN transient. Very few physical events in the Universe can liberate this much electromagnetic energy. We discuss potential mechanisms, including the tidal disruption of a high-mass star (>30 M⊙), gravitational lensing of an AGN flare or supernova, or a supermassive (pair-instability) supernova in the accretion disk of an AGN. We favour the tidal disruption of a massive star in a prograde orbit in an AGN disk.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Published in Science, the study used 7-Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (one of the most advanced brain scanners available, with only two in Australia) to identify how two major regions of the brainstem coordinate pain relief through placebo responses. A placebo cream was used on some areas, but scientists secretly lowered the temperature to convince participants that the cream was reducing pain. Each participant's heat level was personalized to reach a moderate level of discomfort, based on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 100 (worst pain imaginable), typically between 40 and 50 degrees Celsius. About 61 percent reported this effect, a strong indication of genuine placebo-driven pain relief. Dr. Crawford noted, "We found that upper parts of the brainstem were more active when relieving facial pain, while lower regions were engaged for arm or leg pain." Each showed distinct patterns of activity depending on where the pain occurred. According to Dr. Crawford, "The brain's natural pain relief system is more nuanced than we thought. Essentially, it has a built-in system to control pain in specific areas. It's not just turning pain off everywhere; but working in a highly coordinated, anatomically precise system." Understanding which brainstem areas are linked to different parts of the body may open new avenues for developing non-invasive therapies that reduce pain without widespread side effects. "This could help us design more effective and personalized treatments, especially for people with chronic pain in a specific area of their body." The study also challenges long-held assumptions about how placebo pain relief works. "This supports the idea that cannabinoids may play a role in localized, non-opioid pain control." "Knowing exactly where pain relief is happening in the brain means we can target that area or assess whether a drug is working in the right place," said Dr. Crawford.

Aging biomarkers are essential tools for quantifying biological aging, but systematic validation has been hindered by methodological inconsistencies and fragmented datasets. Here we show that the ability of traditional aging clocks to predict chronological age does not correlate with mortality prediction capacity (R = 0.12, P = 0.67), suggesting that these metrics capture distinct biological processes. We developed Biolearn, an open-source framework enabling standardized evaluation of 39 biomarkers across over 20,000 individuals from diverse cohorts. The Horvath skin and blood clock achieved the highest chronological age accuracy (R2 = 0.88), while GrimAge2 demonstrated the strongest mortality association (hazard ratio = 2.57) and healthspan prediction (hazard ratio = 2.00). Our systematic evaluation reveals considerable heterogeneity in biomarker performance across different clinical outcomes, with optimal biomarkers varying according to specific application. Biolearn provides unified data processing pipelines with quality control and cell-type deconvolution capabilities, establishing a foundation for reproducible aging research and facilitating development of robust aging biomarkers.

Approximately 2.75 million years ago, the Turkana Basin in Kenya experienced environmental changes, including increased aridity and environmental variability. Namorotukunan is a newly discovered archaeological site which provides a window into hominin behavioral adaptations. This site lies within the upper Tulu Bor and lower Burgi members of the Koobi Fora Formation (Marsabit District, Kenya), presently a poorly understood time interval due to large-scale erosional events. Moreover, this locale represents the earliest known evidence of Oldowan technology within the Koobi Fora Formation. Oldowan sites, older than 2.6 million years ago, are rare, and these typically represent insights from narrow windows of time. In contrast, Namorotukunan provides evidence of tool-making behaviors spanning hundreds of thousands of years, offering a unique temporal perspective on technological stability. The site comprises three distinct archaeological horizons spanning approximately 300,000 years (2.75 − 2.44 Ma). Our findings suggest continuity in tool-making practices over time, with evidence of systematic selection of rock types. Geological descriptions and chronological data, provide robust age control and contextualize the archaeological finds. We employ multiple paleoenvironmental proxies, to reconstruct past ecological conditions. Our study highlights the interplay between environmental shifts and technological innovations, shedding light on pivotal factors in the trajectory of human evolution. The remarkable ability of humans to inhabit nearly every terrestrial ecosystem is a result of the synergy between biological and technological evolution1. The long term significance of our evolutionary relationship with technology arises from the discovery of stone artifacts within Plio-Pleistocene sediments2,3. This study provides new evidence from the Turkana Basin for the relationship between climatic and environmental shifts and the development of stone tool technologies by hominins. The earliest known assemblages of Oldowan artifacts ( ~ 2.9-2.6 Ma) are confined to four localities in eastern Africa4,5 (Fig. The earliest known localities provide insights into technological behaviors at single time horizons in the deep past. Despite advances in our understanding of early human technology, the specific mechanisms through which environmental changes influenced technological evolution in the earliest Oldowan remain poorly understood. Demonstrating how early hominins adapted their tool-making practices in response to changing environments would provide new insights into the evolutionary pressures that shaped these innovations. Here, we describe multiple assemblages of stone artifacts from well-constrained horizon, with age estimates at 2.75, 2.58, and 2.44 Ma, from the Koobi Fora Formation in the northeastern portion of the Turkana Basin (Paleontological Collection Area 40, archeological site Namorotukunan, National Museums of Kenya ID: FwJj 52). Detailed knowledge of environmental patterns within this region allows us to explore the interplay between periods of environmental change and the presence of an early Oldowan techno-complex that first evolved in the late Pliocene, and emphasizes temporal continuity throughout the Early Pleistocene, in eastern Africa. a Geographical context of the Koobi Fora Formation (red stripes), the paleontological collection area 40 (green square), and the location of the site of Namorotukunan (black dot); [map produced Natural Earth and NOAAA ETOPO 202295]; b Stratigraphic context of the Koobi Fora Formation highlighting members and key volcanic ash marker levels, yellow bars refer to the age of archeological horizons (tephrostratigraphy after McDougall et al.96); c A chronology of key Plio-Pleistocene hominins from the East African Rift System (EARS)11,74,97,98 d A chronology and key localities associated with hominin lithic technology3,6,12 (images of Nyayanga provided by E.

The earliest phases of tool manufacture, dating back to over 3.0 million years ago6 (although see Archer7), highlight percussive technology, which is ubiquitous in hominin records and shared with other primates8,9. Tool use, associated with extractive foraging, is a recurring trait in some extant primates10. The oldest systematic production of sharp-edged stone artifacts, known as the Oldowan, is found in the hominin behavioral record at eastern African sites: Ledi-Geraru and Gona in the Afar Basin (2.6 Ma), Ethiopia, and Nyayanga in western Kenya (2.6-2.9 Ma)3,11,12,13. In this study, we describe the earliest known Oldowan technologies and their paleoenvironmental context in the Koobi Fora Formation (Fig. The presence of butchery marks on bones within the Namorotukunan assemblage underscores the role of sharp-edged tools in the foraging behavior of these hominins and suggests that the development of Oldowan technology was associated with the exploitation of resources mediated by tool use14. Open habitats such as savannas and grasslands expand at the end of the Pliocene and may have facilitated an adaptive shift in hominins towards a regular exploitation of foods requiring the use of tools (e.g., USOs, bone marrow, meat)15,16. Here we examine three distinct temporal horizons containing evidence of sharp-edged tool technology spanning ~300,000 years. The consistent technological approaches across this interval suggest an enduring technological adaptation in the hominin lineage throughout the late Pliocene and earliest Pleistocene. The Koobi Fora Formation (KF Fm.) refers to the sedimentary strata of the Omo Group on the eastern side of Lake Turkana and lies unconformably on Miocene and Pliocene volcanic rocks and associated sediments17,18. The Omo Group encompasses these and other Plio-Pleistocene lacustrine and fluvial deposits that fill a series of alternating half-grabens of the Omo-Turkana Basin, which in turn is part of the larger East African Rift System (EARS19,). Excellent age control throughout the Omo Group (4.02 to ~0.75 Ma) is provided by 40Ar/39Ar dates on volcanic ash layers, K/Ar ages on intercalated basalts and paleomagnetic stratigraphy20. is divided into eight members (see Fig. In Area 40, where Namorotukunan is located, sedimentary strata are estimated to range roughly between 4.3 to 1.6 Ma21,22, with a gap between 3.0 −2.5 Ma represented by the Burgi Unconformity21,23,24. Above this unconformity, a series of lake clays indicate a local change in tectono-sedimentary patterns and the Paleo-Lake Lorenyang transgression in the Turkana basin21,24. To the west of Namorotukunan, across the North Gele Fault19, a younger sedimentary succession is exposed that includes at least the Upper Burgi and KBS Members, as evidenced by the presence of the KBS Tuff within that sequence21. Geological investigations focused on a 46-meter-thick stratigraphic interval examined in seven sections (Fig. These sections are assigned to local geological units used for mapping around Namorotukunan (Supplementary Fig. The lowermost unit in this framework is a tephra level (TB), identified as the Tulu Bor Tuff21 (Supplementary Table 1). The uppermost level is a sequence of lake clays associated with the hill locally known as Namorotukunan, from which the archeological site name is derived (L2b). This lithological succession comprises three distinctly different sediment packages separated by discrete boundaries (Supplementary Table 2). Several linear horizons are characterized by coarse clastic sediments (e.g., cobbles, pebbles, and sands) with distinct bedding features (e.g., cross-through bedding) representing paleo-channels belonging to paleo-river systems whose flow direction is marked as light blue arrows. A series of geological sections (A-G) (lower part of the figure) were used to develop a synthetic log and the magnetostratigraphic context. The main lithologies include red paleosols (R1–R4), sands and poorly cemented sandstones (S1–S3), gray to gray-brown paleosols (P1–P6), conglomerates and gravels (C1–C7), lacustrine clays (L1–L2b), lacustrine sands with ripple marks (LS1), and diatomite-rich lacustrine clays (LD). These lithologies reflect a variety of depositional environments, from fluvial and alluvial systems to lacustrine settings. Green bars reflect straight line distances between stratigraphic sections. Image derived from UAV imagery collected on site. The oldest sediment package is characterized by red silts, paleosols, and sands overlying the Tulu Bor Tuff (TB). It consists of poorly developed paleosols with root traces and carbonate-rich silts intercalated with sands and fine gravels. This package is interpreted as a fluvial floodplain (R1 to R4, Fig. The second package is composed of gravels and paleosols, indicating paleochannels and swamp clays associated with a fluvial system (C1-2, C3, C6), characterized by alternating channel and overbank with intervals of paleosols, interpreted as belonging to a floodplain (S3 to C7). All three artifact-bearing horizons are situated within this sedimentary package. The lower part of this interval contains darker paleosols (P0-P3) rich in carbonate concretions and rhizomes, which alternate with sandy gravel deposits that preserve sand casts of plant roots and rhizomes (Supplementary Fig. Brownish-red, poorly developed paleosols characterize the upper part (P4-P6). Some of the upper paleosol levels (e.g., P5) feature large irregular desiccation cracks (Supplementary Fig. 2), filled with well-cemented sands from the overlying bed (e.g., C6). Cut and fill sequences are limited to three local paleo-rivers corresponding to levels C1-2, C3, and C6. The uppermost cut (C6) is the most laterally extensive and shows characteristics of a meandering river. In some areas, this channel eroded underlying sediments down to the paleosol level P3. These cut and fill structures, representing larger paleoriver features, are highly localized and transition laterally into sandy-silty beds interpreted as overbank deposits. The paleoriver system included low-energy environments, where slack water and point-bar deposits as well as floodplain soil surfaces provided the geological context for the preservation of artifacts and faunal remains. The uppermost and third sedimentary package lies above paleosol level P6 and consists of lake clays (L1 to L2b, see Fig. 2), occasionally featuring sandy units (e.g., LS1) or diatom-rich sediments (e.g., LD) and a single level containing frequent catfish fossil remains (LS1-L2a transition). Previous investigations conducted on the slopes of Namorotukunan Hill (see Fig. However, no age constraints were provided to determine the extent of the time gap represented by this unconformity, leaving its duration, if any, unresolved. Within the investigated Area 40 sedimentary sequence, four age markers were identified that allowed development of a comprehensive age model for the entire sequence (Fig. This layer has been identified as Tulu Bor Tuff β21 and is dated by a 40Ar/39Ar feldspar age of 3.44 ± 0.02 million years22,25,26,27. Geochemical analyses (Supplementary Table 1) also confirm this as the Tulu Bor Tuff β. obtained by correlating the depth axis, represented by the polarity pattern obtained from Namorotukunan (vertical axis) with the age axis, represented by the Geomagnetic Polarity Timescale99 combined with additional geochronological data (horizontal axis), represented by paleomagnetic data represented by magnetic chrons, subchrons and excursions31 and lake phases described from the Turkana Basin28,47,100,101. Two scenarios are considered: a. scenario a assumes continuous sedimentation between gravel levels C7 and lake clays L1; b., represents the second scenario which places the Burgi Unconformity at the C7/L1 lithologic boundary, as previously suggested by Kidney21 and Baldes et al.24, providing slightly older estimates for sites NMT2 and NMT3. For lithological column and paleomagnetic polarity zone legend, see Fig. Paleomagnetic investigations of all the lithologies present, except for the unconsolidated coarse sands (R1-R4), revealed four distinct magnetic polarity intervals (Supplementary Fig. The lowest part of the section, with a thickness of 16.5 meters, corresponds to a normal polarity zone (NZ1). Subsequently, there is a section ~20 meters thick (RZ1) that features reverse polarities. This is followed by a shorter normal polarity segment (NZ2), around 9 meters thick. The top of the Namorotukunan Hill, less than 1 meter thick, is characterized again by the beginning of another reversed polarity zone (RZ2). In most of Area 40 this unit has been removed by modern erosion. These two markers allow us to correlate the local magnetic polarity sequence observed at Namorotukunan with the established Geomagnetic Polarity Timescale (Supplementary Data 1, Supplementary Data 2 GPTS30). Specifically, NZ1 corresponds with the Gauss (C2An) Chron, RZ1, and RZ2 represent parts of the Matuyama (C2r) Chron, and NZ2 correlates with the Feni excursion (Formerly Réunion excursion)31 or, alternatively, with the Olduvai sub-chron. These are either located in the sandy intervals S1 and S2, (incompatible with paleomagnetic analysis) or these sandy intervals are associated with disconformities. This limitation impacts our estimations of sedimentation rates in the lower interval but critically, does not significantly affect the age estimation of the artifact levels investigated here. The studied interval includes the Upper Burgi Unconformity (UBU), a surface interpreted in parts of the Koobi Fora Formation as marking a depositional hiatus of several hundred thousand years24. However, the UBU is not clearly expressed in Area 40, where the transition from fluvial to lacustrine facies is conformable and no field evidence for an erosional surface is present. If a hiatus is present, it must be confined to a narrow interval within RZ1, implying a much shorter duration than has been proposed for central Koobi Fora. We thus consider two possibilities: Scenario A, in which sedimentation is continuous, and Scenario B, in which the UBU represents a brief interruption. Both scenarios securely place the archeological levels in the late Pliocene–early Pleistocene and do not alter our behavioral or chronological interpretations. The KBS Tuff is an important and geographically expansive stratigraphic marker that, if present, would support a correlation with the Olduvai subchron. KBS has been described ~600 west of Namorotukunan, across the North Gele fault21, overlaying a thick succesion of lake clays, inconsistent with the section at Namorotukunan. Its absence in Namorotukunan suggests that the NZ2–RZ2 interval more likely corresponds to the Feni excursion. In addition to the level of the Tulu Bor Tuff β (3.44 ± 0.02 Ma), paleomagnetic data provide three new chronological points for developing the age model for the studied section and obtaining an age estimate for the artifact-bearing horizons at Namorotukunan (Fig. We present two alternative age models based on the different correlations described above. These age models reflect two possible scenarios: the first scenario (Fig. 3a) assumes continuous sedimentation between gravel levels C7 and lake clays L1, while the second scenario (Fig. 3b) incorporates the Burgi Unconformity at the C7/L1 lithologic boundary, as previously suggested by Kidney21 and Baldes et al.24. This second scenario results in slightly older age estimates for sites Namorotukunan-3 (NMT3) and Namorotukunan-2 (NMT2). In this paper, we use the first scenario, which provides more conservative (younger) age estimates. It is important to note that these scenarios do not affect the age estimation of the oldest archeological levels presented in this paper. Archeological research was carried out within the paleontological collection Area 40 at the Namorotukunan site (36.329 E, 4.399 N). Three excavations (in a ~ 5000m2 area), named Namorotukunan-1 (NMT1), Namorotukunan-2 (NMT2), and Namorotukunan-3(NMT3), corresponding to discrete lithological units S3-C1 (for NMT1), C2-P2 (for NMT2), and C3 (for NMT3) yielded a total of 1290 artifacts: NMT1 (n = 198), NMT2 (n = 775), and NMT3 (n = 317), along with associated fossils (Supplementary Table 3). Artifact-bearing horizons are concentrated in sands and fine gravels (Fig. Artifacts associated with the C3 horizon, (NMT3) appear to have undergone minor post-depositional disturbance as indicated by the absence of the smaller fraction of artifacts and linear orientation for this 2.44 Ma archeological horizon (NMT3; see Supplementary Figs. Abrasion on artifacts is present in some of the artifacts, yet thin sharp edges are preserved in the assemblages (% of assemblage exhibiting abrasion ranges from 18-22%). Geochemical and mechanical damage to the surfaces of many of the fossil bone specimens prevents a detailed taphonomic analysis of bone modification in the faunal assemblage. However, some specimens within the 2.58 Ma assemblage include well-preserved surfaces that possess butchery marks indicating that hominins used tools to extract high-quality dietary resources from large mammalian remains (see Supplementary Fig. These archeological horizons are correlated to the composite stratigraphy for the Area 40 region. Wall sections depict the distribution of artifacts in these stratigraphic units. The right diagrams reflect the proportion of artifacts in major typological categories102 and the major rock types present in these archeological assemblages (see Supplementary Data 3). A high prevalence of chalcedony is evident in all the archeological horizons. Yellow circles represent individual stone artifacts greater than 2 cm, white-blue stars represent faunal specimens recovered in situ during excavations (see Supplementary Fig. Note that fauna was poorly preserved in the older and younger time horizons. Artifacts from Namorotukunan exhibit many features that are diagnostic of anthropogenic conchoidal fracture (e.g., prominent bulbs of percussion, clear striking platforms, contiguous flake scars; although see Proffitt et al.9,33) and are dominated by smaller flakes and simple cores. High proportions of sharp-edged flakes and fragments, comprising 94.2 to 79.4% of the assemblages, indicate sharp edges were the likely focus of this technology. Early Oldowan assemblages tend to have flakes that are of similar dimension to their cores (as opposed to Acheulean sites where cores are much larger) and have fewer flake scars on cores (as compared to younger Oldowan assemblages3,12 (Fig. Various technological attributes indicate that the Namorotukunan assemblages are more similar to other early Oldowan assemblages (e.g., Bokol Dora 1; Nyayanga) than assemblages younger than 1.8 Ma (Fig. Evidence of an understanding of fracture mechanics (e.g., relationship between platform angles and other technological features) is similar between hominins that produced the assemblages at Namorotukunan and older Oldowan assemblages (Supplementary Fig. Cores from the Namorotukunan assemblages also show similar patterns to those seen at other early Oldowan assemblages ( > 2.3 Ma) where cores are rarely rotated during production (% Cores that are Unifacial; Fig. Although percussive tools are infrequent in the Namorotukunan assemblage, the appearance of heavily battered artifacts ( < 1% of assemblage; NMT2) confirms the presence of percussive activities (Supplementary Fig. Comparisons of raw material selectivity demonstrate fine grained chalcedony at proportions that are significantly greater than its presence in nearby conglomerates (Supplementary Fig. We note that although hominins at Namorotukunan appear to be selective in their selection of specific rock types, there is little evidence of transport of stone. Gravels (braided river system deposits) that carried cobbles suitable for artifact manufacture were present in coarser grained sediments directly adjacent to all archeological sites. This level of selectivity is evident in all three assemblages and suggests a persistent preference for materials that fracture consistently (Supplementary Fig. A Principal components analysis of major technological features of several of the earliest stone tool industries currently known (Supplementary Data 6, 7). PCA scores were used to calculate a K-means cluster analysis. The shaded polygons (convex hulls) are the results of this K-means cluster analysis. In addition to early archeological assemblages, we include here assemblages made unintentionally by both Capuchins (SCNP33) and long-tailed macaques (Lobi Bay9). B The analysis of eigenvectors indicates that most Oldowan (and primate) assemblages are distinguished from Lomekwi by their smaller size and relative infrequency of cores. Most early Oldowan assemblages cluster together based on the relative size of flakes compared to cores. C Technological variables describing core forms analyzed from 3D models of cores (See “Methods”). Boxplots represent the interquartile range of data. Whiskers represent the upper and lower quartile. ; In numerous variables the Namorotukunan assemblage is similar to early Oldowan ( > 2.0 Ma) assemblages but significantly different from the Lomekwi 3 assemblage as well as the later Oldowan and early Acheulean assemblages (Supplementary Figs. The stratigraphic sequence in Area 40 of the KF Fm provides a framework for examining the paleoecological conditions from ~3.44 to ~2.0 million years ago. The existence of paleosols, along with accompanying sediments and fauna, facilitates a multiproxy reconstruction of the fluctuating environmental conditions within this period. Pedogenic carbonates, plant wax biomarkers, and phytoliths provide detailed information (Fig. The range of values from some paleoenvironmental proxies indicate the presence of diverse habitats within some temporal intervals (e.g., δ13C values of pedogenic carbonates −10 to −2 ‰). However, when fitting linear estimates through the data, there are coincident changes that suggest an increase in C4 vegetation and a decrease in water availability in the gravel and paleosol interval (2.7-2.2 Ma; Supplementary Fig. This is supported by increases in the δ13C values of C31 and C33 n-alkanes that indicate an increase in C4 vegetation and likely, open habitats, in the gravel and paleosol interval. Phytolith analysis indicates an overall decrease in grass phytoliths that characterize the gravel and paleosol interval (Fig. High incidences of palm and sedge phytoliths before these red silts, paleosols, and sands interval, indicate the presence of substantial standing water in these habitats (3.4 – 2.6 Ma) that is notably absent in the younger sediments, the gravel and paleosol interval (2.6-2.2 Ma). Significant increases in microcharcoals, associated with landscape-scale wildfires, point to a more seasonally arid habitat beginning around the onset of the gravel and paleosol interval (2.7-2.6 Ma; Fig. Seasonality probably played a key role, as shown by investigations of paleo-fire frequency on more recent timescales in Africa34. Phytoliths from the 2.7-2.2 Ma time interval (Fig. 6) show increased shrub-derived morphotypes and decreased grass phytoliths, further suggesting a shift towards more seasonally arid habitats. This is further supported by the presence of phytoliths of C4 Chloridoideae grasses suggesting xerophytic habitats consistent with arid conditions at this time. Chemical index of alteration (CIA) and mean annual precipitation (MAP) was calculated based on bulk geochemistry of paleosol samples (see “Methods” and Supplementary Note 2). High CIA values indicate removal of labile cations (Ca2+, Na+ and K+) relative to Al3+ during the chemical weathering of silicate minerals under wet climatic conditions and low values indicate absence of the chemical weathering under dry climate35,36. Low CIA values (<55) between 2.9 and 2.7 Ma indicates dry climate (Fig. MAP calculated using geochemical climofunctions for paleosols varies between 231 and 855 mm/year, broadly classifying the climate as semi-arid to semi-humid. MAP follows a similar trend as of CIA and lowest MAP is recorded between 2.7 and 2.6 Ma indicating an increased aridity at this time interval. The time frame between 2.7 and 2.2 Ma is associated with the relatively low MAP estimates. This pattern is reversed at the return of lacustrine environments (i.e., Paleo-Lake Lorenyang) at the top of the sequence (2.2-2.0 Ma) (Fig. Environmental magnetic analysis of bulk sediments confirms the reliability of our paleomagnetic approach. The analysis indicates that magnetite is the primary iron oxide, carrying magnetic properties in nearly all samples. There are relatively few identifiable faunal specimens from the entire sedimentary sequence in Area 40 (Supplementary Data 5). However, those species that are present in the gravel and paleosol interval indicate relatively open habitats. Antilopin and alcelaphin bovids as well as equids are the most abundant taxa. Several suids are also present, but most notably those associated with grass dominated habitats (e.g., Metridiochoerus37,38). The archeological sites examined in this study were recovered from sediments that range between 2.75 and 2.44 Ma. Deposits representing this time interval, which includes the Burgi Unconformity, were previously thought to be absent in most of the northern portion of the KF Fm21,24,39. However, sediments of this age have been documented in various locations within the northern Koobi Fora Formation40. The presence of dated horizons confirms active sedimentation on the east side of Lake Turkana in the terminal Pliocene [(e.g., Aberegaiye Tuff (2.7 Ma) in Area 11640 and Area 13021; Tuff D-5-2 of the Shungura Fm. The oldest archeological horizon (NMT1) is situated in unit C1-S3 and lies 2.3 meters below the Gauss-Matuyama boundary (C2An-C2r), with an attributed age of 2.75 million years. Excavations in unit P2/C2 (NMT2) directly overlie the Gauss-Matuyama boundary and are estimated at 2.60 million years. The uppermost archeological excavation is located in unit C3 and is positioned stratigraphically ~2 meters above the Gauss-Matuyama boundary (C2An-C2r), with an attributed age of 2.44 million years. This aligns with previously reported known Oldowan assemblages which also appear in the upper Gauss Chron (Bokol Dora 112; Nyayanga 33). Hominins at Namorotukunan appear to have had an acute understanding of the mechanical properties of rocks used for artifact manufacture. Numerous lithologies were available to make stone artifacts (including basalt, which was overwhelmingly favored for tool production later in the Koobi Fora Formation sequence [Supplementary Fig. 1341], yet the degree of selection for fine-grained raw materials at the assemblages at Namorotukunan is similar to or exceeds levels of selectivity in younger assemblages (Supplementary Fig. Fine-grained crypto-crystalline rocks, (e.g., chalcedony, jasper) available in conglomerates in the Koobi Fora Formation, have mechanical properties that result in predictable fracture patterns (Supplementary Fig. This selection for fine-grained raw materials is a characteristic feature of Oldowan assemblages (Supplementary Fig. Artifacts from Namorotukunan indicate that hominin toolmakers had a clear understanding of some components of stone knapping as indicated by the interaction between flaking angles and where they struck cores (Supplementary Fig. This is a substantial departure from flakes produced by percussive activities (Supplementary Fig 18). Whole flakes produced in each assemblage from Namorotukunan indicate morphological overlap with individual flakes produced during percussive tool use by modern non-human primates. However, at an assemblage scale, flakes from Namorotukunan are distinguished from those produced by percussive activities by their shapes and technological attributes (Supplementary Fig. Analysis of the relationships between flaking surfaces indicates that Namorotukunan hominins rotated cores less frequently than those found in later Oldowan assemblages43 (Fig. 5), suggesting that hominins had not mastered some of the features associated with advanced flintknapping skills44. In many respects the overall technological pattern of all the Namorotukunan assemblages most closely aligns with the known Oldowan sites (Fig. The older, 3.3 Ma Lomekwi 3 assemblage represents a distinctive technology compared to Namorotukunan and other early Oldowan sites (Fig. Lomekwi 3 includes extraordinarily large cores, with relatively few flaking surfaces and extensive evidence of battering associated with percussive activities6. The data from Namorotukunan further supports previous analysis that indicate that the earliest Oldowan represents a distinct technological strategy from that which is seen in the earlier Lomekwian technology3,12. This assertion is supported by the expansion of Oldowan assemblages earlier in time45. Paleoenvironmental reconstructions from older records46, in the vicinity of Namorotukunan (~25 km. to the south in Area 129) suggest high variability between C4 and C3-dominated ecosystems ~3.60-3.44 million years ago. Directly after the Tulu Bor volcanic eruption, ~3.44 million years ago, the paleo landscape around Namorotukunan exhibited characteristics of a humid floodplain situated near a permanent body of water. High occurrences of palms and sedges before 2.8 million years ago suggest the existence of significant standing water or a high water table in these environments (Fig. MAP is estimated to have reached around 855 mm per year in the older sediments (Fig. Around 2.8 to 2.7 million years ago, the landscape underwent a profound transformation, transitioning into alternating channel and floodplain deposits (lithofacies) of a paleo-river system. This change likely resulted from a retreat of the paleo-lake shoreline due to the onset of a drier climate, as indicated by the decrease in MAP to under 300 mm per year (Fig. 6), as reflected in paleosol geochemistry at Namorotukunan after 2.75 million years ago. Paleo-vegetation studies (e.g., phytoliths, plant-wax biomarkers) provide further support for the hypothesis of a vegetation reorganization after 2.75 million years. a Mean annual precipitation (MAP) estimates obtained from paleosol geochemistry (mm/year) follow a similar trend with the Chemical index of alteration (CIA), red numbered dots represent the three archeological horizons (1. NMT3); b Microcharcoal and diatoms found in the phytolith samples (counts); c Composite record of pedogenic carbonate δ13Cpedcarb values from East and West Turkana, compiled from existing literature by Levin (2013) and combined with new paleosol δ13Cpedcarb data from site Namorotukunan and its surroundings (‰, VPDB); d An overview of paleoclimatic trends observed from plant wax biomarkers in Namorotukunan, in this study. (Basin Scale) Climate change in the Turkana Basin: e Changes in the landscape composition based on faunal composition48; f Changes in the abundance of open country adapted bovids90; g Water deficit (ES-EI index) estimates (mm/year) based on δ18Oenamel91,92). The older part of the stratigraphic sequence ( > 2.75 Ma) is characterized by a higher occurrence of C3 vegetation (Fig. An increase in C4 vegetation occurs after 2.75 million years. The general increase in δ13C values observed in the n-alkanes reflects a period of perturbation, with significant fluctuations, likely triggered by changes in vegetation and adaptation to drier climates (Fig. Phytolith analysis indicates an overall reduction in grass phytoliths around 2.9 million years ago (Supplementary Fig. The presence of phytoliths indicating shrubs and a notable increase in microcharcoals (evidence of landscape-scale wildfires) point to a more arid environment around 2.7–2.8 million years ago. This is further reinforced by the presence of C4 Chloridoideae grasses, suggesting xerophytic habitats consistent with arid conditions after 2.8 million years ago. ~2.2 million years ago, evidence from facies changes at Namorotukunan and in the nearby ( < 200 m laterally) sediments suggest that the landscape experienced yet another transformation to a lacustrine domain28. At this time much of Area 40 was flooded by the Paleo-Lake Lorenyang, a precursor to the modern-day Lake Turkana28. Following an initial inundation, that left the Namorotukunan area completely submerged, the lake receded, and the area around Namorotukunan evolved into a shallow-water nearshore depositional environment. However, this regression was short-lived, and the lake expanded once again. The base of this subsequent lake transgression is characterized by rich catfish bone beds that may be indicative of an environmental catastrophe within the lake. This has previously been documented in West Turkana, resulting from a shift to an endorheic regime following the closure of the lake's outflow47. During the late Pliocene, the EARS witnessed significant landscape and climate transformations such as lake regression and aridification (Fig. that significantly transformed vegetation communities, expanded grasslands, reduced woody cover, and altered the physiognomic composition as well as available resources to hominin and non-hominin species55. These changes were instrumental in shaping the evolution and adaptations of both flora and fauna in eastern Africa as we show locally in this study15,46,51,56,57. Artifact levels represent records of localized paleolandscapes shaped by a unique convergence of conditions. Geological factors ensured the availability of large cobbles that can be used to make stone artifacts, while features of paleoriver systems (e.g., point bars) facilitated the rapid burial of artifacts in archeological deposits. Paleoecological conditions provided foraging resources that encouraged tool use (i.e., open habitats had higher frequencies of resources that required tool use58). The co-occurrence of hominins as well as local ecological conditions that favored tool manufacture and burial resulted in the presence of these concentrations of artifacts. These conditions were met during a relatively dry climate episodes in the Namorotukunan area between 2.75 and 2.44 Ma. Factors that favored the production and burial of artifacts likely shifted within the basin in concert with global and regional environmental factors. Orbital variability has played a major role in shaping the climate and landscapes in eastern Africa, including during the late Pliocene and Pleistocene interval studied here, primarily through its influence on the intensity of the East African monsoon59,60. A pivotal event during this period was the closure of the Panama Seaway roughly between 2.8 to 2.5 million years ago, which had profound implications for Earth's climate and ecosystems61. This closure disrupted ocean circulation patterns and contributed to the formation of the Atlantic Ocean Gulf Stream, exerting a substantial influence on North America and Northwestern Europe62. This led to a cascade of climatic effects, including the rapid strengthening of the Westerlies at around 2.75 million years ago64 and a similar strengthening of the NE trade winds at about 2.7 million years ago, as documented through various records offshore of western Africa65. This shift in wind directions and their overall influence on aridification in various parts of Africa likely influenced the overall drying trend, the increase in C4 vegetation, and possibly increased wildfires based on microcharcoal data presented here. In the context of human evolution, the late Pliocene climate and ecosystem changes in eastern Africa likely exerted selective pressures on all fauna, including hominins. It influenced their dietary adaptations and behavioral strategies as they adapted to shifting ecological pressures66. As these shifts impacted different parts of Africa separately, it is likely that such selective pressures on tool use impacted different populations at different times54. This period of aridification played a role in shaping the ecological context in which the behaviors of our human ancestors evolved67. The significant climatic shifts seen throughout eastern Africa ~2.75 Ma, highlighted in the sequence at Namorotukunan, may have heightened the need for hominins to expand their dietary niche by incorporating high-quality dietary resources (i.e., animal tissues) into their diet14,66,69. This shift in the dietary niche resulted in a subsequent release of selective pressures on the various hominins living on this landscape, including the earliest known members of the genus Homo70 and occurs concurrently with environmental shifts in Ethiopia15,55. Elsewhere in eastern Africa these changes are associated with the appearance of early Homo11,15,55. The hominin fossil record in the KF Formation at this time is limited. Further south in the Koobi Fora Formation, KNM-ER 5431 has been attributed to early Homo71; but also shares affinities with Australopithecus72) and may be older than Namorotukunan73. Currently, detailed chronostratigraphic information for these specimens is not well resolved74. The development of consistent production of sharp-edged tools likely improved the foraging energetic return of hominins in the Pliocene16, similar to the increased foraging efficiency seen in various extant primates75. Controversial evidence of the earliest technology elsewhere in eastern Africa at Lomekwi6 (although see Archer et al.7), along with the butchered bones from Dikika, Ethiopia76 (although see Dominguez-Rodrigo77), indicate that tool use could be a shared ancestral trait (i.e., plesiomorphic), already present in the last common ancestor with Pan, and may reflect a more generalized primate pattern of tool use9,78. Importantly, even though the different stratigraphic horizons are separated by hundreds of thousands of years, the regular association between such river systems and stone artifacts is ubiquitous in the sedimentary record at Namorotukunan. As with similar localities in eastern Africa the presence of rivers that transported and provided raw material appears to structure the frequency of stone artifact production41,79. In the northeastern portion of the Turkana Basin, large rivers transporting raw material are intermittent in the sedimentary sequence between 3.4 and 2.1 Ma (Fig. River systems that carry cobbles only appear ~2.7 Ma, in Area 40, coincident with the oldest archeological levels. This suggests that this technology in the Namorotukunan area was likely both limited and facilitated by raw material availability5. Therefore, the absence of stone tools earlier in the record of this region could indicate fluvial source area and drainage paleogeography that result in a paucity of rocks available to make stone artifacts. Our paleoenvironmental data reveal climate-driven dynamic landscape evolution in East Turkana during the late Pliocene. This period witnessed the disappearance of lake-proximal environments after 3.44 Ma, which were replaced by a semi-arid alluvial landscape with episodes of paleoriver activity including channel and floodplain (paleosol) deposition28,39,52 until the region experienced a re-inundation by the Paleo-Lake Lorenyang around 2.2 million years ago. These paleo landscape transformations likely mirror fluctuations at regional and global scales. Increased aridity from ~2.75 million years ago was followed by a transition to more humid conditions around 2.1 million years ago (Supplementary Fig. Evidence for similar shifts near the Plio-Pleistocene boundary has been documented in multiple parts of the EARS15,55,68. Comparable to other early Oldowan sites (e.g., Bokol Dora, Gona: Ethiopia and Nyayanga: Kenya), the emergence of regular production of sharp flakes at the Namorotukunan site represents a derived trait complex, possibly connected to innovative foraging behaviors3,12. The presence of butchery marks on one specimen (Supplementary Fig. 8; NMT2) confirms that a portion of this adaptation was associated with access to some large mammal tissues from carcasses14. A possible focus on meat from carcasses is further supported by the prevalent use of crypto-crystalline silica in the artifact assemblages. This type of rock, known for its uniformity and high silica content, is excellent for the production of numerous smaller sharp-edged tools80, but its appearance in mostly smaller, brittle cobbles makes it unsuitable for percussive tools. The use of sharp-edged tools significantly enhances the extraction of nutritionally rich food sources from mammal tissues16. This change in behavior may not align with the appearance of the genus Homo, however variability in the available sedimentary record limits our ability to resolve the co-occurrence of biological and behavioral shifts81. Oldowan technology in the Turkana Basin appeared during periods of dynamic climate and ecological change. However, the persistent nature of stone tool technology from 2.75 throughout to 2.44 Ma is consistent with the hypothesis that it reflects an enduring adaptation. The technological innovations that distinguish our lineage, particularly those that emerged in the later stages of the Pleistocene83, could represent a distinct development that originated independently from the array of varied tool-based behaviors that began in the Pliocene6,76. Excavations at Namorotukunan were conducted in Area 40 (East Turkana Basin, Northern Kenya) between 2013 and 2022. The objective was to excavate known Early Pleistocene localities19 to provide a multi-disciplinary context for the Oldowan lithic assemblage found at the site (Fig. All material was excavated according to discrete stratigraphic horizons. Archeological material was mapped to the nearest mm using a total station Leica Builder 505 with a TDS Nomad 900 LE using EDM Mobile 5.1bt84. Detailed stratigraphic information for many artifacts was captured using three-dimensional photogrammetric models of artifacts in their in situ context. Excavations were conducted under the auspices of a permit provided by the National Council for Science and Technology of Kenya. Excavations and collections were carried out under the auspices of an Exploration and Excavation Permit provided by the Kenyan Ministry of Heritage, Tourism and Culture. This research was carried out with permissions granted by the National Museums of Kenya and the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology of the Republic of Kenya (MOEST 13/001/31 C 216 and NACOSTI/P/23/31328). All artifacts were measured using standard caliper and goniometer measures at the Archeology Division of the National Museums of Kenya in Nairobi. Comparisons of technological variables were compiled from the literature following recent reviews3. These models were captured using a structured light scanner (Einscan). Three dimensional models were captured at the National Museums of Kenya (with the exception of the Lomekwi 3 collection which was captured from models available at http:africanfossils.org). Three dimensional models were analyzed using morphometric packages in the R statistical computer language (Morpho, bezier, Rvcg, rgl). Placement of landmarks on three dimensional models was conducted using MeshLab software (2022.10). Variables (e.g., rotation angle between flake scars) were calculated from three dimensional models. Data in this analysis deviate significantly from a normal distribution. As such we calculated differences between groups using a permutation test that compared differences between groups to 10000 resampled simulated assemblages of similar size samples from the entire data set. Significance values are estimated based on the probability of finding similar differences in resampled data sets. Faunal specimens were analyzed in the Archeology Division of the National Museums of Kenya. Modifications to bone surfaces were identified using a 5X hand lens. Further imaging of modifications took place on a Sensofar Nanofocus spinning disk microscope at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. Lithological characterization was conducted in situ across various studied sections, where each section was thoroughly examined to identify and describe the rock types present. Observations focused on key characteristics including texture, color, mineral composition, and structural features (Supplementary Table 2). Systematic sampling was performed, with rock samples collected for detailed laboratory analyses. To synthesize the geological attributes of the area, seven distinct sections (A-G) were logged, sampled, and measured using a combination of geological field techniques and geochemical methods as well as site fabric analysis. The overlapping seven sections were combined in a composite section (Supplementary Fig. These descriptions were then integrated to construct a composite synthetic section that represents the overall geological framework and variability across the study area, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the geological context and its spatial heterogeneity. Lateral geological features were documented to assess the horizontal continuity and distribution of rock formations. These observations were crucial for understanding the lateral extent of geological phenomena and their implications on the regional geological setting. High-detail examination of cut and fill features was undertaken to interpret the processes of erosion and deposition that have influenced the landscape. This included detailed logging of stratigraphic sections to identify sequences of deposition, erosional unconformities, and associated geological processes. We used paleomagnetism and geochemistry to refine age markers in the section. 160 oriented samples were specifically collected for paleomagnetic studies. Paleomagnetic studies were mainly focused on magnetostratigraphy, aimed at identifying magnetic polarity reversals. Geochemical methods were employed to verify if the signatures of the tephra correspond to well dated tephra in the region. Additionally, 222 unoriented samples were taken for paleoenvironmental reconstruction analyses. We used a multiproxy approach (including Rock-Magnetism, Geochemistry, Phytoliths, etc.) from well dated stratigraphic levels, to describe the paleoenvironmental shifts in the East Turkana environments. Paleomagnetic samples from the Namorotukunan site were collected across seven trench sections (A–G) (Supplementary Fig. S16; Supplementary Note 1) during six field campaigns conducted between 2012-2022. Using a 2.5 cm-diameter diamond-coated bit powered by hand operated air pump (necessary because water cooling would destroy unconsolidated samples) samples were oriented with a geological compass and inclinometer. In the Utrecht paleomagnetic facility 160 samples (Supplementary Fig. These methods were employed to isolate primary magnetic components and minimize overprinting. Samples were measured at the Fort Hoofddijk Paleomagnetic Laboratory (Utrecht University) and at the CENIEH (Centro Nacional de Investigación sobre la Evolución Humana), demagnetization utilized a 2 G Enterprises DC SQUID cryogenic magnetometer with an in-line, triaxial, AF demagnetizer for the AF samples, and an ASC thermal demagnetizer (residual field <20 nT) for the Th samples. The demagnetization results were interpreted using Paleomagnetism.org85, Characteristic Remanent Magnetization (ChRM) directions were typically isolated between 15–45 mT or 150–600 °C. Paleomagnetic directions were calculated using principal component analysis86 based on a minimum of four consecutive steps, ensuring the reliability and robustness of the outcomes (refer to Supplementary Data 1). For rock magnetic insights, a separate sample set underwent Isothermal Remanent Magnetization (IRM) acquisition curve measurements (up to 1.5 T) using a MicroMag Model 3900 Series VSM vibrating sample magnetometer (Lake Shore Measurements). These rock magnetic analyses complemented the paleomagnetic investigations, providing a comprehensive understanding of the magnetic properties within the sampled materials. Samples of the Tulu Bor Tuff were collected at (4.399161 N / 36. 326657 E WGS 84) and were based on previous descriptions of the Tulu Bor Tuff in Area 4021. Samples of the Tulu Bor Tuff were analyzed for geochemistry by electron microprobe (EMP) on a JEOL 8900 Superprobe instrument housed at the Carnegie Institution for Science's Geophysical Laboratory. Samples were measured using wavelength-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (WDS) using the following analytical setup: accelerating voltage = 12 keV, beam current = 10 nA, and a beam diameter = 10 μm, conditions ideal for reducing alkali loss while obtaining reliable counts for elements such as Fe. Pedogenic carbonates were collected from a 3 km2 region within paleontological Area 40. Samples were collected from paleosols with evidence of pedogenesis such as dish structures and root casts. Samples were collected from trenches that were at least 40 cm beneath the estimated top of the pedogenic horizon. Samples were limited to paleosols with discrete nodules. 47 pedogenic carbonates were collected from this region and results are presented in Fig. Carbonate nodules were isolated from the surrounding sediment using a rotary diamond bit to remove debris, after which they were manually homogenized in a mortar and pestle. The homogenized carbonate reacted with 100% H3PO4 at 90 °C. A dual inlet Thermo MAT253 isotope ratio mass spectrometer analyzed the resulting CO2 gasses for 13C/12C. Sample results were calibrated using an internal Hagit Carrara marble standard and an NBS-19 calcite standard. The average standard precision over multiple runs was 0.5–0.04 ‰ for 13C at Johns Hopkins University. Sediment samples were collected in the field directly onto Al foil. Samples came from at least 40 cm below modern surfaces and were screened to ensure modern plant material (e.g., roots) was absent. In the lab, samples were rinsed with an organic solvent, dichloromethane (DCM), to remove possible surface contaminants. Samples were then wrapped in foil, placed on a steel plate, and gently disaggregated with a hammer into 1–4 cm size pieces. About 200 g of sample was further crushed into a powder using a solvent-rinsed mortar and pestle. An average of 190.8 g (min: 172.6; max: 198.7 g) of sample was extracted using a Dionex Accelerated Solvent Extractor 350 over three consecutive aliquots ( ~ 64 g each) of sample packed into 66 ml cells. Soluble lipids were extracted at 100 °C and 1600 psi (110.3 bar) over four 10-min static cycles with 9:1 DCM:methanol. A recovery standard was added to the total lipid extract (TLE) after extraction. The TLE was dried down under purified nitrogen and compounds were separated into aliphatic, ketone and ester, polar fractions via silica gel flash column chromatography using hexanes, DCM, and methanol, respectively. n-Alkanes were characterized and quantified on an Agilent gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890 A GC) equipped with both a mass selective detector (5975 C MSD) and flame ionization detector (FID). One microliter of sample dissolved in 100 ml hexane was injected into a multi-mode inlet injector at 60 °C (0.1 min hold), which was then ramped to 320 °C at 900 °C/min and held for the duration of the analysis. A helium-purged microfluidics device downstream of a DB-5 column (30 m length, 250 mm ID) quantitatively split the GC flow to the MSD and FID detectors. Compound identification was done with comparison of mass spectra and retention times to authentic standards, and quantification was done using MSD peak areas using a response factor correction based upon the peak area of known concentrations of internal standards added to the TLE. The carbon preference index (CPI) was calculated using the equation of Marzi et al.87 and average chain length (ACL) was calculated as ∑bi=aiCi/∑bi=aCi, where Ci is the concentration of the molecule with chain length i and i = 27, 29, 31, 33, 35 for n-alkanes. Carbon isotope ratios of n-alkanes were analyzed using a GC coupled to a Thermo Delta V isotope ratio mass spectrometer through a combustion interface at the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory Stable Isotope Laboratory. All sample injections were interspersed with injections of molecular mixtures with known isotopic values (mixes A4 and A5 supplied by Arndt Schimmelmann, Univ. Samples were injected in duplicate or triplicate when feasible. To extract phytoliths from sediment, ~1 g of sediment was treated with 10% hydrochloric acid (HCL) to remove the carbonates. Samples were then washed using distilled water and sieved at 250 µm to remove larger particles ( > 250 µm) and then treated with nitric acid (HNO3) to remove organic matter through an oxidation process. The remaining material was gently sieved through a 53 µm sieve to loosen clay particles adhered to phytoliths for clarity during microscopy analyses. Samples noted to have stubborn clays were further cleaned by repeated sedimentation process and, when necessary, sodium hexametaphosphate was added to deflocculate clays, followed by multiple washing, decanting and centrifuging processes. To float the phytoliths/bio-silica, we added 10 ml of sodium polytungstate with specific gravity of 2.4 g/cm3. Phytoliths were pipetted out to another set of centrifuge tubes for final distilled water washing and recovery. The recovered residue was dried, and 0.002 g of this was mounted using “Entellen New” mounting media (refractive index 1.53) on a slide and viewed under Carl Zeiss Scope A1 light microscope. Observation, counting and classification was done at 400x magnification. Where necessary, oil immersion was done for Grass Short Silica Cells (GSSCs) morphotypes and photography. Microphotographs were taken by USB 3.0 Digital Camera, THORLABS. Phytolith classification largely followed International Code for Phytolith Nomenclature (ICPN) 1.0 and 2.088 for both non-GSSCs and GSSCs phytoliths. Only well preserved phytoliths were counted and classified to taxon; weathered phytoliths were classified as indeterminate. Except for one sample, all yielded statistically reliable phytolith counts averaging above 300 morphotypes. Each sample (2 ml) was mixed with 3% sodium hexametaphosphate (NaPO3)6 in a water bath (90 °C) for 30 min and mechanically agitated over several days. Lycopodium spore tables were added to calculate pollen and microcharcoal concentrations. Separation of pollen and charcoal was done using gentle mechanical agitation over several days followed by heavy liquid separation using lithium heteropolytungstate at specific gravity 2.0. Acetolysis was achieved through a 9:1 mixture of C4H6O3 to H2SO4 and 10% HCl. The samples were mounted on a microscope slide with glycerol (cover: 22 × 40 mm = inspected area). System microscopy was done at 25x, 40x, 63x. A minimum of 350 pollen grains and 200 microcharcoal were counted. Bulk paleosols (n = 22) underwent major oxide concentration analysis using the XRF fusion bead method on a Zetium model spectrometer at Laboratório de Caracterização Tecnológica (LCT), Universidade de São Paulo (USP), Brazil. Samples ( < 200 mesh) were agate-milled to minimize metal contamination. About 1 g of finely powdered samples was fused with lithium tetraborate (Li2B4O7) to form glass beads, eliminating particle size and matrix effects. Precision, reflected by relative standard deviation (RSD), was 1% for major oxides and ~2.8% for minor oxide P2O5. Loss on Ignition (LOI) estimation involved heating ~1 g of finely powdered samples at 1020 °C for 2 h using a muffle furnace, presenting LOI (wt%) = 100 × (ash weight1020 °C/sample weight). ICP OES analysis on selected pedogenic carbonate-free paleosols (n = 8) determined CaO* in silicates. Pedogenic carbonate removal involved treatment with 1 N HCl, followed by washing, drying, and multi-acid digestion (HF: HNO3: HClO4: HCl). A 300 mg powdered ( < 200 mesh) sample underwent digestion with 2.4 ml of HCl-HF-HNO3 mixture (2:2:1). The analysis was performed on an iCap 6300 Duo model Thermo Scientific spectrometer at LCT, USP, using standards GBW 07401 and GBW 07404 for quality control within the same digestion conditions.

Ionic transport within porous carbon electrodes is crucial for optimizing charge and discharge rates in supercapacitors, yet the material properties governing ion dynamics remain poorly understood. Unlike the traditional viewpoint, here we find that mesoporosity does not necessarily correlate with a high supercapacitor rate capability. We employed pulsed-field-gradient nuclear magnetic resonance to directly measure the anionic effective diffusivities in the carbon pores. This technique probes ionic transport in supercapacitors. Our findings reveal a major discrepancy between short-range and long-range diffusivities, which captures the tortuosity of the pore network. Short-range diffusivities lack correlation with supercapacitor rate capability, whereas long-range diffusivities correlate strongly. Low-tortuosity nanoporous carbon exhibited superior rate capability, which highlights the importance of well-interconnected pore networks for efficient ion transport. Our study reveals that the pore network tortuosity is a key factor governing charging rates in amorphous nanoporous carbon and that it can be used to guide the design of electrodes with optimized transport channels to enhance supercapacitor performance. Electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) are high-performance energy-storage devices known for their rapid charge and discharge capabilities and long cycle lives. These devices typically consist of nanoporous electrodes immersed in electrolyte solutions1,2, with carbon-based materials being the most widely used due to their high surface area and chemical stability1,3. This nanoporous carbon is composed of defective graphene-like fragments that form the pore walls of a three-dimensional porous network with a range of pore sizes4. Although much of the current research is focused on increasing the energy density of EDLCs, either by maximizing the cell voltage or by improving the specific capacitance of the electrodes5, the role of electrode material and electrolyte in the rate capability, an advantage of EDLCs, is sometimes overlooked. Efficient ionic transport is crucial for maintaining performance at high charge and discharge rates6,7,8, particularly in thick electrodes that can be used to increase the supercapacitor energy density9,10,11. Electrode mesoporosity (having pores with diameters of 2–50 nm) is often mentioned as a critical component for efficient ionic transport. The mesopores serve as a bridge between micropores (where charge storage occurs) and the bulk electrolyte12,13,14,15,16,17. However, the relation between mesoporosity, ionic transport and performance remains insufficiently understood. Although some studies have demonstrated improved performance in materials with engineered mesoporous architectures (such as elongated channels designed to facilitate rapid ion transport8,9,10,11,18 or electrodes with etched microporous patterns19,20), others indicate that mesopores do not necessarily enhance ionic transport in carbon materials21,22. Disentangling the relative contributions of pore architecture, meso- and macroporous specific surface area (SSA), and ionic diffusion to supercapacitor performance remains a substantial challenge, and existing studies have been, in part, limited by the lack of characterization of ionic transport in such complex porous structures, particularly in commercial nanoporous carbon. Several techniques have been employed in attempts to analyse the pore structures of nanoporous carbon materials, each with inherent limitations. Gas physisorption, the standard method for evaluating the pore size distribution, relies on small gas molecules, so that it can overestimate the surface area and transport pathways accessible to larger electrolyte ions23. A pair distribution function analysis is effective for probing short-range atomic structures but is less well suited for investigating long-range pore connectivity or network organization24. Crystallographic techniques, like X-ray diffraction, are similarly limited by the lack of long-range order in amorphous carbon, whereas advanced tomographic methods, such as focused-ion-beam nanotomography, are restricted in resolution and cannot resolve micropores (<2 nm)25,26. One approach for relating the porosity of a material to its ability to transport ions or charge is the Bruggeman equation, which has been widely used to link porosity to transport properties in materials such as the graphite electrodes of a lithium-ion battery27,28. However, its assumptions of uniform particle distribution and isotropic pores are inadequate for nanoporous carbon, which features irregular shapes, broad size distributions and highly disordered, hollow structures. Consequently, studies investigating the role of mesoporosity in ionic transport often rely on transmission electron microscopy, which tends to emphasize and more readily characterize ordered regions of the structure, potentially overlooking the transport behaviour in disordered regions of amorphous carbon12,14,16. These limitations underscore the need for experimental approaches that directly probe electrolyte transport within the pore network. Such approaches are critical for understanding the role of mesoporosity in facilitating ion movement and optimizing supercapacitor performance at high current densities. Diffusion pulsed-field gradient (PFG) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a powerful technique for measuring transport in porous media and for investigating pore structure29,30. PFG NMR can measure the self-diffusion coefficients of molecules confined in the porosity, and it can characterize diffusion restrictions due to pore size, interconnectivity or surface interactions31,32. Tortuosity measurements obtained from PFG NMR have proven to be valuable for probing transport phenomena, and PFG NMR has been widely applied to the transport of hydrocarbon and shale gas in porous rocks33,34 and transport in ion-exchange membranes35,36. Tortuosity characterizes transport within a material. It describes the winding and indirect pathways for diffusion by highlighting the presence of dead ends, pore interconnectivity and multiscale diffusion properties35,36. In carbon-based EDLCs, in situ PFG NMR has been used to show that the ion diffusion coefficients are substantially reduced in nanoporous electrodes compared with the bulk, as the coefficients are modulated by changes in the ion population at the electrode–electrolyte interface during charging. Thus, PFG NMR has provided insights into the charging mechanism37. Other studies have used PFG NMR to investigate electrolyte diffusion in the hierarchical structures of nanoporous carbon, highlighting the interplay between diffusion, microporosity, mesoporosity and hierarchical pore architectures21,22. Although these template-assisted materials have provided initial insights into ion transport within complex structures, questions remain regarding diffusion across various length scales, pore connectivity and the characterization of pore architecture in more disordered, template-free materials, which are more commonly used for industrial production. Addressing these aspects is crucial for evaluating charge and discharge rates and large-scale ion transport. In this study, we discover a connection between the fast-charging performance of supercapacitors and the ionic effective diffusion coefficient in the electrode nanopores. We assess the fast-charging capabilities of nanoporous carbon supercapacitors with electrochemistry experiments and employ PFG NMR to investigate the underlying mechanisms affecting performance. We hypothesize that increasing the tortuosity of the pore network impedes the transport of electrolyte ions to charge storage sites. By probing diffusion at >3 µm length scales (D∞), our results reveal a positive correlation between effective long-range diffusion and the rapid charge and discharge behaviour of supercapacitors. This relation is primarily influenced by material tortuosity. Building on previous NMR studies of supercapacitors37,38,39, our work identifies the pore network tortuosity as a critical factor linking electrode structure to charge and discharge rates, and it demonstrates how NMR can provide unique insights into the mechanisms driving supercapacitor efficiency. Electrochemical measurements on a group of activated carbon cloths (ACCs) showed similar capacitances at a low current density (50 mA g−1) in 1 M tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TEABF4) in acetonitrile (ACN) (Fig. 1a), indicating that a similar amount of energy can be stored and released upon slow charging and discharging. However, the capacitance decreases with increasing current density at rates that can vary notably between the different carbon materials, highlighting the necessity of characterizing and reporting electrode capacitance at a range of current densities to fully capture the performance of an electrode material (Fig. a, ACC series with different pore size distributions with 1 M TEABF4 electrolyte in ACN. b, ACC-15 with 1 M TEABF4 (ACN), 1 M TPABF4 (ACN) and 1 M TBABF4 (ACN) electrolytes with increasing cation size. To quantify the rate performance of electrode materials, we fitted the capacitance versus current density data with a decaying exponential function to obtain the rate capability J0, which represents the current density at which 63% of the initial capacitance is lost (Fig. Higher values of J0 indicate better supercapacitor rate performance. We found J0 values ranging from 1.6 A g−1 for ACC-10 up to 91.1 A g−1 for ACC-20 electrodes in 1 M TEABF4 electrolyte in ACN (Supplementary Fig. As ACC-20 has larger pores than ACC-10 (Supplementary Fig. 2), we hypothesized that this would reduce the restrictions on ionic transport during charging, leading to better rate performance. To test this hypothesis, we systematically varied the electrolyte cation size using a fixed electrode material (ACC-15), with TEABF4, tetrapropylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TPABF4) and tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TBABF4) electrolytes (1 M in ACN). Increasing the cation size reduced the fast-charging performance (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1) owing to the more restricted porosity accessible to the electrolyte40,41. Mesoporosity (pore sizes >2 nm) is often associated with providing transport channels for rapid electrolyte movement, whereas microporosity (pore sizes <2 nm) is linked to enhancing performance at low current densities due to its charge-storing surface interactions13,15,17,42. To examine the role of mesoporosity on rate capability, we performed rate capability measurements of nanoporous carbon with various combinations of micro- and mesopores (Supplementary Fig. We did not observe a strong correlation between rate capability with microporosity or mesoporosity measured for carbon and films (Fig. This indicates that mesoporosity is not the primary determinant of rate capability21,22. SSA measurements obtained from N2 adsorption can overestimate the surface area accessible to electrolyte molecules, as the narrow micropores accessible to N2 molecules might be inaccessible to the larger electrolyte ions. As a result, the SSA derived from N2 adsorption may not accurately represent the active surface area involved in electrochemical processes. Importantly, supercapacitor performance is not driven solely by surface area but by the efficient transport of ions through the pore network21,22, which is expected to depend on pore interconnectivity. Therefore, we hypothesized that directly studying electrolyte transport over longer length scales within the porous network using PFG NMR would provide a more accurate depiction of the factors determining good performance at high current densities. a,b, Correlations between the SSAs of micropores (<2 nm) (a) and mesopores (≥2 nm) (b) and electrode rate capability obtained from N2 isotherms at 77 K using a slit-pore carbon model and quenched-solid density functional theory. Error bars represent the 95% confidence intervals of the rate capability fits. PFG NMR probes ionic effective diffusion and tortuosity in the carbon nanopore network. It is a relevant approach because it characterizes how electrolyte ions navigate the meso- and microporous structure of the electrode under conditions like those in actual supercapacitor operation. To measure diffusion within the porosity of nanoporous carbon, here defined as the effective diffusion coefficient over a timescale (and, therefore, length scale) set by the experimental parameters, nanoporous carbon was loaded into an NMR tube, which was then filled with an excess of electrolyte to saturate the carbon pores in the absence of any external potential (Fig. In the 19F NMR spectra of ACC electrode materials soaked in 1 M TEABF4 electrolyte in ACN, we resolved in-pore and ex-pore anionic environments43,44,45 (Fig. In this context, ex-pore environments are where anions occupy the interstitial spaces between nanoporous particles and in-pore environments are where ions are confined within the carbon nanopores. PFG NMR measurements use gradient pulses to encode and decode the position of nuclear spins. If the positions of nuclei change during the experiment, for example, because of self-diffusion, the signal measured at the end of the experiment decreases, allowing the diffusion coefficient to be determined46. a, 19F NMR spectrum recorded at 9.4 T (corresponding to 400 MHz 1H Larmor frequency) revealing a free electrolyte environment (red, ex-pore) and an in-pore environment (green). b, Decay of the 19F signal intensity in the in-pore environment with an increase in the gradient strength revealing the presence of several components. c, Schematic of diffusion in nanoporous carbons, highlighting the ex-pore component (red), in-pore to ex-pore exchange (magenta) and slow component (blue).

Inset: The same data replotted on a logarithmic scale. displacement characterizing the diffusion transport distance in the gradient direction. Error bars were calculated based on the 95% confidence intervals from the diffusion measurement fits and rate capability measurements. Initially, ACC-15 saturated with 1 M TEABF4 (ACN) was studied using an intermediate diffusion time (85 ms). Diffusion 19F PFG NMR measurements reveal two components in the in-pore anionic environment (Fig. The dominant slow-diffusing component (Fig. 3b,c, blue component) corresponds to ionic diffusion within the porosity, which is influenced by electrolyte/surface interactions, pore connectivity and geometry. This component reflects the intrinsic transport properties of the electrode material. By contrast, the faster-diffusing component (Fig. 3b,c, magenta component) is driven by in-pore to ex-pore anion exchange, that is anions leaving a particle to enter another one during the diffusion time, leading to a greatly increased effective diffusion coefficient. This is expected to vary with particle packing and particle size22,37,47 but does not represent the intrinsic electrode properties and is, therefore, not analysed further. Unlike previous work37, no external potential was applied, so the effective diffusion coefficients reflect the ease of ionic transport in the porosity without contributions from electrostatic interactions during charging and discharging. For ACC-15 soaked with 1 M TEABF4 (ACN), the effective anionic in-pore diffusion coefficient decreases with increasing diffusion time (Fig. This contrasts with the neat electrolyte (Supplementary Fig. 3), in which the diffusion coefficient stays constant. Here we consider in-pore diffusion in two limiting cases: (1) D0, at a low diffusion time and (2) D∞, at long diffusion times. Because of their finite strength, the PFGs cannot capture slow diffusion processes at very low diffusion times, so D0 and D∞ were obtained by fitting the data. The fitting equation was adapted from the Taylor expansion introduced by Mitra et al.48, which is valid only in the limit of short diffusion times.By contrast, our generalized equation (equation (2)) satisfyingly captures the diffusion behaviour across both short and long diffusion times. The effective diffusion coefficient of anions at short diffusion time D0 (1.5 × 10−10 m2 s−1; Fig. 3d) was found to be one order of magnitude below that of anions in bulk electrolyte (1.5 × 10−9 m2 s−1; Supplementary Fig. This is due to the anionic adsorption of anions and solvent molecules within the pores, which slows down anionic diffusion. Over long diffusion times, ionic transport occurs across a larger pore network, which is measured by the effective long-range diffusion coefficient D∞ and is expected to be hindered by the size of the constrictions connecting the pores and the degree of interconnectivity between them, both of which determine whether the porosity is accessible to the electrolyte and contribute to the long-range diffusion coefficient at long diffusion times. Indeed, we found D∞ =5.8 × 10−12 m2 s−1 for BF4− ions diffusing in the pores of ACC-15, which is much lower than D0 (1.5 × 10−10 m2 s−1). The observed dependence of the effective diffusion coefficient on the diffusion times is a way to probe diffusion at different length scales49. displacement in the gradient direction \(\sqrt{\langle {z}^{2}\rangle} =\sqrt{2D\Delta }\), where Δ is the diffusion time and D the diffusion coefficient, provides an estimate of the transportation distance in the gradient direction z (ref. In this study, we were able to probe diffusion at the ~0.2–3 µm length scale (Fig. For the diffusion measurements made in this work, contributions from in-pore to ex-pore anionic exchange have been filtered out, and therefore, the measurements are limited when the r.m.s. displacement exceeds the particle size at longer diffusion times. Furthermore, note that the anionic r.m.s. displacements from self-diffusion are expected to be much smaller than those attained during charging when an electric field gradient driving ionic transport is applied. Therefore, the scope of this work is to characterize material properties rather than ionic transport across the electrode during charging. The discrepancy between the diffusion coefficient found at short diffusion times (D0) and long diffusion times (D∞) represents the diffusion coefficients in the two limiting cases of short-range diffusion (<0.2 µm) and long-range diffusion (>3 µm) (Fig. This discrepancy can be quantified using tortuosity values34, which are here defined as τ = D0/D∞, where the diffusion coefficients at short (D0) and long (D∞) diffusion times are obtained from PFG NMR. Tortuosity describes the extent to which the pathways within a porous material deviate from a straight line. It reflects the structural complexity of the material and is commonly quantified by comparing the effective distance travelled by diffusing particles with the shortest possible distance between two points (Fig. Given the large tortuosity values measured in our work, it was essential to extrapolate the short-range diffusion coefficient to values not limited by the finite gradient strengths imposed by the instrumentation, which set a lower bound on the diffusion times suitable for accurate diffusion measurements. To investigate the link between ionic transport and rate capability, we conducted PFG NMR measurements on various carbon powders and cloths saturated with 1 M TEABF4 (ACN), which was chosen to exhibit resolved in-pore and ex-pore environments in 19F spectra. These measurements were critical for separating the dominant bulk electrolyte signal from the much weaker in-pore contribution (Supplementary Figs. The selected carbon materials represent a broad range of rate capabilities (Supplementary Fig. 1), graphene-like domain sizes39 and pore size distributions (Supplementary Fig. Scanning electron microscopy images of powders and films (Supplementary Fig. 9) show that all samples contained particles (>3 µm) larger than the in-pore r.m.s. Nanoporous carbon electrodes traditionally require polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) binder to transform loose powders into self-standing films. However, this binder can obstruct pores and diminish electrochemical performance, and the film fabrication process considerably reduces the experimental throughput. We compared PFGs measurements between powders and films immersed in electrolyte to quantify these effects. Films containing 5 wt% PTFE exhibited an approximately 1.5-fold higher tortuosity and a corresponding 1.5-fold decrease in long-range diffusivity compared with unbound powders, directly demonstrating the restrictive effect of PTFE on electrolyte transport pathways (Supplementary Fig. Notably, these differences were modest relative to the variations in tortuosity and diffusivity across our different systems. Together, these findings indicate that, although film preparation can slightly reduce transport, powder-based measurements still provide valid insights into pore accessibility and transport phenomena. Using powders also streamlines sample handling and enables more rapid screening of carbon materials. The short-range (<0.2 µm) effective diffusion coefficient D0 did not show any clear correlation with the rate capability (Fig. 4a), SSA or capacitance (Supplementary Fig. By contrast, the long-range effective diffusion (>3 µm) D∞ showed a clear correlation with the measured rate capability (Fig. Carbon and electrolyte combinations with slower long-range anionic diffusivity D∞ typically have a lower rate performance, which indicates that long-range in-pore ionic transport (for example, ionic transport through the electrode) is much more important than short-range transport (for example, ions moving to form the electric double layer) in determining supercapacitor charging rates. The discrepancy between long-range and short-range ionic transport is further illustrated by the anionic r.m.s. displacements along the gradient axis (Supplementary Fig. 4), which indicate that typically much longer-range anionic transport is possible in samples with lower tortuosity. displacements from self-diffusion are typically much smaller than those attained during charging when an electric field gradient is applied. Consequently, D∞ does not grow linearly with the rate capability and plateaus at values above 100 A g−1. This indicates that power performance is not always limited by the approximately 3-µm ionic transport range observed in our experiments and that larger-scale structural features may play a role in enhancing performance. a, Correlation between short-range diffusion coefficient and rate capability. b, Correlation between long-range diffusion coefficient and rate capability. c, Correlation between long-range diffusion coefficient and mesoporous SSA (>2 nm porosity). d, Correlation between pore network tortuosity and rate capability. Error bars were calculated based on the 95% confidence intervals from the fits. Interestingly, \({D}_{\infty }\) does not correlate with the mesoporous SSA (Fig. 4c), which further supports the idea that other factors beyond SSA play a role in determining ionic transport and performance. These factors could include pore interconnectivity or the relative size of electrolyte molecules to the pore and pore constriction sizes. This result is consistent with previous reports of increased performance in samples containing large transport channels19,51. To evaluate the contribution of pore interconnectivity, we measured the tortuosity of our samples (Fig. For the carbon–electrolyte systems studied, we found pore network tortuosity values ranging from approximately 8 to 105 (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 12), which highlights the diversity in the long-range electrolyte transport in the different samples. The particularly high tortuosity values in some samples demonstrate that ionic transport can be limiting in some electrode materials, as the diffusion path length was more than two orders of magnitude longer than diffusion in a straight line in some samples. Excitingly, we found a good correlation between the tortuosity parameter plotted against rate capability (Fig. 4d) and, overall, that higher tortuosity was associated with lower electrode performance at high current densities owing to the more indirect ionic transport pathways. The tortuosity values did not correlate with the microporous or mesoporous SSA (Supplementary Fig. 11), indicating that, in addition to the pore sizes, the pore arrangements and how pores are connected are important considerations for fast-charging performance. Both D∞ and tortuosity plateau at rate capabilities above 100 A g−¹, indicating that other factors may also limit supercapacitor performance at high current densities. To elucidate the mechanistic origin of the tortuosity–rate capability relation, we considered the ion transport processes underlying supercapacitor charging. Charge storage proceeds through ion migration to electrode surfaces, where counter-ion adsorption and co-ion desorption form electric double layers. Two mechanisms may limit this process: ohmic polarization, arising from resistive losses along tortuous pathways, and concentration polarization, which develops when ion transport cannot match the applied current, generating concentration gradients that restrict pore accessibility. As the measured cell resistance shows no correlation with tortuosity (Supplementary Fig. 14), ohmic losses are probably masked by other resistive contributions, indicating that concentration polarization dominates the rate limitation. The relation between tortuosity and rate capability can be described using the Nernst–Planck equation for ion transport52 (Supplementary Information Section 1). Here electrolyte transport constraints manifest as a decline in galvanostatic charge–discharge-measured capacitance at high current densities, which isolates transport-limited pore accessibility rather than RC time constants that convolve resistive and capacitive effects53,54. In the regime where anionic electromigration becomes rate-limiting, the critical current density J0 marks the onset of capacitance loss and scales inversely with tortuosity (J0 ∝ 1/\(\tau\)). Experimentally, a linear correlation between J0 and 1/\(\tau\) (Supplementary Fig. 15) confirms that tortuosity directly governs the transport-limited rate capability of porous electrodes. Interestingly, increasing the electrolyte cation size leads to lower measured long-range effective anionic diffusion coefficients and tortuosities (navy points in Fig. 4b,d and Supplementary Table 1). These variations reflect how cation size and solvation shells affect the accessibility of porosity to electrolyte ions, markedly influencing their ability to enter pores and modulate the available volume for anionic transport. Because electroneutrality must be preserved, if a cation cannot access a given pore, anions are also excluded from that space to maintain the charge balance. This effect becomes more pronounced in closed or poorly connected pores. As a result, cation size indirectly impacts anion mobility by restricting the fraction of the pore space that is functionally accessible. It is important to note that the observed diffusion coefficients reflect ion motion across the entire porous network, which spans micrometre-scale distances, but they are strongly governed by nanoscale effects such as pore accessibility, crowding and local confinement. The tortuosity metric helps to disentangle these geometric and structural effects from purely molecular-scale mobility (for example, as predicted by the Stokes–Einstein relation), thus allowing us to focus on how the material architecture modulates transport. These findings highlight the value of anionic diffusion as a sensitive probe of supercapacitor rate performance and demonstrate that 19F PFG NMR remains an effective tool for characterizing transport and pore connectivity, even when the cation properties are varied. Using PFG NMR, we have shown that long-range ionic transport determines the rate performance of nanoporous carbon electrodes. Tortuosity measurements at the micrometre scale revealed that well-connected pore networks enable faster ion access, directly enhancing high-rate charging and discharging. These results establish tortuosity as a key structural descriptor linking pore architecture to electrochemical behaviour and show that PFG NMR is a robust and quantitative tool for its characterization. Our findings indicate that the design of electrode materials should go beyond maximizing charge storage by focusing on engineering the pore connectivity to minimize transport limitations. By combining low-tortuosity networks with materials that efficiently store charge, future supercapacitors and potentially other electrochemical energy-storage devices could achieve faster and more energy-efficient operation under demanding current densities. More broadly, this framework bridges microscopic transport measurements and macroscopic device performance and offers a route to rational design principles for porous materials. Approaches that integrate structural control across several length scales, from atomic-level ordering to micrometre-scale connectivity, are probably most effective in overcoming diffusion bottlenecks. Such strategies could inform the development of next-generation electrodes that deliver both high energy and high power, thus accelerating progress towards sustainable, high-performance, energy-storage technologies. YP50F and YP80F activated carbon powders were sourced from Kuraray, and PW-400 carbon powders came from Carbon Activated Corp. ACCs (ACC-5092-10, ACC-5092-15 and ACC-5092-20) were obtained from Kynol. PowerSorb EL-106 and EL-104 were obtained from Jacobi Carbons Group. TEABF4, TPABF4 and TBABF4 salts (Acros Organics) were dried at 100 °C for 7 days and made into a 1 M solution with N2-purged (3 h) anhydrous ACN from Sigma-Aldrich. Activated 3-Å molecular sieves were used to dry the electrolyte solution further. Nanoporous carbon powers were dried for at least 2 days in a vacuum oven at 100 °C and transferred to an N2-filled glovebox where enough material was loaded in a 5-mm tube to fill the NMR coil. The carbon was covered with an excess of dry 1 M TEABF4, TPABF4 or TBABF4 electrolyte in dry ACN (≥99.0%, Sigma-Aldrich). NMR tubes were sealed with PTFE tape, and the electrolyte was left overnight at room temperature to fill the sample porosity. Electrochemical measurements were performed as in our previous studies39,55. ACCs were directly used as electrodes, whereas powdered carbon was made into free-standing carbon electrode films by mixing carbon powder (95 wt%) with PTFE binder (5 wt%) in ethanol, rolling it to ~0.25 mm thickness and drying at 100 °C for 24 h to remove residual solvents. All electrochemical cells were symmetric two-electrode coin cells assembled in a N2-filled glovebox. Electrodes were cut with a stainless-steel manual punch (6.4 mm diameter), while ensuring that the electrodes in each cell had the same mass within 0.2 mg, which ranged from 3.5 mg to 5.2 mg for carbon films and from 5.5 mg to 8.5 mg for ACCs due to their increased thickness. Electrodes were separated with a Whatman GF/A glass fibre separator, and approximately 150 µl of electrolyte was added. Stainless-steel (SS316) spacer discs and a spring were used as current collectors, and cells were sealed with a hydraulic crimper (Cambridge Energy Solutions) under a pressure of 80 kg cm−3 for approximately 40 s. All components were stainless steel and supplied by Cambridge Energy Solutions. Electrochemical measurements were performed with a Biologic BCS-805 potentiostat. Constant current charge and discharge measurements were conducted for various current densities (from 0.05 A g−1 to 2 A g−1) with the same voltage window (0–2.5 V) for at least three cycles per condition. The capacitance was calculated from the slope of the second half of the discharge curve, with results averaged across at least two cells (standard deviation <5 F g−1). Error bars reflect standard deviations across two cells. Sufficient cell precycling was verified by repeating charge and discharge tests at 50 mA g−1 to ensure stable capacitance after pore wetting. The data are plotted in Supplementary Fig. To assess the rate capability across various nanoporous carbon materials and electrolytes, the capacitance C(J) was fitted against current density J using the expression \(C(J)={C}_{0}\exp (J/{J}_{0})\), where J0 represents the rate capability (Supplementary Fig. To remove the contribution from the cell design, data points corresponding to less than 80% capacitance retention were excluded. PFG NMR experiments were carried out using a Bruker Avance Neo spectrometer and a 5 mm H/F-BB diffusion probe at a magnetic field strength of 9.4 T (1H Larmor frequency at 400 MHz) and 25 °C sample temperature. The diffusion experiments used stimulated echo and longitudinal eddy-current delay bipolar gradient pulses for diffusion and two spoil gradients that yielded high-resolution, distortion-free NMR spectra46 (ledpbgp2s Topspin pulse sequence). The pulse durations of the diffusion gradients δ were each 1 ms long with pre-emphasis. The gradient strengths were varied from 17.1 mT m−1 to 16.7 T m−1 in 32 increments on an exponential scale. The gradients were calibrated using the self-diffusion coefficient of dry ethylene glycol56 at 25 °C (8.87 × 10−11 m2 s−1). Diffusion delays Δ ranged from approximately 3.5 ms up to 500 ms in 16 increments on a logarithmic scale. The sequence used two 8.5 mT m−1 spoil pulses of 100 µs and 100-µs gradient recovery times. The optimized 19F 90° pulses on resonance was about 20 µs, which is approximately 12.5 kHz. The recycling delay was set to 5 s. The in-pore environment was integrated in MATLAB, and the diffusion decay was fitted with the sum of two components46: where Di is the diffusion coefficient in m2 s−1, γ is the gyromagnetic ratio in rad s−1 T−1, δ is the summed duration of the two gradient pulses during the encoding or decoding, g is the strength in T m−1 and Δ is the diffusion time in seconds. The tortuosity \(\tau\) and diffusion coefficient D0 were obtained by fitting the diffusion coefficient D(Δ) versus the diffusion time, with the equation generalized from the Taylor equation in the limit of short diffusion times developed by Mitra et al.31,48: Error bars show the 95% confidence interval. N2 gas physisorption experiments were carried out using a high-vacuum physisorption and chemisorption analyser (Autosorb iQ from Anton Paar) at 77 K. For each carbon sample, around 25 mg of powder was placed into a glass bulb gas cell and degassed at 120 °C in vacuo for 16 h before the measurement57. Pore size distributions were calculated with quenched-solid density functional theory (slit-pore model) based on a slit-pore model. The microporous and mesoporous SSAs were determined by integrating the pore size distribution plots for pores <20 Å and >20 Å, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy was performed using a Tescan CLARA 2 scanning electron microscope. Samples were imaged in ultrahigh resolution scan mode using an Everhart-Thornley secondary electron detector. The accelerating voltage was set to 5 keV, with a working distance of approximately 6 mm and a beam current of 61 pA. Uncoated samples were mounted on standard aluminium stubs using carbon tape and imaged under high vacuum.

(2025)Cite this article Achieving the efficient integration and synergy of multi-component polymers is an effective approach for the development of new polymer materials and breakthroughs in performance. However, there are still considerable challenges in achieving molecular-level integration of multi-component polymers. Here we report polymer chain entanglement through asymmetric entangled nodes, inspired by macroscopic woven materials with different warp and weft strands, achieving the integration of polyurethane and epoxy resin chains at the molecular level. The abundant dynamic entanglements within the polymer network, reminiscent of woven topologies, enable the flexible polyurethane chains and rigid epoxy chains to work synergistically under external stress, thereby imparting excellent mechanical and adhesive properties to the final network. This study demonstrates the potential of weaving-inspired molecular-level entanglement in polymer integration and performance modulation, while also providing an important reference for the design of novel multi-component polymeric materials through weaving-inspired strategies. The advent of polymers, particularly synthetic polymers, has profoundly advanced human civilization by providing materials with unparalleled versatility and functionality1,2,3,4. However, the limitations inherent in single-type polymers often restrict their applicability in emerging application scenarios. To overcome these challenges, it is essential to merge multiple types of polymer, achieving efficient integration that combines the advantages and functions of diverse types of polymer5,6,7,8,9. Current polymer integration methods, such as blending and copolymerization, have been used to merge different polymers10,11,12,13,14,15, but they often fall short of achieving effective synergy owing to issues such as incompatibility and limited control over polymer chain distribution16,17,18. Consequently, these methods may not fully realize the potential of multi-component polymeric materials. This underscores the pressing need for innovative approaches to polymer integration that can seamlessly merge different polymer chains at the molecular level, unlocking new possibilities in polymeric material design. Weaving has been proven to be an efficient and versatile technique, where simple linear materials are entangled through the induction of numerous entangled nodes, achieving a high degree of integration and synergy between warp and weft segments, forming intricate and refined topological structures and imparting exceptional mechanical properties to the fabric materials19,20,21,22,23. Drawn by the fascinating structures and interesting properties of macroscopic weaving, chemists have been striving to incorporate weaving at the molecular level, with the goal of developing novel polymeric materials through bottom-up weaving control24. Since the Yaghi group reported the first example of woven covalent organic frameworks in 2016 (ref. 25), molecularly woven polymers have garnered widespread attention26,27,28,29. These pioneering efforts demonstrated that entanglement at the molecular level can effectively regulate the topological structures and mechanical properties of polymeric materials. It is noteworthy that macroscopic weaving not only regulates the structures and properties of materials but also integrates various types of functional fibre through entangled nodes, creating woven materials with diverse warp and weft threads that achieve a high degree of synergy among different materials30,31,32,33 (Fig. Inspired by this approach, we envisaged interlacing different polymer chains through molecularly entangled nodes, utilizing their dynamic synergistic effects akin to woven topologies to achieve effective integration of the polymer chains, thereby creating functional polymeric materials with enhanced performance. However, current research on woven polymer networks mainly focuses on molecular chains with identical components, leaving the challenge of leveraging weaving-inspired strategies to achieve efficient integration and synergy of different polymer chains at the molecular level unresolved. a, A schematic representation of woven networks with the same (left) and different (right) warps and wefts. b, A schematic representation of the formation of polymer network WPU-EP crosslinked by weaving-inspired asymmetric entangled nodes. The asymmetric entangled nodes facilitate the efficient entanglement of flexible (PU) and rigid (EP) polymers, enabling molecular-level integration of their respective advantages and functions. In the present work, we have achieved efficient integration and synergy of two types of polymer chain at the molecular level by utilizing the weaving-inspired asymmetric entangled nodes, resulting in a polymer network with exceptional performance. Specifically, we synthesized a bis-hydroxylated tridentate ligand (TL)34,35,36,37,38 and copolymerized it with polytetramethylene ether glycol (PTMG) and hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) to form a linear polyurethane (PU) containing tridentate binding sites (PUT). Subsequently, the coordinative binding between the tridentate binding sites in PUT and monodentate ligand (ML) was realized by the addition of palladium acetate, resulting in the highly efficient formation of asymmetric entangled nodes in the polymer chains (PUW). Finally, by copolymerizing the epoxy resin (EP) fragment E51 and the chain extender diamine (N,N′-dimethylethane-1,2-diamine, DMEDA) at the nodes of the PUW chains, the chain entanglements induced by the asymmetric entangled nodes facilitate the integration between the PU and EP chains, forming a polymer network (WPU-EP). The core of this approach involves using palladium (II) to create weaving-inspired asymmetric entangled nodes through coordination between tridentate and monodentate ligands, enabling the stepwise polymerization of PU and EP into a synergistic polymer network with the entanglements. In this network, the flexible PU segments and rigid EP segments are highly integrated through the mediation of the numerous entangled nodes (Fig. The movement and deformation of the flexible segments, along with dynamic entangled node dissociation and polymer segment slippage, provide the material with dynamic properties that effectively absorb and dissipate energy while dispersing stress under external forces. Meanwhile, both the rigid EP segments and the intricate entanglement topology serve as a skeleton to maintain the integrity of the topological network. Consequently, the efficient integration and synergy of flexible and rigid polymer chains at the entangled nodes impart excellent mechanical properties to the resulting network. PU and EP are among the most commonly used polymeric materials in industrial production. PU polymers are typically known for their excellent elasticity and flexibility39,40. Conversely, EP, while exhibiting high strength and modulus after curing, has high brittleness and limited flexibility41,42. Therefore, in industrial applications, it is common to blend these two materials to enhance their overall performance and meet the demands of various harsh environments43,44,45. In this work, we selected PU and EP as examples to explore the synergy of topological entanglement in facilitating the integration of different polymers and enhancing their performance. We synthesized the WPU-EP network and, for comparison, also created CPU-EP and SPU-EP networks (Fig. 2f), with their primary distinction being the topological structures formed through entangled, covalent and supramolecular crosslinks, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 1–23 and Supplementary Tables 1–3). The construction of WPU-EP hinges on inducing entanglement through weaving-inspired asymmetric entangled nodes. To validate the feasibility of interlaced coordination at the asymmetric entangled node, we successfully used model ligands to construct an asymmetric entangled node and analysed its crystal structure (Fig. 2a) using X-ray diffraction (Supplementary Table 6). The crystal structure presented in Fig. 2a demonstrates that, as expected, interlaced asymmetric coordination occurred in the presence of palladium(II), suggesting that this class of molecular entangled nodes can effectively induce the entanglement of different polymer chains. On this basis, the entangled crosslinked polymer network WPU-EP was obtained by stepwise polymerization of PU and EP chains via the polar functional groups at the end of the nodes. This polymeric material exhibits a transparent pale yellow colour and, due to the entanglement of the nodes, maintains structural stability. It does not dissolve after being immersed in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) for 24 h (Fig. The changes in characteristic functional group signals of the three polymer networks were also investigated in the condensed state by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 2c, the peaks around 2,120 cm−1 corresponding to the NCO groups and 912 cm−1 corresponding to the epoxy groups disappeared completely in the all three polymer networks, indicating that both HDI and E51 in the systems have been completely reacted to construct polymeric networks. The peaks at 3,300–3,600 cm−1, 1,660–1,720 cm−1 and 1,010–1,250 cm−1 were assigned as the characteristic absorptions of N–H and O–H, C=O, and C–O–C, respectively, which demonstrates the formation of urethane groups and the introduction of a large number of hydroxyl groups in the EP chains. The peaks at 2,850–2,960 cm−1, 1,490–1,550 cm−1 and 810–830 cm−1 were ascribed as the stretching vibrations of CH2 and benzene rings and the bending vibrations of para-disubstituted benzene rings, indicating the successful integration of PU and EP segments in the networks. Moreover, the peak at 1,450 cm−1 ascribed to the pyridine groups of the nodes was found only in the spectra of WPU-EP and SPU-EP, demonstrating the presence of crosslinks in the networks. a, The crystal structure of a weaving-inspired entangled node based on tridentate and monodentate ligands (model compounds) with palladium (II) via crossed asymmetric coordination. b, Photographs of a WPU-EP dumbbell-shaped sample and its state after 24 h of immersion in DMF. c, Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectra of WPU-EP, SPU-EP and CPU-EP. d, DSC curves of WPU-EP, SPU-EP and CPU-EP recorded in the second heating scan from −85 °C to 80 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1.

The segmental mobility within a polymer network is constrained by its crosslinking structure; therefore, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on the three polymer networks to investigate their thermal transition behaviours. The endothermic peak formed by the melting of crystalline PTMG in the PU chains is located around 23 °C. The glass transition temperatures (Tg) of CPU-EP, WPU-EP and SPU-EP are −69.8 °C, −70.1 °C and −78.2 °C, respectively (Fig. These low Tg values are mainly attributed to the PU soft segments in the networks (Supplementary Fig. At a higher temperature (65.6 °C), the SPU-EP sample exhibited another Tg, attributed to the EP polymer segments within the network. Due to the weaker constraints imposed by supramolecular crosslinking, the polymer chains in SPU-EP exhibit enhanced chain mobility, which facilitates partial phase separation resulting from the limited compatibility between PU and EP segments. A similar situation can also be observed in the PU/EP blend sample (Supplementary Fig. However, this phenomenon was not observed in the WPU-EP sample with the same composition, implying that the induced entanglement of the entangled nodes enhances the integration of these two distinct polymers. The swelling curves of the three networks (Fig. 2e) also indicate that the more interchain entanglements within WPU-EP contributes to maintaining network stability, even though DMF partially disrupts the coordination bonds during the swelling process46. In general, the introduction of topological entanglements brings the two polymer chains closer together while preserving the dynamics of the structure, thereby creating favourable conditions for their synergistic effects (Fig. To explore the effect of the entangled structure on the strength and toughness of integrated polymer networks of PU and EP, a series of mechanical property tests were carried out on a WPU-EP sample, a CPU-EP sample and an SPU-EP sample. As shown in Fig. 3a, the CPU-EP sample possesses the highest Young's modulus (76.1 MPa) among the three samples (SPU-EP is 66.3 MPa and WPU-EP is 67.8 MPa) due to covalent crosslinking, while its stretchability is the lowest at 771% due to the lack of dynamic properties of the crosslinks, with a maximum stress of 25.8 MPa. The SPU-EP sample, through supramolecular crosslinking, exhibited a maximum stress of 25.4 MPa and a stretchability of 1937%. However, despite a remarkable improvement over CPU-EP, its stretchability value remains considerably lower than that (3105%) of WPU-EP, probably due to insufficient integration of the PU and EP components under supramolecular crosslinking, which leads to progressive fracture of both crosslinking points and the network structure. When the polymer network was crosslinked by entangled nodes, WPU-EP achieved an ultrahigh strain at break of 3,105% with a maximum stress of 63.3 MPa. This may be attributed to the entangled nodes based on metal coordination, which improve structural dynamics under external forces and enhance the entanglement of polymer chains, facilitating the integration of two originally incompatible polymers and achieving their synergistic effect (Supplementary Fig. Benefitting from its excellent tensile and structural strengths, WPU-EP achieved an exceptionally high toughness of 989 MJ m−3, substantially higher than CPU-EP (142 MJ m−3) and SPU-EP (308 MJ m−3). Combined with the results of the cyclic stress–strain tests (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Figs. 41–55), WPU-EP showed better performance in terms of toughness, maximum stress, elongation at break, fatigue resistance and recoverability (Fig. 3b), suggesting that weaving-inspired entangled nodes have a unique advantage in constructing multi-component polymer networks. a, Stress–strain curves recorded with a deformation rate of 50 mm min−1 of WPU-EP, CPU-EP and SPU-EP. b, A comparison of the mechanical properties of WPU-EP, CPU-EP and SPU-EP. c, Normalized stress relaxation curves of WPU-EP, CPU-EP and SPU-EP measured at 130 °C. d, Arrhenius plots of the stress relaxation time for WPU-EP, CPU-EP and SPU-EP samples.

Exploring the stress relaxation behaviour of a polymer network can be an effective indicator of the characteristics of changes in the network structure under stress conditions. As shown in Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 56, WPU-EP retained most of the stress below 110 °C, but the stress relaxation was gradually evident as the temperature continued to increase. This relaxation, however, did not completely release the stress in the network, quite different from SPU-EP, which relaxed almost completely within 10 s at 130 °C, and CPU-EP, which did not change appreciably with temperature (Supplementary Figs. This difference is mainly attributed to the variation in the crosslinking mode, which consequently leads to the difference in the connectivity state of the polymer chains in the networks. We attempted to quantitatively evaluate the differences in the stability of the three networks by calculating their network activation capacities, derived from Arrhenius fitting of their stress relaxation data. As shown in Fig. 3d, the activation energies of WPU-EP, CPU-EP and SPU-EP were 32.4 kJ mol−1, 59.0 kJ mol−1 and 19.5 kJ mol−1, respectively, suggesting that the covalently crosslinked network is the most stable, whereas the topologically entangled network is superior to the supramolecular crosslinked network as indicated in other experiments (Supplementary Figs. To understand the role of the entangled nodes in the polymer network, we performed a temperature scan on all three polymer networks using a tensile mode of dynamic mechanical analysis. 3e, the storage modulus E′ of WPU-EP showed a steady and continuous decrease after a plateau as the temperature increased from −100 °C to 150 °C. Meanwhile, the loss modulus E″ also exhibited a decreasing trend with increasing temperature after a small increase. As a result, the loss factor tan δ formed a broad peak around −45 °C, which is mainly attributed to the PU soft segments in the network. A similar phenomenon was also observed in the result of CPU-EP (Supplementary Fig. Moreover, the subsequent rapid decline in E′ of all samples within the temperature range of −10 °C to 30 °C is mainly attributed to the melting of crystalline PTMG. However, a unique notable difference was observed in SPU-EP (Fig. 3f), that is, a peculiar rising interval in its E″ curve around 50 °C, causing tan δ to gain a new peak around 50 °C, which should be attributed to the EP segments within the network. This finding confirms the results of the DSC analysis, indicating that the entanglement of polymer chains induced by the nodes can effectively integrate the immiscible PU and EP segments, thereby suppressing phase separation within the network. To further investigate the practical behaviour of topological entanglements within the network, we conducted large-amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) experiments (Fig. The moduli of oscillatory shear against the step time for WPU-EP and SPU-EP are shown in Fig. 3h and Supplementary Fig. It could be found that WPU-EP and SPU-EP showed different trends in the variation of the modulus with time during a single LAOS stage (as indicated by the red arrows). Using the modulus at a strain of 600% as an example, the storage modulus G′ of WPU-EP exhibited an increasing trend over time, while that of SPU-EP showed a gradual decrease. This difference primarily stems from the distinct deformation behaviours of the two polymer networks under tensile stress. In WPU-EP, the presence of topological entanglements allows the entangled polymer chains to tighten and slip under stress while maintaining the overall network integrity. Moreover, the entangled topology enables efficient stress transfer throughout the network, thereby contributing to an increase in modulus. By contrast, the polymer chains in the SPU-EP network are crosslinked through relatively weak supramolecular nodes, which dissociate under applied stress, thereby triggering plastic deformation of the polymer. Therefore, as shown in Supplementary Figs. 62 and 65, when correlating the network moduli with the applied strains, the modulus of WPU-EP exhibits an initial decrease with increasing strain, followed by a plateau at approximately 150%. This indicates that the entangled nodes in the WPU-EP network endowed the structure with dynamics, and the presence of the high-density chain entanglements induced by these nodes hindered the further deformation of the network, thus maintaining the stability of the network structure. On the contrary, without the restraining effect of chain entanglements, the moduli of SPU-EP continuously decreased with the increase of applied strains, indicating the continuous deformation of the network. The frequency sweep results (Fig. 3i and Supplementary Figs. 63 and 66) indicate that the deformed network of WPU-EP has a faster recovery rate. Moreover, the continuous cyclic shear tests of WPU-EP and SPU-EP also demonstrated the crucial role of the polymer chain entanglements induced by the cross nodes in the structural stability of the network (Supplementary Figs. Subsequently, the demetallized WPU-EP and SPU-EP samples were prepared to further explore the influence of polymer chain entanglements on the properties of the polymer networks (Supplementary Figs. 24–28 and Supplementary Table 4). As shown in Fig. 3j, after the removal of metal ions, both the maximum stress (from 25.4 MPa to 15.5 MPa) and the elongation at break (from 1,937% to 1,092%) of SPU-EP dramatically decreased. Moreover, the demetallized SPU-EP shares similarities with the PU/EP blend sample in many aspects, including the swelling ratio, mechanical properties, phase separation state and so on (Supplementary Figs. By contrast, for WPU-EP, only the maximum stress decreased (from 63.3 MPa to 39.9 MPa), while the stretchability showed little change (from 3,105% to 2,989%). The primary reason for this phenomenon lies in the fact that, after the removal of metal ions, the polymer network can no longer dissipate energy through the breaking of coordination bonds under stress, resulting in a noticeable decrease in maximum stress (Supplementary Figs. However, despite the removal of metal ions, numerous chain entanglements remain within the polymer network, which help maintain the structural integrity during stretching and thereby preserve its excellent tensile performance. As indicated by the frequency sweep results after oscillatory shear at different strains, the demetallized WPU-EP maintained a stable modulus even at a strain of 300%, whereas the demetallized SPU-EP showed a marked reduction in modulus at strains as low as 50% (Fig. 3k and Supplementary Figs. Collectively, the weaving-inspired asymmetric entangled nodes formed via metal coordination play multiple critical roles in the polymer network. The metal–ligand coordination within these nodes strengthens intermolecular interactions across the network and provides effective energy dissipation pathways through the reversible dissociation of coordination bonds under stress. More importantly, the presence of these entangled nodes induces additional topological entanglements between polymer chains, which not only enhance the compatibility between otherwise immiscible polymer segments, but also promote their synergistic interactions through the mediating role of the entangled nodes. These synergistic mechanisms enable the polymer network to effectively avoid brittle failure and reduce plastic deformation under stress, resulting in a remarkable enhancement in its mechanical performance. To further investigate the impact of entangled nodes on the properties of the polymers, we first prepared a series of WPU-EP samples with varying node proportions of 1%, 5% and 10%. As shown in Fig. 4a,b, the maximum stress and break strain of these samples experienced a huge undulation from 8.7 MPa and 276%, to 63.3 MPa and 3,105%, to 21.7 MPa and 966% as the proportion of nodes increased from 1% to 5% and to 10%. This behaviour is primarily due to the influence of the node content on the crosslinking density of the polymer network. Specifically, insufficient entangled nodes result in inadequate confinement of polymer chain entanglement, leading to a loosely structured network and a more pronounced tendency for phase separation (Supplementary Fig. Conversely, excessive crosslinking creates a tightly crosslinked network that restricts a wide range of dynamic behaviours. The result of the cyclic tensile tests (Supplementary Figs. 79–81) also indicates that the increase in metal-coordinated entangled nodes enhances energy dissipation due to dynamic dissociation under extra stress. a,c, Stress–strain curves of WPU-EP samples with different proportions of entangled nodes (a) and different EP contents (c). b,d, Maximum stress and breaking elongation of WPU-EP samples with varying proportions of crosslinked nodes (b) and EP contents (d) in the network. e,f, Cyclic tensile tests without an interval for WPU-EP samples with 15% (e) and 50% (f) EP contents under strains of 50%, 100%, 150% and 200%. g, Damping capacities of WPU-EP samples with different EP contents calculated based on their cyclic tensile tests. h, The loss factor of WPU-EP samples with different EP contents from 0 °C to 120 °C. i, Arrhenius plots of the stress relaxation times for WPU-EP samples with different EP contents.

Subsequently, we further investigated the impact of the EP content on the network performance by preparing a series of WPU-EP samples with varying EP contents of 15%, 20%, 30%, 50% and 70%. We initially conducted stress–strain tests on these samples. 4c,d, we found that the elongation at break, maximum stress and toughness of the samples exhibited a continuous decrease with increasing the EP content in the network; for example, the maximum stress decreased from 63.3 MPa to 7.91 MPa. In the cyclic tensile tests, the damping capacity, residual strain and recovery capacity of these samples gradually increased with increasing EP content (Fig. 4e–g and Supplementary Figs. This finding suggests that the performance of the polymeric network constructed from asymmetric nodes can be effectively tuned by controlling the contents of different polymer components, enabling adaptation to various application needs. To investigate the cause of this effect, we measured and analysed the loss factors of the samples. 4h, as the EP content in the network increases, the peak of tan δ gradually intensifies within the temperature range of 50 °C to 80 °C. This indicates that, as the EP content continues to increase, the phenomenon of phase separation within the polymer network becomes more pronounced (Supplementary Fig. Moreover, increasing the content of rigid EP segments in the network led to greater overall rigidity and a higher activation energy barrier (Fig. Based on the above experimental results, we preferred the WPU-EP sample with a 5% node proportion and 15% EP content, which has the highest tensile strength and toughness, for the dumbbell lifting experiment. 4j and Supplementary Movie 1, a WPU-EP sheet of only 46 mg was used to easily lift a 3-kg dumbbell, whose weight is more than 65,200 times higher than its own mass, reflecting the great potential of asymmetric entangled nodes in the construction of multi-component polymeric networks. EP is widely used in the bonding field because of its excellent adhesion, but its excessive rigidity is prone to brittle fracture under stress, necessitating the addition of flexible polymers to enhance its toughness. Encouraged by the above-discussed experimental results, we formulated an adhesive based on WPU-EP and compared it with a control adhesive that uses EP toughened by a marketed PU-based toughener, with the specific preparation steps of the adhesives shown in the Supplementary Information. The tensile strength was tested using aluminium as the substrate (Fig. The tensile strength of the WPU-EP-based adhesive was slightly higher than that of the control adhesive, and the stiffness was lower (Fig. 5b,c and Supplementary Table 5). Overall, the WPU-EP-based samples exhibited adhesive properties comparable to those of commercially available, traditional covalently crosslinked networks. a, Tensile pattern for adhesion performance testing. b,c, Adhesion strength–displacement curves (b) and data for tensile strengths and displacements (c) of WPU-EP and control adhesives, obtained from the adhesion performance tests, with aluminium as the substrate. d, Lap-shear pattern for adhesion performance testing and the deformation mechanism of the polymeric network in the WPU-EP adhesive during the test. e, A photograph of the WPU-EP adhesive sample in the vehicle traction experiment. f,g, Adhesion strength–displacement curves (f) and data for tensile strengths and displacements (g) of WPU-EP and control adhesives obtained from the lap-shear tests. h, Literature comparison on tensile and shear strengths of copolymeric materials in recent years. Unlike tensile strength, which primarily depends on the intrinsic bonding ability of the material, shear strength is more influenced by the toughness of the adhesive's internal structure. This is due to the uneven and localized stress concentrations within the sample, resulting from changes in the direction of the applied external force (Fig. Therefore, we tried to evaluate the state of the samples under different force modes to verify the stability of the bonding. In Supplementary Fig. 99, a 5-kg dumbbell was easily lifted by two aluminium plates bonded over an area of just 2.5 cm × 1.3 cm. Remarkably, with the same bonding area, a car weighing up to 2.1 tons was successfully towed using two aluminium pieces joined by the WPU-EP adhesive. The traction remained stable, unaffected by rapid stress fluctuations caused by road undulations (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Movie 2). Moreover, after the traction was completed, the braking of the trailing vehicle caused a sudden increase in tensile force, resulting in the breakage of the traction rope, while the bonded area showed no abnormalities (Supplementary Fig. 100), indicating that the bonding performance of the WPU-EP adhesive is excellent and of great practical value. The shear strength, 15.1 MPa, of WPU-EP is much higher than that, 6.82 MPa, of the control (Fig. 5f,g), but with lower stiffness. From the bonding areas after the break (Supplementary Fig. 101), we can conclude that the bond is strong and efficient, and its rupture should also be attributed to the cohesive destruction of the polymer itself. Overall, the induced entanglement from asymmetric nodes enables the efficient integration of PU and EP, leading to the development of an excellent adhesive that combines high tensile and shear strength47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55 (Fig. In this study, we achieved the efficient integration of two polymers—PU and epoxy resin—through crosslinked entanglement induced by weaving-inspired asymmetric entangled nodes. The flexible PU segments and rigid epoxy segments work synergistically under the influence of the entangled nodes, resulting in a polymeric network with excellent mechanical properties and adhesion performance. More importantly, we advanced the concept of weaving-inspired polymer networks from single-component systems to multi-component systems. This progression allows the entanglement and integration of different types or functionalities of polymeric material through entangled nodes, enabling multi-component and multi-functional synergy, and providing insights and references for the development of novel polymeric materials. We believe that the integration of polyurethane and epoxy resin, enabled by weaving-inspired asymmetric entangled nodes, marks only the beginning. We look forward to exploring further combinations of diverse polymers to fully realize the vast potential of molecular weaving in the design of novel polymeric materials. All reagents used in this research were commercially available and used as supplied by the manufacturer without further purification. Organic solvents were evaporated under reduced pressure on an Eyela rotary evaporator using a water bath (50 °C). All reactions were performed at ambient laboratory conditions, and no precautions were taken to exclude atmospheric moisture unless otherwise specified. 4-{[N-(Boc)methylamino]methyl}phenol was prepared according to literature procedures56. The mechanical properties of the polymers were measured using an Instron 34SC-1 instrument in standard stress–strain experiments. Toughness values (total toughness) were obtained by integrating the area under the corresponding stress–strain curves. Energy dissipation (dissipated toughness) was calculated by integrating the area encompassed by the cyclic tensile curves. Damping capacity was defined as the ratio of the dissipated energy (the area encompassed by the loading and unloading curves) to the loading energy (the area encompassed by the loading curve). Fatigue resistance was defined as the ratio of the maximum stress after multiple stretches to the initial maximum stress. Recovery ratio was defined as the ratio of the difference between the set deformation and the residual deformation after unloading to the set deformation. For WPU-EP, all the reactants were fed in certain ratios as shown in Supplementary Table 3. First, E51 was added to a solution of PUW in a CH2Cl2/MeCN mixture (3:1, about 20 ml). After the contents were well mixed (about 3 h) and the solution was concentrated to around 2 ml, DMEDA was added and the mixture was stirred well again. After stirring for 3 h, the mixture was poured into a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) plate, which was subsequently put in an oven at 80 °C for 12 h to allow the reaction to complete. Thus, a WPU-EP film was obtained. For SPU-EP, P1 (5% node proportion, about 920 mg) was added to a solution of P2 (186 mg) in dry CH2Cl2 (10 ml). The solution was stirred vigorously for 2 h. The volatiles were removed under reduced pressure, and the mixture was poured into a PTFE plate. Then, the plate was put in an oven at 80 °C for 12 h to allow the reaction to complete. Thus, a SPU-EP film was obtained. For CPU-EP, E51 (140 mg, 357 μmol) was added to a glue solution of P3 (all the resulting P3 product, about 0.91 g) in dry CH2Cl2 (10 ml). To avoid the occurrence of side reactions between the residual isocyanate groups and DMEDA, the mixture was thoroughly stirred for 6 h to ensure a complete reaction between P3 and E51. Then, after the solution was concentrated to around 2 ml, DMEDA (31.0 mg, 352 μmol) was added and the mixture was stirred well again. After 3 h, the mixture was poured into a PTFE plate, which was subsequently put in an oven at 80 °C for 12 h to allow the reaction to complete. Thus, a CPU-EP film was obtained. For the PU/EP blend sample, PUT (about 910 mg) was added to a solution of P2 (186 mg) in dry CH2Cl2 (10 ml). The solution was stirred vigorously for 2 h. The volatiles were removed under reduced pressure, and the mixture was poured into a PTFE plate. Then, the plate was put in an oven at 80 °C for 12 h to allow the reaction to complete. Thus, the PU/EP blend samples were obtained. For the demetallized samples, the films of WPU-EP and SPU-EP were immersed in 5 ml of a tetrabutylammonium cyanide solution (1 M solution in MeOH) for 24 h at room temperature, followed by sequential washing with 20 ml of MeOH three times. Then, the films were dried in an oven at 50 °C for 12 h to obtain the demetallized samples. Initially, a frequency sweep from 300 to 1.2 rad s−1 within the linear viscoelastic regime (strain 0.2%) was performed to record the sample's baseline viscoelastic response. Subsequently, the following procedure was cyclically applied: (1) an oscillatory shear (preshear) with a defined strain amplitude (γ) was applied for 300 s to induce mechanical motion of the network nodes and deformation of the polymer matrix, and (2) immediately after the preshear, a frequency sweep (300 to 1.2 rad s−1, strain 0.2%) was conducted to capture the altered viscoelastic state of the network. This cycle was repeated 16 times with increasing strain amplitudes ranging from 0.2% to 700%, without any interval between successive cycles.
