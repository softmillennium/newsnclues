(Harvard University Police Department via AP) BOSTON (AP) — Two Massachusetts men were arrested Tuesday in connection with a weekend explosion at Harvard Medical School, authorities said. Logan David Patterson and Dominick Frank Cardoza face charges of conspiracy to damage by means of fire or an explosive, according to the charging document. Patterson, an 18-year-old from Plymouth, and Cardoza, a 20-year-old from Bourne, were arrested Tuesday morning and were due to be arraigned in federal court later in the day. The explosion occurred early Saturday on the fourth floor of Harvard Medical School's Goldenson Building, which houses labs and offices associated with the school's neurobiology department. “Anxiety levels naturally rise when the public learns that an explosion was intentionally caused. I would say those levels may rise even higher in the Boston area,” U.S. Attorney Leah B. Foley said at a news conference, noting that the investigation is ongoing but that there's no further threat to the university. According to the charging document, witnesses said the men were visiting Wentworth College for Halloween activities, including parties at area schools. This photo provided by the Harvard University Police Department shows a person of interest in an explosion at the Harvard Medical School in Boston, on Saturday, Nov. 1, 2025. Witnesses said the pair lit a roman candle outside of the building and placed a cherry bomb inside of a locker in the building that then exploded, according to the charging document. “Let me be clear: Setting off an explosive device inside a locker at an institution geared toward higher education is not some harmless college prank. Neither Foley nor Docks would speculate as to the motive. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Medical school officials said the explosion caused no structural damage and that all labs and equipment remained intact. Police said officers did not find additional devices during a sweep of the building. An officer who responded to a fire alarm that morning encountered two people running from the building, university police said.</p>

(AP Photo/Seth Wenig) The New York Jets agreed to trade star cornerback Sauce Gardner to the Indianapolis Colts on Tuesday for two first-round draft picks and wide receiver Adonai Mitchell, according to a person with knowledge of the deal. Gardner, an All-Pro selection in his first two seasons, signed a four-year, $120.4 million contract extension with the Jets in July. “New York it's been real,” Gardner posted with a green heart emoji on X. 4 overall pick in the 2022 NFL draft out of Cincinnati and quickly established himself as one of the league's top cornerbacks during his first two seasons with the Jets. He had a slightly down year, by his standards, last season and was excited to play for new coach Aaron Glenn and defensive coordinator Steve Wilks. Gardner said during minicamp in June that Wilks was trying to get him to reach another level. It came just 24 hours after New York also gave a massive extension to wide receiver Garrett Wilson, who was selected by the team six picks after Gardner, with the team envisioning them being cornerstones of the future. Gardner got off to an up-and-down start this season, but was mostly solid since before missing the team's win at Cincinnati with a concussion. Glenn said Monday that Gardner was among three players who were completing the concussion protocol coming out of the Jets' bye-week break and was expected to return to practice this week. Gardner now goes from a Jets team that is coming off winning its first game after opening with seven losses to a Colts squad that has been one of the NFL's biggest surprises with a 7-2 start that ties Indianapolis with New England and Denver for the most victories in the AFC. Indy scrambled to plug holes in its injury-riddled secondary even before the regular season started. They signed free agents Charvarius Ward and Cam Bynum during the offseason to revamp a unit that struggled last season. The Colts even tried cornerback Xavien Howard, a two-time NFL interceptions champ who did not play in 2024, after losing two promising rookies — safety Hunter Wohler and cornerback Justin Whaley — with season-ending injuries in training camp. Howard retired after playing just four games. Ward is now on injured reserve after suffering a concussion in a collision during pregame warmups on Oct. 12. Indy's latest attempt to find a solution came last weekend when third-year cornerback Jaylon Jones was activated off injured reserve. It's the first major trade by new Jets general manager Darren Mougey and it evoked memories of the deal New York made in 2012 when it sent Darrelle Revis – to whom Gardner was often compared for his ability to shut down receivers – to Tampa Bay in 2013 for two draft picks, including a first-rounder. The Jets traded for cornerback Jarvis Brownlee Jr. last month, acquiring the 2024 fifth-rounder from Tennessee in September, and dealt nickel cornerback Michael Carter II to Philadelphia last Wednesday. New York has been looking for someone else among a group that includes Josh Reynolds, Tyler Johnson, Allen Lazard and rookie Arian Smith to step up as a clear No. The Colts had high hopes for Mitchell when they drafted him and thought he could push another young receiver, Alec Pierce, to fulfill his potential. Pierce responded by averaging a league-high 22.3 yards per catch last season and is second in the NFL this season at 20.9 yards. He had a reputation for dropping passes but appeared poised to play a bigger role in the offense this season. But just when Mitchell appeared to be emerging, his progression was stalled by a big blunder — dropping the ball before crossing the goal line against the Los Angeles Rams, costing him the first score of his career and resulting in a touchback. Since then, Mitchell has been virtually invisible. AP Sports Writer Mike Marot in Indianapolis contributed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Watch live voting from across the U.S. on Election Day 2025, including for Virginia and New Jersey governor, New York City mayor and a California proposition to redraw its congressional district boundaries. Voters on Tuesday will be casting ballots in U.S. state and local elections with an injection of presidential-level politics, including a pair of competitive races for governor in New Jersey and Virginia, the mayoral race in the nation's largest city and a ballot measure in California that Democrats are counting on for next year's elections to determine control of Congress. The off-year elections have drawn President Donald Trump's attention, and no race has attracted as much lip service or social media opinions from Trump as the mayor's race in his hometown of New York City. Though local issues are a major factor in Tuesday's contests, the winners take on an outsize role in a year when Trump has battled with governors and mayors as he's deployed National Guard troops and immigration agents across cities and states. For Democrats, the offices offer a chance to push back on the president's agenda, while Republicans see it as an opportunity to support his aims.

Different states have different voter identification rules, so it's important to know the voter ID laws in your state before heading off to cast your ballot. Those laws determine whether voters need to show an ID and, if so, what kind. The National Conference of State Legislatures website provides information on voter ID laws in effect. Before casting ballots, voters can review voter guides and sample ballots that include the candidates and the state or local issues up for a vote. Voter guides offer more information on candidates and ballot measures. The two leading candidates in a special election to fill the 18th Congressional District seat in Houston that's been vacant most of this year since the death of Democratic Rep. Sylvester Turner stood nearly side by side outside a community center Tuesday asking voters for their support. Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee and former Houston City Council member Amanda Edwards greeted voters as they drove into the parking lot of the Acres Homes Multi-Service Center in northwest Houston. Standing by the parking lot's entrance on a hot and sunny day, both candidates passed out campaign flyers as voters rolled down their vehicles' windows and briefly talked to Menefee and Edwards before parking their cars. Edwards told voters she would represent the congressional district to “bring home economic opportunities, education, housing and health care.” Tyler Ziemann, a 39-year-old firefighter, said he voted against the only state measure on the ballot — a proposal to redraw California's maps to add five Democratic U.S. House seats in response to President Trump's redistricting moves in Texas. “I think that it's a power grab,” said Ziemann, adding he doesn't typically vote in line with just one political party. “They're just trying to redraw district lines in their benefit, and it should just be done the way we've always done it.” The Southern California equestrian community of about 25,000 people is lined with riding trails and strip malls and known as “Horsetown USA.” It's one of a cluster of inland cities in a congressional district represented by Republican Ken Calvert that could be affected by the measure known as Prop. Amy Leos, a 50-year-old Republican from Norco, said she voted against it. “I feel like voting ‘yes' would be setting up even more of a blue state,” Leos said. While Trump lost Virginia and New Jersey last fall, there were significant shifts to the right in both states. Those shifts were fueled by Trump's increasing popularity among traditional Democratic loyalists: labor union members, Black men, Hispanic voters and younger people. If those pro-Trump trends continue this week, Democrats could be in trouble. But Trump isn't on the ballot, of course. The Democratic gubernatorial candidate cast her ballot in the closely watched contest in Montclair, New Jersey, accompanied by her husband, Jason Hedberg, and two of their four children Tuesday morning. New Jersey gubernatorial candidate Mikie Sherrill talks to reporters after voting in Montclair, N.J., Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2025. Asked about Election Day bomb threats at several New Jersey polling places, Sherrill said she was told none of them was credible and state voters wouldn't be deterred. “Obviously this is an attempt to suppress the vote here, and I don't think New Jerseyans take very kindly to that kind of tampering in our election system,” she said. Her opponent, Republican Jack Ciattarelli, cast his ballot during early voting last week in Bridgewater. The president didn't set foot in Virginia or New Jersey to campaign with Republican gubernatorial candidates Winsome Earle-Sears or Jack Ciattarelli, but both contests will likely be viewed as a referendum on Trump's job so far. The president endorsed Ciattarelli in New Jersey's governor's race but held only a pair of tele-town halls on his behalf, including one Monday night. Trump also did a Monday night tele-town hall for Virginia Republican candidates, but he didn't mention Earle-Sears, speaking mostly in favor of the GOP candidate for attorney general. Earlier in the campaign, Trump gave Earle-Sears only a half-hearted endorsement, saying he supported the GOP candidate for governor though he didn't use her name. Mayoral candidates for the New York City primary election, including Democrats Zohran Mamdani and Andrew Cuomo, are seen on a ranked-choice voting ballot in New York, on Tuesday, June 24, 2025. Back in June, voters in New York City's Democratic primary had the option to select up to five candidates by order of preference under a system known as ranked-choice voting. Still, in a memorable moment from last month's debate, the candidates were asked how they would fill out their ballots if the ranked-choice system were in effect. “Oh, please,” the Republican replied, deploying a bit of Gen Z slang, “don't be glazing me here, Zohran!” “I can afford (it) just fine, but it bothers me that it affects so many other people, and they don't care,” she said after casting her ballot at the Aurora Hills Library in Arlington. Uhl, who describes herself as caring more about issues than party, said she voted for former Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger for governor, but couldn't bring herself to vote for Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for attorney general, after learning of the violent references he made to other Virginia lawmakers in text messages made public last month. Tuesday offers a test of two very different Democratic philosophies on display from candidates: toeing a moderate line or fully embracing far-left progressivism. But it also presents a scenario in which both, or neither, could be successful — making drawing conclusions going forward more difficult. The party's candidates for governor, New Jersey Rep. Mikie Sherrill and former Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, have focused largely on the economy, public safety and health care, distancing themselves from some of the Democratic Party's far-left policies. Tuesday could be a key indicator of whether they're right. A worker lowers an American flag to half-staff, Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2025, at the Capitol in Washington. Virginia is home to more than 134,000 federal workers, many of whom have been furloughed or are being forced to work without pay. New Jersey has nearly 21,000 federal employees, according to the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service, out of a total of more than 2 million such government employees nationwide. Either number is more than enough to swing a close election. At the same time, millions of people may be losing critical food assistance from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, offering voters another urgent reason to express their displeasure. “Many Mamdani voters will be furious that you came from behind by stoking what they will see as Islamophobia, with recent ads and appearances on conservative media,” said host Brian Lehrer in an interview on WNYC radio. Cuomo at first insisted Lehrer had it “upside down.” “I am all about unifying,” he said, touting his record as governor and accusing Mamdani of being the divisive one. But Lehrer continued to press Cuomo, who has been criticized for failing to speak out against bigoted attacks on Mamdani from some allies. Cuomo responded that he's met with members of “the Muslim community” and said he wants to make them a “big part” of his administration and appoint them to senior positions. New York City mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa speaks to people at a voting location inside Trinity Lutheran Church Tuesday, Oct. 28, 2025, in the Queens borough of New York. “And you know animals throughout the city will be partying hearty because they'll have a friend both in Gracie Mansion and in City Hall,” he said. Sliwa had cast his ballot earlier during early voting. It amounted to about 75,000 registered voters out of roughly 385,000 in the county. County election officials became aware of the problem just after polling places opened and were “actively deploying” supplemental poll books to 230 polling locations, according to county spokesperson Rebecca Brain. A majority of voters in Chester County, about an hour's drive west of Philadelphia, backed Democrat Kamala Harris over Republican Donald Trump in last year's presidential election. Three Democratic justices on the state Supreme Court were running in retention elections, in which voters give a “yes” or “no” on whether they serve another term. Third-party voters were offered a provisional ballot if their name wasn't in the poll book Tuesday morning. Republican officials in Texas are asking voters to add language to the state constitution they say will make sure noncitizens don't vote in any elections there. The Texas Constitution's article on voting begins with a list of people forbidden to vote, such as those under 18. It's already illegal under state and federal law for non-citizens to vote. Supporters note that at least 20 communities across the country allow noncitizens to vote in local elections, including the District of Columbia.

The U.S. doesn't have a single government agency that collects and releases election results. The Associated Press has filled this gap for nearly 180 years. In many cases, the states themselves don't offer up-to-date tracking of results. Turner was only months into his first term after serving as Houston's mayor. The biggest names include Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee and Amanda Edwards, a former Houston City Council member. If no candidate gets more than 50% of the vote Tuesday, there will be a runoff. Abbott has said Harris County officials needed more time to prepare for the election. Confusion has lingered because many of the district's residents will vote in a different district next year under a redrawn map demanded by President Trump in an effort to increase the number of GOP seats. One thing on voters' minds heading into Election Day in the two states holding elections for governor was the rising cost of energy bills. The Democratic candidates embrace clean energy options like wind and solar. Meanwhile, the two states' Republican nominees are more closely aligned with the policies of President Donald Trump, who's called climate change a “con job” and promotes more traditional energy sources like gas and coal. ▶ Read more about how the campaigns tackled energy costs This combination photo shows candidates for governor of New Jersey Republican Jack Ciattarelli, left, and Democrat Mikie Sherrill during the final debate in governors race, Oct. 8, 2025, in New Brunswick, N.J.

Sherrill is a four-term U.S. representative and former Navy helicopter pilot. Ciattarelli is a former state Assemblyman backed by Trump. The former New York governor cast his ballot at a high school shortly after 10 a.m., talking and shaking hands with people at the polling location while surrounded by TV news cameras. The Department of Justice said last week it would send federal election observers to California and New Jersey, following requests from their state GOP officials. The election monitors will be in six jurisdictions: Passaic County, New Jersey, and Los Angeles, Orange, Kern, Riverside and Fresno counties in California. “I look forward to fighting for every single dollar this city is owed,” he told reporters Tuesday morning. “I look forward to utilizing every single tool at my disposal as the next mayor of this city to fight for the people of it. “But I will not be intimidated by this president,” he said. Trump endorsed Cuomo, the former Democratic governor of New York who's running for mayor as an independent, on Monday. Cuomo said voters should look beyond political party and vote for him to save New York City from Mamdani. “It's about saving the city, and that's not being overly dramatic,” Cuomo said on Fox News Channel's “Fox & Friends,” which is one of Trump's favorite TV news programs. In Pennsylvania, voters will cast Yes or No votes on whether to retain three justices of the state's Supreme Court 5-2 Democratic majority. Voters will decide whether to approve partisan U.S. House maps favoring Democrats. Gavin Newsom and other Democratic allies say the measure is a tool to counter a Trump-backed plan in Texas to help Republicans gain more congressional House seats next year. The Department of Justice said it will send election watchers to voting centers in Los Angeles, Orange, Kern, Riverside and Fresno counties. It's the Democrats' best opportunity in an unprecedented state-by-state redistricting battle. From left, Mayoral candidates, Independent candidate former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa are looking to lead the nation's largest city. He secured key endorsements from party leaders like New York Gov. The winner will replace outgoing Mayor Eric Adams, who initially sought renomination as a Democrat, ran as an independent, and then dropped out and endorsed Cuomo. The Democrat kicked off his busy Election Day morning schedule by voting with his wife, Rama Duwaji, at a local school. He held a brief news conference outside afterward, wearing an “I Voted” sticker on the left lapel of his dark gray suit jacket. “We are on the brink of making history in our city. He then embarked for several TV and radio appearances. Poll workers help people get set up to vote at a polling site in Garfield, N.J., Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2025. New Jersey law enforcement and election officials responded swiftly after threats were made against several polling locations as voting began in one of two states that will be electing new governors. Tahesha Way, who serves as the state's top elections official, described them as emailed bomb threats targeting polling places in seven counties but said law enforcement determined there are no credible threats at this time. Law enforcement officers “have worked swiftly to secure these polling locations and ensure the safety of every voter,” he said. Bomb threats also disrupted voting across several battleground states during last year's presidential election. This combination photo of candidates for the Virginia governor's election shows Democrat Abigail Spanberger in Henrico County, Va., Nov. 25, 2024, left, and Republican Winsome Earle-Sears in Richmond, Va., Jan. 25, 2022. Winsome Earle-Sears and Democratic U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger are looking to replace term-limited Republican Gov. An Earle-Sears' victory would turn her into the first Black female governor of any U.S. state. In the first off-year general election of Trump's second term, we are watching high-profile races for Virginia and New Jersey governor, New York City mayor and a proposition in California to redraw the state's congressional map. The results of these contests and others on Tuesday's ballot will signal how voters are feeling about Trump's agenda and about how Democrats are responding to it. More than half of the states will hold contests on Tuesday. ▶ Read more about the races with national implications to be decided on Election Day</p>

U.S. Special Envoy for Syria Thomas Barrack described Lebanon as a failed state and Iran-backed terror group Hezbollah had effectively supplanted the government. As Hezbollah rebuilds its forces and Lebanon is accused of failing to enforce the ceasefire terms brokered last year, Israel's defense minister has fired off a warning to Beirut. On Sunday, Defense Minister Israel Katz said, "Hezbollah is playing with fire, and the president of Lebanon is dragging his feet," he said. "The Lebanese government's commitment to dismantle Hezbollah's weapons and remove it from southern Lebanon must be realized. Enforcement will continue and deepen — we will not allow a threat to the residents of the north." His warning comes as Fox News Digital has learned that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) is weighing broader operations against the Iran-backed terrorist group after repeated violations of the truce. A senior IDF officer stationed on the northern border told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview that Hezbollah remains fully armed and funded by Iran. "Hezbollah didn't give up their heavy weapons," the officer said. Our job is to make sure they don't succeed." On Monday, the IDF confirmed it had killed two Hezbollah commanders in southern Lebanon. Muhammad Ali Hadid, a senior member of Hezbollah's elite Radwan Force, was eliminated in Nabatieh, while another operative was struck in Ayta ash Shab after being seen collecting intelligence on Israeli positions. "If somebody threatens us, we take control of the situation and make the threat go away," he said. "We pushed Hezbollah back, so civilians could return. Now we're fortifying those gains and acting to prevent their recovery." That, he added, is the lesson Israel learned from Oct. 7. "Until then, we sometimes looked the other way. We're not sitting and waiting for the next rocket." A flag bearing the picture of assassinated pro-Iranian Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah flutters in front of a picture of Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei during a ceremony marking the first anniversary of Nasrallah's assassination in an Israeli airstrike at his grave in Beirut. "We tested our defensive systems, coordination, and rapid-response capabilities," he said. "We're applying every lesson from Oct. 7 so our response next time will be immediate." Israeli soldiers take part in an IDF exercise to enhance operational readiness along the Lebanon border in Oct. 2025 (IDF) According to Israel's Haaretz newspaper, intelligence officials believe Hezbollah is rapidly rebuilding its arsenal with Iranian assistance. The Trump administration has also expressed frustration over Beirut's failure to curb Hezbollah. U.S. Special Envoy Thomas Barrack recently described Lebanon as "a failed state" because of its "paralyzed government," and that Hezbollah pays its fighters more than the national army soldiers earns. "Only a diplomatic solution, not a military one, can ensure stability and maintain calm in the south," Raggi said, according to Lebanon's National News Agency (NNA). He added that the Lebanese government "is gradually moving forward with its decision to bring all weapons under state control." The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) on Thursday voiced "deep concerns", urging all parties "to fully commit to the cessation of hostilities." UNIFIL added that it remains in contact with the Lebanese Armed Forces and emphasized that extending state authority "is at the very core of Resolution 1701." IDF troops fighting Hezbollah terrorists in southern Lebanon. Despite diplomatic criticism, Israeli commanders insist they will not allow Hezbollah to rebuild. "We won't wait for another Oct. 7," the Israeli officer said. Efrat Lachter is an investigative reporter and war correspondent.

Defense Secretary Dick Cheney poses with some of the U.S. Army troops stationed in southern Iraq in this May 7, 1991 file photo. WASHINGTON (AP) — Dick Cheney, the hard-charging conservative who became one of the most powerful and polarizing vice presidents in U.S. history and a leading advocate for the invasion of Iraq, has died at 84. Cheney died Monday due to complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, his family said Tuesday in a statement. Bush gestures during a news conference at the White House on Friday, March 10, 1989, where he announced his selection of Rep. Richard Cheney, R-Wyo., left, to become Defense Secretary replacing his last choice of John Tower, whose nomination was turned down by the senate Thursday. He had a hand, often a commanding one, in implementing decisions most important to the president and some of surpassing interest to himself — all while living with decades of heart disease and, post-administration, a heart transplant. “History will remember him as among the finest public servants of his generation — a patriot who brought integrity, high intelligence, and seriousness of purpose to every position he held,” Bush said in a statement. Years after leaving office, Cheney became a target of President Donald Trump, especially after his daughter Liz Cheney became the leading Republican critic and examiner of Trump's desperate attempts to stay in power after his 2020 election defeat and his actions in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. “In our nation's 246-year history, there has never been an individual who was a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,” Cheney said in a television ad for his daughter. “He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him. In a twist the Democrats of his era could never have imagined, Cheney said last year he was voting for their candidate, Kamala Harris, for president against Trump. For all his conservatism, Cheney was privately and publicly supportive of his daughter Mary Cheney after she came out as gay, years before gay marriage was broadly supported, then legalized. A survivor of five heart attacks, Cheney long thought he was living on borrowed time and declared in 2013 that he awoke each morning “with a smile on my face, thankful for the gift of another day,” an odd image for a figure who always seemed to be manning the ramparts. In an interview Sunday, Oct. 27, 2013, Cheney said Republicans need to look to a new generation of leaders as the party deals with poor approval ratings following a 16-day partial-government shutdown. Instead, Cheney made it a network of back channels from which to influence policy on Iraq, terrorism, presidential powers, energy and other conservative cornerstones. A hard-liner on Iraq who was increasingly isolated as other hawks left government, Cheney was proved wrong on point after point in the Iraq War, without losing the conviction he was essentially right. He alleged links between the 9/11 attacks and prewar Iraq that didn't exist. He said U.S. troops would be welcomed as liberators; they weren't. He declared the Iraqi insurgency in its last throes in May 2005, back when 1,661 U.S. service members had been killed, not even half the toll by war's end. But well into Bush's second term, Cheney's clout waned, checked by courts or shifting political realities. Bush did not fully embrace his hawkish positions on Iran and North Korea. From the beginning, Cheney and Bush struck an odd bargain, unspoken but well understood. Shelving any ambitions he might have had to succeed Bush, Cheney was accorded power comparable in some ways to the presidency itself. Vice President Dick Cheney addresses a campaign rally for Gus Bilirakis, a Republican who is running for the Tampa Bay area congressional seat his father is vacating in Tampa, Fla. July 21, 2006. As Cheney put it: “I made the decision when I signed on with the president that the only agenda I would have would be his agenda, that I was not going to be like most vice presidents — and that was angling, trying to figure out how I was going to be elected president when his term was over with.” His penchant for secrecy and backstage maneuvering had a price. He came to be seen as a thin-skinned Machiavelli orchestrating a bungled response to criticism of the Iraq War. The victim, his friend Harry Whittington, recovered and quickly forgave him. When Bush began his presidential quest, he sought help from Cheney, a Washington insider who had retreated to the oil business. Cheney led the team to find a vice presidential candidate. Together, the pair faced a protracted 2000 postelection battle before they could claim victory. Recounts and court challenges left the nation in limbo for weeks. In office, disputes among departments vying for a bigger piece of Bush's constrained budget came to his desk and often were settled there. On Capitol Hill, Cheney lobbied for the president's programs in halls he had walked as a deeply conservative member of Congress and the No. Jokes abounded about how Cheney was the real No. 1 in town; Bush didn't seem to mind and cracked a few himself. But such comments became less apt later in Bush's presidency as he clearly came into his own. By then, two airliners had hit the World Trade Center and a third was bearing down on the capital from nearby Dulles airport in Virginia. Cheney talked to Bush again from the bunker and told him, “Washington was under attack, as well as New York.” It came down after passengers fought the hijackers. Cheney lost to challenger Harriet Hageman in the primary. Politics first lured Dick Cheney to Washington in 1968, when he was a congressional fellow. He became a protégé of Rep. Donald Rumsfeld, R-Ill., serving under him in two agencies and in Gerald Ford's White House before he was elevated to chief of staff, the youngest ever, at age 34. Cheney held the post for 14 months, then returned to Casper, Wyoming, where he had been raised, and ran for the state's lone congressional seat. In that first race for the House, Cheney suffered a mild heart attack, prompting him to crack he was forming a group called “Cardiacs for Cheney.” He still managed a decisive victory and went on to win five more terms. Cheney was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, son of a longtime Agriculture Department worker. Senior class president and football co-captain in Casper, he went to Yale on a full scholarship for a year but failed out. He moved back to Wyoming, eventually enrolled at the University of Wyoming and renewed a relationship with high school sweetheart Lynne Anne Vincent, marrying her in 1964. He is survived by his wife and daughters. Associated Press writer Mead Gruver in Cheyenne, Wyoming, contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two men were arrested following an explosion this weekend at Harvard Medical School, according to the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force and the Harvard University Police Department. Logan David Patterson, 18, and Dominick Frank Cardoza, 20, both ofo Massachusetts, were arrested and charged with conspiracy to damage by means of fire or an explosive a building belonging to an institution that receives federal financial assistance, according to a criminal complaint. It's unclear whether the two have attorneys. They were arrested Tuesday morning at their homes, said Ted Docks, special agent in charge at the FBI's Boston division. When asked whether there was a motive for the incident, Foley said, “The investigation is ongoing and it's just too early right now for us to speculate.” The incident came after a tense year for Harvard students, teachers and staff who were thrust into the national spotlight amid the White House's push to reshape higher education. Officials from Harvard and the White House have been in discussions for months about a high-dollar deal to restore all federal funding to the university and end its ongoing lawsuits against the administration. An officer responded to the Goldenson building just before 3 a.m. ET Saturday and saw two people fleeing after a fire alarm was activated, according to Harvard police. Surveillance footage circulated by police showed two masked people, one of them wearing what appeared to be a gray ski mask and the other a long face mask and black hoodie. Docks called the incident “selfish” and “shortsighted.” A message sent to the Harvard Medical School community Sunday afternoon said there was no structural damage to the building. This is a developing story and will be updated.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) said Tuesday that, barring a “surprise,” voters are on track to elect Democrats in statewide elections in Virginia and New Jersey, plus a mayoral race in New York City. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) similarly tempered expectations, telling the Washington Examiner, “I assume they may very well perform well.” Recent polls show some of the Republican candidates in neck-and-neck matches. Traditionally, New Jersey and Virginia have been blue strongholds, but the overperformance of Republicans, including President Donald Trump, in those states has put them under a microscope. Republicans are also feeling pessimistic about their chances of keeping the governor's mansion in Virginia, where Lt. Gov. “Of course, everybody will be spinning it based on what expectations were and all that,” Thune said, before cautioning reporters against reading too much into election night. In particular, analysts are looking to see whether the races mirror the strong turnout Democrats have seen in other off-year races, particularly special elections for open House seats. “I think if you look at these races that are being run, most of them are kind of focused on local issues,” Thune added. “I mean, some of them are focused on economic issues, which will be an issue in the midterm elections, but I think we've got a great case to make next year.” “They're terrified the Marxists are taking over their party, and the evidence today may show that that is true,” Johnson said.</p>

The United States government, Dunn's attorney Julia Gatto told the jury, “turned that moment, a thrown sandwich, into a criminal case. On Tuesday, the Border Patrol officer testified about his experience. Greg Lairmore told the jury that Dunn “became really irritated and started yelling obscenities” at him and other officers that night before throwing “a subway style sandwich at me that struck me in the chest.” DC jurors dismissed in the trial of man charged with throwing sandwich at federal agent are deeply skeptical of the case That's his constitutional right to express his opinion,” Lairmore, a division chief who has been with Customs and Border Protection for 23 years, said. “Look, I understand you may all have views of the federal law enforcement presence in DC,” Assistant US Attorney John Parron told the jury during opening statements Tuesday. “And that's fine, we're not trying to convince you otherwise. But respectfully, that's not what this case is about. This case is about the fact that you can't go around throwing stuff at people when you're mad.” “When we have disputes, we settle them verbally,” Parron added, concluding that Dunn threw the sandwich and “forcibly assaulted him.” He thinks recent immigration enforcement is racist,” Gatto said, adding that Dunn saw the local federal takeover of DC law enforcement as “fascism.” “They will not come close to convincing you beyond a reasonable doubt the conduct was forcible,” Gatto concluded.

National Air Traffic Controllers Association's Nick Daniels tells ‘The Story' how the government shutdown is fueling frustration among air traffic controllers and impacting flight delays across the country. FIRST ON FOX: A Republican senator wants to stop members of Congress from receiving paychecks as federal workers go without pay during the ongoing government shutdown. As the shutdown enters its 35th day, federal employees, air traffic controllers and other employees have either missed paychecks or received only partial pay. Members of Congress, however, are constitutionally required to get a paycheck, even if the government is closed. Some lawmakers have said that they would forego a paycheck, while others have introduced legislation to prevent their colleagues from getting paid. Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., has two bills that would see lawmakers go unpaid during the shutdown. Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., jumped into that arena and has two bills that would both halt lawmakers from getting paid as the shutdown continues and deal with the constitutional issue. "I don't see missing paychecks or empty dinner plates as leverage or bargaining chips," Kennedy said in a statement to Fox News Digital. "My bills ensure Congress feels the same pain as the folks we're failing to pay — our troops, air traffic controllers, and federal workers. If we can't do our jobs and fund the government, we don't deserve a paycheck — plain and simple." One of the bills, the "No Shutdown Paychecks to Politicians Act," would see lawmakers go without pay for every day that a shutdown is underway. Members of Congress on average make $174,000 a year. A 1787 copy of the U.S. Constitution that sold for $9 million is displayed at Brunk Auctions in Asheville, N.C., Oct. 17, 2024. Kennedy's desire to see that lawmakers don't get paid runs into the Constitution, however. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution requires that "Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States." Then there is the 27th Amendment, ratified in 1992, which prevents Congress from passing a law affecting its pay during the current congressional term. That's where his other bill, "Withhold Member Pay During Shutdowns Act," comes into play. That legislation would sidestep the 27th Amendment by not cutting pay to lawmakers, but instead withholding it in escrow until after the November 2026 elections. That bill is also being carried in the House by Rep. Bryan Steil, R-Wis., who said in a statement to Fox News Digital, "If service members, men and women of federal law enforcement, and other essential employees are working without pay during the Schumer shutdown, members of Congress should not be paid either." Then there's a constitutional amendment proposed by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., last week that would require lawmakers forfeit their paychecks. That money would then be sent to the U.S. Treasury Department to help pay down the national debt. Alex Miller is a writer for Fox News Digital covering the U.S. Senate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Later that day, when reporters asked Dick Cheney what he thought about how Republican leadership had quickly reversed course and folded to Trump, he said: “Well, it's not leadership that resembles any of the folks that I knew when I was here for 10 years.” No doubt many people will remember the 84-year-old Dick Cheney, who died on Monday evening, as one of the most powerful and controversial vice presidents in history. But Liz Cheney says she hopes people will also remember that her father was one of the few Republican leaders who broke with his party and spoke out publicly against Trump. “I want people to remember that my father chose country over party,” Liz Cheney said. When Liz Cheney voted to impeach Trump after January 6, the disgraced former president still had enough influence to make sure she became a pariah in the GOP. Dick Cheney, once vilified by Democrats, joined his daughter and endorsed Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. In his endorsement, the former staunch Republican vice president said of Trump, “There has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic.” “I talk to my dad probably just about every single day. And he sees things the way that I see them.” Still, when asked if she ever imagined that her father would one day vote for a Democrat for president, Liz Cheney shook her head, smiled and said “No.” When Liz Cheney accepted the Profile in Courage award in May 2022 from the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library, she told a little-known story of how her father was inspired to go into public service. As a young man, Dick Cheney had planned to get his PhD and become an academic, but in 1963, he attended a speech by President John F. Kennedy and was so moved by his words he went to work in Washington. Dick Cheney went on to have a decades-long career in Republican politics, serving as the youngest White House chief of staff in history to President Gerald R. Ford, then as a congressman from Wyoming, and defense secretary in the George H. W. Bush administration. In 2000, Cheney was tapped to lead George W. Bush's vice presidential selection committee — and ultimately, took the job himself. Despite harsh criticism that “enhanced interrogation” was torture, Cheney never backed down. Discussing his memoir in 2011, Cheney said he had “no regrets” and it was “the right thing to do.” After leaving the White House, he became a strident critic of Obama's foreign policy and wrote two memoirs, including one with his daughter, Liz, titled, “Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America.” “I feel confident he will be remembered as a man of tremendous courage, and someone who did what he knew was right, even when it was tough, and even when people were criticizing him for it,” she told CNN. When Trump announced his candidacy for president in 2015 and quickly surged to the top of GOP polls, Dick Cheney said he was “surprised” Trump had done as well as he had. Early on in Trump's first administration, Cheney said privately that he was alarmed by the chaos as well as Trump's relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. As Liz Cheney quickly rose in the ranks of House Republican leadership, she stayed true to the hawkish foreign policy she shared with her father. In general, she backed Trump, but would challenge him on national security. In 2018, Cheney said she was “deeply troubled” by Trump's embrace of Putin at a Helsinki press conference. But both Cheneys became even more alarmed after Trump refused to accept his 2020 election loss. Liz Cheney wrote that her father helped to organize a letter signed by all 10 former defense secretaries, which said that the election was over and warned against any use of the military. On January 6, when Trump said in his speech on the Ellipse that his supporters should get rid of “the Liz Cheneys of the world,” Dick Cheney called to warn his daughter that she was in danger. A week later, she was one of 10 House Republicans who joined with Democrats to impeach Trump over the attack on the Capitol. In May 2021, she was forced out as GOP conference chair. Asked afterward what advice her father had given her, Liz Cheney said in an NBC interview that she learned from him “the importance of having the courage of your convictions.” “People say well this is courageous, you know, I'm not landing on Omaha Beach — that's courage,” she said. “This is duty, this is what our oath requires and what history requires, and I'm just incredibly proud to be Dick Cheney's daughter.” When she shared the news, he said: “I'm proud of you.” Pelosi specifically applauded the former vice president for his appearance. “That he would come this day with Liz Cheney, as you know, his daughter, was quite a statement on his part, one that was well received by the rest of us,” Pelosi told CNN's Anderson Cooper that night. Liz Cheney's role on the January 6 committee put her further at odds with her party as Trump quickly regained his influence over the GOP and vowed revenge. In response, Dick Cheney made a television ad attacking Trump to try to help his daughter keep the Wyoming seat he also held for a decade. “He is a coward,” Cheney said, speaking directly into the camera. “Two years ago, I won this primary with 73% of the vote. I could have easily done the same again,” she said in her concession speech. “The path was clear, but it would've required that I go along with President Trump's lie about the 2020 election, it would've required that I enable his ongoing efforts to unravel our democratic system, and attack the foundations of our republic. In 2024, Trump easily won the Republican nomination and was facing off against Harris after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. The Cheneys had one more decision to make: Whether Dick Cheney would support a Democrat. In September, he issued a statement endorsing Harris: “As citizens, we each have a duty to put country above partisanship to defend our Constitution. That is why I will be casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris.” “I also want to thank your father, Vice President Dick Cheney, for his support and what he has done to serve our country. On a lighter note, reflecting on her father's legacy, Liz Cheney said that the “Darth Vader” nickname he was given while vice president was always laughed about inside the family. “He's really the opposite of his public persona,” she said. “That's why the Darth Vader caricature was so funny to us, and it became a family joke.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They pointed to a strong country-to-country relationship, built on decades of investment and singled out Petro as the biggest impediment to shoring up the joint efforts to tackle illicit drug production and trafficking inside the country. Days after Trump's social media post deeming Petro a drug trafficker and calling for a cutting of all payments and subsidies to the country, there was an interagency meeting planned with all of the Cabinet heads to discuss US support to Columbia, US officials said. But that meeting was canceled for unknown reasons and has not been rescheduled. Rubio's staff began working with the Treasury Department to quickly put sanctions on Petro into place, sources said. Rubio, following Trump's initial Truth Social post, publicly cited the “excellent” US-Colombia relationship, founded on strong partnership. “Despite billions of US taxpayer dollars invested in Colombia's counterdrug efforts, cartels are thriving under President Petro's failed policies. President Trump is carefully reviewing every program and only investing in projects that show clear value to protecting US citizens,” the official said. “The politics of Colombia are not actually reflected by the current president,” Rubio said as he prepared to head to Asia with Trump. “Our problem with the current president, in addition to his behavior, which has been erratic and counterproductive, is that in fact he is not cooperating on our counter-drug, and we felt that was best addressed at the individual level.” Tough sanctions have been imposed on Venezuela by both Republican and Democratic administrations given a rupture in diplomatic relations after the country's National Assembly declared Nicolás Maduro was not the country's legitimate leader in 2019, which was a position the US backed. Meanwhile, US-Colombia relations remain intact despite tensions at the top. Trump administration officials have also drawn up plans for strikes inside Venezuela, while there are no plans for the same kind of action inside Colombia. Trump administration officials are keenly aware of the political calendar in South America's largest country: Petro's presidency will end next year as he is constitutionally barred from running for a second term in the 2026 presidential election. “Our relationships with the people of Colombia, the economic sector of Colombia, the majority of people in politics in Colombia, and their institutions, in particular their defense institutions, are strong and enduring, and they're going to be strong and enduring long after this individual is no longer the president there,” Rubio said. US officials were stunned and angry when Petro joined pro-Palestinian protests in New York in September and called on US soldiers to “disobey the orders of Trump.” It prompted the US to revoke Petro's visa. But days later, back in Colombia, the left-wing leader doubled down. “If Mr. Trump keeps being complicit in the genocide, as he is up to today, he deserves nothing but jail, and his army should not obey him,” Petro said in Bogota. When the US rolled out sanctions against Petro and two of his family members in recent weeks, Rubio also officially decertified Colombia as a partner in combatting drug trafficking. “We remain steadfast in our support for Colombian security forces, its justice sector, and departmental and municipal officials, and we will continue to partner with them in our joint efforts to combat drug trafficking,” the State Department announcement said. “Today's decision is not a reflection on these institutions but rather the failures and incompetence of Gustavo Petro and his inner circle.” “The decision to impose sanctions on Petro and his family was ultimately made at the Presidential level, as is every action. President Trump made it clear that Colombia is ‘failing demonstrably' to uphold its drug control responsibilities, and Petro has since doubled down in defense of his failed policies,” the official said. The US has provided about $210 million in assistance to Colombia this fiscal year, including about $31 million in agricultural support, according to data from the US Department of State. Speaking a day after Rubio last month, Sen. Lindsey Graham said that Trump believes that both Venezuela and Colombia “have been safe havens for narco-terrorists for too long.” Graham added, during his CBS interview, that Trump said there were plans to brief members of Congress after his trip to Asia “about future potential military operations against Venezuela and Colombia.” The Clinton administration launched Plan Colombia in 2000, which was a $1.3 billion program primarily to support the military and security forces' fight against growing and trafficking narcotics. But before that period in 1997 the US had cut off assistance to Colombia and decertified it as partner in combatting drug trafficking. “US officials concluded that we actually did more damage to ourselves by cutting off assistance to Colombia than actually punish Ernesto Samper,” said Juan Gonzalez, a former NSC official focused on the Western Hemisphere during the Biden administration who is currently a fellow at the Georgetown Americas Institute. The US support to the Colombian police was robust before that cutoff: helping pay for judicialized wiretaps, training police and vetting them. Experts say that today's continued funding to Colombia's security and defense forces – which includes ongoing intelligence sharing between the two nations – is critical to achieve the administration's own goals for fighting drug trafficking. “We're talking about two militaries that are deeply integrated and cooperating, and they work more closely together, I think, than any other country that the US works with that's not in NATO,” she told CNN. And if intelligence sharing were to be cut, it would leave the US “flying blind,” she said. “If you are not sharing humint (human intelligence), electronic intel on shipments, routes, organizations, schedules, methods – you're cutting off what's needed to do the stated thing you want to do – stop the flow,” a former US diplomat who worked on the issue told CNN. Another former US diplomat who worked on the issue said cutting the security funding would be “cutting one's nose to spite one's face.”</p>

Fox News political analyst Lisa Boothe and former DNC press secretary Jose Aristimuno discuss polls aggregating which party Americans blame for the government shutdown on ‘America Reports.' And with no deal reached yet between Democrats and Republicans in Congress, it's all but certain that the dispute will bleed into day 36. The previous shutdown occurred over a disagreement on funding Trump's border wall. But this time, it's Democrats' priorities being caught in the middle. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., speaks to the media next to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on the day U.S. President Donald Trump meets with top congressional leaders from both parties, just ahead of a September 30 deadline to fund the government and avoid a shutdown, at the White House in Washington, D.C., Sept. 29, 2025. Republicans have for weeks pushed a short-term extension of fiscal year (FY) 2025 federal funding levels called a continuing resolution (CR), aimed at giving lawmakers until Nov. 21 to strike a deal on FY2026 spending. The measure is largely free of unrelated policy riders, save for an added $88 million aimed at enhanced security funding for lawmakers, the White House and the Supreme Court. But Democrats have said they will reject any federal funding bill that does not also extend enhanced Obamacare subsidies that are set to expire at the end of 2025. The enhanced subsidies were a COVID-19 pandemic-era measure that a majority of Republicans have said is no longer needed. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., have said they are open to discussing a reformed version of those subsidies, but rejected pairing the two issues together. Johnson has kept his chamber out of session since then in a bid to pressure Senate Democrats to agree to the GOP bill — though they have rejected it 13 times since then. Senate Majority Leader John Thune holds a copy of a continuing resolution bill as he speaks alongside Speaker of the House Mike Johnson during a news conference in Statuary Hall at the U.S. Capitol Building on Oct. 3, 2025, in Washington, D.C. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) "Here's the reality, they're at about 25% approval rating right now, and as one of their colleagues told me, the only way they can really go up is to show their base that they're fighting with the president, and that's what they're doing right now," Rounds said. "So once they get to the point where they think they made their point, then I think there's a possibility of actually getting something done," he continued. There has been more optimism in the upper chamber over the last several days than the entire shutdown so far, as more and more bipartisan conversations are cropping up. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., believed that lawmakers were close to an off-ramp, but there still hasn't been a concrete move made toward ending the shutdown yet. Senate Democrats, led by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., still want a solid deal on expiring Obamacare subsidies, and want Trump to get more involved. When asked if breaking the record would add more weight to lawmakers' ending the shutdown, Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., believed it would take an outside force. "I don't see what it is," he said. "It'll take some type of an outside inflection point, or the best negotiator in the world to come in." Meanwhile, funding for critical government programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the Women, Infants, and Children program (WIC), as well as national flood insurance are running critically low on funds — potentially ensnaring millions of Americans.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Malala Yousafzai and Greta Thunberg's unlikely stan war, explained. And yet the Nobel Peace Prize winner has spent the past couple of months churning out this sort of uncanny, “normie” content on social media. “Not me becoming chronically online,” she captioned one of her latest Instagram posts. Outside of making content, Yousafzai recently appeared at a New York Liberty game, talked to celebrity whisperer Jay Shetty, and has gone on a number of talk shows and podcasts. The Pakistani education activist is currently promoting her newly released memoir, Finding My Way, in which she grapples with her rise to prominence after surviving being shot in the head by a Taliban gunman at 11 years old while returning home from morning classes. But the 28-year-old has been evolving into a media impresario for some years now, producing films — one of which was Oscar-nominated — and a musical with Hillary Clinton. Yousafzai is not the only icon of progressive girlhood whose image has gone through an evolution. On October 2, the 22-year-old Swedish climate activist, whose focus has recently shifted to the genocide in Gaza, was reportedly detained by Israeli forces, along with more than 400 people, while on a flotilla mission delivering aid to Palestinians. Thunberg and other detainees were deported to Greece days later. Seeing two of the biggest names in activism in two very different places in their careers — one on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and one on the front lines of a humanitarian crisis — has generated a lot of commentary online, resulting in something of a stan war between their respective supporters. To many, it seems like Yousafzai and Thunberg have come to represent two opposing activist tropes: the sellout and the true revolutionary, respectively. Still, the response to Yousafzai and Thunberg's diverging second acts shows how expectations for young, progressive leaders have changed in our unsettled and increasingly authoritarian political age. Thunberg is the leftist action hero Gen Z seems to be clamoring for, while Yousafzai has become a cringy relic of the Obama years. Yousafzai has faced plenty of scrutiny and questions lately about her integrity as an activist, especially when it comes to her affiliations with certain Western leaders. She received backlash last April, after the announcement that she would be co-producing Suffs, a Broadway musical about the suffragette movement, with Clinton. After all, the former secretary of state oversaw drone strikes in Pakistan that killed civilians, and when Yousafzai visited the White House in 2013, she expressed her concerns over the attacks to President Barack Obama. More than a decade later, critics see Yousafzai's new partnership with Clinton as hypocritical. The optics got worse for Yousafzai after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023. Clinton, a longtime and well-documented supporter of the Israeli government, pushed back against early calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, a position that directly contradicted progressives in the United States, European leaders, and Yousafzai herself, who demanded a ceasefire in the days after the attacks. But because she highlighted the suffering of both Palestinian and Israeli children, Yousafzai was swiftly accused of “both siding” the issue by failing to directly acknowledge the power imbalance Palestinians faced after Israel's invasion and occupation. Yousafzai's initial response to the October 7 attacks doesn't paint a complete picture of her posture toward Gaza, however. “I have and will continue to condemn the Israeli government for its violations of international law and war crimes,” Yousafzai posted on X. In a May British GQ profile, she reflected on the backlash she's received over Gaza, arguing the limits of providing public statements on social issues and claiming that there's “a lot more you can do.” At home in Pakistan, Yousafzai's reputation has been much more complicated since becoming a global icon. While she's been deified as a sort of girlboss hero in the West, in her home of Pakistan, she's been the target of antagonism, erasure, and even conspiracy theories, stemming from the notion that she's a puppet for Western imperial interests. It's important to remember, too, that Yousafzai ended up on the global stage unwittingly. Criticism of Yousafzai happened to reach a boiling point — fueled by people seeing her on TikToks and reading about her weed use in college — at the same time that reports of Greta Thunberg's detainment in Gaza emerged. Over the past month, remarks like “Greta Thunberg is what Malala thinks she is” and comparisons of their recent endeavors have been all over X and TikTok. “I went down a bunch of these accounts and what I found…was that many of them were what I would call stan accounts,” says Ryan Broderick, editor-in-chief of Garbage Day, an internet culture newsletter. “It looked to me like very young people without any real background in politics effectively treating Greta and Malala like you would Sabrina Carpenter or Taylor Swift.” Thunberg vowed to strike each Friday until Sweden agreed to follow the Paris climate agreement, inspiring other “Future for Fridays” protests around the globe. At a time when radical ideas and leftist figures are becoming more mainstream, however, it makes sense that Thunberg would be the more appealing public figure at the moment, according to Broderick. After all, Yousafzai is working directly with the liberal, institutional figures who are, in many ways, responsible for pushing folks further to the left. There's a certain absurdity to the pitting of Yousafzai against Thunberg. After all, these two are not pop stars. They're not competing for a number one spot on the charts. While online fights over Yousafzai and Thunberg's second acts show how people on the left are demanding more from progressive leaders, this manufactured contest is also just another example of how stan culture has rotted our relationship with politics. You are not going to like where our ancestors got their protein.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dick Cheney, the hard-charging conservative who became one of the most powerful and polarizing vice presidents in U.S. history and a leading advocate for the invasion of Iraq, has died at age 84.Cheney died Monday night due to complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, according to a statement from his family. He had a hand, often a commanding one, in implementing decisions most important to the president and some of surpassing interest to himself — all while living with decades of heart disease and, post-administration, a heart transplant. Cheney consistently defended the extraordinary tools of surveillance, detention and inquisition employed in response to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Years after leaving office, he became a target of President Donald Trump, especially after daughter Liz Cheney became the leading Republican critic and examiner of Trump's desperate attempts to stay in power after his election defeat and his actions in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. “In our nation's 246-year history, there has never been an individual who was a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,” Cheney said in a television ad for his daughter. “He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him. In a twist the Democrats of his era could never have imagined, Dick Cheney said last year he was voting for their candidate, Kamala Harris, for president against Trump. A survivor of five heart attacks, Cheney long thought he was living on borrowed time and declared in 2013 he now awoke each morning “with a smile on my face, thankful for the gift of another day,” an odd image for a figure who always seemed to be manning the ramparts. His vice presidency defined by the age of terrorism, Cheney disclosed that he had had the wireless function of his defibrillator turned off years earlier out of fear terrorists would remotely send his heart a fatal shock. Instead, Cheney made it a network of back channels from which to influence policy on Iraq, terrorism, presidential powers, energy and other cornerstones of a conservative agenda. A hard-liner on Iraq who was increasingly isolated as other hawks left government, Cheney was proved wrong on point after point in the Iraq War, without ever losing the conviction that he was essentially right. He said U.S. troops would be welcomed as liberators; they weren't. He declared the Iraqi insurgency in its last throes in May 2005, back when 1,661 U.S. service members had been killed, not even half the toll by war's end. But well into Bush's second term, Cheney's clout waned, checked by courts or shifting political realities.Courts ruled against efforts he championed to broaden presidential authority and accord special harsh treatment to suspected terrorists. His hawkish positions on Iran and North Korea were not fully embraced by Bush. With Bush out of town on that fateful day, Cheney was a steady presence in the White House, at least until Secret Service agents lifted him off his feet and carried him away, in a scene the vice president later described to comical effect. From the beginning, Cheney and Bush struck an odd bargain, unspoken but well understood. Shelving any ambitions he might have had to succeed Bush, Cheney was accorded power comparable in some ways to the presidency itself. “He is constituted in a way to be the ultimate No. 2 guy,” Dave Gribbin, a friend who grew up with Cheney in Casper, Wyoming, and worked with him in Washington, once said. As Cheney put it: “I made the decision when I signed on with the president that the only agenda I would have would be his agenda, that I was not going to be like most vice presidents — and that was angling, trying to figure out how I was going to be elected president when his term was over with.”His penchant for secrecy and backstage maneuvering had a price. And when he shot a hunting companion in the torso, neck and face with an errant shotgun blast in 2006, he and his coterie were slow to disclose that extraordinary turn of events. When Bush began his presidential quest, he sought help from Cheney, a Washington insider who had retreated to the oil business. Together, the pair faced a protracted 2000 postelection battle before they could claim victory. A series of recounts and court challenges — a tempest that brewed from Florida to the nation's highest court — left the nation in limbo for weeks. In office, disputes among departments vying for a bigger piece of Bush's constrained budget came to his desk and often were settled there.On Capitol Hill, Cheney lobbied for the president's programs in halls he had walked as a deeply conservative member of Congress and the No. Jokes abounded about how Cheney was the real No. 1 in town; Bush didn't seem to mind and cracked a few himself. But such comments became less apt later in Bush's presidency as he clearly came into his own. Cheney retired to Jackson Hole, not far from where Liz Cheney a few years later bought a home, establishing Wyoming residency before she won his old House seat in 2016. The fates of father and daughter grew closer, too, as the Cheney family became one of Trump's favorite targets. Dick Cheney rallied to his daughter's defense in 2022 as she juggled her lead role on the committee investigating Jan. 6 with trying to get reelected in deeply conservative Wyoming. Liz Cheney's vote for Trump's impeachment after the insurrection earned her praise from many Democrats and political observers outside Congress. Politics first lured Dick Cheney to Washington in 1968, when he was a congressional fellow. He became a protégé of Rep. Donald Rumsfeld, R-Ill,, serving under him in two agencies and in Gerald Ford's White House before he was elevated to chief of staff, the youngest ever, at age 34. Cheney held the post for 14 months, then returned to Casper, where he had been raised, and ran for the state's single congressional seat. In that first race for the House, Cheney suffered a mild heart attack, prompting him to crack he was forming a group called “Cardiacs for Cheney.” He still managed a decisive victory and went on to win five more terms. Cheney was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, son of a longtime Agriculture Department worker. Senior class president and football co-captain in Casper, he went to Yale on a full scholarship for a year but left with failing grades. He moved back to Wyoming, eventually enrolled at the University of Wyoming and renewed a relationship with high school sweetheart Lynne Anne Vincent, marrying her in 1964.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>John E. Sununu, the former New Hampshire Republican senator seeking to reclaim his seat from retiring Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), has a mixed voting record on supporting Israel that could reignite Jewish criticism and present an obstacle in a contested GOP primary. Chris Sununu, opposed several pro-Israel resolutions in the late 1990s and early 2000s during his three terms as a congressman. During his single term as a senator from 2003 to 2009, John E. Sununu was an outlier in his party, advocating more humanitarian assistance to Palestinians. More recently, he's tiptoed around taking a position on the Israel-Gaza war that's become a flashpoint of U.S. politics and elections, even as he seeks the nomination of a party that staunchly embraces Israel. During his three terms as a New Hampshire congressman from 1997 to 2003, Sununu opposed a series of pro-Israel resolutions, according to voting records. In 2000, Sununu was one of two Republicans to vote “present” on a resolution expressing support for Israel and condemning the Palestinian Authority for violence. That same year, he was one of two Republicans to oppose the Peace Through Negotiations Act, which was against Palestinian statehood and would have withheld U.S. aid and resources to international organizations that recognize the region as a free state. Sununu ultimately prevailed in his 2002 Senate campaign, but not without criticism and obstacles from the pro-Israel lobby due to his voting record, which some Jewish organizations and leaders perceived as anti-Israel. In the weeks before his October campaign launch and prior to a U.S.-led peace deal announced by President Donald Trump, Sununu was asked by New Hampshire ABC affiliate WMUR if the Senate should put restraints on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's actions in Gaza. “John Sununu knows that peace in the Middle East has been elusive for decades, and he supports President Trump's policies that have reshaped the dynamics of the region and brought about an historic ceasefire,” Mike Schrimpf, a Sununu spokesman, said in a statement. “Israel has every right to defend itself and remains America's strongest ally in the region.” “With this bold approach, the administration has created an unprecedented opportunity for peace initiatives to move forward in the region,” Schrimpf said. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the leading pro-Israel lobbying group, did not respond to a request for comment about Sununu or whether it might get involved in the New Hampshire Senate primary and general elections. Despite his string of anti-Israel votes, Sununu took several positions as a senator that were more in line with his party and in support of the U.S. ally. The Senate GOP's campaign arm, which is supporting Sununu over Brown, said Sununu will be a stronger Trump ally on Middle East policy. “Liberal Chris Pappas would appease Democrats' pro-Hamas radical base and guarantee Jewish Americans and Israelis have one less ally in the U.S. Senate, while John Sununu will stand with America's ally and support President Trump's peace efforts in the Middle East,” NRSC Regional press secretary Samantha Cantrell said in a statement. Brown, who himself has a checkered record on cultural issues that stand in contrast to conservative values, criticized Sununu on what he said “is not a complicated or nuanced issue for me.” Brown faced criticism in his 2012 reelection campaign, which he lost to Warren, for featuring a man in a campaign ad who was later discovered to have made antisemitic social media posts and derogatory remarks about Warren and former President Barack Obama.</p>

But his policies are making gas cars more expensive too. As President Donald Trump sees it, environmental regulations that attempt to improve efficiency and address climate change only make products more expensive and perform worse. He has long blamed efficiency regulations for his frustrations with things like toilets and showerheads. He began his second term in office to “unleash prosperity through deregulation.” But there's at least one big way that American companies and households may end up paying more, not less, for the president's anti-environment policy moves. Kelley Blue Book reported that the average sticker price for a new car topped $50,000 for the first time in September. For most Americans, gasoline is their single-largest energy expenditure, around $2,930 per household each year on average. While a more efficient dishwasher, light bulb, or faucet may have a higher sticker price up front — especially as manufacturers adjust to new rules — cars, appliances, solar panels, and electronics can more than pay for themselves with lower operating costs over their lifetimes. And Trump's agenda of suddenly rolling back efficiency rules has simultaneously made it harder for many industries to do business while raising costs for ordinary Americans. No one knows this better than the US auto industry, which has whiplashed between competing environmental regulations for over a decade. President Barack Obama tightened vehicle efficiency and pollution standards. Now Trump is reversing course again — leaving the $1.6 trillion US auto industry unsure what turn to take next. In July, the Environmental Protection Agency began undoing a foundational legal basis that lets the agency limit climate pollution from cars. By weakening fuel efficiency and pollution rules, the administration is setting up consumers to spend more on gasoline and vehicle maintenance — the opposite of what Trump says he's aiming for. Rolling back standards means locking in pricier, dirtier cars for longer. Energy analysts estimate households could spend an extra $310 billion on fuel by 2050 as efficiency progress stalls. While Europe and China double down on electric vehicles, Trump's policies discourage EV investment. The big picture: Policies meant to “save money” are instead locking Americans into higher energy bills, costlier cars, and a slower transition to cleaner, cheaper technology. Because it takes years and billions of dollars to develop new cars that comply with stricter rules, carmakers would prefer if regulations stayed put one way or the other. Every rule change adds time and expense to the development lifecycle, which ultimately gets baked into a car's price tag. Changing rules are also vexing for electric car makers, whose models are gaining traction both in the US and around the world, even as the Trump administration has ended tax incentives for EVs. Trump is making things even more difficult by pulling support for domestic battery production that would help US car companies build electric cars. It all adds up to a huge headache for the industry. “Particularly in the last six months, I think ‘chaos' is a good word because they're getting hit from every angle,” said David Cooke, senior associate director at the Center for Automotive Research at Ohio State University. As the government relaxes efficiency targets, progress will stall and car buyers will get stuck with cars that cost more to operate. Energy Innovation, a think tank, found that repealing tailpipe standards could cost households an extra $310 billion by 2050, mainly through more spending on gasoline. Undoing the standards would also increase air pollution and shrink the job market for US electric vehicle manufacturing due to lower demand. Even the Trump administration's own analysis of the effects of undoing the EPA's greenhouse gas emissions regulations found that his moves would drive up gasoline prices due to more fuel consumption from less efficient vehicles. “Repealing these standards in particular would set America back decades,” said Sara Baldwin, senior director for electrification at Energy Innovation. While the Trump administration shifts gears, other countries are racing ahead. Automakers can design electric cars faster than conventional internal combustion-powered vehicles, since EVs generally have fewer components, and manufacturers don't have to worry about designing pollution controls to meet tightening restrictions. Since EVs are mechanically simpler, they also need less maintenance. Conventional cars, by contrast, typically take around five years to go from the drawing board to dealer lots, so the gasoline-powered cars being designed now won't come out until 2030 — when someone else will be in the White House. Markets like Europe are holding fast to their environmental regulations and are looking to ban the sales of internal combustion vehicles altogether. Though car companies often grumble about the expenses and effort they have to expend when environmental regulations become stricter, regulatory uncertainty continues to be a much bigger nuisance. “These changes in regulations are really disruptive to the industry and are hurting our global economic competitiveness,” said Gregory Keoleian, co-director of the Center for Sustainable Systems at the University of Michigan. The Category 5 storm is an extraordinary threat — even in a season that felt unusually quiet. ﻿People in the Caribbean need help now — and for years to come.
