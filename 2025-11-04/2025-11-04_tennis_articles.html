Blockx capitalized on his first real opportunity, breaking Droguet in the ninth game before serving out the set 6–4. The Belgian continued his strong form in the second set, breaking early and maintaining control with solid serving and superior consistency. I served well, and with just two breaks in the match, it was pretty tight. Physically, I didn't have as much energy as in the previous days, which is normal after four tough matches. My semifinal [against top seed Raphael Collignon] was one of the best matches I've ever played, so it's not easy to keep that level. I'm happy I managed to finish strong.”The young Belgian faced a major challenge as early as the first round, where he was just two points away from defeat against Germany's Jan-Lennard Struff.“Honestly, I was just happy to get through that first round,” Blockx admitted. “That gave me confidence, and I played better with every match.
