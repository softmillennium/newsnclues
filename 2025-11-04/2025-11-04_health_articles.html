                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An analysis of brain scans from 572 people reveals that activity in brain regions linked to reward and social processing can predict how effective messages will be. Christin Scholz, Hang-Yee Chan, Emily Falk, and colleagues pooled data from 16 functional MRI studies to explore how the human brain responds to persuasive messages across various contexts, including public health campaigns, crowdfunding sites, movie trailers, and YouTube videos. Across these diverse settings, the researchers found that effective messages activated brain regions involved in anticipating and receiving rewards, as well as those related to understanding other people's thoughts and feelings - a process known as mentalizing. These brain responses predicted not only which messages were preferred by participants who underwent brain scans, but also which messages were well received by broader audiences whose brains were not scanned. These results suggest that certain aspects of our neural responses - such as whether a message prompts us to think about others or evokes emotion - may serve as universal indicators of persuasiveness across people and contexts. According to the authors, these insights deepen our understanding of what makes a message effective and could inspire new, broadly applicable persuasion strategies. Scholz, C., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An international team of researchers has used genetic engineering to create the first ever “product-ready” antivenom for snakes such as cobras and mambas. This work shows how we developed the first “product-ready” recombinant snakebite antivenom that covers all the elapid species in Africa, including cobras, mambas, and rinkhals snakes, and which outperforms existing serum-derived antivenoms.” Because the antibodies are produced recombinantly - using genetic engineering - rather than harvested from immunized animals, future manufacturing does not depend on the use of animals. Snakebite is a neglected tropical disease (NTD), causing over 100,000 deaths annually and 300,000 disabilities each year, mostly in poor rural communities. Current animal-derived antivenoms are lifesaving but flawed, showing batch variability, side effects, and limited snake species coverage. Creating an antivenom that works for all bites is extremely challenging because each snake species produces a different mix of toxins that attack nerves, blood, or tissues. This study used genetic engineering to develop a recombinant nanobody-based antivenom, combining eight alpaca- and llama-derived nanobodies that neutralize seven toxin families across cobras, mambas, and rinkhals snakes – all African elapids. The new therapy outperformed traditional serum antivenoms, preventing death and tissue damage in animal models while offering greater safety and consistency. Dr Menzies said: “This research highlights the potential of biotechnology to develop antivenoms capable of neutralising toxins from multiple snake species. While clinical validation will be crucial, these findings represent an important step towards improving the treatment of snakebite.” Next steps include optimizing large-scale production and clinical translation to make recombinant antivenoms accessible in the field. Lead author Professor Andreas Hougaard Laustsen-Kiel from the Technical University of Denmark said: “It is fantastic to see how international collaboration between complementary research groups can help make a mission like this successful. I truly believe that team efforts like this can help transform snakebite envenoming therapy and bring better treatments to those victims most in need.” Nanobody-based recombinant antivenom for cobra, mamba and rinkhals bites.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Every 27 minutes, someone in Australia is diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Best known for its tremors, movement and balance issues, it also brings another, often overlooked burden – persistent pain. Now, new research from the University of South Australia shows that many people with Parkinson's are struggling to manage their pain, with researchers calling for more individualized, multidisciplinary and empathetic care. In two studies that assessed how people with Parkinson's manage pain and their experiences of pain care services, researchers found notable gaps in support, with many people resorting to trial-and-error strategies due to a lack of tailored clinical care. In Australia, more than 65,000 people with Parkinson's disease experience persistent pain. Lead researcher and UniSA PhD candidate Anthony Mezzini says we need to improve quality pain care for people with Parkinson's. Pain is a prevalent and debilitating non-motor symptom of Parkinson's. People with Parkinson's told us that they often rely on trial-and-error approaches to manage their pain – not because they want to, but because they don't always have access to specialist pain support or tailored advice. When pain care worked well, it was because healthcare professionals – especially allied health practitioners and Parkinson's nurses – took the time to listen, understand their experience, and tailor care to their specific needs." However, these qualities were inconsistent across the health care system, with people reporting mixed feedback about the support they received from general practitioners and neurologists, and significant access barriers in rural and regional areas. UniSA's researcher and Parkinson's Nurse Dr Sue Sharrad says improving pain management for people with Parkinson's requires both greater access to multidisciplinary care and enhanced training for healthcare providers. "Embedding empathetic, individualized care into routine practice – and expanding access to Parkinson's nurses and allied health professionals – could make a real difference," Dr Sharrad says. "Parkinson's specialist nurses and allied health professionals are often praised for their high level of care. We need to ensure that every person with Parkinson's receives pain care that's tailored, evidence-based, and delivered by professionals who understand the complex nature of Parkinson's pain. By making care more personalized, coordinated, and compassionate, we can help people with Parkinson's live better, less painful lives."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Investigators from Mass General Brigham have developed a way to promote antitumor immunity by hijacking cellular machinery within cancer cells. The study demonstrated that inducing cancer cells to produce an immune-activating molecule led to reduced tumor growth in preclinical models. Natalie Artzi, PhD, corresponding author, researcher in the Mass General Brigham Department of Medicine The presence of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in a cell's cytoplasm activates innate immune sensors that set off defense mechanisms against potential infections or cellular damage. One such sensor known as cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) detects cytosolic dsDNA and produces cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), which triggers the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway and leads to inflammatory immune responses. Furthermore, cGAMP can be transported out of the cell to activate neighbouring cells. While cancer cells can have high levels of cytosolic dsDNA, they often silence the cGAS-STING pathway - preventing their own activation and of bystander immune cells within the tumor microenvironment. The research team exploited this innate mechanism within cancer cells to increase cGAMP production and thereby boost antitumor immunity. They found that cultured mouse melanoma cells upregulated cGAMP production when treated with dsDNA and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) carrying mRNA coding for cGAS. Similarly, treatment with cGAS LNPs activated surrounding immune cells, slowed tumor growth and improved overall survival in mouse models of aggressive melanoma. Combining this treatment with immune checkpoint blockade therapy further improved outcomes. The authors suggest that this strategy could find future applications beyond cancer therapies, including in vaccines.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research that sheds light on how the immune system responds to serious eye infections is underway at Wayne State University, supported by a $2.3 million federal grant from the National Eye Institute of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The study focuses on microbial keratitis, an infection of the cornea often caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterium that is difficult to treat due to its aggressive nature and resistance to many antibiotics. If not treated properly, it can lead to corneal scarring, perforation and blindness. While eosinophils are typically associated with allergy and asthma, there is growing evidence that they play a more nuanced role in infection and tissue repair. By understanding their role, we hope to identify new therapeutic strategies that not only fight infection but also preserve vision." Eosinophils are types of white blood cell that have been largely overlooked in eye research. However, emerging studies suggest that they may help modulate inflammation and promote healing during corneal infection. At the same time, their persistence in the cornea could lead to extensive tissue destruction, including corneal opacity, stromal fibrosis and ulceration. By characterizing the role of eosinophils within the corneal microenvironment, Berger's research aims to fill a critical gap in understanding eosinophil biology in ocular health. She hopes the findings will ultimately lead to novel cellular targets for treating infections and reducing associated complications, particularly in high-risk groups such as contact lens wearers and immunocompromised individuals. "This NIH grant is an exciting addition to Dr. Berger's research portfolio that supports the important research that she is doing here at Wayne State University," said Dr. Ezemenari M. Obasi, vice president for research & innovation. I look forward to the important impact this research will have."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sleep patterns and eating habits can influence each other, but the link between these behaviors remains unclear. In a new JNeurosci paper, researchers led by William Ja, from the Herbert Wertheim UF Scripps Institute for Biomedical Innovation and Technology, used fruit flies (Drosophila) to explore how different kinds of sleep deprivation influence subsequent sleeping and feeding behavior. The researchers tested different sleep loss conditions and discovered that when fruit flies are sleep deprived to the point of energy loss, they compensate by feeding and sleeping more to restore their energy. When the flies experience sleep deprivation that doesn't deprive them of energy, they do not eat or sleep more. Says Ja, "I think our work adds credence to using less-intrusive, behavioral sleep interventions for alleviating eating and metabolic disorders. Our work also suggests that it might be hard to treat sleep or metabolic disorders in isolation-we may need to correct multiple behaviors, including sleep and eating habits, for successful therapeutic interventions."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at Helmholtz Munich and the Technical University of Munich (TUM) have developed Nicheformer, the first large-scale foundation model that integrates single-cell analysis with spatial transcriptomics. Trained on more than 110 million cells, it offers a new way to study how cells are organized and interact in tissues – knowledge that is crucial for understanding health and disease. Single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed biology by showing which genes are active in individual cells. Spatial transcriptomics preserves this context but is technically more limited and harder to scale. Researchers have long lacked a way to study cell identity and tissue organization together. Nicheformer overcomes this barrier by learning from both dissociated and spatial data. It can “transfer” spatial context back onto cells that were previously studied in isolation – essentially reconstructing how they fit into the bigger picture of a tissue. Beyond performance, the researchers also explored interpretability, revealing that the model identifies biologically meaningful patterns in its internal layers – offering a new window into how AI learns from biology. “With Nicheformer we can now transfer spatial information onto dissociated single-cell data at scale,” says Alejandro Tejada-Lapuerta, PhD student at Helmholtz Munich and TUM and co-first author of the study together with Anna Schaar. “This opens up many possibilities to study tissue organization and cellular neighborhoods without additional experiments.” The study connects to the emerging idea of a “Virtual Cell”, a computational representation of how cells behave and interact within their native environments. While this concept is gaining momentum across biology and AI, previous models have largely treated cells as isolated entities, without reasoning their spatial relationships. Nicheformer is the first foundation model to learn directly from spatial organization, offering a way to reconstruct how cells sense and influence their neighbors. Beyond introducing this new capability, the researchers also present an entire suite of spatial benchmarking tasks that challenge future models to capture tissue architecture and collective cellular behavior – an essential step toward biologically realistic AI systems. With Nicheformer we are taking the first steps toward building general-purpose AI models that represent cells in their natural context – the foundation of a Virtual Cell and Tissue model. Such a model could help analyze tumor microenvironments and other complex structures in the body with direct relevance for diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and chronic inflammation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Research into why some areas of the country lack enough doctors has revealed the reasons why medical professionals prefer certain locations over others. The paper entitled “Medical training pathways and underdoctored areas: a qualitative study of doctors working in areas that struggle to recruit and retain” is by Liz Brewster, Michael Lambert, Choon Key Chekar, Clare Mumford, Tasneem Patel, Nicola Rennie and Cliff Shelton from Lancaster Medical School. Undoctored areas are, by definition, those with ongoing issues in recruitment and retention of medical workforce and understanding the motivations for working in these locations is crucial for leveraging access to care in these locations. By examining routes into a location and the impact of different life stages, we have described some of the rationales for working in these areas and reflected on how these decisions were often driven by compromises.” Doctors presented complex, intertwined accounts of their rationale for working in these areas, which encompassed elements of family life, career satisfaction and place-characteristics. For many participants, the driving factor in where they lived and worked was guided by those around them (e.g. family, partners, friends). A medical consultant in the Northwest, Tegan, said: “I can't imagine me leaving. A smaller number expressed their decision-making as being driven by the place itself, sometimes based on the attractions of scenery or outdoor opportunities. Northern GP Yasmin said: “We both wanted to be somewhere more rural. However, a more common explanation for ending up working in an underdoctored area was because of career opportunities or other work-related attractions. Any choice based on one of these factors had potential consequences for the others. For some participants, these intertwined factors were aligned, which enabled them to settle in place, but for others, the factors were in conflict, and compromises had to be made. Dr Brewster said: “Our research highlights some of the patterns where particular types of choices are made, which may be useful for considering future workforce planning. Location of medical school did not seem to be a deciding factor unless there were other affordances offered by the place. “These findings raise questions about what might shift perceptions of places, what meaningful work looks like alongside a good quality of life, and what might be altered to encourage more doctors to work in particular areas.” DeNovix discusses how customer demand inspired the development of specialized CellDrop applications for hepatocytes and organoids.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Both traditional and heated tobacco exposure, whether active or passive, were linked to intestinal permeability, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction, revealing that “smokeless” doesn't mean harmless. They found that adults and children who were exposed to tobacco smoke, either from heated tobacco products (HTPs) or conventional cigarettes, showed markers of oxidative stress and endotoxemia. Unlike electronic cigarettes, which vaporize nicotine-containing liquids, HTPs heat real tobacco at lower, non-combustion temperatures to generate a tobacco aerosol, making them chemically and biologically distinct from vapes. Tobacco use remains a leading preventable cause of disease and death worldwide, mainly due to its connection to cardiovascular disease and cancer. Conventional cigarettes emit a range of toxic compounds that trigger systemic inflammation and chronic health problems. Manufacturers promote HTPs as “safer alternatives,” claiming reduced harmful emissions because of lower heating temperatures. However, emerging data suggest that HTPs still cause oxidative stress and vascular injury similar to traditional cigarettes. One central mechanism underlying tobacco-related harm is endotoxemia, characterized by elevated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels resulting from the presence of Gram-negative bacteria in the bloodstream. Smoking disrupts gut microbiota and weakens the intestinal barrier, allowing LPS to enter circulation. Smoke particles themselves may also carry endotoxins. Circulating LPS activates Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), promoting inflammation and oxidative stress through the activation of NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2). This cascade links intestinal permeability with systemic oxidative stress and endothelial injury observed in both adults and children. While the relationship between endotoxemia and vascular injury is correlational rather than causal, endotoxins may originate not only from the gut but also from the lungs or oral cavity. The reactive oxygen species generated through NOX2 activation impair endothelial function and heighten cardiovascular risk. Comparative data on endotoxemia and NOX2 activation between adults and children exposed to either conventional or heated tobacco remain scarce. The Italian study aimed to fill these gaps by evaluating LPS levels and related oxidative and vascular biomarkers in these populations. Researchers used a cross-sectional study design involving both children passively exposed to tobacco smoke and adults who actively used conventional cigarettes or HTPs. The primary goal was to measure serum LPS levels, with secondary analyses exploring oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and platelet activation. The adult cohort comprised 60 participants: 20 chronic HTP users, 20 smokers, and 20 non-smokers. All HTP users had previously smoked conventional cigarettes. Statistical testing involved ANOVA or non-parametric tests, correlation analysis, and multivariate regression adjusted for age, sex, BMI, and cotinine. Both passive and active exposure to tobacco smoke, whether from HTPs or cigarettes, were linked to increased endotoxemia and intestinal permeability. Among children, serum LPS and zonulin were significantly elevated in both HTP- and cigarette-exposed groups compared with controls, showing no significant difference between exposure types. LPS correlated positively with cotinine, zonulin, and platelet activation markers (sCD40L, P-selectin) and negatively with antioxidant capacity (HBA). Cotinine and zonulin emerged as independent predictors of LPS, reinforcing the connection between nicotine exposure, gut permeability, and oxidative stress. In adults, both HTP users and cigarette smokers exhibited elevated LPS and zonulin levels compared to non-smokers, with no significant difference between the two groups. LPS correlated positively with zonulin, NOX2, hydrogen peroxide, and platelet activation markers but negatively with nitric oxide, evidence of endothelial dysfunction. Regression models identified zonulin and nitric oxide bioavailability as key predictors of LPS, underscoring the intertwined nature of gut barrier disruption and vascular stress. The findings demonstrate that both HTPs and cigarettes, whether actively used or passively inhaled, promote low-grade endotoxemia linked to oxidative stress and vascular impairment. This challenges industry claims that HTPs are meaningfully safer alternatives to traditional smoking. While comprehensive in scope, the study's small sample size, lack of microbiome data, and absence of mechanistic experimentation limit the ability to draw causal conclusions. Prior cigarette use among HTP users could also confound results. The authors further note that HTP aerosol temperatures can still reach levels sufficient for nicotine pyrolysis, potentially eliciting similar oxidative responses to those from combustible cigarettes. Nicotine exposure itself may exacerbate gut permeability and dysbiosis, amplifying oxidative stress. In conclusion, both HTPs and conventional cigarettes impair gut barrier integrity and increase cardiovascular risk, refuting claims of reduced harm. The results highlight the urgent need for stronger tobacco control policies and targeted public health interventions to protect both smokers and those exposed to second-hand smoke.
