                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin traders hoping that the top crypto asset has already marked its bottom for the cycle are likely to be disappointed, according to a new report from CryptoQuant. The firm's weekly report insists traders need patience, noting that bear market bottoms “take time to form,” while citing the true bottom for BTC is $55,000. “Bitcoin's ultimate bear market bottom is around $55K today,” the report reads. CryptoQuant's analysis mirrors that from others in the last few weeks. Galaxy's head of research noted the asset's lack of near-term catalysts and structural weakness as reasons it could head towards its 200-week moving average around $58,000. Plus, earlier this week, Standard Chartered updated its forecast to indicate that BTC could drop to $50,000 before any sort of rebound towards $100,000. Predictors on Myriad—a prediction market operated by Decrypt's parent company, Dastan—feel similarly, favoring Bitcoin's drop to $55,000 before a pump to $84,000 at around 54% as of Saturday morning. Nevertheless, BTC has climbed 1.6% in the last 24 hours, recently changing hands around $69,724. At that mark, it has now dropped around 27% in the last 30 days and has fallen nearly 45% from its October all-time high of $126,080. Inicia sesión para acceder a tu cartera de valores</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin BTC$69,706.52 has clawed its way back above $70,000, recovering from a sharp drop near $60,000 earlier in the month. The rebound comes as investors react to a cooler-than-expected U.S. inflation print and signs of renewed risk appetite. That gave markets a reason to believe interest rate cuts could arrive sooner than expected, lifting both stocks and cryptocurrencies. Lower interest rates make risk assets more attractive, as the rate of return on risk-free or low-risk investments lowers. Traders on prediction market Kalshi are currently weighing a 26% chance of a 25 bps rate cut in April, up from 19% earlier in the week. “Nevertheless, the rotation of supply from weaker hands to conviction investors has historically been associated with market stabilisation phases, though such redistribution requires time to fully unfold,” Bitwise wrote. Bitcoin treasury firms were sitting on over $21 billion of unrealized losses, an all-time high. Bitcoin's recovery has seen that figure drop to $16.9 billion. As Bitwise research analyst Danny Nelson told CoinDesk, the market's “main driver right now is fear. That fear is seeing investors take any coming rally as a chance to sell. Whether that will keep on materializing or the shift to higher-conviction holders will see the market change directions remains to be seen.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum price has pushed decisively back above the $2,000 mark, trading between $2,060 and $2,080 after gaining more than 6% in the latest session. While the broader crypto market has turned positive, ETH's rebound carries deeper structural implications as institutional flows stabilize and on-chain participation accelerates. However, fresh ETF data, improving network activity, and historical volatility patterns now suggest the rebound may be evolving beyond a simple relief rally. Data from U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs shows a meaningful shift in capital flows. Daily total value traded reached $1.10 billion, highlighting that institutional participation remains active even amid volatility. This shift is particularly notable given the aggressive withdrawals seen at the end of January, including a $252.87 million outflow on Jan. 30 and $155.61 million on Jan. 29. The stabilization and quick return of capital suggest repositioning rather than capitulation. Market attention has also turned to Fundstrat's Tom Lee, who argues that Ethereum may be setting up for another classic V-shaped rebound. His thesis is grounded in repeated historical behavior. Since 2018, Ethereum has endured eight separate drawdowns exceeding 50%, with declines ranging between -50% and -81%. In every instance, the correction eventually gave way to sharp V-bottom recoveries once leverage was flushed and macro pressures stabilized. After collapsing more than 80% from its peak, ETH staged a powerful recovery as inflation peaked and monetary tightening expectations softened. Similar snapback rallies occurred in prior reset cycles when positioning became overly defensive. JUST IN : Ethereum might be down, but Tom Lee says don't get too comfortable being bearish. He believes BITSTAMP:ETHUSD is setting up for a V-shaped rebound. Since 2018, Ethereum has crashed over 50% eight different times… and every single time it eventually… pic.twitter.com/zTxeG2iuDT Sentiment recently turned cautious, price retraced significantly from highs, ETF outflows peaked late January, and now flows are stabilizing while on-chain activity strengthens. The current divergence between rising participation and earlier price compression suggests that structural demand remained intact. Such behavior typically reflects accumulation rather than speculative exhaustion. When network growth accelerates while price stabilizes, it often marks the early stage of a broader recovery cycle rather than a short-lived bounce. The latest recovery is technically significant because it follows a classic liquidity sweep beneath the $1800-$2000 demand zone before aggressively reclaiming lost territory. By reclaiming the lower boundary and pushing decisively above $2k, ETH has shifted from distribution risk back toward re-accumulation structure. The short-term moving averages are beginning to flatten and curl upward, signaling improving momentum. In case of further upward movement, immediate resistance sits near $2200-$2450. While no investment is guaranteed, recent data shows institutional flows stabilizing and network growth accelerating, which historically signals structural demand and potential for a broader recovery cycle. If momentum continues, ETH faces immediate resistance at $2,200-$2,450. CUSIP Database provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc. All rights reserved.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In 2026, couples still swap playlists and promise forever, but now they also swap custody arrangements for a ledger, argue over who pays the gas fees, and discover that “our savings” includes a wallet named DefinitelyNotMaritalAssets.eth. Young adults are building wealth in ways the legal system wasn't designed for, with cryptocurrency holdings, monetized social accounts and creator brands. This is pushing prenups from cold-hearted to common sense, Irwin Mitchell, a law firm in the United Kingdom, reported Jan. 16. In a survey of 1,000 Brits aged 18 to 44 with assets, 47% said they're open to a prenup, 32% said they own cryptocurrency, and 58% of crypto owners said they're considering a prenup to protect that digital wealth. The creator economy is also showing up, as 17% said they are content creators with monetized accounts, and 65% of those creators are considering a prenup. The report also flagged a practical headache for divorce courts: Crypto's value can swing dramatically between financial disclosure and a final hearing. We'd love to be your preferred source for news. The funny thing about internet money is that it's now treated like property in plenty of places. In England and Wales, the Property (Digital Assets etc) Act 2025 reinforces that digital assets like crypto tokens can attract property rights, useful when the marital estate includes a pile of Bitcoin next to the kitchen renovation budget. Finding it can be easier than people think (blockchains are traceable), but only if you know where to look, such as exchanges, on-chain wallets, hardware devices and that definitely-not-mine browser extension. Unlike pensions or property, crypto can whipsaw between dates, which is why Irwin Mitchell's lawyers are already talking about the system needing fresher, closer-to-real-time valuations. Coins don't move without private keys, device access or exchange cooperation. Crypto is finally making couples talk about money early, clearly and in writing. The downside is that those talks now include phrases like “cold storage,” “staking rewards” and “multi-sig.” We're always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

SEATTLE, Wash. – Coinme, a Seattle-based cryptocurrency exchange company serving the Tri-Cities area, has resumed full operations after state regulators ordered the company to halt collecting new funds and refund customers. The order was originally issued based on allegations that the firm wrongfully claimed millions of dollars of wired funds as its own income. The Washington State Department of Financial Institutions (DFI) issued a temporary restraining order on December 1, 2025, following an investigation into Coinme's money transmission and virtual currency kiosk operations. Coinme reached an agreement with DFI in late December. A temporary resolution was reached after Coinme submitted financial records and operational information to clarify its business practices.

He simplifies complex market data into sharp, easy-to-understand insights, helping readers stay ahead of trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, and DeFi. His writing combines technical precision with compelling market storytelling. Zcash (ZEC) price surges over 22%, breaking out of a multi-week compression range as volume expands sharply. HBAR price climbed more than 10% following FedEx's entry into the Hedera Governing Council, reinforcing its enterprise narrative. While Bitcoin stabilizes and Ethereum regains short-term structure, selective altcoins are accelerating at a much faster pace. Is this merely a relief rally in sync with Bitcoin's bounce, or are token-specific catalysts adding fuel to the move. A closer look at both price structures and recent developments suggests the rally may have deeper foundations than just market-wide momentum. Zcash (ZEC) has staged one of the strongest single-day recoveries among mid-cap altcoins, rebounding sharply from its recent demand zone near the $210–$220 region. ZEC daily chart shows price reacting aggressively from a long-standing horizontal support area that previously acted as accumulation during earlier cycles. If ZEC token secures a daily close above $300, the next hurdle lies near $330–$350, where prior distribution occurred. The broader privacy-coin narrative has also regained modest traction amid renewed interest in decentralized financial autonomy, which may be adding speculative tailwinds to ZEC's breakout attempt. FedEx's involvement centers around leveraging Hedera's distributed ledger technology to move aspects of global supply chain tracking on-chain. This development strengthens Hedera's enterprise narrative and reinforces its positioning as a high-performance, corporate-friendly blockchain infrastructure. HBAR price has rebounded from the lower boundary of its multi-month descending channel. However, failure to clear resistance could keep HBAR locked within its broader corrective structure. The combination of technical rebound and enterprise-backed news flow provides a stronger foundation for HBAR's move compared to purely sentiment-driven rallies. Both ZEC and HBAR are benefiting from the broader crypto market recovery, but their magnitude of gains suggests selective capital rotation into tokens with either technical breakout setups or credible fundamental triggers. For now, both tokens have shifted momentum decisively in favor of bulls, but confirmation will come only if key breakout levels hold in the sessions ahead.

Crypto正从独立行业转变为隐形基础设施，最好的应用是用户感知不到它的存在。

我在 Crypto 行业待了六七年，近两年同时深入 AI 赛道，常驻硅谷。因为同时在两个圈子里，一个很明显的体感是：硅谷主流圈子里，Crypto 这个词越来越少被提起，但 Crypto 做的事越来越多地被用到。

我想从 AI 这边带一些信号回来，供 Crypto 从业者参考。

这种错位在 YC 身上表现得最明显。

YC Winter 2026 刚刚公布，149 家公司里有 5 家和 Crypto 相关。这个数字不高，但如果你拉一下历史数据，会发现这 5 家背后藏着一个很清晰的故事。

YC 从2014 年开始投 Crypto 项目，到现在一共投了 177 家。我把每个批次的数量拉出来，变化很直观：

2018-2019 年，每批 3-7 家，稳步爬坡。2020 年，每批 5-7 家，开始提速。2021 年，直接跳到每批 13-15 家。2022 年到了顶峰——Winter 一个批次投了 24 家，Summer 投了 20 家，一年投了 44家 Crypto 公司。

然后就是断崖。

2023 年还有每批 10-13 家，撑了一年。2024 年开始崩——Winter 7 家、Fall 4 家、Summer 直接掉到 1 家。一整个夏天，YC 只投了 1家 Crypto 公司。

2025年 Winter 短暂反弹到 10 家，但紧接着 Spring和 Summer 又掉到每批只有 2 家。

到了 2026年 Winter，5 家。





如果你是 Crypto 从业者，看到"从 1 回到 5"可能会觉得是回暖信号。但如果你去看这 5 家到底在做什么，你会发现它们和 2022 年那 24 家几乎是两个物种。

2022年 YC 投的 Crypto 公司在做什么？DeFi 协议、NFT 基础设施、DAO 工具、L2 扩容、链游、社交代币。

2026 年这 5 家在做什么？稳定币存款 API、跨境新银行、交易执行引擎、AI Agent 支付网关、注意力交易所。

没有一家在做链，没有一家在做协议，没有一家在做任何你能叫得出名字的传统"Crypto 赛道"。

这不是回暖，这是换血。

先快速过三个相对好理解的。

Unifold，纽约团队，做 Crypto 存款的 Stripe。一套 API+SDK，让任何 App 用不到 10 行代码接入跨链、跨 Token 的链上存款。联合创始人 Timothy Chung 之前做过 Streambird（钱包即服务，后来被 MoonPay 收购变成了 MoonPay Wallets），在 Polymarket和 Instabase 也待过。另一位创始人 Hau Chu 毕业于康奈尔科技学院（Cornell Tech）。这是一个典型的开发者工具生意——用户不需要知道底层是 Crypto。

SpotPay，旧金山团队，基于稳定币的跨境新银行。CTO Thomas 之前在 Google，是 Brex 的第 4 号工程师。CEO Zsika 也是 Google 出身，斯坦福 MBA（Stanford MBA），在加勒比和拉美长大，亲身经历过跨境汇款有多痛苦。产品很直接：一个账户搞定海外收款、本地支付、全球消费（有实体卡）、储蓄生息。底层跑稳定币，但前端就是一个 Fintech App，和 Crypto 没有任何视觉关系。

Sequence Markets，纽约，5 人团队，做数字资产的智能交易执行。帮机构投资者跨交易所做智能路由，拿更好价格、更低滑点。完全非托管，不碰用户资产，只做技术层——典型的卖水模式。

这三家的共同点很明确：Crypto 是管道，不是卖点。

这个项目我觉得 Crypto 从业者应该认真看看。



创始人 Christian Pickett 之前在 Coinbase 做支付，还在 Vercel 待过。Bera Sogut在 Google 做过 reCAPTCHA和 Maps APIs，在 Amazon Robotics 也待过，两次 ACM ICPC（国际大学生程序设计竞赛）世界总决赛选手。

他们要解决的问题是这样的：现在 AI Agent 越来越多，这些 Agent 需要调用各种付费 API 来完成任务。但 Agent 没有信用卡，没有银行账户，没法像人一样走注册-绑卡-付款的流程。目前的做法是开发者预先给 Agent 充值或绑自己的 API key，Agent 少的时候能凑合，但当成千上万个 Agent 需要自主调用数百个付费服务时，这套体系撑不住。



Orthogonal 做了一个统一网关：Agent 通过 MCP或 SDK 接入，即时访问数百个付费 API，按请求付费，不需要管理 API key，不需要建立计费关系。API 提供者上架一次，就能被所有 Agent 发现和调用。底层用 Crypto 做结算，支持 x402 协议——HTTP 402 Payment Required 的链上实现。

为什么这件事和 Crypto 行业有关？因为机器对机器的实时微支付，恰好是传统金融体系做不好的事——信用卡有手续费门槛，银行转账有到账延迟，这些在人类交易中可以忍受的摩擦，在 Agent 每天调用几千几万次 API 的场景里就变成了硬伤。而 Crypto 的可编程性、即时结算、无许可性，天然适配这个场景。

值得注意的时间线：YC 在2025 年秋季的 RFS（选题指南）中重点推了"Infrastructure for Multi-Agent Systems"，半年后就投了 Orthogonal。早期支持者里有 Precip（W24）、Riveter（F24）、Andi（W22）、Fiber AI（S23）等一批做 Agent 产品的 YC 校友公司，说明这个需求不是理论推演，是真实存在的。

这里有个有意思的交叉点：橘子最近那篇刷屏的文章里说"Agent 才是软件的新主人"，SaaS 要从 2B、2C 变成 2A（to Agent）。如果这个判断成立，那 Agent 之间的支付就是一个必须被解决的基础设施问题——而 Orthogonal 押注的是 Crypto 来解决它。

这个项目的想象力最大，风险也最大。

创始人 Owen Botkin 之前在 Balyasny（全球顶级对冲基金之一）做多空股票交易。Joseph Thomas 做过 NASA（美国国家航空航天局）和 DreamwaveAI 的工程师。YC 给这个项目配的 Partner是 Jared Friedman——这位是 YC 的核心合伙人之一。

Forum 要做的是"第一个受监管的注意力交易所"。具体来说：从搜索引擎、社交媒体、流媒体平台的数据中构建指数，量化某个话题、品牌、文化现象"被关注的程度"，然后让用户做多或做空这个关注度的变化。

举个例子：如果你判断某个品牌即将因为 PR 危机失去公众注意力，你可以做空它的注意力指数。如果你判断某个文化现象正在快速升温，你可以做多。

他们的核心论点是：注意力是数字时代商业成功的首要驱动力，广告、流量、用户增长，归根到底都是注意力的变现。但注意力本身从来没有被直接定价和交易过。

这个项目目前的标签里没有写 Crypto/Web3，但"regulated exchange"加上"创造新资产类别"这个形态，大概率会涉及 token 化。2026 年春季 YC的 RFS 里首次出现了"new financial primitives"（新金融基元）的说法，Forum 正好踩在这个方向上。

对 Crypto 行业来说，Forum 代表的方向比稳定币支付远得多——如果 token 化的对象不再是 JPEG、不再是房地产份额，而是"注意力"这种此前无法量化的东西，那这是一个完全不同的故事。当然，能不能跑通还太早说。

除了看 YC 投了什么，还值得看 YC 公开说它想投什么。

YC 每个季度会发布 RFS（Request for Startups），相当于官方选题指南。我把最近三期的 Crypto 相关内容梳理了一下：



2025 年夏季：14 个方向，Crypto 一个字没提。连"AI for Personal Finance"这条讨论投资和税务优化的都完全没提 Crypto。YC 的注意力被 AI 占满了。

2025 年秋季：还是没有 Crypto 专条，但两个方向埋了伏笔——"AI-Native Hedge Funds"（数字资产市场 24/7、数据开放，天然适合 AI 量化），以及"Infrastructure for Multi-Agent Systems"（这正是 Orthogonal 后来切入的场景）。

2026 年春季：变化来了。Daivik Goel 专门写了一条"Stablecoin Financial Services"，直接点名 GENIUS Act和 CLARITY Act 这两个美国稳定币法案，说稳定币正处于 DeFi和 TradFi 之间的监管中间地带。原话是："The regulatory window is open. The rails are being laid."（监管窗口已经打开，轨道正在铺设。）



同期 RFS 的整体介绍里还首次出现了"new financial primitives"（新金融基元）的说法，和 AI-native workflows、现代化工业系统并列。

这是 YC 近两年来第一次在 RFS 中为 Crypto 相关方向单独开题。措辞也很具体——不是说"区块链"或"Web3"，而是精确到"stablecoin financial services"，并给出了具体方向：yield-bearing accounts、tokenized real-world assets、跨境支付基础设施。

作为一个同时在 Crypto和 AI 两个赛道的人，我觉得这组数据对我们 Crypto 从业者其实是个好消息——只是好消息的方式可能和很多人预期的不一样。

YC 没有放弃 Crypto，但 YC 重新定义了什么样的 Crypto 公司值得投。

用一句话概括就是：YC 不再投 Crypto，YC 在投用 Crypto 的公司。

区别在哪？前者的价值主张是"我在建设 Crypto 生态"，后者的价值主张是"我在解决一个真实问题，而 Crypto 恰好是最合适的工具"。

前者的用户需要理解什么是钱包、Gas 费、链上交互。后者的用户根本不知道自己在用 Crypto——SpotPay 的用户以为自己在用一个银行 App，Unifold 的客户以为自己在接入一个支付 SDK，Orthogonal的 Agent 甚至没有"以为"这个概念。

这对我们意味着什么？

首先是好消息：稳定币支付赛道已经从圈内共识变成硅谷主流共识。YC在 RFS 里单独开题，GENIUS Act和 CLARITY Act 推进，Stripe 收购 Bridge——这些信号叠在一起，说明稳定币的合规路径正在打通。对于一直在这个赛道深耕的团队来说，融资环境和市场认知都在改善。

其次是新机会：Agent 支付是一个从 AI 行业内部长出来的需求，Crypto 从业者有天然优势去接住它。机器对机器的实时微支付，可编程货币，无许可结算——这些我们讲了好几年的东西，在 Agent 经济里突然有了最具体的应用场景。这不是我们去找场景，是场景自己找上了门。

当然也有需要正视的现实：竞争对手的 profile 变了。SpotPay的 CTO是 Brex 的第 4 号工程师，Orthogonal 的创始人来自 Coinbase和 Google——这些人不是 Crypto native，但他们带着传统科技公司的工程能力和产品方法论进来了。我们 Crypto 行业的人要和他们竞争，光靠对链的理解不够，还需要补上产品体验和工程化的课。

另外，L1/L2、DeFi 协议、NFT、DAO 工具这些方向——不是说没有价值，但在硅谷主流加速器和 VC 的视野里，确实已经不在优先级上了。这不等于这些方向完蛋了，但如果你在做这些方向，融资策略和叙事方式可能需要调整。

最后，"24→1→5"这条数据线，我觉得最准确的解读不是"Crypto 在复苏"，也不是"Crypto 在衰落"，而是：Crypto 正在被重新定义。

YC 花了两年时间想清楚了一件事——Crypto 最大的价值可能不是成为一个独立的行业，而是成为其他行业的基础设施。这个判断对不对，还需要时间验证。但作为同时在两个赛道的人，我觉得这里面有大量属于 Crypto 从业者的机会——前提是我们愿意换一个角度看自己。

Crypto 不需要消失，但 Crypto 最好的产品，用户可能感觉不到 Crypto 的存在。

这不是妥协，这可能是最大的胜利。

你可以不同意这个判断，但这就是目前硅谷最有影响力的创业加速器，用真金白银表达的立场。

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump Media and Technology Group Corp. has filed new proposals for crypto exchange-traded funds. The Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs will provide investors with direct exposure to these digital assets. They are designed to allow participation in staking rewards while operating under oversight by Yorkville America Equities. Kris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com, said, “We are pleased to provide digital asset custody, liquidity, and staking services for these new Truth Social Funds ETFs.” He added that Crypto.com supports the value proposition of the two digital asset ETFs. JUST IN: Trump Media & Technology Group is seeking to launch a Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, along with a fund tracking the native token of the Cronos blockchain developed by Crypto .com. Last August, the SEC delayed decisions on several of TMTG's crypto ETF proposals. It will offer network staking rewards for investors while being managed in collaboration with Yorkville and Crypto.com. Trump Media first announced plans to enter the crypto ETF market in June 2025. The initial registration included a Bitcoin ETF and a broader “Crypto Blue Chip” fund tracking multiple tokens, including BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, and CRO. In August 2025, the SEC delayed decisions on several TMTG crypto ETF proposals. The agency's review process has been faster for some funds, but those staking underlying assets or tracking smaller tokens remain under scrutiny. The new filings indicate that Trump Media and Technology Group is continuing efforts to list ETFs despite regulatory delays. All purchases for the funds will be conducted through Crypto.com's broker-dealer, Foris Capital US LLC. Crypto.com and Anchorage Digital also support Trump Media's Bitcoin treasury. Future plans include a non-equity rewards token for DJT stockholders that may also use the Cronos blockchain. Trump Media's CEO is former California Congressman Devin Nunes, who left office in 2021. These ETF filings follow previous regulatory delays and indicate the company's continued interest in digital asset investment products. TMTG is positioning itself to participate actively in the crypto investment space. His work has been featured in top publications including Coingape, Cryptobasic, MetaNews, Coinedition, and Analytics Insight.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Authorities will also strictly vet offshore issuance of tokens backed by Chinese onshore assets, according to a notice published on the central ‍bank's ⁠website. Although the statement largely reiterates Beijing's existing ban on cryptocurrency, some are encouraged by signs China is setting up a legal framework for the real-world asset (RWA) tokenisation business. “The biggest breakthrough is a clear separation between virtual currencies and RWA,” said Louis Wan, CEO of Unified Labs. “Virtual currencies ​will still be outlawed, but RWA is being included ‌in the regulatory system. Winston Ma, an adjunct professor ​at NYU School of Law, said that China's central bank is essentially highlighting that only its own digital yuan is legitimate, “not a patchwork of private RMB (yuan) stablecoins circulating on global crypto exchanges.” Beijing has long taken a tough stance on virtual currencies, but officials said recent “speculative activities” posed new challenges that warranted additional measures. Regulators also banned domestic and foreign entities from issuing offshore stablecoins ‌pegged to the yuan without authorization. The central bank also ‌warned financial institutions against providing ‍banking and ⁠clearing services ​to virtual currency-related businesses. Regarding the RWA business, under which all kinds of Chinese goods are being turned into digital assets with little oversight, ⁠offshore issuance of tokens must be strictly regulated by ⁠relevant authorities, according to the notice. “To some extent, this means China is allowing the issuance of offshore tokens based on onshore assets,” said Alex Zuo, senior vice president of Singapore-based crypto ‌custodian provider Cobo.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Publicly Traded Blockchain Lender Figure Confirms Customer Data Breach Figure Technology confirmed Friday that it suffered a customer data breach after an employee was targeted in a social engineering attack. The hacking group ShinyHunters claimed responsibility, saying Figure refused to pay a ransom and that it published 2.5 gigabytes of stolen data. TechCrunch, which first reported on the breach, said that it reviewed some of the files, which included customers' full names, home addresses, dates of birth, and phone numbers. “We recently identified that an employee was socially engineered, and that allowed an actor to download a limited number of files through their account,” Figure said in a statement shared with Decrypt. A January report by Chainalysis said that over $17 billion in crypto was stolen last year through AI-powered impersonation scams. Data breaches remained widespread in 2025, with regulators logging more than 8,000 notification filings tied to over 4,000 separate incidents affecting at least 374 million people, according to a December 2025 report by the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse. Founded in 2018, Figure is a New York–based lender that runs its loan platform on the Provenance blockchain, focusing on home equity lines of credit. While the spokesperson declined to go into further detail, a member of ShinyHunters reportedly told TechCrunch the breach was part of a broader campaign targeting companies that rely on single sign-on provider Okta. “We are offering complimentary credit monitoring to all individuals who receive a notice,” the company said.
