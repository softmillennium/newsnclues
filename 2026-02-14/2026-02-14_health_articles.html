                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research reveals how attachment insecurity and materialistic values fuel 'phubbing' in romantic relationships. Constantly checking your phone during conversations with a partner - a behavior known as phubbing - may be less about bad manners and more about deeper psychological needs. The study, published in Behavioral Sciences, shows that people who feel insecure in close relationships are more likely to engage in phubbing or feel hurt by it - particularly when they also place a high value on material success, status, and external validation. Phubbing, short for 'phone snubbing', refers to ignoring someone you are with in favour of your smartphone. While often dismissed as a modern habit or social faux pas, the research suggests it can be driven by attachment-related anxieties and seeking reassurance, attention and self-worth. The researchers surveyed over 200 adults in romantic relationships, measuring their attachment styles, materialistic values, and both 'enacted phubbing' (how much they phub their partner) and 'perceived phubbing' (how much they feel phubbed). They found that, for some people, phones are a source of reassurance, status, or distraction from uncomfortable emotions - even at the cost of face-to-face connection. Study co-author Dr Claire Hart, Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Southampton, said: "Phubbing isn't just about screen time or poor etiquette. For people who feel uncertain in relationships, this can make the phone especially hard to put down. The findings suggest that tackling phubbing in relationships may require more than simply telling people to use their phones less. Dr Hart said: "Taking this approach could be especially valuable in relationship counselling, digital wellbeing initiatives, and conversations between couples about technology and intimacy." The research builds on Dr Hart's previous work that examined people's emotional responses to phubbing. She added: "Understanding why people reach for their phones helps us move beyond blame. Phubbing can be a signal of unmet emotional needs - not just distraction."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Surgical interventions, particularly stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG)-guided temporal lobe resection (TLR) and SEEG-guided responsive neurostimulation (RNS), have emerged as pivotal treatment options. This systematic review aims to compare the efficacy, safety, and quality of life (QoL) outcomes associated with these two interventions in adults with drug-resistant TLE. Eligible studies included adult patients (≥18 years) with drug-resistant TLE who underwent SEEG-guided TLR or RNS, with preoperative SEEG used for localization. Quality assessment was performed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for randomized trials and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies. Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria, encompassing sample sizes ranging from 10 to 440 participants. TLR was associated with transient memory deficits (12%) and mild infections (8%). RNS had higher device-related issues, including lead revisions (10%) and minor infections (4%). The review highlights that SEEG-guided TLR offers superior seizure freedom and reduction rates, making it a highly effective option for patients with well-localized epileptogenic zones. However, it carries risks of cognitive decline, particularly in dominant hemisphere resections. In contrast, RNS provides meaningful seizure reduction with cognitive preservation, making it a valuable alternative for patients with bilateral onset, eloquent cortex involvement, or prior failed resections. The direct comparison of outcomes is limited by inherent differences in patient populations-RNS cohorts often include more complex cases. Individualized treatment planning is essential, balancing seizure control, cognitive risks, and patient-centered outcomes. Most included studies were observational, with only two randomized controlled trials, limiting the strength of comparative conclusions. Variability in outcome definitions and reporting also complicates synthesis. Investigation of demographic and socio-economic factors influencing treatment response. Systematic reporting of device-related complications to refine clinical guidelines. SEEG-guided TLR and RNS are both effective and safe interventions for drug-resistant TLE, with distinct profiles: TLR offers higher seizure freedom, while RNS preserves cognitive function. Treatment should be personalized based on patient-specific factors, including seizure localization, cognitive risks, and QoL priorities. Future studies should prioritize long-term outcomes and refined patient selection criteria to optimize epilepsy care.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Adult survivors of childhood cancers are at higher risk for another cancer – such as breast, colorectal, sarcomas and thyroid cancer – that is not a relapse of their original illness. Previous cancer therapies are largely responsible, however up to 13 percent of survivors also have hereditary predisposition that elevates their risk of subsequent cancer. A recent clinical trial found that genetic services via remote centralized telehealth and in collaboration with primary care increased the uptake of genetic counseling and testing in this population. "Identifying survivors with cancer-predisposing genetic variants allows personalized survivorship care with early screenings and preventive measures," said lead author Tara Henderson, MD, MPH, childhood cancer survivorship expert and Chair of Pediatrics at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, as well as Professor of Pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. "Our study is the first national randomized trial to show that remote telehealth services, working with primary care providers, improve access to genetic counseling and testing for adult survivors of childhood cancers. Genetic services also drive earlier detection of subsequent cancer, which reduces morbidity and mortality." All participants were provided with information on the benefits of genetic testing. Dr. Henderson and colleagues found that at six months, 43 percent of participants in the remote telehealth services group received genetic services, compared to 15 percent in the usual care group. "Better access to genetic services is critical for improving outcomes in childhood cancer survivors. Enhancing motivation for testing may require personalized decision aids, further education about its benefits, and financial support mechanisms to reduce concerns about testing costs."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But which aspects of the training are most influential in this respect? A new study from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign examines how a popular intervention program affected individual outcomes such as mental health, sleep, and substance use. "Past research has looked at different factors that might explain why these programs are helping couples' relationships. But we thought it was remarkable that relationship education also benefits people's individual health, and we wanted to find out what might explain this," said lead author Noah Larsen, a graduate student in the Department of Human Development and Family Studies, part of the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences at Illinois. The study's co-author is Allen Barton, Illinois Extension specialist and assistant professor in HDFS. The program covers topics such as communication, conflict, problem-solving, commitment, and friendship. It is delivered through online modules and video calls with a program coach. Study participants were either married, engaged, or in a cohabitating relationship. They completed surveys prior to the intervention, immediately after its conclusion, and six months later. They found all three factors were important but improvements in relationship confidence had the biggest impact on individual outcomes, including improved mental health, better sleep, and reduced substance use. "Relationship confidence involves the belief that my partner and I can handle whatever challenges come our way and build a lasting future together. It involves trusting that our relationship will continue and feeling assured that we have the skills to manage conflicts and keep the relationship strong," Larsen explained. Communication and support are crucial in everyday interactions, but relationship confidence involves a deeper, more ongoing commitment to maintaining the relationship, which might provide unique benefits for individual mental health, Larsen said. For example, they can reflect on their strengths and accomplishments as a couple. Relationship counselors can help couples build skills to deal with challenging situations and encourage them to talk about their future together and develop a sense of being a team. "Marriage often comes with a long-term commitment to the relationship. The Strong Couples Project is offered through Illinois Extension and directed by Barton. It is available free of charge to qualifying participants nationwide.
