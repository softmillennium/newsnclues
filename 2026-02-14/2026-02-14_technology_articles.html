                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fresh off the Seahawks' Super Bowl victory, we debate different tech and business moguls as candidates for owning the Seahawks or Sonics — including unlikely but interesting-to-consider possibilities ranging from Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez to Costco's Jim Sinegal. (Who wouldn't want $1.50 hot dogs and sodas at Lumen Field?) Then we dig into the debate over Seattle's tech future, sparked by angel investor Charles Fitzgerald's GeekWire column, “A warning to Seattle: Don't become the next Cleveland,” which led to a response and ultimately a great conversation with Cleveland Mayor Justin Bibb. Fremont Chamber Executive Director Pete Hanning joins us to talk about the neighborhood's tech corridor, why Fremont is seeing some of the highest return-to-office rates on the West Coast, and how Fremont balances its quirky identity with serious business. In the final segment, test your Seattle tech knowledge with our Fremont-themed tech trivia, plus audience Q&A, in which Todd comes clean about his relationship with Claude.

The only thing surprising is that we didn't know it specifically happened before, so it's only as "surprising" as chatgpt logs being subpoenaed. On the other hand forcing apple to specifically insert a backdoor runs into all sorts of constitution/due process issues. Add to the list of grievances social media platforms that include bot farms and organized political operatives. Now we certainly see some excesses with companies like Palantir and others ramping up government surveillance.Each side ramps up the encroachment on privacy and civil liberties without realizing the next time the other side comes into power they will gladly use and abuse everything the previous administration put in place during their rule. Nor is "doxxing" (filming, identifying) a public employee. None of these activities satisfy those criteria.Remember the "Twitter files" nonsense? Not hearing much backlash about this from the same people, because this is what they were claiming, but 100x worse. Nor is "doxxing" (filming, identifying) a public employee.

Does it matter that your neighbour says they don't agree with ICE of they still rat you out to them? At this point, we should assume these CEOs are fully on board with and support Trump's policies. I definitely don't think what these CEOs are doing is moral, but it's certainly rational. I think that a 30%, 64% or 145% tax on Chinese imports would be a huge blow for a $400 billion business importing Chinese-made phones.And Trump can impose such taxes (and grant exemptions from them) at will, apparently. Maybe it is time people move to that. Sadly I forgot its name or where to get it. Of course the app stores could block that too.There is always USENET I guess.

Governments can ban them, or mandate on device scanning to monitor your usage. They are against very specific parts of big government and censorship The liberal position on bodily autonomy (and indeed most things) has never been absolute. I remember conservatives making fun of the antivax movement as liberal lunacy as recently as 2019.>"I thought liberals were for free speech" (with regards to cancel culture).Cancel culture is itself a form of free expression and association. >"I thought liberals were for free speech" (with regards to cancel culture).Cancel culture is itself a form of free expression and association. Cancel culture is itself a form of free expression and association. Until the COVID-conspiracism came around, vaccine mandates had been supported by a massive bi-partisan consensus - for decades - because they make sense. We've had mandatory vaccines for schoolchildren in America since before the Emancipation Proclamation. The Supreme Court has upheld that practice as constitutional for over a century, and only the political fringes believe there ought to be a debate about such matters. This is one of the few areas where government necessarily exercises power.> You shouldn't be compelled to vaccinate your child, but neither should the rest of us be compelled to pretend like you did.> It's the failure to deal with those consequences that frustrates me about this debate. In the absence of an immediate threat, such as a life-threatening plague or outbreak, the state doesn't have a compelling reason to administer that vaccination by force or to infringe on your rights. But that doesn't mean there are no tradeoffs for such a decision. We've had mandatory vaccines for schoolchildren in America since before the Emancipation Proclamation.

If there are genuine aims to censor or target Americans who are genuinely simply criticizing ICE, I don't understand why the media isn't naming names with their permission. For instance when Jay Bhattacharya was revealed as one of the people censored for having contrarian views on COVID related decisions, I think it was a major turning point because it made it clear that the censorship extended to the point of censoring highly qualified people simply for having different opinions. Republicans today are far-right extremists straight out of an authoritarian regime, operating within the friend-enemy mode of politics ("everything for my friends, the law for my enemies"). Far-right figures envision societies organized through hierarchies—whether racial, ethnic, religious, or ideological. They aspire to deploy state power to defend the “true people” (sometimes called the Volk), who often already occupy the top rungs of society, from a constellation of perceived enemies or from relative or outright disempowerment. The far-right ideal is a homogeneous society, and that ideal is diametrically opposed to a liberal, pluralistic order. Generally for the far right, discussion and deliberation are denigrated in favor of authoritarianism and “decisive action,” although the far right will also frequently invoke values like “freedom of speech” to exert pressure on discourse communities to welcome its ideas and rhetoric (see Why do far-right groups often talk about “freedom”?

I'm sure we'll see a comment about Biden censoring anti covid vaccine posts and the poster is somewhat right.The difference is the Republicans run on freedom of speech making them hypocrites.Being a hypocrite is the worst attribute a politician can have in a representative democracy People love making them for censorship-related rules and laws. "Oh if <biden> is allowed to ask/tell social media to stop publishing so many lies about covid then that means trump will be able to <whatever>"First of all, trump and his ilk are probably going to do <whatever> regardless of what people did in the past and the technical legality of the actions seems to be of only minor concern.Secondly, I hate this idea that laws and rules can't have nuances.

On the other hand, the long term trend of billionaires and large companies getting their way politically will likely continue. I'm going to guess they'll have fled the country with their winnings by then. The reality of course was that TikTok wouldn't censor what the US government wanted to censor.The irony is that these companies are sowing the seeds for their own destruction and the US government is undermining US tech dominance, which is a potent foreign policy tool.I think Steve Jobs would be rolling over in his grave at Tim Cook's capitalization. I once trusted Apple to be more user-forest than any other platform.

Unless I've been severely misinformed, someone saying similar things about Xi Jinping on a Chinese tech forum would be swiftly banned and likely arrested. Discussion or even mention of it is still forbidden in China.1. That said, they also use them as slave labors.Maybe that's what ICE is going to do with the plan to setup large detention centers in the US Maybe that's what ICE is going to do with the plan to setup large detention centers in the US ICE detention is already beginning to resemble the Salvadoran prison system.Due process rights get violated. And they are trying to scale up like 10x+. And once they do, the detention system won't just be for immigrants. They are going to target anyone they want.D's have successfully blocked DHS funding for now, but if they (or SCOTUS) allow any of this to go forward, things are likely to get far worse And they are trying to scale up like 10x+.

But they don't have to, and shouldn't where ethics and human rights are involved, go beyond what is required by the law. "We stand up to ICE abuse" would probably help them in the markets.Something interesting happened recently in France where it turned out that the American subsiduary of CapGemini was selling serives to ICE. They were forced to sell that subsiduary after public outcry.

It's long been said that the insane rise in DRAM pricing would eventually affect common household electronics, and those predictions are starting to come true, likely sooner than most people imagine or would like to admit. Counterpoint researchers state that this steep climb should last at least through June, and is likely to continue due to the ongoing supply crisis. While this likely won't have a direct impact on the monthly price of your internet connection, the usual "free installation" and similar deals, such as a free set-top box, may disappear over time. The graph below shows a significant difference in LPDDR4 pricing for mobile phones versus the standard DDR4 used in consumer-facing telco gear. DDR4 was already being phased out before the crisis hit, and supply constraints forced a surge in prices. The fact that the AI craze led to the addition of memory-hogging features in routers and STBs didn't help matters, as some equipment has as much RAM as a common PC. The market researchers also note that this problem may even affect ISP fiber rollouts. Even big telecom and phone gear manufacturers have started specifically calling out the problem in their quarterly earnings statements. Meanwhile, MediaTek reportedly stated that it's got enough memory for its datacenter needs, but that for other segments it will "adjust its pricing to reflect the rising supply chain costs and allocate our supply across products based on the overall profitability".

Micron has officially introduced the world's first mass-produced PCIe 6.0 SSD. The all-new Micron 9650 series takes full advantage of a PCIe 6.0 x4 interface to achieve up to a whopping 28 GB/s in read speeds, double that of the world's fastest PCIe 5.0 SSDs. Pricing was not disclosed, but since the 9650 is a datacenter drive, don't expect a static MSRP to be announced. Where both models differ is in mixed performance conditions and endurance. Random and sequential endurance ratings are similar, with the Max models having noticeably better endurance than the Pro models of similar capacities. For instance, the 9650 Pro 30.72TB has a random endurance rating of 56,064 TBW. The 9650 Max 25.6TB has a random endurance rating of 140,160 TBW. Take this info with a pinch of salt, as Micron did not share the exact PCIe 5.0 SSD model it is referring to, but most outgoing PCIe 5.0 SSD write speeds sit around the 10GB/s to 13GB/s range. What has changed is the cooling requirements for Micron's new drive. The 9650 is Micron's first SSD to support both air and liquid cooling, with liquid cooling being supported specifically on the E1.S version. It may seem silly to have to liquid-cool a device that only draws 25 watts, but cooling becomes complicated quickly when you have multiple 25-watt drives sitting side by side in a server rack. Solidigm was the first manufacturer to release a liquid-cooled enterprise SSD. LLMs require a lot of high-speed storage to move data quickly where it's needed. Also, don't expect Micron's announcement to be any indication of a consumer PCIe 6.0 coming out anytime soon; not only is the AI race consuming NAND flash at an extraordinary rate, but consumer platforms have not yet adopted PCIe 6.0 (and won't until 2030), making a consumer variant completely useless.

A moderator on diyAudio set up an experiment to determine whether listeners could differentiate between audio run through pro audio copper wire, a banana, and wet mud. Spoiler alert: the results indicated that users were unable to accurately distinguish between these different 'interfaces.' “The amazing thing is how much alike these files sound. The mud should sound perfectly awful, but it doesn't," Pano said. "All of the re-recordings should be obvious, but they aren't." As we can see in the image above, there are only six correct answers out of 43 guesses. We put these numbers in a spreadsheet, which showed that only 13.95% of the answers were correct. This goes in line with Pano's conclusion that "listeners can't reliably pick out the original from the looped versions," suggesting that they cannot detect any changes introduced by the loop — whether it's pro-grade copper wire or wet mud from somebody's backyard. Pano came up with this idea after they watched a documentary, Amigo, where the U.S. Army was setting up a singular telegraph wire in the Philippines. This got them thinking that if you could send telegraphy signals across the ground, what would an audio signal using the same medium sound like? They then tried various materials like mud and banana, which, although they're pretty poor conductors, still seemed to introduce imperceptible changes to the signal, at least for the average person.

Naturally, sites like iFixIt and Adafruit are irked by the recently unearthed patent application, and the latter has already shown makers can do something about it. Patent drawings show a threaded fastener with a head in which two of the four segments of the BMW roundel logo are voids. Thus, a corresponding driver bit will be required for ideal torque transfer, and to minimize wear, slippage, cam-out, etc. Digging through the filing reveals that BMW wants its admittedly stylish fastener to be implemented “…to prevent being loosened or tightened…by unauthorized individuals.” Repair-centric site iFixIt calls BMW's plans “a logo-shaped middle finger to right to repair.” But the site says this isn't a surprising move from BMW, which has a track record of trying to gatekeep its ecosystems. Other than that, the BMW screw is branding and merely cosmetic, it says. Thus, the “claim risks collapsing into a predictable variation optimized for brand identity rather than engineering necessity,” reckons the open-source community driven hardware company. Moreover, Adafruit provided some technical guidance for folks who may want to do the same. In addition to the design tips, it mentions that the material chosen for output should be “strong enough to survive sharp internal corners without fracture.” While we didn't see Adafruit actually share files created during its BMW patent-busting replica work, a little Google-fu found several others have already uploaded 3D printable screw and bit files. These may be useful if BMW's patent application sees this fastener implemented in production vehicles. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Authorities in Mexico's Guadalupe, Nuevo León, this week unveiled four robot dogs that will be part of the security devices at BBVA Stadium, one of the three Mexican venues of the 2026 World Cup. The “K9-X” unit functions as a kind of first responder only. The robot dogs are not armed, but each unit incorporates video cameras, night vision, and communication systems that are used to issue warnings or instructions. Its function is to deter illegal activity, detect unusual behavior, identify suspicious objects, control crowds, and immediately alert law enforcement when the system deems necessary. Robot dogs operate semi-autonomously: They do not make decisions or execute movements on their own. “These K9-X robot dogs are going to support the police with an initial intervention, providing video and ultimately entering high-risk locations—that is, before public security forces go in—and to protect officers' physical safety, the robots will intervene in the event of a fight or an intoxicated person,” Héctor García, mayor of Guadalupe, said at a press conference. “We have good police officers, and we are working hand in hand with cutting-edge technology for the safety of the people of Guadalupe.” The K9-X unit has already made its first official intervention.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ideal Solution (that has existed for a very long time):  Legislate the requirements for most clients used by young children to look for the RTA server header and trigger parental controls if the parent thinks they should be enabled. It's not perfect, nothing is nor ever will be but using the header solution is entirely private, does not store or leak data and puts the decision into the device owners rather than creating perverse incentives to track everyone. It may actually protect most small children whereas today teens quickly find a work-around and then teach smaller children how to work around these centralized gate-keepers. The current solutions are just about tracking people by real identity and incentivizing teens to commit identity crimes thus feeding the prison industrial complex. If parents are having difficulty with raising their children that is a different problem and would require a different solution after significant critical thinking.Less Than Ideal solution:  Create a maintain multiple deny-lists of domains that are using 3rd party age verification or gathering personal data in any way shape or form.

Looking like religious zealots blindly condemning people we don't know. )Your comment looks a LOT like insult #3 up there, with some whining thrown in on top.If you want a substantive conversation or debate about the different facets of data privacy then lay the groundwork with some good faith place to start. If you instead just post mini screeds pre-insulting everyone then lamenting that nobody engages then nothing is going to change for you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A security lapse by one of India's largest pharmacy chains allowed outsiders to gain full administrative control of its platform, exposing customer order data and sensitive drug-control functions, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. Security researcher Eaton Zveare told TechCrunch that he discovered the flaw after identifying insecure “super admin” application programming interfaces on DavaIndia's website and privately shared details with Indian cybersecurity authorities. The exposure comes as Zota Healthcare rapidly scales DavaIndia Pharmacy's retail business. The Gujarat-headquartered company operates more than 2,300 DavaIndia stores across India, including 276 new outlets announced in January, and plans to add another 1,200 to 1,500 over the next two years. With that level of access, an attacker could view thousands of online orders containing customer information, modify product listings and prices, create discount coupons, and change settings governing whether certain medicines required a prescription, the researcher said. Based on system timestamps, Zveare said the vulnerable administrative interfaces appeared to have been live since late 2024. Zveare said the access allowed edits to website content that could have been used for defacement or disruption. Pharmacy order data can be particularly sensitive, as it may reveal information about a person's health conditions, medications or other private purchases. “This includes name, phone numbers, email IDs, mailing addresses, total amount paid, and the products purchased. Since this is a pharmacy, the products being purchased could be considered private and even embarrassing for some people.” Zveare said he reported the issue to CERT-In, India's national cyber emergency response agency, in August 2025. Sujit Paul, chief executive of Zota Healthcare, did not respond to emails sent by TechCrunch last month.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Airbnb has taken its time to launch AI features within the app, but CEO Brian Chesky on Friday said the company is now planning to bake in features powered by large language models that would help users search for listings, plan their trips, and aid hosts in managing their properties. Speaking at the company's fourth-quarter conference call, Chesky said the company wants to increase its use of large language models for customer discovery, support and engineering. “We are building an AI-native experience where the app does not just search for you. The company separately said it is testing a new feature that lets users search and ask questions about properties and locations using natural language queries. Currently, Airbnb offers an LLM-powered customer service bot, for some personalization, and communications. Questioned by analyst whether Airbnb would roll out sponsored property slots within AI search, Chesky said the company wants to get the design and user experience right first. “AI search is live to a very small percentage of traffic right now. Over time, we are gonna be experimenting with making AI search more conversational, integrating it into more than the trip, and, eventually, we will be looking at sponsor listings as a result of that,” Chesky said, adding that Airbnb would consider designing an ad unit that fits the conversational search flow. Chesky said Airbnb plans to tap the AI expertise of its new CTO, Ahmad Al-Dahle (he worked on Meta's  Llama models previously), to use its trove of identity and review data to make the app more useful. Airbnb claimed its AI-powered customer support bot, launched in North America last year, now handles a third of customer problems without needing any human intervention. “A year from now, if we are successful, significantly more than 30% of tickets will be handled by a custom service agent, in many more languages, in all the languages where we have live agents. The company is also thinking about increasing AI usage internally. Airbnb reported better-than-expected revenue of $2.78 billion in the fourth quarter, up 12% from a year earlier.
