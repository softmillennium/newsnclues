                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Couples who intentionally pause to appreciate the enjoyable experiences they share tend to be more satisfied in their relationships, argue less, and feel more confident that their partnership will endure, according to researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign. "Savoring involves slowing down to become aware of and focus on positive experiences," said first author Noah Larsen, a graduate student at Illinois. "Savoring can occur when we reminisce on a past experience, focus on the present moment or look ahead to a future experience." The participants were drawn from a larger project examining resilience in romantic relationships. Researchers used a scale called Joint Savoring in Romantic Relationships, adapted from the widely used Savoring Beliefs Inventory, which assesses how individuals savor positive moments. Participants reported how frequently during the past month they felt in control of their responsibilities or, on the other hand, overwhelmed by what they had to handle. They also rated their overall quality of life, general health, and psychological distress. "We found that joint savoring has the most benefits for romantic relationships, as well as secondary benefits for individuals' health and well-being," Larsen said. The protective effect was especially noticeable among couples facing higher stress. "Being able to identify factors that provide this type of buffering effect is important for marriage and romantic relationships, as they provide tangible things that couples can do to keep their relationship strong, even in the midst of heightened levels of stress," Barton said. The researchers noted that intentionally focusing on shared positive experiences can serve as a practical strategy for maintaining or strengthening a relationship. "We all are busy and have so many things going on in our day-to-day lives," Larsen said. "Finding time -- even just once a week -- to slow down, be present with your partner and talk about positive experiences in your relationship or focus on something you both enjoy can really benefit you as a couple.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The answer may be less than you think A large survey of U.S. singles reveals the different ways people experience passionate romantic love And 14 percent of the 10,036 respondents said they had never fallen in passionate love at all. “There's a lot more variation than we really know about,” she says. Researchers have proposed many ways to understand romantic love. One popular model is the triangular theory of love, which divides romance into three pieces: passion, intimacy and commitment. “It's that first feeling of magnetism to a partner, that feeling of obsession—just this intense longing to be together,” Gesselman says. It also typically fades over time and is often replaced by companionate love—a steadier, “warm and cozy kind of love,” she explains.

Stories of passionate love are everywhere—in movies, books and the narratives we tell ourselves about what it means to live a fulfilling life. These stories often “really center the experience of passion and talk about how universal this is and how everyone feels it,” Gesselman says. Gesselman and her team analyzed data from 2022 and 2023 studies of singles in the U.S. Respondents between 18 and 99 years old were asked to report how many times during their life so far they had experienced passionate love. Single Adults,” by Amanda N. Gesselman et al., in Interpersona, Vol. More than a quarter of people aged 18 to 19 reported never having felt it, and the number decreased to 7.6 percent for those older than age 70. Heterosexual men also reported feeling passionate love more times on average than heterosexual women, but no such differences appeared between men or women who were gay, lesbian or bisexual. But a big question remains unstudied, Gesselman says: How do people's appraisals of these experiences change across the life cycles of their relationships and across their own life? People likely reevaluate their past romantic experiences as time goes on, a phenomenon that is crucial for understanding survey data like these. Partnered people are likely to have experienced passionate love at least once, so a survey that excludes them can't reveal the full picture of this phenomenon, notes Jaimie Krems, a social psychologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who was not involved with the study. Passionate love could also exist outside of romantic relationships. “I think that is part of the human repertoire, to feel passionate love” in both romantic and nonromantic relationships, she says.

Mood disorders are associated with complex disruptions in brain networks, including those associated with the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC). Differential functions of these regions, especially the functions of the far-caudal OFC, are incompletely understood. We trained macaques to perform an approach-avoidance task and recorded cOFC and pACC neuronal activity and autonomic/somatic responses during performance, including during electrical microstimulation (EMS) of the cOFC. The cOFC was sensitive to both positive and negative stimuli, whereas the pACC was significantly more active during aversive outcomes. cOFC EMS increased avoidance, suggesting a causal cOFC function in cost-benefit decision-making. The cOFC activity led pACC activity during the decision period, supporting cOFC network prominence. Autonomic and somatic responses were positively correlated with behavioral patterns, consistent with a coordinated body-brain involvement during emotionally significant decision-making. We suggest that dysfunction of this network could potentially contribute to the etiology of mood disorders.

Because it is in such an early phase, the Egg Nebula offers astronomers a valuable chance to study what happens as Sun-like stars approach the end of their lives. At this stage, the nebula shines by reflecting light from its central star. That light escapes through a polar opening, or "eye," in the surrounding dust. Two bright beams stream outward from the star, lighting up fast-moving polar lobes that punch through older, slower rings of material arranged in concentric arcs. The structure and motion of these features point to possible gravitational effects from one or more unseen companion stars, which remain concealed within the dense disk of dust. The Egg Nebula, however, has not yet reached that fully developed stage. Stars at this stage manufacture and release large amounts of dust, material that can later become part of new star systems. Our own solar system, including Earth and the other rocky planets, formed from such recycled material about 4.5 billion years ago. An early visible light image from WFPC2 (Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2) was followed in 1997 by a near infrared view from NICMOS (Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer), offering a closer look at the nebula's glow. The mission is a partnership between NASA and ESA (European Space Agency). NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland oversees telescope and mission operations, with additional operational support from Lockheed Martin Space in Denver. The Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, manages Hubble's science operations for NASA.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An international group of astronomers has identified a faraway planetary system that calls into question one of the most widely accepted ideas about how planets take shape. Small, rocky planets circle close to their star, while large gas giants orbit at greater distances. Farther out, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are dominated by thick layers of gas. This arrangement is explained by a leading theory of planet formation. Young stars emit intense radiation that can strip away gases from nearby developing planets, leaving behind solid, rocky worlds. A newly identified system orbiting the star LHS 1903 does not follow that script. The innermost world is rocky, followed by two gas rich planets similar to smaller versions of Neptune, a lineup that matches standard expectations. But years of additional observations brought an unexpected twist. "We've seen this pattern: rocky inside, gaseous outside, across hundreds of planetary systems. They considered whether a massive impact might have stripped away the planet's atmosphere. They also examined whether the planets could have shifted positions over time. Detailed computer simulations and studies of the planets' orbits ruled out both scenarios. Instead, the findings point to a more unexpected idea. The planets in this system may not have formed simultaneously. Rather, they could have developed one after another as conditions around the star changed. In this environment, clumps of material form several planetary embryos at roughly the same time. It challenges the assumptions built into our current models," says Cloutier, who adds that the discovery raises broader questions about whether LHS 1903 is an anomaly or an early example of a pattern scientists have yet to recognize. "As telescopes and detection methods become more precise, we are strengthening our ability to find planetary systems that don't resemble our own and that don't conform to longstanding theories," he says. "Each new system adds another data point to a growing picture of planetary diversity -- one that forces scientists to rethink the processes that shape worlds across the galaxy."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>By combining fresh telescope data with more than a decade of archived observations, scientists were able to test and refine long standing theories about how the most massive stars end their lives. Rather than exploding outward in a brilliant supernova, this star's core gave way under gravity and formed a black hole. In the process, its unstable outer layers were gradually pushed outward. The findings, published February 12 in Science, are drawing attention because they offer a rare look at the birth of a black hole. The results may help explain why some massive stars explode dramatically at the end of their lives, while others collapse quietly. Light from dusty debris surrounding the newborn black hole, he says, "is going to be visible for decades at the sensitivity level of telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope, because it's going to continue to fade very slowly. And this may end up being a benchmark for understanding how stellar black holes form in the universe." By 2022 and 2023, the star had nearly vanished in visible and near-infrared wavelengths, fading to just one ten-thousandth of its former brightness in those bands. What remains can now only be detected in mid-infrared light, where it glows at roughly one-tenth of its original intensity. De says, "This star used to be one of the most luminous stars in the Andromeda Galaxy, and now it was nowhere to be seen. Stars shine because nuclear fusion in their cores converts hydrogen into helium, creating outward pressure that counteracts gravity. In stars at least 10 times more massive than our sun, this balance eventually breaks down when nuclear fuel runs low. But if that shock wave is too weak to eject the surrounding material, much of the star can fall back inward. Theoretical models have long suggested that this fallback can turn the neutron star into a black hole. "We've known for almost 50 years now that black holes exist," says De, "yet we are barely scratching the surface of understanding which stars turn into black holes and how they do it." Convection arises from large temperature differences inside a star. This contrast drives gas to circulate between hotter and cooler regions. At lower temperatures, atoms and molecules combine to form dust. That dust blocks light from the hotter gas closer to the black hole, absorbs energy, and reemits it in infrared wavelengths. Co-author and Flatiron Research Fellow Andrea Antoni developed the theoretical framework behind these convection models. This convective material has angular momentum, so it circularizes around the black hole. And because of all this, it becomes a brighter source than it would be otherwise, and we observe a long delay in the dimming of the original star." Much like water spiraling down a drain rather than dropping straight through, gas continues orbiting the newly formed black hole as gravity gradually pulls it inward. This delayed infall means the entire star does not collapse all at once. Even after the core quickly gives way, some material falls back slowly over many decades. Building a Bigger Picture of Black Hole Formation The new study provides strong evidence that both stars followed a similar path. What first seemed like an unusual case now appears to be part of a broader category of failed supernovae that quietly produce black holes. M31-2014-DS1 initially stood out as an "oddball," De says, but it now seems to be one of several examples, including NGC 6946-BH1. "It's only with these individual jewels of discovery that we start putting together a picture like this," De says. Note: Content may be edited for style and length.

Inverse design enables automating the discovery and optimization of devices achieving performance significantly exceeding that of traditional human-engineered designs. However, existing methodologies to inverse-design electromagnetic devices require computationally expensive and time-consuming full-wave electromagnetic simulation at each iteration or generation of large datasets for training neural-network surrogate models. This work introduces the Precomputed Numerical Green Function method, an approach for ultrafast electromagnetic inverse design. The static components of the design are incorporated into a numerical Green function obtained from a single fully-parallelized precomputation step, reducing the cost of evaluating candidate designs during optimization to only being proportional to the size of the region under modification. A low-rank matrix update technique is introduced that further decreases the cost of the method to milliseconds per iteration without any approximations or compromises in accuracy. This method is shown to have linear time complexity, reducing the total runtime for an inverse design by several orders of magnitude compared to using conventional electromagnetics solvers. The design examples considered demonstrate speedups of up to 16,000x, shortening the design process from multiple days to weeks down to minutes. The approach enables practical and ultrafast design of complex structures that are prohibitively time-consuming for prior inverse design methods. Source data are provided with this paper.
