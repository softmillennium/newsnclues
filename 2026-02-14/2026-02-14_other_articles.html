                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mehdi, who has spent decades debunking conspiracy theorists, is wondering whether he has become one himself, as the latest release of the Epstein files continues to reveal just how far-reaching Epstein's elite circle was. Who better to help him and viewers make sense of it all than Zeteo contributor Naomi Klein – who authored the New York Times best-selling book, Doppleganger, which explores conspiracy theory culture and the forces that are driving real conspiracies (like the Epstein files). Steve Bannon's use of faux conspiracy theories to distract from the revelations about his own involvement with Epstein Epstein's relationships with former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and right-wing billionaire Peter Thiel What Epstein represented to the “Davos class” (“He could let them act on their impunity.”) “What they [the Epstein class] fear most is these mass movements leading eventually to some kind of accountability. I think we should actually give them what they're afraid of.” Paid subscribers can watch the entire 35-minute conversation between Mehdi and Naomi. And, if you like this conversation, then good news: ‘Unshocked' is finally back for 2026! Be on the lookout for more episodes from Naomi and Mehdi coming your way soon, as they pull viewers “out of shock” through analysis, facts, and history.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As horror fans might already be aware, all of these stories are loosely based on real cases investigated by renowned paranormal investigators, Ed Warren and his wife, Lorraine Warren. Continue reading to learn how the movie ends. The plotline of The Conjuring: Last Rites The Conjuring: Last Rites begins with a flashback in which we see 'Ed' (Patrick Wilson) and 'Lorraine Warren' (Vera Farmiga) tackling a paranormal case involving a haunted mirror. The case soon comes to a standstill when 'Lorraine', who is heavily pregnant at the time with 'Judy', is induced to give birth after she sees a terrifying vision. Now, when 'Lorraine's' baby is born, she comes out as a 'stillborn'. Jumping back to the present, 'Judy' (Mia Thompson) is an adult who even has a fiancé. Secondly, ‘Lorraine' has also developed serious trauma from all that she has experienced in life while dealing with the paranormal. She appears to be afraid that, similar to her, ‘Judy' has inherited the power of seeing visions. 'Judy' convinces her parents to take on their case and help stop whatever is haunting the family. Amid this, ‘Lorraine' realises that by teaching ‘Judy' (who becomes possessed by the demon and tries to harm herself and her parents) how to suppress her visions, she is passing down her own bad habits to her daughter. It is worth noting that prior to this, ‘Ed' had tried to take the mirror off the ‘Smurl' family property, but couldn't be removed as it was too powerful. Even when he tried to perform an exorcism on the haunted mirror, it failed completely.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In an interview with former Fox News host-turned-independent journalist Megyn Kelly, Erika discussed the Turning Point USA founder's “frequency.” Erika Kirk claimed that her deceased spouse, Charlie Kirk, had an unexplained “frequency” as she'd see “lights flicker” around him throughout their time together. In an interview with former Fox News host-turned-independent journalist Megyn Kelly, Erika discussed the Turning Point USA founder's “frequency.” “When we first started dating, we were walking to dinner one night -and this happened a lot- the lights would start to flicker, and he would look up at the light and be like ‘ you know what this is, so weird this happens a lot' she said. Erika recounted how she felt her husband's presence on the night of his assassination as the lights flickered in her hotel room. "Part of me couldn't sleep because it was a strobe light, the other part of me couldn't sleep because of how my world had just crumbled, and another part of me couldn't sleep because I was like, Baby, I feel you, I know you're here,” she said. Charlie's close friend, Candace Owens, had similar supernatural claims about the deceased conservative public figure. "Charlie and I spoke a lot about his third eye,” she said in a recent episode of her podcast, which was addressed to Erika Kirk. We spoke about a lot of the things that were strange in our childhoods, the testing that both of us had to endure,” she added. Furthermore, Owens suggested in other instances that Charlie believed he would die at a young age. “I don't think I will ever get over the fact that Charlie Kirk knew he would die young,” Owens said, adding, “I am starting to believe that so did the agents that surrounded him his entire life.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Following the breakout success of her debut feature, “A Dance With Rainbows,” director Lee Yi-shan is developing supernatural crime thriller “Ghostbusters Club” (working title), Taiwan's Flash Forward Entertainment revealed at Berlin's European Film Market. The coming-of-age boxing drama opened to strong box office results in Taiwan in January and stars Golden Horse best new performer nominee Lin Yi-ting alongside veterans Tsai Chen-nan and You An-shun. Golden Scene acquired Hong Kong rights to the film. The project represents a significant stylistic departure for Lee, who won the Golden Horse Award for best action choreography with her gritty boxing drama. The new film combines elements of Taiwanese folk religion with a police procedural format. The narrative pairs her with Sister Ying, a detective investigating a series of infant corpse cases where bodies are discovered sealed in luxury apartment walls. The antagonist, a drug lord known as “Screw,” employs Thai dark arts to conceal structural defects in construction projects, creating what Flash Forward describes as both a social commentary on corruption and a mystical thriller. Flash Forward founder Patrick Mao Huang added: “This is not just a ghost story. ‘Ghostbusters Club' explores justice — both human and divine — through the lens of two powerful women from completely different worlds forced to collaborate.” Flash Forward's EFM slate also includes Japan-Taiwan-Poland co-production “Good Death,” currently in production with a cast featuring Yo Yang, Chen Shu-fang and Eliza Rycembel; “Lotus Feet,” the second feature from Cannes Grand Prix winner Amanda Nell Eu, which was selected for the Berlinale Co-Production Market; and animated sci-fi anthology “Bliss: Beyond the Edge of Time,” which brings together six directors for a genre-spanning exploration of time, technology and alternate realities.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ocean Falcon was originally delivered in 2015 by Spanish shipyard Astilleros Zamakona as a commercial rescue ship, though she was purchased not long after by an owner who sought to transform her into an explorer yacht for charter. As such, in September 2022, the vessel arrived at Lürssen's facilities in Bremen, Germany, where she was set to receive a four-metre extension and undergo a thorough conversion. Two years later, in August 2024, it was announced that Ocean Falcon would no longer undergo her rebuild due to a "number of challenges". According to the brokers, Ocean Falcon offers her new owner a solid foundation for long-range operations and is ideally suited for private exploration, research-focused programs or future charter conversion – as was previously intended. Thanks to her previous rescue ship background, highlights of the vessel include a steel hull and a significant 2,950GT of volume, allowing her new owner to undertake extensive expeditions, including operations in remote and challenging environments such as the Arctic or the South Pacific. Northrop & Johnson brokers Kevin Merrigan and Kristen Klein closed the sale. We hope to see her in challenging and exotic locations around the world.” Lürssen was the second shipyard to accept but ultimately did not proceed with Ocean Falcon's conversion. Original plans for the conversion project indicated a high-volume interior with room for four tenders, a submarine, a 10-metre swimming pool and two fully certified helicopter landing pads with an accompanying helicopter hanger. Details of the new conversion are yet to be unveiled.
