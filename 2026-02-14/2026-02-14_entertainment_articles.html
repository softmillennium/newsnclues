                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump returned to bashing Bill Maher on Saturday, almost a year after the HBO Real Time host dined with him at the White House. The president took offense at some of Maher's jokes and commentary on Friday, including the president's prediction that China would end all hockey in Canada. Host Bill Maher asked to have dinner with me through one of his friends, also a friend of mine, and I agreed. He was extremely nervous, had ZERO confidence in himself and, to soothe his nerves, immediately, within seconds, asked for a ‘Vodka Tonic.' Anyway, we had a great dinner, it was quick, easy, and he seemed to be a nice guy and, for his first show after our dinner, he was very respectful about our meeting — But with everything I have done in bringing our Country back from ‘OBLIVION,' why wouldn't he be?” Newsom Insists "Trump Is Temporary," Goes Full Governor Of The Free World At European Security Meetup & Talks 2028 Trump wrote, “In any event, it was a total waste of time for me to have this jerk at the White House and last night, after explaining what a DISASTER Canadian ‘Leaders' are to deal with, how Canada has “ripped off” the United States for years on TRADE (But not anymore! ), I jokingly stated in a TRUTH that, “The first thing China will do is terminate ALL Ice Hockey being played in Canada, and permanently eliminate The Stanley Cup.” Trump also wrote that Maher “went on and on about the Hockey statement, like ‘What kind of a person would say such a foolish thing as this,' as though I were being serious when I said it. Fortunately, his Television Ratings are so low that nobody will learn about his various Fake News statements about me. He is no different than Kimmel, Fallon, or Colbert but, I must admit, slightly more talented! Anyway, Bill Maher is a highly overrated LIGHTWEIGHT, and Republicans should stop using him to show how the Left is coming over our way — Our Base, the Greatest of All Time, laughs at your weakness when you do it! Maher asked me if he could come back to the White House again and, with his friend, also asked to come to the wonderful White House Christmas Party, but he didn't. Regardless, I'd much rather spend my time MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN than wasting it on him. Bill continues to suffer from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome (TDS! ), and there is nothing that will ever be done to cure him of this very serious disease. Thank you for your attention to this minor matter! In April, Maher dined with Trump at the White House, in a visit arranged by Kid Rock, who is a longtime supporter of the president. Host Bill Maher asked to have dinner with me through one of his friends, also a friend of mine, and I agreed. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jimmy Fallon has reportedly nixed a line of pasta sauces he was set to release with music mogul Tommy Mottola due to the latter's friendship with Jeffrey Epstein. The late-night host and Mottola Media Group chairman have long been friends, and have shared photos of themselves dining at Italian restaurants like Rao's on social media. The pair were reportedly set to release their own line of pasta sauces next year, but that plan has been “paused” after Mottola appeared frequently in the Epstein Files due to his frequent correspondence with the convicted sex offender, Page Six first reported. The Hollywood Reporter added that the sauce venture is “definitely not moving forward” due to Mottola's close contact with Epstein, with conversations ranging from travel arrangements and helicopter renting to more concerning topics, like procuring a private investigator and their response to the #MeToo movement. “Shut up and lay low,” Mottola wrote to Epstein. Casey Wasserman Selling His Talent Agency After Epstein Debacle: 'I Have Become a Distraction' Republicans Have Moved Into a New, Even Dumber Phase of Bad Bunny Outrage A former Sony Music CEO and Mariah Carey's ex-husband, Mottola is the latest powerful entertainment figure to incur repercussions due to their presence in the Epstein Files: On Friday, Casey Wasserman announced that he was selling his namesake talent agency, as he had become a “distraction” after his emails with Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell were revealed. In a memo sent to Wasserman agency employees and obtained by Rolling Stone following an exodus of talent, the founder apologized for his “past personal mistakes” that have caused “so much discomfort.” “It's not fair to you, and it's not fair to the clients and partners we represent so vigorously and care so deeply about,” he added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Is it weird to still be turning to a fictional network TV show, some two decades after it debuted, for life advice? But it depends, as there's one clear-eyed outlier. Because if we're talking about Friday Night Lights, the full-hearts-on-its-sleeves NBC drama about a small town in Texas and its lifeblood of a high-school football program that arrived back in the fall of 2006, there is a strong case to be made that, yes, it is. If you haven't watched the show, you're probably still aware that Friday Night Lights, which ran for five seasons and 76 episodes, has its fair share of big locker-room speeches. There have been sketches about it and, if memory serves, at least one not particularly funny joke about it at the Emmys. (That was, admittedly, also not a particularly funny joke.) For as much as Friday Night Lights is about so much more than those game-day, fire-'em-up monologues—just like it's about so much more than football or high school or small towns or, as a devotee of the show maybe annoyingly explained to you at a bar once, America—when boiled down, the series really is just one big ol' locker-room speech. And the people giving those speeches are either Eric (Kyle Chandler) or Tami Taylor (Connie Britton), who have an onscreen marriage so solid that the pair has been accurately dubbed “The Greatest TV Couple Of All Time” and has inspired love-letter essays with titles like “I Want What They Have” about their very enviable—but decidedly not perfect or drama-free—relationship. Club‘s Love Week continues, let's look at why the town of Dillon, and the viewers at home, fell so hard for them. “Everything I know about women you can stick in this damn coffee cup here,” the coach tells the 19-year-old former star quarterback, who is now using a wheelchair and just informed his old coach that he got a one-night-stand pregnant and wants her to keep the child. Without trust and honesty, it is not gonna work.” It's good advice (and it's also notable, and wise, that he doesn't tell him what to do), and you get the impression that Street went to Coach to gauge whether he's ready to have a kid when he's pretty much still one himself first. There are countless scenes like this (some are more effective than others, but a few land so hard that you may be left wishing you had your own Coach or Tami Taylor in your life), and over the course of the show, these two essentially become Dillon's Problem Solvers. If there is an issue, they undoubtedly will fix it—or completely change your life for the better. That's certainly the case with Vince Howard (Michael B. Jordan), who was headed toward a life of crime only to become a star quarterback and, in the series finale, explicitly says “You changed my life, Coach,” and Tyra Collette (Adrianne Palicki), who escaped her upbringing and went to college pretty much because of Tami's persistence. The first time we meet Tami, Eric is studying game tape in his dark office, his eyes fixed on the small screen and not her. And the first time we see her in her home, he's doing the exact same thing while she talks about wanting to get a bigger place and their daughter Julie (Aimee Teegarden) compares the football drama in Dillon to Moby-Dick. But pretty quickly, the show makes sure Tami isn't just Coach's wife, the better half who lives in her husband's shadow. And it's not a stretch to say that by the finale, she's a more interesting and complex character than he is or that, if the show has a lead, it would have to be the Taylors as a couple. And as a couple, they're tested, sometimes in a funny ha-ha way, like when Tami's co-worker (played by Steven Walters) drunkenly tries to kiss her outside a work happy hour or when her motormouthed ex (portrayed by Peter Berg, who developed the show) drunkenly gets in a fight with Eric. In fact, Britton said the following to EW: “[Chandler and I] were like, ‘We're never letting the writers have us have an affair. And we told them so.” But they did have some serious struggles in their marriage. Near the end of the series, Tami is offered Dean Of Admissions at Braemore College in Philly, a prospect Eric doesn't humor, even after several pleas from her to do so. Now it's time to talk about doing that for my job. Because otherwise, what am I gonna tell our daughter?”) Eric eventually comes to his senses, delivering an apologetic “Will you take me to Philadelphia with you, please?” and a dose of the feels for the audience. And the show ends not with Vince's state-winning Hail Mary (the completion of which we don't even see) but this same couple on a different field in a very different place, embracing as they walk into the darkness together.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The people were picked up Friday by a SWAT team with the Pima County Sheriff's Department after both a home and vehicle were swarmed near the 84-year-old's Tucson property, according to multiple reports. Two men along with one of their mothers were detained after the house search, according to The Post. An image obtained by Fox New showed the unidentified man, who was linked to the search warrant that was being served at the house, in handcuffs with a hoodie partially covering his face. Law enforcement questioned the man in the vehicle but released him, believing him not to be the kidnapper, a law enforcement official told CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller. The Pima County Sheriff's Department did not immediately respond to Page Six's request for comment. Prior to these potential breaks in the case, authorities detained a man named Carlos during a traffic stop in Rio Rico, Ariz., south of Tucson near the Mexico border on Feb. 10 in connection to the investigation, but he was released the following day. and they told me this lady … I don't know her name,” he said of Savannah Guthrie's 84-year-old mom. Carlos explained he works for a delivery service in Tucson, but declared that he never kidnapped anyone and was released after questioning. Authorities also performed a court-approved search of his home. The latest news comes after Pima County Sheriff's Department confirmed they recovered DNA from someone in the home who is not “close” to Nancy. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. “DNA other than Nancy Guthrie's and those in close contact to her has been collected from the property. Earlier in the week, they also collected DNA samples from hired workers around Guthrie's residence. In addition to the DNA, cops confirmed they recovered “several items of evidence” this week, including black gloves that were discovered two miles away from the property. FBI Phoenix on Feb. 12 provided a physical description of an “armed individual” who was seen on Nancy's home security camera wearing a mask in the early morning hours of Feb. 1. Via X, the agency said the suspect is a 5-foot-9 or 5-foot-10 male with an average build, who also carried a black 25-liter Ozark Trail Hiker Pack backpack. Nancy was reported missing on Feb. 1 after she failed to attend church following an evening out with family members. Several ransom notes have landed at news organizations including TMZ demanding bitcoin transactions by specific deadlines. Savannah and her siblings Annie and Camron Guthrie have continued to express hope for their mother's return through various social media posts. 💛” Savannah captioned throwback footage of her mother on Thursday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some great Letts jokes landed as the stars of Karim Aïnouz's 'Rosebush Pruning,' including Pamela Anderson, Jamie Bell and Lukas Gage, gathered for the film's press conference on Saturday. Pamela Anderson, Callum Turner, Tracy Letts, Lukas Gage and Jamie Bell gave the Berlinale some much-needed star power at the press conference for Rosebush Pruning on Saturday. '17' Director Kosara Mitic on Exploring the Silence of Trauma and Unspoken Female Solidarity in Her Debut (Exclusive Berlin Clip) The Berlin Film Festival and its celebrity attendees have been under scrutiny so far this week after jury president Wim Wenders, Golden Bear recipient Michelle Yeoh, and Sunny Dancer star Neil Patrick Harris all declined to talk about cinema's relationship with politics and the rise of fascism. European journalists have voiced their disapproval that Berlin, historically a politically active festival, has seemingly shut out urgent conversations as they arise at the pressers. Acclaimed Indian author Arundhati Roy (The God of Small Things) pulled out of the fest entirely on Friday in response to comments by Wenders that “art should not be political.” Yeoh told journalists at her press conference that “I don't think I am in the position to really talk about the political situation in the U.S., and also I cannot […] say I understand it, so it is best not to talk about something I don't know about,” while Harris said he prefers to “do things that are apolitical” when hit with a barrage of questions on U.S. politics. “I can't speak for other artists,” he continued, “I don't necessarily feel comfortable taking away from the work that they've done… It's an awkward thing to discuss because of our political situation, but one of the things that this movie gets at, I think, on the face of it, is that this extreme disparity in wealth breeds bad behavior, and, in fact, probably creates fascism. “We live in a time where censorship and political judgments of what we're doing are really, really dangerous, particularly in certain countries,” he answered. We're not only doing something for audiences, but sometimes, to get there, we do need to be accompanied by the initiatives, like from Germany… I come from a country where cinema would not exist if it weren't for public funding.” The Last Showgirl star Anderson later touched on playing the mother in Aïnouz's film: “It's always complex, being a mother and the shame that carries anyway and just the generation of mothers in my own life… That was quite an interesting journey.” She added: “Obviously, she is gay, and there's a lot of interesting rebellion going on in her.” Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jimmy Fallon and longtime music executive Tommy Mottola have scrapped plans to launch a branded pasta sauce line following renewed scrutiny tied to recently released Epstein-related documents. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Fallon and Mottola had been in early development on a pasta sauce brand that could have launched as late as 2027. However, the project is no longer moving forward as attention intensifies around Mottola's association with Jeffrey Epstein.

The files, made public after congressional action compelled the Department of Justice to release additional materials, include communications and records involving numerous high-profile figures. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Mottola's name appears in approximately 600 documents released to date, with the materials showing contact between Mottola and Epstein over multiple years, including references to travel arrangements and other communications. Mottola has appeared as a guest on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon to promote his projects.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ralitza Petrova observes "the emptiness left by absent fathers, and how daughters carry that weight." Lust is about Lilian, a parole officer whose life is governed by clinical precision, with her body, emotions, and desires held under strict control. “When she is summoned back to her hometown to settle the death of an absent father, what should be a brief administrative detour unravels into unresolved debts, institutional inertia, and a decaying body caught in bureaucratic limbo,” explains a synopsis. An uneasy connection with a Shibari rigger offers a practice of controlled vulnerability, where intimacy is negotiated rather than promised.” Shibari is Japanese rope bondage. 'Yellow Letters' Review: 'The Teachers' Lounge' Director Delivers a Modern-Day Political Parable That's Strongly Acted but Hampered by Vagueness Snejanka Mihaylova stars in Lust, along with Nikola Mutafov, Mihail Milchev, and Alexis Atmadjov. “In 2016, my father passed away – someone I barely knew,” explains Petrova. “What followed was not conventional grief, but the mourning of an absence already in place. Lust emerged from this space as a way of framing what is missing and how it lingers. Conceived as a coming-of-mid-age psychodrama, Lust moves between mystery, fantasy, and ghost story – not to resolve absence, but to trace how it unsettles control and, at times, creates an opening.” THR can now exclusively premiere the trailer for Lust, hinting at the restrained mix of trauma, emptiness, tenderness, and austerity that awaits us.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A renowned forensic artist stepped out of retirement to draw an unofficial sketch of the masked suspect in the Nancy Guthrie case. Gibson clarified that she was not asked by any agency to do an official police sketch, but she felt a hard need to help in the search for Nancy. “It's the most horrific, insane torture if you have a kidnapping… every minute seems like a half hour because you say, ‘Where are they? Gibson, who retired in 2021, acknowledged that creating the sketch was especially challenging because the suspect's face was covered. She noted that much of her work is an “educated guess” based on mathematical probability and decades of experience. He's below 40, I believe,” she told Inside Edition. “And other than that, he could be Latino, white, Lebanese, just any kind of race.” Despite her 43 years of experience in the field, Gibson acknowledges her sketches in this case may not be completely accurate. “The guy might have tattoos all over his face. I might have the facial hair wrong,” she pointed out. As the search for Nancy Guthrie enters its second week, Lois Gibson hopes her unofficial sketch will help generate new leads and ultimately aid in solving the case. Gibson holds the Guinness World Records title for “Most criminals positively identified due to the composites of one artist.” Over the span of her career, she has worked with over 5,000 cases and helped identify 1,313 suspects with her sketches.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At least three individuals have been detained in connection with the search for Nancy Guthrie, which has now entered its second week. A law enforcement source told Fox News Digital that authorities detained two men and the mother of one of them after acting on a tip. The source also confirmed that a warrant was executed, noting that during its execution, “technically everyone is detained.” The latest detainments come after a SWAT team from the Pima County Sheriff's Department swarmed an area about two miles from Nancy Guthrie's home late Friday night. Authorities are also investigating a Range Rover at the scene, not a white van, according to Fox News Digital. The Pima County Sheriff's Department confirmed the latest development in a statement shared on X, saying “Law enforcement activity is underway at a residence near E Orange Grove Rd & N First Ave related to the Guthrie case. Because this is a joint investigation, at the request of the FBI – no additional information is currently available.” The FBI is zeroing in on a description of Nancy Guthrie's captor. The suspect is described as a man about 5'9″ – 5'10” tall, with an average build. He was also wearing a black, 25-liter Ozark Trail Hiker Pack backpack in the video. Meanwhile, a crew of pool cleaners, escorted by the Pima County Sheriff's Department, was able to access the home on Friday. Drone footage shared by MS Now reporter Alex Tabet shows two men dragging nets through the water in Nancy's backyard.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jason Aldean had a simple response to Zach Bryan's continued criticism after the Turning Point USA alternative halftime show. The “Something in the Orange” singer posted a video of himself and Harley Carmichael singing a parody of Gilbert's song – which Aldean covered on his 2010 album, “My Kinda Party.” “@zachlanebryan, you can climb all the fences you want, you're not getting my chili dog,” Gilbert wrote in his caption, referencing a video of Bryan climbing a fence in an argument with fellow country singer Gavin Adcock. “Best song I've heard from that guy,” Aldean quipped in the comments, referring to Bryan's parody. Bryan initially criticized the TPUSA halftime show on Instagram. “What kid rock actually thinks is happening across America,” he wrote on his Instagram Story, per Whiskey Riff. Boy you turned into a Hollywood sell out b—- real quick. Now you are nothing but another dumba– out of touch elitist. Bryan wrote, “I don't care what side you're on, a bunch of adults throwing temper tantrums and their own halftime show is embarrassing as hell and the most cringe s–t on the planet.” “Where'd your patriotism go?” one fan wrote on Instagram. “lol go throw another cringe worth tantrum Zach and get over your jealousy of KidRock!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some familiar faces are dropping in as Disney gets into the micro-drama craze with its new short-form series, Locker Diaries. Designed for vertical viewing, the series features characters from Zombies, Descendants and Phineas & Ferb in bite-size adventures that blend comedy, drama and thrills, all unfolding in school hallways and told through open locker doors. They feature Malachi Barton, Freya Skye, Swayam Bhatia, Julian Lerner and Mekonnen Knife, reprising their roles from Zombies 4: Dawn of the Vampires. The series comes as Disney+ embraces vertical video to drive daily engagement, part of a larger trend of major studios and execs adapting to a growing demand for micro-dramas. The booming medium was projected to surpass $9.4B in China last year. Erin Teague, EVP of Product Management for Disney Entertainment and ESPN, previously said “everything's on the table” in terms of how vertical video is delivered on Disney+. It could be original short-form programming, repurposed social clips, refashioned scenes from longer-form episodic or feature titles or a combination. “We're obviously thinking about integrating vertical video in ways that are native to core user behaviors,” Teague said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brian Wilson was back, as the promotional campaign around 15 Big Ones excitedly proclaimed, and that meant the rockin' good times were here to stay. And then, as happens so often with this most enigmatic of bands, the pendulum swung back. The group's next album, The Beach Boys Love You, was a proto-synth-pop bomb with songs about Johnny Carson and “Honkin' Down the Highway,” and its intended follow-up, Adult/Child, was a mixture of big-band jazz and adolescent reverie that was shelved for fear it would further upset the group's already bemused fanbase. This is unlikely territory for a band to re-evaluate. But that's exactly what they do on We Gotta Groove: The Brother Studio Years, a new 73-track box set loosely hung around recordings Brian Wilson made in the group's Brother Studio from 1976 to 1977. Love You has, over the years, gained a cult following, but for a long time it was a curio that fans tended to explore many years into their Brian Wilson obsession: It was the band's 21st studio album and, back then, it probably only just edged into their top 20 best. This was a period when the Beach Boys powered down blind alley after blind alley in search of their lost mojo, and the decision to go full orchestral swing, on Adult/Child songs like “Life Is for the Living,” wasn't one of their best. And yet, for all these reasons, 1976 to 1977 is among the most fascinating periods of the Beach Boys' career, a time when songwriting brilliance and mythical vocal interplay met Wilson's rudderless genius and a desire to expand the band's sound in ways that looked to both the future and past of pop music. The counterpoint to the sharp, “Surfin' U.S.A.”-style early Beach Boys is not Pet Sounds' baroque pop arrangement; it's “Mona”'s rough synth swing next to “Johnny Carson”'s rollicking boogie and very literal lyrics about Ed McMahon, sequenced in a way that probably has only ever made sense to Brian Wilson circa 1976. Throughout Brian Wilson's psychological torment, he still wrote excellent songs. And the Beach Boys, for all their sometimes grating complaints about his output, kept singing them, delivering incredible vocal harmony even when they didn't fully grasp the material. Love You is historically important for its pioneering use of synths and Moog-heavy production, like David Bowie's Low on Californian zinfandel. But it also contains stunning pop songs that shine through the novelty. “The Night Was So Young” is a touching tale of thwarted love, sung like a nostalgic angel by Carl Wilson; “Let's Put Our Hearts Together” is a charming duet between Brian and his then-wife Marilyn, which runs warm through the veins like love itself. “Life Is for the Living,” with its gratingly peppy lyrics and jaunty swing, would almost certainly have been better as a Frank Sinatra record, for whom some of the songs on Adult/Child were apparently intended, while “Deep Purple” and “New England Waltz” are unpalatable schmaltz. Their elegant, time-worn melodies point to an unrealized future where the Beach Boys mutated into a creatively vibrant pop act of the third age, with death at their elbow and a mind full of memories. The Beach Boys have an incredibly deep catalog of unreleased material. But anyone with enough interest in an unreleased Beach Boys album from 1977 will have already sought it out online, and the unreleased songs on We Gotta Groove aren't as strong as on the recent glut of Beach Boys box sets like 1967 - Sunshine Tomorrow and Feel Flows. The dozen 15 Big Ones Outtakes are essentially 12 Slightly Smaller Ones, a handful of rock'n'roll covers that add very little to vintage songs like “Shake, Rattle and Roll” and “Mony Mony,” alongside “Short Skirts,” a lower-middling Brian Wilson original, and a handful of backing track mixes. The outtakes and alternate mixes of Love You are largely for completists, while Brian's cassette demos from the same period are moving in their distressed beauty. “Sherry She Needs Me,” a Love You outtake with a long history, showcases Brian Wilson's voice at its most lost and lovely, as it curls up against the comforting radiance of the band's fraternally perfect backing vocals with the distinct air of Pet Sounds reverie. “Everybody Wants to Live,” one of the Adult/Child tracks that hasn't seen the light of day, is lavish and wistful, like a synth-y Surf's Up. “Holy Man (2025 Mix Carl Wilson Vocal),” a song whose existence seems to have surprised most fans, is an elegiac take on a great tumbling wave of a Dennis Wilson track that was originally intended for his Pacific Ocean Blue album. “Carl's Song 2 (Angel Come Home) (2025 Mix)” is an embryonic instrumental version of a song that would turn up on L.A. (Light Album), its velvety guitar ambience like the Durutti Column crossed with the Eagles; and “String Bass Song (Rainbows) (2025 Mix)” tastes like heartbreak in an expensive hotel suite. Raked over like this, We Gotta Groove sounds like an academic exercise, a foot-noted path to explore one of the wildest times in Beach Boys history and make some sense of their bizarre choices. It's an artifact, too, a multi-disc object for Beach Boys obsessives to fawn over. But the streaming era, for all its woes, has opened up what would once be little-heard historical documents like We Gotta Groove to an audience of interested, rather than merely hardcore, fans.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Following an exodus of talent who have left the Wasserman Group talent agency after emails between founder Casey Wasserman and Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell were revealed in the Justice Department's latest tranche of documents, pressure for the founder to step down came to a boiling point in recent days. In a memo sent to Wasserman agency employees and obtained by Rolling Stone, the founder apologized for his “past personal mistakes” that have caused “so much discomfort.” “It's not fair to you, and it's not fair to the clients and partners we represent so vigorously and care so deeply about,” he added. Wasserman acknowledged the “pain experienced by the victims of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell is unimaginable,” and reiterated claims that his interactions with Epstein were limited a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 and “a handful of emails that I deeply regret sending.” In one of the messages, Wasserman asked Maxwell, “What do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?” In a separate message dated April 1, 2003, he asked, “Where are you, I miss you. I will be in nyc for 4 days starting april 22…can we book that massage now?” Maxwell wrote back, “All that rubbing – are you sure you can take it?” and, “There are a few spots that apparently drive a man wild – I suppose I could practise them on you.” Maxwell mentioned being in Brazil and asked Wasserman if he had ever been. Maxwell was later convicted of conspiring with Epstein to sexually abuse minors between 1994 and 2004. Wasserman, who still serves as the chairman and president of the LA28 Olympic committee, wrote in his note that he will devote his “full attention to delivering Los Angeles an Olympic Games in 2028 that is worthy of this outstanding city.” The LA28 executive committee said on Wednesday that Wasserman will continue leading preparations for the Summer Games despite calls for him to step down. Over the past week, Chappell Roan, Best Coast's Bethany Cosentino, Weyes Blood, Chelsea Cutler, Wednesday, Water From Your Eyes, Orville Peck, and Beach Bunny have cut ties with the Wasserman Group. “No artist, agent, or employee should ever be expected to defend or overlook actions that conflict so deeply with our own moral values.” Having been confronted by executive leadership in an intervention-like setting prior to the latest release of documents (reports of his association with Maxwell began circulating in 2024), and questioned about the nature of his relationship with Epstein, Wasserman assured his senior staff that “there's nothing else” that would come out and implicate him with the Epstein-Maxwell trials, according to one person privy to the meeting.

The acquisition would bring to Wasserman a slew of new music clients, including arena- and stadium-fillers Coldplay, Ed Sheeran, Kendrick Lamar, Phish, and Dave Matthews, along with hundreds of smaller acts across all genres, and especially in indie rock. In a way, Wasserman, by virtue of his last name, was no stranger to scandal. Lew Wasserman, who transformed the Hollywood agency business in the Sixties and Seventies as head of MCA, weathered anti-trust scrutiny and criticism of perceived Washington-Hollywood collusion. And as Casey Wasserman detailed to The Hollywood Reporter in a 2025 cover story, his father, from whom he was estranged, was convicted of money laundering.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Expressing what we can't help but think of as the “making a movie for several tens of millions of dollars” equivalent of an apparently incurable verbal tic, Hollywood has decided it's just got to reboot the Charlie's Angels franchise as a movie. This is per THR, which reports that Sony has apparently put a new film version of the classic '70s cheesefest into early development, following some deep, unknowable, and possibly tidal Tinseltown whim. Although Sony itself is in “no comment” mode on the project, THR reports that Peter Chiarelli—a writer whose biggest job prior to this was on Crazy Rich Asians, and who has a “story by” credit on Sony's current animated feature Goat—is being tapped to write this latest version of the story. We'll be honest here, folks: This one has us flummoxed. It's not like Charlie's Angels hasn't been a workable brand at some point in living memory: The original show was wildly popular back in its day, and the 2000 film, directed by McG, managed to be a pretty fun time by dint of not getting in the way of Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, and Lucy Liu's goofball energy. But subsequent efforts to keep the series going really don't seem to have paid off on producers' beliefs that the Angels brand has some sort of inherent staying power. And while we wouldn't argue that Elizabeth Banks' 2019 film reboot is entirely dire—if nothing else, Patrick Stewart and Kristen Stewart are both having a lot of fun playing various genre tropes—it was also a notorious box office bomb. Are we simply underestimating film execs' belief that you can make a bankable movie out of any name that most of the people on the planet have heard of? What sound echoes in the modern film executive's mind, that tells them that they will be the ones to make Charlie's Angels work for more than a single film at a time? Regardless, here we are: They'll probably outlive us all.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A woman told reporter Tony Ortega that the singer sent her inappropriate clips after she congratulated him on his new album. Evan Dando of The Lemonheads has been hospitalized for mental health issues following recent allegations he sent a fan unwanted sexual content. “Evan Dando has long struggled with mental health issues dating back to his childhood,” it read. As reported by journalist Tony Ortega on his Underground Bunker Substack, the fan — whose husband reached out to Ortega, and whom the reporter referred to as “Dawn” — claims to have simply congratulated Dando on releasing new album Love Chant this past October when, after a brief exchange, she received footage the musician had allegedly filmed of himself masturbating. Speaking to Billboard over the phone, Dando's wife, Antonia Teixeira, provided more context. According to her, the musician — who has been open about his past struggles with addiction — had been wrestling with periods of heavy drinking and prescription drug abuse for several years before suffering a mental episode earlier this year. She believes he then relapsed and ingested high amounts of Adderall, mushrooms and TCH at once earlier in February, after which he began exchanging sexual videos with numerous women on X — one of whom happened to have the same name as the woman who claimed to have received one of the videos unsolicited. After discovering that Dando had been sending and receiving the explicit videos, Teixeira says she decided to take him to a mental health treatment center in Brazil, where they live. Billboard has reached out to Dando's rep for comment on Teixeira's account of what happened. Though he quit using heroin, speed and cocaine after spending time in rehab in late 2021, Dando told The New York Times last year that he was still taking “over-the-counter” substances. Shortly after publishing Rumors of My Demise, The Lemonheads' Love Chant dropped, marking the band's first album of original music in 19 years. “We've been around so long that it's almost like a grudging respect — like the ugly building or the old hooker that just won't go away, so people have to deal with it,” Dando said candidly in an interview with Billboard shortly after it was released. It's a very human quality, this dogged refusal to give up.” The Lemonheads have scored a handful of hits on Billboard‘s alternative charts, as well as four entries on the Billboard 200. The band's song “Into Your Arms” also reached No. If you or anyone you know is in need of support after experiencing sexual harassment, assault or abuse, reach out to RAINN — which is available 24/7 online, via phone at 800-656-HOPE or text 64673 — for live, confidential help and resources.
