                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Chris Brown speeds toward a February trial in the case of a housekeeper who was mauled by a security dog at his Los Angeles house five years ago, the singer is sharing his detailed description of the incident, in his own words, for the first time. Brown, 36, has filed portions of his April deposition in the civil court matter as part of his new request that the judge strike the housekeeper's claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress and punitive damages from her lawsuit. Brown's description stands in stark contrast to the housekeeper's own harrowing account of what happened. In her lawsuit and related filings, housekeeper Maria Avila says she was removing trash from Brown's house on Dec. 12, 2020, when a large brown dog “viciously” attacked her, ripping chunks of flesh and even bone from her face and arm as she “screamed in terror and called out for help.” Avila alleges Brown came outside, stood over her while speaking on a cell phone, and then “fled the scene as [she] lay on the driveway in a pool of blood, bleeding to death.” (Avila says she required emergency surgery and now lives with extensive disfigurement, nerve damage, and loss of vision.) For years, Brown has been fighting the lawsuit and a related complaint from Avila's sister, Patricia, who was also at the house that day and allegedly ran outside to find her sister “covered in blood while she was screaming and crying for help.” In the excerpts of Brown's April deposition filed with the court Monday, Brown says he heard no screaming, saw no blood, at least initially, and only left the house because his manager advised him to do so once it was clear that paramedics were on their way. Asked how the terrifying incident unfolded, Brown said he was in his upstairs bedroom when he heard the dog, named Hades, growling outside. The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time “I could see her chest moving,” he said. Asked if he could remember saying anything to Avila, Brown said he didn't speak to her. “I got security to make sure she was okay.” Brown said that after he rounded up all three of his dogs, including Hades, who was acting “nervous,” he called his manager while his security guard was allegedly on the phone with a 911 dispatcher. Wilson told you to get the hell out of there, right?” Avila's lawyer asked, to which Brown responded, “yes, ma'am.” The lawyer then asked if Brown felt “bad” about leaving his house under those circumstances. I didn't want to – I didn't want to see the damage or whatever that happened,” he testified. Sean Combs Files to Appeal His Conviction and 4-Year Prison Sentence and Tiny Accuser Loses Bid to Get Defamation Lawsuit Reinstated, Plans Appeal Kevin Costner Loses Early Round in Sexual Harassment Lawsuit From 'Horizon 2' Stuntwoman Brown said he was not involved in the decision by his security to remove Hades from the premises before law enforcement arrived, nor was he involved, he says, in having a security guard drive the animal up to Humboldt County, where the dog, described as a Caucasian Shepherd, was abandoned. “So if you learned that one of your security guys took the dog up to Humboldt, loaded him onto his car, tied him to a tree, and left him there, would you have fired the guard for doing that?” Avila's lawyer asked. He said the dog actually belonged to his head of security and was living on his property as a deterrent to potential stalkers or home invaders. In his motion filed Monday, Brown argues that Avila failed to substantiate her claim that Brown acted with malice or engaged in any “outrageous conduct.” For that reason, her claims for emotional distress and punitive damages should be dismissed before trial, he says. Avila's lawyer, Nancy Doumanian, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Avila's lawsuit and the related negligence complaint filed by her sister have been consolidated into the same trial set for Feb. 9, 2026. Brown's new motion to dismiss the punitive and emotional damages claims has a hearing set for Jan. 15. Maria's husband is a co-plaintiff in her lawsuit. He claims the harm to his wife caused him “loss of consortium damages.” Brown, meanwhile, is being sued alongside his company, Black Pyramid, LLC. “Defendants anticipate that plaintiffs will point to defendants' post-incident conduct in support of their punitive damages claim. However, any actions defendants took after the incident are wholly irrelevant, because these actions in no way contributed to the occurrence of the incident,” Brown's lawyers wrote in his motion filed Monday. Rina Sawayama Has Notes for the Team Behind Sabrina Carpenter's Japan-Inspired ‘SNL' Set “Plaintiffs will likely argue that defendants' decision to drive Hades to another location and have him euthanized was an attempt to ‘conceal evidence,' and thus was oppressive, fraudulent, and malicious,” the filing continued. “To the contrary, it was an attempt to remove what had just become an unpredictable animal from a terrible situation and ensure nothing like this would happen again. The intent was not to ‘conceal' or ‘destroy' evidence but rather to prevent the risk of future harm. “The head of security, Emil Lewis, testified to this under oath during his deposition.” Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Netflix fell short of Wall Street analysts' earnings expectations in the third quarter and said a dispute with Brazilian tax authorities kept operating margins from meeting its guidance. Revenue came in on target during the June-to-September period, reaching $11.51 billion. Earnings per share of $5.87 on a diluted basis came in more than a dollar shy of analysts' consensus outlook for $6.97. In its quarterly letter to shareholders, the company said its operating margin of 28% undershot guidance of 31.5% “due to an expense related to an ongoing dispute with Brazilian tax authorities that was not in our forecast. Absent this expense, we would have exceeded our Q3'25 operating margin forecast. We don't expect this matter to have a material impact on future results.” Netflix Strikes 'KPop Demon Hunters' Toy Deal With Hasbro And Mattel The stock had been on a tear, rising almost 40% in 2025 to date and recently trading above $1,200, close to its all-time high. Wednesday‘s Season 2 premiere in September drove significant viewership to close out the quarter. In addition to production, the company said it uses AI and machine learning already to fine-tune its user interface, place relevant ads on shows across its subscriber footprint, localize promotional assets and improve other functions. “Given our significant data assets and at-scale products and business processes, we are very well positioned to effectively leverage ongoing advances in AI,” the letter said. As Netflix and other major streamers and studios approach another negotiation with above-the-line unions, which are all on edge over AI, Netflix's letter characterized the technology as “empowering” for creators. GenAI tools can “help them achieve their visions and deliver even more impactful titles for members,” it said. “For example, in Happy Gilmore 2, filmmakers used GenAI coupled with ML and Eyeline's proprietary volumetric capture technologies to de-age characters during the opening flashback scene. And the producers of Billionaires' Bunker used various GenAI tools during pre-production, including for pre-visualization to explore wardrobe and set designs.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tyler Hynes may not be a guitar god, but the leather jacket-wearing, motorcycle-riding, ruggedly handsome star of too many rom-coms to count is undeniably a rock star within the Hallmark universe. On October 20, 2025, Hynes announced via social media that, in addition to his already scheduled appearances at upcoming fan events across the U.S., he'll also make stops at holiday festivals in Indianapolis, Denver, and Tacoma, Washington. Unlike the average rock star, Hynes is notorious for ensuring his fans feel seen and appreciated. He's also sentimental to his core, so it's no surprise Hynes has dubbed his ever-growing list of appearances the “I'll Be Seeing You” Tour, named after the classic, heart-tugging tune of the same name (Hynes is partial to the Jimmy Durante version, FYI). To share the news of his additional tour dates, Hynes captioned several touching videos of himself connecting with fans and wrote, “Some lovely folks have asked me to join in their holiday festivities. Can't think of a more lovely thing. In the comment section, he reiterated that sentiment, writing, “I've been asked a lot lately how I feel about meeting folks, taking pictures, singing things so often. While some fans expressed how thrilled they are to live within driving distance of one of Hynes' tour stops (including one who said she'll drive 13 hours), others asked for cities near them to be considered next. But many people also shared their excitement for the people in new places who will have a chance to meet their Hallmark rock star. I'm proud to be an OG Hynie, even though I haven't had the pleasure of meeting you….yet! Another commented, “So happy you're sharing the love with people in these areas ❤️🙌👏👏🎄. I wish he make some visits to Canada. He has a  big fan base here and it would be so good to finally meet him. Come to Palm Springs or Dallas TX! I hope he can come To  Florida How come nobody ever comes to Florida specially my city Miami Only an hour drive and I am so very excited to see him in person. Please consider coming to New York sometime. I will be driving from Houston Texas. This will be our first ever Hallmark anything. We are so looking forward to this time together the 3 of us friends and also meeting other Hallmark Actors as well. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

Jana disclosed that it now holds approximately 9 percent of Six Flags shares, alongside Kelce, former Gap CEO Glenn Murphy and tech executive and former J.D. Tom Brady Wants You to Roast Him (and Dinner) For His Latest Viral Marketing Stunt “I am a lifelong Six Flags fan and grew up going to these parks with my family and friends,” said Travis Kelce in a statement. Kelce grew up in Ohio, not far from Cedar Point. “We look forward to working with the Six Flags board and management to unlock shareholder value for the benefit of all stakeholders,” added Jana managing partner Scott Ostfeld. The current iteration of Six Flags was created last year in an $8 billion merger between Six Flags and Cedar Fair, creating a theme park behemoth that spans the country. Kelce may seem like an unusual choice for an activist campaign, but generating attention in today's investing environment is half the battle, and the star might be able to get shareholders to buy in and perhaps Six Flags executives or board members. Kelce could also become a public face of the effort. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

On Tuesday, WBD announced in a lengthy statement that it was reviewing purchase offers from “multiple parties for both the entire company and Warner Bros.” We knew Warner Bros. was potentially for sale and that Paramount/Skydance was seriously prepping its own offer. There were even rumors that someone like Netflix was interested in making a bid, up until Netflix's co-CEO recently shot those rumors down. It's also a good way to goose the stock price by making Wall Street think there's a lot of buzzards circling. Related Stories ‘Sinners' Returns to IMAX Theaters for Halloween Weekend — and for a Little Oscar Season Reminder 10 Must-See AFI Fest Movies as Chosen by the Programmers, from the Audacious ‘Yes' to Josh O'Connor in ‘Rebuilding' But not really a whole bunch has changed here because the most realistic buyer — until another seriously emerges — is and remains Paramount. The reason Paramount is reportedly making an offer to buy all of Warner Bros. While someone like Apple could easily absorb WBD and its tens of billions of dollars in debt, it wouldn't necessarily want to. Paramount, on the other hand, could still find a use for traditional cable networks like HGTV, TNT, Food Network, TCM, and more to add to its own portfolio. The same would go for the sports rights WBD controls, and it would give Paramount/Skydance a broadcast network in CBS and a major cable news network in CNN. Way more buyers would've come calling than just David Ellison. When Fox sold its film studio to Disney, it retained its broadcast channel and cable networks, and it got a hefty price for doing so all the same. Discovery is at least continuing its spin into two separate companies (kinda like it was when they were individually Warner Bros. and Discovery), and that at least gives Zaslav and company more options when considering offers. None of this is to say that Paramount is the preferable option should they be the ones to buy WBD. We still believe it would lead to another legacy studio disappearing, potentially a major streaming service being sunsetted, countless more jobs lost, and not to mention the entire political can of worms it would open.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With Together Again, Jesse Hassenger looks at actors and directors who have worked together on at least three films, analyzing the nature of their collaborations. Then it was a meme within a meme, the day on social media that someone expressed surprise over the identity of the bearded man nodding as a camera slowly zoomed in on him. (We'll see this spring whether social media has rendered it impossible to use that footage in an actual In Memoriam reel.) But before all of that internet gunk, it was simply a shot of Robert Redford in the wilderness, nodding in approval from about halfway through Jeremiah Johnson, his second movie with Syndey Pollack, his most frequent director. Redford reflected this in his later life's work as the founder of the Sundance Institute and its accompanying independent film festival—named for his character in 1969's Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid, a major work of emerging New Hollywood artistry and a lighter buddy-comedy flipside to Midnight Cowboy, which came out the same year. During the actual 1970s and beyond, though, Redford did not celebrate this artistic revolution by working with Martin Scorsese, Brian De Palma, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Robert Altman, Peter Bogdanovich, Hal Ashby, or Francis Ford Coppola (unless you count a couple of Coppola screenplay credits). He did make two more movies with George Roy Hill, director of Butch Cassidy, as well as one with the satirically minded Michael Ritchie. But for most of the '70s, while the likes of De Niro and Pacino were baring their souls and reinventing movie stardom, Redford was doing Sydney Pollack movies. In the '80s and '90s, when his on-camera appearances became scarcer in the wake of his directorial and Sundance obligations, while an even newer wave of exciting American filmmakers ascended, Pollack movies remained a priority. This isn't meant as a knock on Sydney Pollack, mind you. Jeremiah Johnson, though, is a stranger movie by most measures. The basic story could have been a classic Western, following the title character in a journey through the 19th-century wilderness, his eventual formation of an unexpected makeshift family, and a mission for revenge when that family is harmed. Much of the film features Redford quietly, slowly fumbling his way through a barely explained quest for wilderness isolation. The film is therefore attentive to Johnson's hardships without turning them into a visceral endurance test. At the same time, in its semi-austere way, it's also one of Pollack's more stylish movies, from stately wide shots capturing figures in vast expanses of mountain snow to some surprisingly slam-bang moments of action to that famous slow zoom. But that stuff was, at least per Pollack himself, secondary to his facility with actors, owing to starting his career as one himself; he actually met Redford when both men appeared in the film War Hunt in 1962. But Pollack brings out a key element of the Redford style, far more so than in their first film together as director and actor, the Tennessee Williams adaptation This Property Is Condemned. That film came out in 1966, well before Redford's movie-star peak—though he had already been paired once with co-star Natalie Wood in the previous year's Inside Daisy Clover. As a railway man tasked with closing a station in Depression-era Mississippi and a possible beacon of hope for local free spirit Alva (Wood), Redford's trademark keel plays as opaque, even chilly at times. Embracing the low-dialogue desolation of Jeremiah Johnson, though, works wonders for Redford, who no longer seems quite so aloof despite saying even less. This was not a constant feature of, say, Ryan O'Neal, and it makes Redford surprisingly believable in a variety of roles, from mountain men to CIA nerds. Following the more conventionally entertaining Condor and The Way We Were, Redford and Pollack made another sorta-Western with The Electric Horseman, which arguably set a template for their remaining (and less artistically successful) collaborations. The Electric Horseman specifically feels like it could be a minor-key Clint Eastwood vehicle, and also parallels another Altman anti-Western foray, the little-seen Buffalo Bill And The Indians, Or Sitting Bull's History Lesson, where Redford's old partner in crime Paul Newman plays Buffalo Bill as the star of a Wild West show. It also features a bit of It Happened One Night when reporter Hallie Martin (Jane Fonda) winds up going along for the ride. Redford and Fonda, in their third of four co-starring vehicles, have chemistry, and The Electric Horseman is a minor charmer. It brings Redford back to outdoorsy, quasi-environmental image-making—even if he is playing overtly washed in a way that goes further than usual for his later-period characters, who tend to be slightly diminished rather than hitting bottom—after spending many of his '70s highlights in more urban settings. That movie gives equal weight to the tumultuous partners Hubbell (Redford) and Katie (Barbra Streisand), and largely gives the moral upper hand to Streisand, as Katie practices ideals in politics and disappointment in her WASPy paramour, who prefers an easier, breezier lifestyle. In The Electric Horseman and Out Of Africa, Pollack pairs Redford with a powerhouse actress, just as he did in The Way We Were. But that Eastwoodian sensibility, which very much carries over into the Oscar-winning Out Of Africa, has more than a hint of movie-star vanity, too. Jeremiah Johnson's rugged individuality holds hints of private anguish or compulsion, amplified by the distance with which he's sometimes observed. When he returns to the site where he's just slaughtered several members of the tribe responsible for his makeshift family's death, he lies down on the ground in sorrow, and Pollack's camera pulls away, rather than getting in close. Denys, Redford's Out Of Africa character, arguably lives with greater moral dubiousness. He's a quasi-respectful big-game hunter in British-controlled East Africa who eventually gets involved with aristocratic farmer Karen Dinesen (Meryl Streep), and the latter is the movie's main concern; the film scarcely seems interested in any tension between the character's love of Africa and his colonialist position, despite 70 years of hindsight. Out Of Africa nonetheless won Sydney Pollack a Best Director Oscar, five years after Redford won one for Ordinary People. It's notable that unlike Eastwood, Redford's earliest attempts at directing did not include himself as an actor—and when he did finally turn the camera on himself, it resulted in the soft-focus self-mythologizing nightmare of The Horse Whisperer. So maybe Pollack was actually keeping Out Of Africa in check, even if the movie now feels like an awfully long walk through Nairobi. Streep and Redford are good together, and Out Of Africa has an old-fashioned sweep that must have felt a throwback even in its original 1985 release, now 40 years ago. Havana‘s blatant modeling on Casablanca keeps it from immediately scanning as another alt-Eastwood vehicle, but it's somewhere in that vicinity—specifically in its pokiness. A movie with a semi-doomed love story, revolution in the air, and several explosions somehow feels like the characters are mostly waiting around for a card game to start, then vaguely impatient for it to end. Watch the movie, and you'll know how they feel. Havana has great atmosphere, often gorgeous cinematography that gives Pollack a chance to add some noir shades to his palette, and a punishingly slow pace that eventually resembles a trek through beautifully shot mud. On paper, it's not wildly different from Out Of Africa; for that matter, Redford's character in Havana is arguably better-suited to his age and skillset, and less self-flattering. But Lena Olin, through no fault of her own, isn't exactly Meryl Streep or Jane Fonda, and Pollack's later-period tendency to keep Redford's well-judged reticence centerstage backfires. The whole movie feels like it's thinking, and possibly stalling. Sneakers‘ bouncy caper must have felt even more refreshing in 1992 to anyone who had recently sat through this one; it's a confident merging of early-'90s tech, late-'60s history, and Redford's '70s heyday. For that matter, Pollack made at least one decent late-period thriller, too: The Interpreter, 15 years after Havana, maintains an old-fashioned tension the Redford movie lacks. Redford, meanwhile, proceeded to star in his share of tedium, like Horse Whisperer and Indecent Proposal. That is to say his taste in romantic dramas bent toward a lacquered, soft-focus, borderline tacky sensibility. For all his appreciation of artistic independence, Redford took comfort in the old-fashioned, perhaps even more than Pollack. Today, their first film together, This Property Is Condemned, plays like a transmission from an alternate universe where Redford became a big star a decade and change earlier, when he might have made a decidedly different set of movies with different co-stars—and maybe would have been left behind by the changes of the '70s. On Pollack's side, though, the filmmaking has younger-man energy, as if it's itching to jump forward a few years when this kind of theatrical melodrama might go a little further in content or style. It's a movie that feels nothing like Havana, but they bookend the Redford/Pollack partnership by feeling unstuck in time. It's easy to picture several of his later self-directed vehicles, like Lions For Lambs or The Company You Keep, working better with Pollack at the helm. As is, the pair's last few movies together were more of an awkward transitional phase where they both seemed too in thrall of Redford's famous persona. But Pollack, that ultimate actor's director, preserved his favorite leading man through an unpredictable decade, making the most of what could have been a movie-star wilderness.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some music fans will spend their entire lives mourning the concerts they were never able to attend. Concert films have remedied this slightly, but Janelle Monáe has discovered an even better solution: time travel. In conversation with Lucy Dacus for Rolling Stone‘s Musicians on Musicians series, Monáe recalled her experience seeing David Bowie perform The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars live approximately a decade before she was born. @JanelleMonae is a certified time traveler and saw David Bowie on stage. It all started with an inquiry about Halloween, a holiday that Monáe plans for two years in advance. It fulfills the creative pull she feels towards transformation and world-building in music. “I think when I saw David Bowie,” they said, before Dacus cut in for clarification, asking, “You saw him?” “I traveled back into the 1970s, and I saw him do Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars. It was incredible.” There's more to the story, but Dacus wanted to make sure she was hearing all of this right.

And now that Netflix has gotten into a Euro strategy game like Catan, it's a gateway drug to the streamer next making movies and shows based on Ticket to Ride, 7 Wonders, Everdell, Azul, and Scythe, just you wait. The streamer bought — or traded, likely a haul of some brick and wood or a bunch of wheat — the rights to make movies, TV series, and unscripted series all based on the board game. Related Stories ‘Selena y Los Dinos' Trailer: Netflix's Smash Hit Sundance Doc Puts the Focus Back on Selena's Groundbreaking Music Inside the ‘Task' Finale: Mark Ruffalo's Speech, That Last Shot, and Not Ending the Series After Explosive Penultimate Episode Part of the reason we immediately thought of Netflix for Catan compared to anyone else is that Netflix has its gaming division that we so often forget about. While it's not necessarily the reason anyone signs up for Netflix, the fact that Netflix has some free mobile apps tied to “Squid Game” or “Love Is Blind” or “Stranger Things” arguably keeps a few people around. So adding a Catan app, letting people actually play the game online with other Netflix users while they're Netflix and chilling with the show or movie, makes perfect sense in our mind. But as IndieWire understands it, Tuesday's deal doesn't also include gaming rights. So at the moment, it doesn't mean Netflix can put out its own Catan gaming app. That already exists for mobile in an official form, but it hasn't been supported or updated of late in the way that digital versions of some other popular games have. It likely also doesn't mean we'll get a “Wednesday” themed version of Catan or something like that. Netflix does have a number of big name mobile apps and games it doesn't own itself, like “Civilization VI” or “Hades,” to name just a couple. But not having some sort of playable Catan experience whenever a movie or series does come out could be a big missed opportunity, especially one that Netflix itself would be uniquely capable of executing. Because we're still admittedly skeptical what a Catan movie would actually look like. It also has an “Exploding Kittens” project (also an asmodee game) and is developing a reality competition series based on Monopoly.

Beloved actress Diane Keaton, who died on Oct. 11 at age 79, makes her Billboard music chart debut under her own billing this week with her holiday single, “First Christmas.” The track bows at No. The love you've given my debut holiday single, ‘First Christmas,' has been the most beautiful gift I could ever imagine. “First Christmas” was written by Grammy Award winners Carole Bayer Sager and Jonas Myrin, and produced by Myrin. In “First Christmas,” Keaton sings in its chorus, “The snow falls on my window, I wish that I could let go, it's a silent night, it's another year, the first Christmas without you here.” Although Keaton was best known as a four-time Oscar-nominated actress on the big screen, she had her hand in some iconic music and chart moments since the late ‘60s. In 1968, she was in the original Broadway cast of the musical Hair, and performed on its cast album. In 1987, Keaton directed the official music video for Belinda Carlisle's Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hit “Heaven Is a Place on Earth,” and the video for its follow-up single “I Get Weak,” which reached No. 2-peaking Hot 100 hit from 1964, “You Don't Own Me.” In 2023, Keaton went viral on social media when she filmed herself dancing to Miley Cyrus' Hot 100 No. 1 that year, “Flowers,” and later called Cyrus her “favorite artist” of 2023.

We look forward to celebrating her remarkable career on this very special night.” The gala has raised millions of dollars to support MusiCares' programs, including health and wellness services, addiction recovery, preventive care, disaster relief, and emergency support for music professionals. The first Person of the Year gala (honoring David Crosby) was held in 1991, two days before the 33rd annual Grammy Awards ceremony at which Carey won her first two Grammys – best new artist and best pop vocal performance, female for breakthrough smash, “Vision of Love.” Carey joins a distinguished list of MusiCares honorees. The last five recipients of the award are Aerosmith, Joni Mitchell, Berry Gordy and Smokey Robinson, Jon Bon Jovi and Grateful Dead. Carey's philanthropic works include providing relief for communities impacted by Hurricane Katrina and the COVID-19 pandemic. She founded Camp Mariah in partnership with the Fresh Air Fund to support underserved youth and has championed initiatives advancing health, education and social welfare. “Mariah Carey's influence extends far beyond her remarkable artistry,” Theresa Wolters, executive director of MusiCares, said in a statement. Her work exemplifies the values at the heart of MusiCares: creating systems of care that lift people up and ensure music professionals and communities can thrive. Carey has received multiple awards in recent years. She was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2022. In February 2024, she received a Global Impact Award from The Recording Academy's Black Music Collective. She received the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the MTV Video Music Awards on Sept. 7 – and also won her first VMA in competition that night for “Type Dangerous” as best R&B. She has been nominated for the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in each of the last two years but has yet to receive that accolade. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, from “Vision of Love” in June 1990 to “All I Want for Christmas Is You,” which logged its most recent appearance at No. 1 hits than any other solo artist and is just one shy of the all-time record held by The Beatles. She has amassed 19 top 10 albums on that chart, including her current album, Here For It All, which debuted at No. Only two women have had more top 10 albums in the history of the chart (since it began publishing on a regular, weekly basis in 1956) – Barbra Streisand (34) and Madonna (23). Carey has won five Grammys, including vocal performance honors in both pop and R&B. In 1991, she became just the fifth artist in Grammy history to be nominated in each of the Big Four categories – album, record and song of the year, plus best new artist. Tickets are for sale on the organization's website. The event will again be produced by live event broadcast outfit Lewis & Clark, comprised of Joe Lewis and R.A. Clark.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The film's unhinged and morbidly comedic observations regarding ecological collapse, corporate greed, and conspiratorial thinking as a trauma response have since crystalized into cultural truths, particularly in an increasingly fascistic America. Yet Bugonia, Yorgos Lanthimos' English-language remake of Jang Joon-hwan's film, squanders every opportunity to meaningfully adapt this premise for the director's postmodern sensibility. The overarching premise of Jang's film is largely preserved, save for a few key alterations. Always on point, Jesse Plemons plays Teddy, a reclusive, greasy-haired beekeeper who has dedicated his life to proving that not only do aliens walk among us, but they occupy crucial positions of power and siphon critical Earthly resources. Teddy has indoctrinated his sweet and easily manipulated cousin Don (Aidan Delbis) into this intricate conspiracy. Together, they plan to kidnap Michelle Fuller (Emma Stone), the powerful CEO of the pharmaceutical company Auxolith, who Teddy has pinpointed as an extraterrestrial hailing from Andromeda PK 45. Their ramshackle ambush proves shockingly successful: They transport an unconscious Fuller to their basement, hoping that she will eventually grant them passage onto her mothership when it returns to Earth during the forthcoming lunar eclipse. Before she's kidnapped, Michelle goes through her daily routine—a self-defense lesson, red light mask session, an assortment of daily supplements—but this is merely fodder for a brief fight scene and a single quip about how her exorbitantly expensive cosmetic procedures have her looking exceptionally youthful for a 45-year-old woman. For several days, Teddy and Don try to torture a confession out of Fuller. This mostly entails an excruciating electroshock contraption, emphatically homemade, after which Teddy is even more convinced of the CEO's Andromedan heritage, though the metrics he cites are nonsensically vague. can map where the plot goes from here: There is an unexpected personal connection between Teddy and Fuller; the importance of bees to the Earth's ecosystem is expounded upon; a nosy but feckless cop (Stavros Halkias, far more subtextually perverted than necessary) starts poking around Teddy's property. But no character depth is cultivated, save for an underwritten tangent involving his comatose mother (Alicia Silverstone). The lack of pronounced personalities all around is also a disservice to Stone's character. Particularly now, when the assassination of CEOs is considered by some to be a necessary reckoning, why should anyone care if a fictional one—undoubtedly embroiled in dubious practices—lives or dies? Though bees are a fixation of Teddy and Fuller (one fosters their habitat, the other depletes it), this concept is never directly addressed. However, its final scene—the most artistically congruent with Lanthimos' previous output, a shocking series of images with no emotional resonance—hints at a new hope if not for humanity, then for the ecosystem that allows life to thrive on Earth.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The game has sold more than 45 million copies globally and been translated into over 40 languages. “Millions of people are enjoying Catan since it was created and for many, it remains a gateway to modern board gaming,” said Thomas Koegler, CEO of Asmodee. It's also a testament that board gaming is truly part of pop culture and a popular form of entertainment in everyone's homes, and I'm delighted to continue Asmodee's relationship with Netflix.” “When our father Klaus Teuber first introduced Catan 30 years ago, he imagined an aspirational world where people would gather by trading, building and settling together — both at the table and beyond it,” added Benjamin and Guido Teuber, co-CEOs of Catan GmbH. “This collaboration with Netflix marks an exciting new chapter in that journey. For three decades, Catan has connected families and friends around the world. Netflix has built up the largest army of game titles to adapt in recent years. In addition to Catan, the streamer also has Castlevania, Family Pack (The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow), Exploding Kittens, an upcoming Assassin's Creed series, a  Monopoly reality competition series, and a Gears of War  film.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A beloved American star has revealed that she once had flings with two of the biggest names in showbusiness. Actress, singer, and former model Cybill Shepherd, 75 — the star of movies like 1976's ‘Taxi Driver' and television shows like ‘Psych' — spilled the beans on the relationships on Friday, October 17, at the Catalina Jazz Club in Los Angeles, during An Evening with Cybill Shepherd: Music, Conversation & Stories. Cybill Shepherd explained that her fling with Johnson occurred in 1985, when both stars worked on the made-for-television romantic drama movie ‘The Long Hot Summer' — a remake of the 1958 Martin Ritt film of the same name starring Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward, Anthony Franciosa and Orson Welles. Johnson starred in the movie as drifter Ben Quick, while Shepherd had a supporting role as Eula Varner, the daughter of business owner and key character Will Varner. As per People, Shepherd explained that she and Johnson had no joint screentime, but they still spent time together away from the set. Shepherd also gave away some behind-the-scenes details, revealing she had targeted a different role in the movie, but was rejected for it for a strange but flattering reason. Shepherd also went into some detail about Elvis Presley, referring to the fling she enjoyed with him in the 1970s. Following her performance of the song devoted to him, Shepherd said, “Elvis was really cool though” and referred to him as “a great guy.” Shepherd hasn't been too active on screen in recent years.
