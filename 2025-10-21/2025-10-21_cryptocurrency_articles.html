                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TORONTO, Ontario and NEW YORK, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bitfarms Ltd. (NASDAQ/TSX: BITF), a North American energy and digital infrastructure company (“Bitfarms” or the “Company”), today announced that it has closed its offering of US$588 million aggregate principal amount of 1.375% convertible senior notes due 2031 (the “Convertible Notes”), which includes the exercise in full of the $88 million option granted to the initial purchasers of the Convertible Notes. “I am happy to announce our tremendous success as a first-time issuer in the convertible bond market,” said Ben Gagnon, CEO. “We were able to upsize the deal while improving on pricing, preserving upside and minimizing potential economic dilution through a 125% capped call, and introduce many high-quality institutional partners into our cap table. The funds raised through these Convertible Notes have strengthened our balance sheet with cash, Bitcoin, and remaining funds available to draw under the Macquarie project facility to over US$1 billion. We now have the financial firepower and flexibility to move forward at full speed with our HPC/AI infrastructure developments in North America. I would like to thank everyone who participated in the deal – we look forward to working together as we execute on our exciting infrastructure pipeline.” The Convertible Notes were offered only to “qualified institutional buyers” (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act). Offers and sales in Canada were made only pursuant to exemptions from the prospectus requirements of applicable Canadian provincial and territorial securities laws. This press release is neither an offer to sell, nor is it a solicitation of an offer to buy the Convertible Notes or any other securities and shall not constitute an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to buy, or a sale of, the Convertible Notes or any other securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. With a focus on U.S. growth, Bitfarms' 1.3 GW energy pipeline is more than 80% U.S.-based and clustered in data center hotspots with robust access to power and fiber infrastructure.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BlockDAG news updates in October show that its presale numbers are strong. As a result, investors are rotating into DeepSnitch AI's crypto analytics platform, which aims to help retail traders to better compete with whales. BlackRock has officially launched its iShares Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Product (ETP) on the London Stock Exchange, marking a major step for crypto accessibility in the United Kingdom. Priced from around $11 per unit, the product tracks Bitcoin's market performance while operating within a regulated framework, making it suitable for traditional investment portfolios and brokerage accounts. BlackRock's entry into the UK market strengthens its dominance in crypto investment products. Data from SoSoValue shows that the firm's U.S.-listed iShares Bitcoin ETF already holds more than $85 billion in assets, highlighting growing institutional interest in digital assets. While the FCA remains cautious by maintaining its ban on crypto derivatives for retail investors the regulator has also expressed interest in exploring fund tokenization as part of its broader financial innovation strategy. DeepSnitch AI's (DSNT) ICO token sales have surpassed $446,000, drawing the attention of both crypto veterans and first-time investors eager to catch the next big AI wave. Unlike typical presales that rely on hype, DeepSnitch is built on a working foundation of blockchain intelligence and it's already showing why analysts believe it could be one of 2025's most explosive projects. At its core, DeepSnitch operates through five powerful AI engines that continuously analyze the crypto sector. These engines detect unusual wallet activity, trace liquidity transfers, and flag suspicious contract deployments before the public notices. By converting vast on-chain data into simple signals, DeepSnitch lets everyday traders anticipate moves that institutional players usually dominate. Its SnitchFeed AI dashboard, which is set to go live soon, will offer easy-to-read insights, highlighting moments of whale accumulation, potential dumps, and high-probability reversals. Security, often the Achilles' heel of early-stage crypto, is another strength. DeepSnitch's contracts have passed double audits by Coinsult and SolidProof, establishing trust at a time when investors are increasingly cautious. Now trading at $0.01953, DSNT's low price is a great entry point that could lead to 500x gains over the next few months. BlockDag presale updates continue to dominate internet searches in the crypto ICO sector. Many investors eagerly seek to know what's going on with the BlockDAG ecosystem. BlockDAG leverages the Directed Acrylic Graph system which aims to make transaction processing faster than what traditional networks offer. The DAG system is also supposed to bring increased scalability, a factor that many crypto ecosystems have struggled with. After raising over $428 million from ICO token sales, the BlockDAG price prediction for 2026 is overwhelmingly strong. Yet, with no news on the official BlockDAG launch date, investors are eagerly turning their attention to other yet-to-launch crypto ecosystems like DeepSnitch AI. Remittix is a new face in the crypto sector, one that aims to bring smooth business transactions thanks to simplified cross border payment systems. Thankfully, all that is set to change with the upcoming launch of Remittix. This new ecosystem allows crypto users to make payments in over thirty different fiat currencies by simply using their wallets. Remittix's technology is particularly useful for cross border business transactions, making it a favorite among ecommerce firms. Investors say Remittix could be one of the leading cross border settlement blockchain networks, competing with giants like XRP. With Bitcoin on the verge of $108k, investors are anticipating another bull run in coming weeks. Additionally, the project has gotten 500x projections, a factor that is now pulling away investors from BlockDAG news sites to DSNT's ICO. DeepSnitch's earliest supporters are now up by 29% with more growth to come before the project goes live. Secure your DSNT tokens now directly from the official presale site while prices remain low. DeepSnitch AI is poised to grow by 500x over the next few months.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin and Ethereum rose on Tuesday as gold's price headed toward its biggest daily drop in over a decade, indicating renewed appetite for risk-taking among investors. Bitcoin was recently trading around $112,000, a 1% increase over the past day, according to CoinGecko. After the precious metal surged to a record of $4,382 per ounce on Monday, that represented its biggest daily drop since April 2013. Despite his recent tariff threats, U.S. President Donald Trump said earlier this week that he thinks China is open to “a really fair and really great trade deal,” per Bloomberg. On Tuesday, the outlet reported that Trump is still eager to meet with China's Xi Jinping. Plummeting gold prices reflect easing geopolitical tensions, according to Jake Ostrovskis, head of OTC trading at market maker Wintermute. He told Decrypt it's plausible that Tuesday's move also stems from fast money unwinding overextended long positions. “Bitcoin seems to be capitalizing on this shift, with mercenary capital finding relative value,” he told Decrypt. Carlos Guzman, a research analyst at market maker GSR, told Decrypt that crypto prices were likely buoyed by strong earning results on Wall Street. “We're off to a strong start for earnings season,” he said. Still, Guzman said recent remarks from Federal Reserve officials suggest the central bank is focused on preserving the labor market's health, and as a result, is likely to cut interest rates. “As long as [CPI] comes in within expectations, it should be a huge market mover.” he said, noting that risk assets like stocks and crypto tend to benefit from cheaper borrowing costs. “If it is significantly higher than expectations, I do think that'll be pretty bearish.” The sentiment was echoed by David Hernandez, a crypto investment strategist at 21Shares, an issuer of crypto-focused exchange-traded products. The split between Bitcoin and gold reflects investors repositioning on hopes of dovish Fed policy. Some influential voices on Crypto Twitter were eager to suggest that the precious metal's price had peaked on Tuesday, including Zion Thomas, who is better known online at Ansem. “Finally,” Thomas said on X, in reference to a chart showing Bitcoin up and gold down. Despite saying that Bitcoin's value would eventually surpass gold's $28.69 trillion market cap on Monday, Binance co-founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao indicated that the precious metal will likely serve as an alternative store of value for years to come.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Read More: Coinbase Deepens India & Middle East Bet with Major Investment in CoinDCX Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong confirmed the acquisition in a short but viral post on X: “Ah man wtf.” “I'm too old to have a crypto podcast, imma be out here looking like Gary V.” Its final episode dropped shortly after FTX's implosion, in what many viewed as the “golden era” for crypto content. And from that moment Cobie would tell people time and time again how the show wasn't his anymore to bring back, how the decision was locked in an NFT. In May 2025, Cobie minted the UpOnly NFT as a tongue-in-cheek experiment, tweeting: No one expected the token, initially listed with an absurd string of zeros to actually sell. But Coinbase just turned the joke into a $25 million marketing statement. Read More: Fed's $10T Payment Future: Circle, Coinbase, and Google Join Force Coinbase's acquisition reveals a deeper, more strategic play: NFTs as programmable media rights. This model may redefine how content rights, royalties, and creator collaborations are handled in the digital age. Analysts say Coinbase's move could pave the way for NFT-backed entertainment, where shows, music, or games can be directly tied to on-chain conditions. “This isn't just about nostalgia,” said crypto analyst Tom Dunleavy. As NFT markets are starting to recover from a brutal 2023–24 slump, corporate actors such as Coinbase find new forms of how they may capitalize on digital collectibles outside art speculation. One memecoin, UPONLY, soared more than 7,800% in a single day following the announcement, underscoring traders' obsession with this deal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A version of this article first appeared in the CNBC Property Play newsletter with Diana Olick. Property Play covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, from individuals to venture capitalists, private equity funds, family offices, institutional investors and large public companies. Roughly a decade ago, cryptocurrency began to show up in the residential real estate market. There were stories of the first bitcoin home sale, but really it was just people buying in the currency and then converting it back to dollars. Now crypto is being used more for leverage. Lenders like Propy are using it as collateral for both residential and commercial property loans, so buyers don't actually have to sell their bitcoin or other digital currency in order to buy. Investors can certainly use cryptocurrency to buy commercial real estate assets, but it's the blockchain, where crypto lives, that the CRE industry is finally, albeit slowly, adopting. Giordano is a luxury real estate broker, who was an early crypto pioneer in the space. He began educating his fellow brokers, through social media and conferences, about how to buy and sell properties in bitcoin. Now he's exploring how it's impacting the commercial sector. Giordano describes the blockchain as a great, big virtual filing cabinet, where billions of records can live into eternity without risk. That includes cryptocurrency, mortgage bonds, titles, deeds, literally everything. CNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox. A report from Deloitte examined how it is already transforming the commercial real estate market: "Until recently, blockchain was known more as the technology powering Bitcoin. However, industry players now realize that blockchain-based smart contracts can play a much larger role in CRE, potentially transforming core CRE operations such as property transactions (purchase, sale, financing, leasing, and management). Over time, blockchain adoption can have a broader impact, as it can be linked to public utility services such as smart parking, waste, water, and energy billing, and also enable data-driven city management," the report said. There are several ways of using the blockchain for commercial real estate finance. This process converts ownership rights of a CRE asset into digital tokens, allowing for fractional ownership and easier trading of shares in a property. For now, however, U.S. citizens cannot invest in U.S. real estate that has been tokenized, because it's still regulated, but international investors can. Another report published last April by Deloitte, specifically on tokenization, said, "This technology could help build trillions of dollars of economic activity for the real estate sector over the next decade, in part, by allowing it to expand its investor base and product offerings." Roughly $4 trillion of real estate will be tokenized by 2035, increasing from less than $300 billion in 2024, according to the Deloitte Center for Financial Services. Giordano pointed to BV Innovation, a blockchain platform creating transferable mortgage bonds for commercial and residential financing on the blockchain. Its AI-enabled software helps commercial real estate finance companies to transfer loans with their current interest rates from one property to another. "It would open up so many more transactions if people weren't sitting on that interest rate. You also have a prepayment penalty for seven more years that doesn't allow you to sell the building without paying a $4 million penalty," he explained. "They don't have to understand that AI and blockchain is on the back end helping the bank do it. They just understand that it's secure from the blockchain."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"The Fed intends to be an active part of that revolution." Waller, who is one of the governors on the seven-member Fed board, is reportedly among President Donald Trump's potential top candidates to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell when Powell's term is up next year. "I believe we can and should do more to support those actively transforming the payment system," he said. They may not, for instance, pay interest on balances, come with daylight overdraft privileges or grant access to borrowing through the Fed's so-called "discount window," and they may come with balance caps. Waller isn't the vice chair for supervision, so he's not in a position to immediately direct Fed policy moves. The current vice chair is Michelle Bowman, and the overall board is still led by Chair Powell, who was appointed by Trump to that role but quickly ran afoul of the president during Trump's first term. But Waller has shown himself a prominent crypto ally at the Fed, having also just appeared at DC Fintech Week to praise decentralized finance (DeFi) innovations. At that same event, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse lambasted Wall Street bankers' resistance to crypto firms getting Fed master accounts, which his company is among those applying for. Such accounts grant more seamless integration into the U.S. financial system and direct access to the central bank's payments systems, rather than forcing crypto-native firms to rely on outside relationships with banks. "I wanted to send a message that this is a new era for the Federal Reserve in payments," Waller said on Tuesday. "The DeFi industry is not viewed with suspicion or scorn.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Top secret information ‘bandied about like confetti' during catastrophic Ministry of Defence leak, MP claims Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. The catastrophic breach exposed the details of thousands of Afghans who said they were in danger from the Taliban because of their links to UK forces and wanted to escape to Britain. The leak, which occurred when a spreadsheet with 33,000 lines of data was emailed to someone outside government, triggered a huge secret evacuation programme. The truth of what happened was only revealed after a court battle lasting almost two years, in which national media – including The Independent – challenged an unprecedented superinjunction. Now it has emerged that the ICO did not take any contemporaneous notes of its decision not to launch an official probe of the catastrophic data loss, claiming officials were unable to record anything due to the classification of the secret information, which one MP claimed was “bandied about like confetti”. He said the ICO had occasional meetings with MoD officials and would “feed in their observations about lines of inquiry”, adding: “I understand that those were received with gratitude”. Tory MP Kit Malthouse said he was surprised that no formal investigation had taken place, given the severity of the breach. He told Mr Edwards: “What you've broadly said to us, is that it was dealt with with a few unrecorded meetings and a handshake. Dr Lauren Sullivan MP added: “It sounds like your method of investigation relies a lot on the honesty of the person you are investigating.” Mr Edwards responded that there were tools the ICO could use to investigate government departments but that these weren't necessary in this case because no formal investigation was launched. 33,000 line Excel file, with top secret information, bandied about like confetti. Mr Edwards admitted there were not enough staff at the ICO with developed vetting to handle top secret information, but said it would not have mattered in this case because the regulator had decided not to launch an investigation. He told MPs: “We are able to investigate top secret matters. We chose not to because it would have tied up resources which would have been better used elsewhere.” He said that the ICO had carried out a formal investigation into a smaller data loss at the same MoD department, when a mass email was sent to 245 Afghans who had worked with the UK government.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Here's Why the Crypto Market is Down | Credit: Hameem Sarwar The cryptocurrency market is showing bearish signs as key support levels risk giving way. After an explosive run earlier this year, both TOTALCAP and ALTCAP signal weakness with fresh breakdowns. Momentum indicators suggest bearishness, and the market may have already reached its peak. The big question is: has the crypto bear market begun, or is there still room for one last push higher? TOTALCAP has fallen since reaching its all-time high of $4.27 trillion in October. This area is critical since it acted as resistance throughout the year until the price finally broke out in June. A breakdown would turn the $3.60 trillion area into resistance, preventing any upward attempts. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) have created bearish divergences in both the long-term (black) and short-term (orange) trends. The MACD has also made a bearish cross (black circle), another sign of a bearish trend. While the crypto market may create a slightly higher high before crashing, it is likely in an ending diagonal, so a decisive breakdown is likely soon. It has already confirmed its bearish outlook with a deviation and breakdown below the $1.6 trillion horizontal area. Several other bearish signs are developing, all suggesting that the TOTALCAP trend is be The RSI and MACD have generated bearish divergences, and the latter has already made a bearish cross (black circle). Moreover, a clearly defined five-wave upward movement (green) with an extended third wave (black) is visible, indicating that the upward movement has ended. Finally, an ascending parallel channel contains the altcoin market cap movement. The crypto market sentiment is pessimistic, with TOTALCAP holding onto critical support and ALTCAP already confirming a bearish breakdown.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You'll follow a guy around taking pictures from hotel parking lots, or outside of a club on Sunset, trying to prove he's having an affair. Same thing: You tail a guy, take pictures, prove he's not really hurt. Iza was a computer wiz who'd made millions off crypto. He had called Paramount Investigative Services in November 2021 with what seemed like a straightforward job: He was hoping to recover a stolen laptop with $300 million in crypto on it, and had a good idea who had taken it. Paramount's founder, Ken Childs, didn't know a whole lot about crypto but promised Iza he could track down the laptop. He warned it could take a while, though — the guy who stole it probably didn't want to be found. After a few weeks of surveilling the suspected thief and turning up no solid leads, Childs decided he wanted to meet Iza. Childs asked Iza for his address, and headed to Bel Air. When he pulled up to Iza's house, he couldn't see past the towering hedges and big redwoods circling the property. He stood about six feet four and wore an earpiece. The house had been built in 1927 in a Mediterranean style, all white with a red-tiled roof; but just a few years before, an architect who'd done work for Rod Stewart and Sylvester Stallone had gutted the interior and updated it with Italian-marble floors and cathedral ceilings. Architectural Digest called it one of the finest homes in Bel Air. Iza emerged from its arching French front doors as Childs exited his car. Suddenly, the gate opened again, and a black Rolls-Royce Phantom pulled up. Another security guard opened the door and a petite Filipino woman emerged in dark sunglasses. Instead, she headed toward a back entrance of the 36,000-square-foot mansion with her children and disappeared. “I just remember thinking, like, ‘Holy fuck,'” Childs says. I was impressed and rolling my eyes at the same time.” Long Covid Is Real — And It's Changing an Entire Generation For Some Young Men, It's a Near-Fatal Gamble Dem Senator Introduces Bill to End Profiteering by Trump and Lawmakers “I was kind of waiting for that dude in the Old Spice commercial who's half man and half horse to come jogging through the center entry,” Childs says. “You would have thought some kids designed the place.” Iza led Childs to his office, which was trimmed in heavy oak. As they discussed the likely hurdles of the laptop-recovery job, Iza said he didn't care how long it might take — six months, nine months, a year. Childs left Bel Air that day with few concerns about Iza's ability to pay. Before long, though, he began to feel a little uneasy, like something didn't quite add up. But the FBI wasn't interested in Childs. Last September, federal prosecutors in the Central District of California charged Iza with tax evasion and wire fraud, alleging the man they'd dubbed the Crypto Godfather ran what amounted to a criminal conspiracy, complete with police officers on his payroll who allegedly intimidated rivals and helped enforce extortion schemes. “For years, I had been warning people that this disorganized crime space was trending toward organized crime,” says Allison Nixon, the chief research officer of Unit 221B, a collective of cybersecurity experts. The charges against Iza suggest cybercrime has entered a new phase, Nixon says. “It's hard for people to wrap their heads around this, because they have a certain image of organized crime and they have a certain image of cybercrime,” Nixon says. Riding that unchecked wave of growth in crypto took Iza from a quiet, solitary childhood in the Midwest suburbs to a world of outlandish wealth, shady operators, and mind-boggling schemes. “It was like The Great Gatsby,” a friend of Iza's says. “He was living this amazing life, and everyone wanted a piece. Until very recently, local police agencies, ­including sprawling departments like the LAPD and the NYPD, didn't take online financial crimes, or the loose collection of hackers who perpetuate them, all that seriously. That's partly because they didn't understand the ­technology, partly because they weren't equipped to build those types of cases, and partly because they didn't see the stereotypical ­hacker (think anti­social incel) doxing Dana White or swatting a Papa Johns as all that dangerous. But in the past few years, something has dramatically shifted. Crypto crimes once contained to online harassment now often include kidnapping, extortion, and armed threats. In May, a crypto investor was allegedly held hostage and tortured in a luxury Manhattan townhouse, in what police say was a failed attempt to steal his $30 million crypto fortune. That same month, a gang in Paris attempted to kidnap the daughter and grandson of the chief executive officer of a crypto firm in broad daylight. These are not isolated incidents, but rather part of a global trend: In the past two years alone, there were kidnappings for ransom of cryptocurrency moguls in Toronto, Sydney, and Danbury, Connecticut. Over that same period, crypto crime has exploded. In 2023 alone, the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center received more than 69,000 reports of crypto-related financial fraud. And while crypto made up just 10 percent of the financial-fraud cases the FBI investigated last year, it accounted for nearly half of all reported losses: a staggering $5.6 billion. Because every crypto payment is locked into the blockchain's permanent ledger, in most cases there's no way to reverse them. Clearance rates for crypto crimes are also abysmal, Nixon says. Law enforcement only has resources to focus on the biggest cases, meaning the best hackers can operate for years without facing any kind of legal repercussions. Of those who do face consequences, Nixon says, “Once these people get out from their very short sentences, they go right back to their gangs and then educate the rest of the members how the justice system works and how they got caught, so they can learn how to not get caught again.” She adds, “Their careers are marked by this constant upward progression of severity and dollar amount.” His best friend from the time, Adam Faleh, says Iza had few friends and mostly kept to himself. “He seemed to enjoy solitude,” Iza's sister tells me. Even before he was in high school, Iza had found a passion, his mother says: computers. Faleh remembers coming over to the cramped home where Iza lived with his parents and four younger siblings and Iza showing him the computer he had built. Iza was into Bitcoin, and already cashing in. One day he showed up to high school driving a Porsche Boxster, Faleh recalls. When Iza was 17, he moved to California and, within a couple of years, had changed his name. To Faleh, it seemed like he had simply disappeared. How and why Iza moved to Los Angeles is a bit murky, as is his descent into criminality: When I talked to his friends from that time period, they seemed reluctant to say too much. But several sources who know Iza well told me on condition of anonymity that while living in Missouri, he had become friendly with members of the Com, the underground hacker collective, and that prominent members of the organization had been so impressed by crypto-mining software Iza had built that they sponsored his move out to L.A. (Iza denies ever being part of the Com.) According to Iza's friend Milad Sarwari, a cybersecurity expert who goes by the name Hackistan, it was during this time that Iza became friendly with some of the most notorious hackers on the planet. UGNazi were most famous, however, for stealing thousands of credit card numbers, which eventually culminated in a massive FBI investigation known as Operation Card Shop. “Adam got involved with the wrong group of people,” a source close to Iza says. These were people who could play on that and manipulate him. It set him off on the wrong path.” A few years after graduating high school, Iza called Faleh and invited him to come out to L.A. Iza told his friend he was doing very well. At first, Faleh didn't even recognize his old friend, who was wearing a black Tom Ford suit — he had completely transformed himself from the shy, halting boy who preferred spending time alone in his bedroom. “I remember ­telling him, ‘Damn, dude, you look like Tom Cruise. Iza told Faleh he was making most of his money off crypto, or more specifically a crypto trading platform he'd invented called Zort. Using a proprietary form of AI that Iza said he'd developed, the Zort trading bot deployed signaling technology that analyzed news reports, market trends, and social media sentiment related to all of the crypto exchanges around the world to make trades. They'd show up at a steakhouse in Beverly Hills, and the whole staff seemed to know Iza. They went to dinner with rappers, and Iza picked up the bill. “We'd go to a restaurant with an entourage. Sometimes, Sarwari says, they'd go down to skid row and Iza would hand out $100 bills. Iris Au had lived with Iza for a few years, and according to Sarwari, he was helping raise her two children from a previous marriage. To Faleh, it seemed like a lot to juggle, but he says Iza seemed content with the way his life had turned out. In the summer of 2021, Iza began planning for his 21st-birthday celebration. He wanted a party that would match the grandeur of his Bel Air home, something that people would never forget. To Iza's friends who attended the party, it seemed like a huge success. Per a source close to Iza, to increase attendance, Chapell had invited patrons from a nearby bar, who had arrived drunk and trashed the bar area of the mansion, urinating and defecating on the marble floors. Visibly agitated, Iza loaded bullets into a magazine while several bodyguards — some wearing law-enforcement-style badges — stood watch. The largest sheriff's agency in the U.S., it has for years been described by watchdogs and former cops as corrupt, with an entrenched culture of lawless groups operating within its ranks. Getting into the gang — or “chasing ink” — typically required engaging in violence against civilians that skirted the law, or was obviously illegal, like beating a suspect during an arrest. As Rolling Stone detailed in 2021, that year nearly one in six LASD deputies surveyed said they had been invited to join an illicit subgroup. Iza's head of security, an LASD deputy named Eric Saavedra, had belonged to a clique known as the Jump Out Boys, according to court records. The clique encouraged violent policing, even rewarding members when they were involved in shootings, per a lawsuit against members of the clique. Iza would brag to friends, in text messages over Telegram later seized by the FBI, that he could get his security detail to do whatever he asked of them, which included illegal activity. At one point, Chapell says in a lawsuit, nine LASD deputies who were part of Iza's security detail drew their weapons. Iza then transferred $25,000 from the party planner's bank account, photographed his passport, driver's license, and credit cards, and told him to leave the house. Federal investigators have alleged Iza began communicating with Chapell's girlfriend and relayed to Saavedra that the party planner was a drug dealer. Saavedra allegedly passed this information on to a fellow LASD deputy without disclosing where it had come from, or that he and his team of deputies were on Iza's payroll. A few days later, deputies pulled over the car Chapell was riding in for what they said was a traffic violation. After claiming Chapell had an outstanding warrant, they searched the car and found cocaine under his seat and mushrooms in his backpack, which his girlfriend had planted at Iza's direction, federal prosecutors allege. The next day, after Chapell texted his girlfriend accusing her of setting him up, Iza followed with another message: “The cops had you on their watch list for weeks, so go complain to them [a]bout setting you up. Later that month, court records allege, Iza held another associate — identified in court records only as L.A. — at gunpoint inside his Bel Air mansion while off-duty LASD deputy Michael Coberg stood by. Accusing L.A. of scamming him, Iza threatened to hurt the man unless he paid up. The victim transferred $127,000 to Iza that same day. The next day, Deputy Coberg picked up L.A. at his hotel and again transported him to Iza's residence, leaving him alone with Iza at the home's shooting range, according to court records. Iza held L.A. at gunpoint, Coberg would later state in a plea agreement, and demanded L.A.'s business partner transfer money to him, which he did later that day. But hiring off-­duty cops to intimidate and extort victims, or throw them in jail, represented a significant escalation. Iza had just crossed a line, and eventually, it would bring him down. By February 2022, private investigator Ken Childs was growing weary of working for Iza, no matter how good the money was. He would soon worry about the legality of what Iza was asking him to do. From the beginning, Iza had insisted his stolen laptop was in the hands of Enzo Zelocchi, an actor and Hollywood producer he'd met a few years before. But Iza was immediately skeptical, according to later testimony given in a deposition: Zelocchi had more than 10 million followers on Instagram and posts with nearly 1 billion views, even though Iza had never heard of him. Iza suspected his movie credits, which claimed to feature stars like Brad Pitt and Al Pacino, were all fake. “It just didn't seem real,” Iza would later testify. Just, you know, the common stupid person's idea of how to make money.” “For a drug dealer, you fucked with the wrong people. According to a complaint Iza filed, he and Zelocchi had met several times to discuss the retrieval and return of the laptop, including more than once at a Cheesecake Factory in Beverly Hills; and yet, it was never recovered. The whole thing  seemed a little curious to Childs, but he wouldn't realize until years later how truly dangerous Iza could be. In one incident in November 2021, for example, shortly after Iza hired Childs, two LASD deputies on Iza's payroll pulled guns on Zelocchi at a gas station in Corona, more than an hour southeast of L.A., and searched his trunk. Zelocchi filed a police report, but the story of how he had ended up  in Corona with Iza was so convoluted that no charges were filed. Later that year, Iza used his connections with LASD to obtain a warrant for Zelocchi's phone. The deputy who helped Iza texted: “Warrant is complete … I will get it signed in the morning.” Iza forwarded the exchange to an associate, as well as a photo of himself posing with a group of officers. “Damn my guy actually filed the warrant,” Iza texted. “That's some serious shit to do for someone.” After more than a decade as a private investigator in L.A., Childs knew celebrities often hired off-duty cops for security, and that the lines between legal and illegal blurred fast. But Iza had blown far past that kind of activity, and Childs worried Iza was now asking him to do something that could put them both in jail. It was late February 2022, and Childs was running surveillance outside of Zelocchi's apartment in Hollywood when he saw a man named David Do arrive with what looked like a laptop bag. From across the street, Childs could see the two men seated side by side with open laptops in front of them. Childs called Iza to describe what he was seeing. It appeared Zelocchi and Do were rapidly cycling through passcodes that popped up on both screens, trying to hack into one of the laptops. “I need pictures,” Childs recalls Iza telling him. Childs says Iza instructed him to take down the hacker if he left the apartment with a laptop in hand. Childs reminded him of their ground rules: “We're not in the fucking robbery business.” A few days later, one of Childs' investigators called him in the evening, just as Childs had sat down for dinner with his wife and kids. The team was surveilling Do outside an apartment in Garden Grove when a security guard hired by Iza showed up. The burly man exited his vehicle and started giving orders to Childs' team. Iza had previously sent his security detail to Zelocchi's house and tried to break in; Zelocchi had fired several rounds before police arrived. By the time Childs got to the apartment, he says, his team was gone, but Iza's guy was still there. Childs tried to talk him out of it, but the guard seemed committed. Childs was about to go home when he saw Do exit the apartment with what appeared to be a laptop bag. After a brief struggle, Childs says, Iza's guy grabbed the bag and took off. But then he realized Iza's guard had left his iPad and phone in Childs' car and was now headed back to Iza's mansion in Bel Air. Childs felt he had no choice but to follow him. Once inside Iza's house, Childs says, he followed three security officers into Iza's office, where Iza was seated at his desk, trying to crack into the laptop that had been snatched from Do. “He's showing me a screen of code, and he's telling me exactly what this line means, and I've got to be a cheerleader to make sure I get paid,” Childs recalls. As it turns out, they'd retrieved the wrong laptop. “It was like Dumb and Dumber: Multi­millionaire Crypto Version,” Childs says. A few days later, Iza texted Childs and told him he wasn't going to pay him because Childs hadn't done what Iza asked — namely, recover the stolen laptop when he had a chance. Childs says Iza then told him to go fuck himself. (He was also using aliases by then, including Tony Brambilla and Diego Facebook.) His crypto trading platform, Zort, was nothing more than a front that Iza used to defraud victims and to launder stolen bitcoin, investigators say. And around the same time he'd orchestrated his party planner's arrest, the FBI says, Iza would become involved with a hacker who had obtained access to Meta merchant accounts, which authorities allege Iza would use to defraud clients of roughly $40 million. If not for “using the cops to do his dirty work,” which attracted the attention of the FBI, Allison Nixon of Unit 221B says, Iza “could have been operating for many years, pulling off all these scams. I think he'd still be at it.” (A source close to the investigation says this isn't true. Iza did know he was being investigated by the IRS, according to his attorney, Josef Sadat, and he was worried enough to hire a tax attorney. (The FBI would allege Iza owed $13 million in unpaid takes between 2020 and 2023.) Sadat says the tax attorney advised Iza that if they began cooperating with the IRS, he could possibly avoid any criminal charges. Instead, Iza left the country, taking trips to Switzerland and spending extended periods of time in Dubai. “Even $300M there isn't shit,” he wrote in a text, seemingly referring to back taxes. He was facing mounting legal troubles from all sides. In November 2023, FBI Special Agent Barbara Johnson traveled to the Philippines to interview two of Iza's former acquaintances, Mir Islam and Troy Woody, who were incarcerated there, charged with the murder of Woody's girlfriend. Woody told the FBI that Iza had stolen millions in cryptocurrency from them and had used Zort to launder it. They interviewed Ken Childs, David Do, Enzo Zelocchi, and the hacker who had allegedly helped Iza scam Meta merchant accounts. And they eventually interviewed the LASD deputies Iza had collectively paid six ­figures a month for security. On Sept. 23, 2024, the FBI took Iza into custody in Los Angeles. Last January, Adam Iza and Eric Saavedra both agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy charges that included “intimidation, extortion, illegal search warrants and other abuses of police power.” Iza also pleaded guilty to tax evasion and wire fraud, and admitted he'd defrauded Meta of more than $37 million by using phishing scams to sell lines of credit to advertisers. In his plea agreement, he also admitted to using law enforcement to extort a victim identified as L.A. in court documents of $127,000, and using LASD deputies to intimidate, harass, and extort the party planner, Chapell. Iza also admitted to using law enforcement to pull warrants on Zelocchi and Do, ordering one of his security personnel to rob Do, which resulted in Do's assault, and breaking into Zelocchi's house with the help of off-duty LASD deputies. Besides Saavedra, three other LASD deputies have been charged in the case. Saavedra and his attorney did not respond to repeated requests for comment. In July, two LASD deputies agreed to plea deals. In previous court filings, Cadman had been referred to as “LASD Deputy 6,” and in his plea agreement, he admitted he had held Chapell, the party planner, at gunpoint until he transferred Iza $25,000. He also admitted he had coordinated the traffic stop a month later in which Chapell had been arrested after planted drugs were found in his car. He did not respond to a request for comment through his attorney. On Sept. 29, a third former LASD deputy, 44-year-old Michael Coberg, pleaded guilty to extortion and admitted to helping set up Chapell's false arrest. In a statement reported by the Los Angeles Times in July, the L.A. Sheriff's Department said it had fully cooperated with the investigation and that it had fired Saavedra, Rodriguez, and Cadman. LASD Sheriff Robert Luna, who was elected in 2022 on a campaign built largely around cleaning up the department, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Despite Luna establishing the Office of Constitutional Policing to root out deputy gangs, the county inspector general argued earlier this year that LASD had made no systemic effort to identify gang members within its ranks or investigate group misconduct. Critics point out that dec­ades-old, secretive clique structures remain deeply embedded in the department. Iza's victims, meanwhile, say they are doing their best to move on. Childs is still trying to get the $90,000 Iza owes him, plus legal fees (in a court filing, Iza has argued that Childs never adhered to their agreement). David Do says it's hard to put a price tag on the harassment campaign he endured. Somehow, the surveillance teams watching Zelocchi had become convinced Do was something else entirely. Besides being mugged by one of Iza's henchmen, a brick was thrown through his window and his car was vandalized. “It's hard for me to go out at night,” Do says. “After everything that happened, I was just so paranoid. As for Zelocchi, he says Iza ruined his reputation in Hollywood. After Iza sued him, Zelocchi claims, he lost major film opportunities, was branded a criminal in industry circles, and had to flee Los Angeles. “Long story short, I was basically stopped for about three years,” he says. He still goes back to L.A. but is wary of staying too long. “His mind is dangerous as fuck,” he says of Iza. She also agreed to forfeit any assets obtained through Zort or the various other shell companies authorities allege she and Iza set up to launder stolen crypto, including a Porsche, a Ferrari, three Mercedes-Benz, 14 Louis Vuitton bags, eight Hermès bags, two Dior bags, a glock, and a Smith & Wesson M&P 15 rifle. From another apartment she rented with Iza, in Dana Point, California, police seized a black-and-yellow Jacob & Co. Godfather watch Iza wore and three Godfather sculptures. Since his arrest, Iza has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown L.A., which holds federal inmates awaiting trial, who can range from white-collar criminals to cartel enforcers. “That's not a knock on the officials who are over there. It's more what the inmates are capable of. At first, a source close to Iza says, he was despondent and felt betrayed by his friends, suspicious that anyone who had ever been close to him had simply been interested in his fortune. But now, after spending roughly a year in jail — much of it in excruciating physical pain due to complications from leg-extension surgery — friends say Iza has reconnected with his family and rediscovered his Muslim faith. “The whole thing is a tragedy,” Sadat says. “You have somebody who clearly is very mentally advanced, who you could maybe even call a genius, extremely young, with the whole world in front of him, potentially millions and millions of dollars, and he took a wrong turn, largely because he surrounded himself with people who did not have his best interest in mind, nor helped push him in a direction that, I think, would have allowed him to use that brain of his for more good than bad, to create a better world. Through Sadat, Iza responded to a series of questions via email in August. He'd lived his “whole life behind a computer,” he said, and rarely left home as a teenager, suggesting his decision to move alone to Los Angeles at the age of 17 might have been avoided had he had a more traditional American upbringing. Sadat says he hopes the judge takes into consideration how young Iza is, just 25, and that he has no prior criminal record as an adult. Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They've always been there but in recent months there have been countless high profile attacks which have potentially huge consequences, including: However, smaller businesses or even those not 'in the spotlight' can't rest easy in the hope hackers won't care about them. In fact, they may even be low hanging fruit. It's clear that 'no one is safe' and those behind these attacks show no signs of slowing down. A representative from the National Crime Agency suggests she has seen incidents double in the last two years to around 35 – 40 per week. Recent research based on a survey of over 200 cybersecurity professionals in the UK whose companies were subject to a ransomware attack between January – March 2025 also shows that the median demand is over £4 million, which could be devastating for small businesses. It's, therefore, unsurprising that the ICO have issued a list of practical steps small businesses should take: Data should be regularly backed up, but you also need to check it has worked/is working as intended. Equally, you'll need to make sure the back up isn't connected to the live data source to ensure that, if there is malicious activity, it won't reach the back up. Always consider strong and unique passwords which would be difficult to guess (e.g. the National Cyber Security Centre recommend picking three random words for passwords). Where you have the option, always consider enabling multifactor authentication (MFA). Although it may be inconvenient waiting for your code to be text/emailed, this second layer of security is always a useful measure to implement. It's important to exercise caution when working out and about. Whether you're on the phone or using a screen when people are around, sending a few extra emails is probably not worth the headache of potentially needing to deal with a security incident. It's always important to ensure you are cautious of suspicious emails. Sometimes it may just be an odd new request, but things like bad grammar, a need to act urgently, and requests for payment are typical signs something may not be real. It's also worth checking email addresses carefully, e.g. a capital 'i' (I) looks near identical to a lower case L (l). However, things like generative AI and spoofing technologies are enabling threat actors to become more sophisticated. Equally, it could appear to come from the sender you know (see, for example, where deepfakes were used to convince someone to transfer $25 million on what they believed were the instructions of the CFO). Whether in an office or working from home/away, you need to ensure your devices are secure. Anti-virus software is a useful tool to protect against malware which may be sent via phishing attacks. If you're going to be away for longer, make sure your screens are in a secure place. Even if you're conscious of your surroundings and locked your screen as recommended while in a cafe, if you're using the public Wi-Fi or an insecure connection you could still be risking personal data. Always make sure you are using a secure connection when connecting to the internet, and if you use the cafe's public network, it's worth also using a secure virtual private network. This also needs to be kept in mind where people leave the business or if they're absent for a long period, as you'll need to suspend their ability to access the systems. Showing someone the wrong thing is hardly new, but it still happens. For example, you may be sharing your screen in a meeting and have tabs or documents which are confidential or include personal data open which can easily be accidentally shown. Equally, make sure notifications are turned off if you're sharing a screen to avoid someone else sending something to you being seen by others. If you're emailing lots of people which could reveal sensitive information about recipients, consider alternatives to BCC'ing them, such as bulk email or mail merge services. It's not uncommon for people to CC rather than BCC people, but in certain contexts this could reveal sensitive, if not special category, personal data (see for example, the charity which was fined by the ICO in 2020 when they CC'd 105 members of an HIV advisory board on an email which meant people could be identified). The ICO do also have guidance on sending bulk communications via email. Don't keep data for longer than you need it Not only does this limit the amount of personal information which is at risk if you are subject to an attack or there is a breach, but it will also free up storage space and is likely cheaper! When someone leaves the business, or they get new equipment, make sure there is no personal data on the devices (whether they are laptops, smartphones, or any device) before they are thrown away. For peace of mind, you may want to consider using deletion software or engaging a specialist to wipe any data. The ICO is clear that "[m]ost small businesses hold personal information and conduct business digitally, so cyber security must be a priority". Ian Hulme (Executive Director for Regulatory Supervision at the ICO) also added that "[w]hile cyber attacks can be very sophisticated, we find that many organisations are still neglecting the very foundations of cyber security". Of course, all types of organisations need to ensure their systems are resilient against complex attacks, and they are able to meet their security obligations under data protection law. Equally, no system is infallible and it's not uncommon, for example, for cyber criminals to simply buy their way in by 'paying off' an employee. It may also be worthwhile considering obtaining insurance to cover the costs of a cyberattack (although you'll still need to have a good standard of security in place to ensure you don't void any such insurance). Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Echo, a crowdfunding platform whose first fundraising project was Ethena, has been acquired by Coinbase after operating for less than two years. Major US cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has acquired Echo, a platform that allows communities to raise capital targeting early-stage projects and startups. Coinbase struck a $375 million deal to acquire Echo, a crowdfunding platform founded by crypto trader Jordan Fish, known in the community as Cobie, the company announced on Tuesday. The acquisition came the day after Coinbase sent $25 million in USDC (USDC) to Cobie's wallet to acquire and burn a non-fungible token (NFT) and revive his UpOnly podcast. “I certainly didn't think Echo would be sold to Coinbase, but here we are: Today Coinbase bought Echo for about $375 million,” Cobie wrote on X. In May, Echo introduced Sonar, a software product allowing founders to self-host public token sales on their own terms and preferred blockchains such as Hyperliquid, Base, Solana or Cardano. Following Coinbase's acquisition, Echo will remain a “standalone platform under its current brand for now,” Cobie said in an X post on Tuesday, adding that the Sonar product will be integrated into Coinbase. “Integrating Echo's tools will help us enable more direct community participation, joining projects with capital, entirely onchain,” Coinbase said, adding: According to a Thursday report by Tiger Research, public sales have been increasingly re-emerging in new forms, with launchpads like Legion, Buidlpad, Sonar and Kaito leading the trend. “The ICO boom peaked in 2017 but rapidly contracted as it lost credibility due to fraud and opaque information,” Tiger Research said, adding that the market subsequently shifted to private sales. They serve as a tool for projects to secure early users and liquidity,” the report concluded. Related: Coinbase CEO sets sights on replacing banks with crypto super app While it remains to be seen how the renewed trend of public token sales will unfold, some high-profile figures linked to the Trump administration had called for an ICO revival earlier this year. “We want to make ICOs great again,” Zak Folkman, co-founder of the Trump family's cryptocurrency venture World Liberty Financial, said in February.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Blockchain technology is democratizing space by enabling decentralized ownership and governance, shifting control from traditional institutions to universal participation.Key projects include SpaceCoin building satellite-based blockchain networks (DePIN) and Copernic Space tokenizing real-world space assets and lunar domains.The TON blockchain is pioneering "space democracy" through on-chain voting to select civilian astronauts for Blue Origin flights, making space travel accessible to a global public. From Bitcoin's first space transaction to tokenized lunar domains, blockchain is powering a new decentralized space race that makes access and ownership universal. I dreamed about floating in zero gravity, watching Earth spin beneath me, and maybe one day walking on the moon. While I never made it to space, life came full circle later while at AWS, when I worked with a partner who helped Rover get to Mars. That experience reminded me that there are many ways to explore new frontiers, and today, one of the most exciting isn't through rockets but through code. Blockchain, the technology that started with digital money, is now expanding into orbit. For decades, it was the realm of governments, billionaires, and aerospace giants. Now a quiet revolution is bringing it within reach of everyone. Instead of relying on a few large institutions, decentralized space allows communities, creators, and investors to co-own and co-govern assets such as satellites, payloads, or even lunar missions. It brings transparency and inclusivity to a domain that has long been exclusive, creating an open network where access and ownership extend beyond Earth. It merges space technology with Web3 principles of transparency, inclusivity, and verifiable ownership which creates an open network where anyone can contribute to humanity's journey beyond Earth. The roots of decentralized space trace back to Bitcoin. In 2019, SpaceChain launched its blockchain node into orbit aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Bitcoin just recently hit an All Time High and then went down again, much like rocketships do! It inspired a wave of projects exploring how digital assets and decentralized systems could support future space missions. What began with Bitcoin has now expanded into a full ecosystem, where tokens, domains, and smart contracts connect people to space in ways never before possible. Together, they show how the future of space can be shared by many. In a recent test, SpaceCoin successfully transmitted data between continents through satellite link alone. This idea belongs to a new category called Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks, or DePIN. These projects use blockchain to power real-world infrastructure rather than purely digital systems. SpaceCoin's network could serve remote regions, censored areas, and space-based devices that need secure communication without dependence on terrestrial internet. In chatting with Taekyung Oh, Founder and CEO of SpaceCoin, at Token 2049, he told me that “Space is the ultimate decentralized frontier. With DePIN, we are turning satellites into nodes of a global network where connectivity, computation, and coordination happen beyond borders and even beyond Earth.” If blockchain can operate from orbit, transactions, identities, and governance systems become independent of Earth's limitations. A space-based blockchain could enable global connectivity, resilient to censorship or natural disasters, and ready for the era of interplanetary communication. Connecting real-world space assets to global capital markets through blockchain technology, the company is pioneering the tokenization of missions, payloads, and even digital identities to transform how space assets are represented, financed, and traded. And recently, in collaboration with Unstoppable Domains (my employer), Copernic launched the .LUNAR domain extension, the first domain to be tied to real space missions. Each .LUNAR badge will be sent to the Moon on a scheduled mission in 2026-2027. That makes every domain a tokenized real-world asset linked to space. Owning one means holding a verified piece of digital identity that will literally travel beyond Earth.Copernic Space has already demonstrated how this model works in practice. Its already commercialized rockets and its first Moon Mission earlier this year sold out with over 2,000 tokenized payloads of individuals and companies landing on the Moon, generating revenue and delivering returns to early participants. For the first time, people everywhere can own a small but meaningful stake of what happens beyond Earth. By combining blockchain with space missions and ventures, we are creating a transparent, participatory ecosystem where the next great discoveries belong to everyone, not just a few institutions.” Copernic describes itself as a marketplace for buying, selling, and investing in tokenized space ventures. The idea is to turn space into an open and accessible market that anyone can take part in. By allowing fractional ownership of real missions and infrastructure, Copernic Space makes participation in the space economy more transparent, liquid, and inclusive. While regulations around space ownership are still evolving, the shift is already underway. For the first time, space is becoming a market that belongs to everyone, not just governments and large corporations. While SpaceCoin builds infrastructure and Copernic focuses on assets, TON is opening direct access to space. This program uses blockchain to select real civilian astronauts for a Blue Origin flight through an on-chain voting system. SERA has secured six seats on the upcoming New Shepard mission, planned for 2026. Five are reserved for citizens from underrepresented countries such as India, Nigeria, Brazil, Thailand, and Indonesia. Participants use the TON wallet integrated in Telegram to earn points and cast votes. Every vote is recorded on-chain for transparency and fairness. "SERA isn't another crypto project launch, it's truly a one-of-a-kind initiative. It feels more like an experiment in what happens when crypto collides with an experience-driven, participatory culture," said Max Crown, President and CEO of TON Foundation. I've always believed that people don't connect with how tech works. We're not talking about using tech to change lives. This is the moment blockchain shifts from just being technology to becoming an experience." Instead of government committees or corporate sponsors, access is being opened to a global audience. TON calls it “space democracy,” where users earn their chance to go to space by participating in a transparent, tokenized process. It demonstrates how blockchain can extend inclusion from financial systems to space exploration. Questions about who governs tokenized lunar assets or how liability works in orbit have no clear answers. Technical hurdles such as satellite lifespan, launch cost, and communication latency will test every innovation. Market adoption also depends on proving real utility beyond hype. Space must not become another venue for inequality or exploitation. If blockchain opens space participation, it must do so fairly and sustainably. The emerging industry will need to balance ambition with responsibility. This matters because it signals a shift in power and possibility. The gap between cyberspace and outer space is closing. The blockchain and bitcoin revolution has officially left Earth's orbit.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fadeev began running London-based crypto hedge fund Fasanara Digital aged 25 in 2021. He's now nearly four years older and is no longer a candidate for the Forbes 30 under 30 list. But he's still a person to be watched. They include recent joiners with histories at big industry names. For example, Conor White, who was head of technology for Citadel in Europe and Asia between 2005 and 2018, joined Fadeev's team last month as head of front office technology. Jerome Busca, a former portfolio manager at Millennium, joined in April. We understand that a mystery head of high frequency trading has also joined recently from Tower Research. The focus will be DeFi "with a few key hires in hunting out market neutral yield and building on-chain automation." This is because, "protocols have shown themselves to be robust in the face of CEX volatility." Fadeev has a reputation for working long hours and trading every day of the week. Last time we spoke to him, aged 29 and employing 15 people, he'd stayed up all night before the US election and traded all weekend. It's not clear whether this was repeated on October 10th, when crypto crashed, but Fadeev said Fasanara Digital's systems "performed well through the volatility" and that it was the fund's highest volume day to date. Events like that simply help flush excess leverage out of the system, he added. Have a confidential story, tip, or comment you'd like to share?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Modern consumers expect instant, secure, and compliant access to their money-whether in traditional currencies or cryptocurrencies. That's where white-label crypto banking software comes in: it provides the core technology, infrastructure, and compliance tools needed to operate a crypto-focused bank efficiently and safely. A crypto bank is a financial institution or digital platform that merges traditional banking functions-such as deposits, transfers, and card payments-with cryptocurrency services like buying, selling, and storing digital assets. Unlike regular banks, crypto banks allow customers to manage both fiat and crypto funds within one account, offering greater flexibility and financial control. Essentially, it's a technological foundation that lets businesses focus on branding, licensing, and customer acquisition instead of building a complex banking core from the ground up. Users can store, send, and convert assets instantly through built-in exchange modules. Linked debit or prepaid cards enable customers to spend crypto directly, with automatic conversion to fiat at the point of sale. Advanced systems may include staking or DeFi integrations, allowing customers to earn rewards or access lending products directly through the platform. Building a crypto bank from scratch gives total autonomy but demands years of development and major financial investment. A white-label solution provides the same functionality much faster, with built-in compliance and security, enabling fintech companies and banks to focus on growth rather than infrastructure. The white-label crypto banking market is expanding quickly as fintechs, EMIs, and established financial institutions look to integrate digital assets into their offerings. Below are five notable providers delivering reliable, ready-to-launch crypto banking infrastructure. SDK.finance delivers a full-scale digital and crypto banking platform for launching multi-asset financial products. Available as SaaS or under a source code licence, providing enterprises with full ownership, scalability, and secure deployment across cloud or on-premise environments. 4IRE Labs provides modular blockchain-based infrastructure for building crypto banks, including crypto-fiat gateways, compliance tools, and mobile apps. Known for its strong DeFi integration and fast time to market. Antier Solutions offers comprehensive white-label crypto banking platforms with wallet management, trading, staking, and NFT features. SoluLab delivers end-to-end crypto banking systems that include KYC/AML verification, card issuing, custodial wallets, and lending tools. The company is recognised for flexible deployment options and quick implementation. Crassula, a European provider, offers multi-currency accounts, IBAN support, and crypto payment features. Crassula's platform combines traditional digital banking with crypto management tools through open APIs. The boundary between traditional finance and blockchain is fading. White-label crypto bank platforms are at the heart of this transition, helping institutions launch secure, compliant, and global services faster. As regulation matures and public trust in digital assets grows, hybrid banks – managing both fiat and crypto in one account – will become the new standard for financial innovation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This diversity could either reinforce the dollar's global reach or usher in a more multipolar financial era. One striking example of how fast the space is changing is USD1—a politically branded U.S. dollar stablecoin launched in 2025, which has quickly become the fifth largest globally, reaching a market capitalization of $2.68 billion. Its success underlines how stablecoins are no longer crypto curiosities but serious tools in the global monetary system. In countries with volatile currencies, stablecoins now serve as digital lifelines, offering price stability and seamless access to global liquidity. “Every USDT, USDC, or on-chain USD transaction is another line of code binding the world to the greenback,” said Sid Sridhar, founder of Bima Labs. Wilfred Daye, CSO for Mercurity Fintech Holding Inc, and the CEO for Chaince Securities, LLC, observes that this trend is drawing traditional finance closer to crypto: “Banks and payment providers are turning stablecoins into a regulated payments infrastructure. Stablecoins are rapidly evolving from crypto instruments to mainstream financial infrastructure, signaling a long-term shift in global payment systems. Over 95% of circulating stablecoins are pegged to the dollar, embedding USD rails across crypto, fintech, and cross-border settlement. Daye describes this situation as “dominance with a new plumbing risk” where stablecoins extend the dollar's reach but introduce technical vulnerabilities, such as the potential market impact if issuers must rapidly liquidate U.S. Treasuries to meet redemptions. Sridhar echoes this sentiment, arguing that stablecoins amplify rather than weaken U.S. power: By halting plans for a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC), Trump may have indirectly accelerated stablecoin adoption. In essence, the U.S. appears to be betting on stablecoins, not CBDCs, as its digital money standard. GENIUS Act—enacted earlier in July 2025—was the first major legislative framework for stablecoins, requiring issuers to maintain 1:1 backing with cash or Treasury assets, undergo audits, and operate under federal oversight. By establishing clear guardrails, the U.S. positioned itself as a global leader in stablecoin regulation. The GENIUS Act has since influenced countries worldwide to revisit their approaches. China is reportedly exploring yuan-backed stablecoins to promote international use of the renminbi, while South Korea is drafting laws to permit won-based stablecoins. In Hong Kong, Standard Chartered, HKT, and Animoca Brands are seeking licenses for a Hong Kong dollar-backed stablecoin, and across Europe, the MiCA regime has set the stage for euro-denominated tokens. Still, as Sridhar warns, “Law alone is not liquidity.” For euro-based stablecoins to gain meaningful market share, banks must issue them at scale, and regulators must actively cultivate use cases across payments, trade, and remittances. Whether stablecoins strengthen or dilute U.S. monetary dominance depends on how institutions and policymakers navigate the next phase. “If the big acquirers and gateways add stablecoins at checkout or for B2B payouts, that's when they go from niche to mainstream.” Sridhar agrees but frames it as an evolution of money itself: With them, they are the operating system of global finance.” Stablecoins may not overthrow the dollar, but they are redefining how it moves. What lies ahead is not a battle over who issues money, but who programs it—and whether the future's financial rails remain unified or fragment into competing digital ecosystems. GENIUS Act setting the pace for worldwide adoption and compliance.</p>
