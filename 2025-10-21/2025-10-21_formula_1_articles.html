Fernando Alonso joked about his relief that the United States Grand Prix weekend lasted only three days, after Aston Martin slid gradually down the order across each day of running. He was unable to show his pace in the Saturday Sprint after involved in a collision at the first corner, and was then 10th in Qualifying for the Grand Prix itself – which is also where he finished on race day. If not, on Monday we would be even worse! “We need to understand why and we need to build the momentum in the last five races step-by-step and arrive in a strong position for Sunday.” He added: “It was good to score one point, obviously, but I don't know... we didn't have the pace. “We need to find a little pace for Mexico." Neither Aston Martin driver saw the chequered flag in the weekend's Sprint, with Alonso involved in the opening lap mayhem that also saw both McLaren drivers retire, while Lance Stroll crashed into Esteban Ocon while attempting a bold overtaking move at Turn 1 late in the race. Of his more successful Sunday outing, in which he made up a host of places to finish 12th – Stroll said: “It was a fun race, attacking all race, and some good overtakes, so that was fun. “We made our way through and picked up some positions.</p>

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Max outmuscles the McLarens in Austin

Iconic Mika Hakkinen onboards 

Mark Hughes and illustrator Giorgio Piola explain how Red Bull have been able to come back fighting with their RB21 at recent Grands Prix.

Max Verstappen's United States Grand Prix victory was his third in four weekends. In the five races since the summer break he has not finished outside the top two, and his championship hopes – which looked to be all over – suddenly have new life. So how have Red Bull done it?

The RB21 has come alive in the second half of the season, with a series of updates based around a new front wing and new underfloor.

The front wing, with its generous flap area, is believed to have been made more aero-elastic than the previous one while still respecting the revised static load test limits in place since the Spanish Grand Prix in May.
