The Department of Homeland Security has signed a $172 million contract to buy two top-of-the-line private jets for use by Secretary Kristi Noem and other leaders, reports say, amid a lengthy government shutdown threatening crucial services for everyday Americans. Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout. The jets are slated to be used by Noem, who has faced scrutiny for her frequent use of Coast Guard resources, and other top DHS officials, the agency said in a statement on the purchase. “These aircraft are required to provide official travel for the secretary of homeland security, deputy secretary homeland security, commandant of the Coast Guard, vice commandant and Atlantic and Pacific commanders as specified by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Department of Homeland Security policy,” the agency wrote. The NYT wants our leaders to be incapable of responding to national emergencies while in the air, leaving DHS to be without leadership anytime the secretary is airborne,” DHS's account wrote. Democrats have sharply criticized the purchase, which comes amid one of the longest government shutdowns in history, which has left thousands of federal employees in limbo and is threatening to take away food benefits for millions of women and children. Washington Republicans want to spend $0 on making health care affordable, but they support:– $200M for Trump's ballroom– $172M for Kristi Noem's private jet– $51M in taxpayer-funded political ads– $10M to promote Trump's Scotland golf course Because Noem has reportedly implemented a much criticized policy that she must personally approve any purchase, contract, or grant over $100,000, Noem has presumably personally signed off on the jet purchase. However, the updated purchase well exceeds that figure. The department has said that the purchase is necessary to ensure equipment is up-to-date, but the Coast Guard has a wide variety of equipment not related to Noem's travel that needs replacing, as critics have noted. She has also faced scrutiny for reports that she is living rent-free in a large, waterfront home that's typically not used by the homeland security secretary, but rather by the Coast Guard's top admiral. Typically, if Cabinet secretaries live in military housing, they pay rent, reports say. Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Maine Democratic Senate candidate Graham Platner attempted to get ahead of potential opposition research by disclosing and explaining a skull-and-crossbones tattoo he has on his chest that resembles Nazi imagery, along with an embarrassing personal video. He said that he wanted to address the issues himself before opponents could weaponize them, saying there isn't anything “worse” or “different” than his problematic Reddit posts that have come back to bite his campaign in recent days, and insisting that he had no knowledge of the imagery's historical associations. When reached for comment, Platner said: “I absolutely would not have gone through life having this on my chest if I knew that” the tattoo resembled a Nazi symbol. He emphasized in the interview that he was “not a secret Nazi” and pointed to his Reddit comment history as evidence of his opposition to Nazism, antisemitism and racism. “I would say a lifelong opponent,” he stated. The US military already has a policy that checks for extremist, racist and sexist tattoos, and Platner added that the Nazi connection never came up during security screenings, including when he joined the army national guard after his marine service and later for the state department when he worked as security detail for the US ambassador to Afghanistan. The disclosures come as Platner's insurgent campaign faced newfound scrutiny. On Friday, he issued a video apology for inflammatory Reddit posts spanning 2013 to 2021, which included calling police officers “bastards”, questioning why Black people tip less, and appearing to agree with characterizations of rural white voters as “racist” and “stupid”. His former political director, Genevieve McDonald, a former state representative who resigned on Friday over the Reddit comments, remained very skeptical about Platner's explanation of the tattoo. “Platner prides himself on his extensive knowledge of military history,” McDonald said. Platner has emerged as a significant figure in a competitive Senate race to flip Maine, drawing hundreds to town halls and raising nearly $4m while positioning himself as critical of the Democratic establishment, including the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, who he said he would not support.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian forces carried out a large-scale attack involving Storm Shadow missiles against Russia on Oct. 21, striking the Bryansk Chemical plant, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported. The Bryansk Chemical Plant produces gunpowder, explosives, and rocket fuel components, which Russia uses in ammunition and missiles launched against Ukraine. The plant has been targeted in previous strikes, some of which reportedly involved long-range ATACMS missiles. Equipped with advanced navigation systems, they are designed to fly close to terrain at high speeds, enhancing their effectiveness in striking critical targets. Ukraine has previously used Storm Shadows to strike targets in Russia's Bryansk and Kursk oblasts, as well as in Russian-occupied Crimea. Zelensky had hoped to win a promise of long-range Tomahawk missiles for Ukraine during his Oct. 17 meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump. Instead, Trump said he wanted to avoid escalation with Russia and said he planned to hold a bilateral summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. U.S. officials said on Oct. 21 that there were no plans for Putin and Trump to meet in the near future. "Russia continues to do everything to weasel out of diplomacy — and as soon as the issue of long-range capabilities for us — for Ukraine — became less immediate, Russia's interest in diplomacy faded almost automatically," Zelensky said on Oct. 21. "This signals that this very issue — the issue of our deep strike capabilities — may hold the indispensable key to peace." Abbey Fenbert is a senior news editor at the Kyiv Independent. She is a freelance writer, editor, and playwright with an MFA from Boston University. Abbey served as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Ukraine from 2008-2011. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also do not plan to meet in person in the near future, though they held a "productive" call on Oct. 20, a State Department spokesperson told the Kyiv Independent. The former head of Ukraine's state-owned grid operator Ukrenergo, Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, says his opponents were likely behind a law enforcement raid on his home on Oct. 21, in a phone call with the Kyiv Independent. Maria Lvova-Belova openly said around 20,000 Ukrainian children have been taken by Russia, Explosions took place at the Petrotel-Lukoil refinery in Ploiești, southern Romania, as well as at Hungary's largest oil refinery in Szazhalombatta.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pictures of East Wing demolition shared online were taken from adjacent Treasury Building The Trump administration has ordered government employees not to take or share photographs of construction work happening at the White House. Pictures of the building's East Wing being torn apart, apparently taken from the adjacent Treasury Department building, were shared online widely on Tuesday. “As construction proceeds on the White House grounds, employees should refrain from taking and sharing photographs of the grounds, to include the East Wing, without prior approval from the Office of Public Affairs,” a Treasury official said in an email to staff on Monday, according to The Wall Street Journal. “I am pleased to announce that ground has been broken on the White House grounds to build the new, big, beautiful White House ballroom,” Mr Trump posted on his Truth Social social media platform on Monday. He added: “Completely separate from the White House itself, the East Wing is being fully modernised as part of this process, and will be more beautiful than ever when it is complete.” For 150 years they've wanted a ballroom,” Mr Trump told a lunch for Republican Senators at the White House as the sounds of machinery could be heard in the background. Mr Trump, who made his fortune in construction and real-estate, added: “When I hear that sound, it reminds me of money. Karoline Leavitt, Mr Trump's press secretary, responded to critics of the project on Monday by sharing examples of former presidents' White House renovations. Among the building work listed was Theodore Roosevelt's building of the West Wing in 1902 and Harry Truman's extensive White House renovations in 1948. “Construction has always been a part of the evolution of the White House,” Steven Cheung, White House communications director, wrote on X. Otherwise you're just living in the past.” Its chairman, Will Scharf, is also the White House staff secretary and a top aide to Mr Trump. Mr Trump has already carried out extensive redecoration of the White House since returning to office. He has covered the Oval Office in gold ornaments and fittings which mimic the style of decor at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. He also paved over the grass in Jackie Kennedy's Rose Garden, saying his female guests' high heels were sinking into the lawn. “It will be near but not touching [the East Wing] – and pays total respect to the existing building,” Mr Trump said. The new ballroom will have space for around 1,000 and will be completed before Mr Trump's second term ends in January 2029 at an estimated cost of $200m (£150m). Earlier this year, the US president spoke fondly of his renovation plans when he met Ursula von der Leyen, the European Council president, at his ornate Trump Turnberry resort in Scotland to hammer out details of a trade deal. “You know, we just built this ballroom and we're building a great ballroom at the White House,” Mr Trump said. “No president knew how to build a ballroom I could take this one, drop it right down there, and it would be beautiful.” Melania Trump's staff packed their belongings and cleared their desks in September before the demolition, the New York Times reported. A Treasury spokesman told The Telegraph: “Carelessly shared photographs of the White House complex during this process could potentially reveal sensitive items, including security features or confidential structural details.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Two coffins of deceased hostages, escorted by IDF (Israel Defense Forces) troops, crossed the border into the State of Israel a short while ago and are on their way to the National Institute for Forensic Medicine, where identification procedures will be carried out,” according to a statement from the IDF and Israel Security Agency (ISA). Israel's Ministry of Health confirmed later that the bodies had arrived at the institute, where teams were working “as quickly as possible” to identify the bodies and investigate their causes of death. If their identities are confirmed, they will be the 14th and 15th deceased hostages to be transferred to Israel since the US-proposed ceasefire deal was signed on October 9. Hamas' armed wing, Al-Qassam Brigades, said earlier Tuesday that the transfer of two hostage bodies was scheduled to take place. Before Tuesday's announcement, Hamas had returned 13 of the 28 bodies of deceased hostages agreed to be released in line with the ceasefire agreement with Israel, the latest of which was identified on Monday as Sergeant Major Tal Haimi. All 13 of those bodies have now been formally identified. Vance downplays concerns over ceasefire in visit to Israel as Trump administration officials privately worry Israeli intelligence has assessed that Hamas may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza. Hamas has said “significant efforts and special equipment” are needed to recover the bodies in Gaza. One of the bodies handed over by Hamas under the agreement last week did not belong to an Israeli hostage, according to the Israeli military. The latest hostage release is underway hours after US Vice President JD Vance touched down in Israel and the Trump administration moves to implement the next phase of its ceasefire plan. Over the weekend, Israel and Hamas affirmed their commitment to the ceasefire deal after Israel accused Hamas of carrying out an attack that killed two IDF soldiers, prompting waves of airstrikes. Vance on Tuesday downplayed concerns about the fragility of the ceasefire between the two warring parties but declined to put a timeline on the return of all deceased hostages and Hamas' complete disarmament. “It is a focus of everybody here to get those bodies back home to their families, so that they can have a proper burial. This is not going to happen overnight,” Vance said at a press conference in Israel. Some of the hostages, nobody even knows where they are. This is a developing story and will be updated.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian President Vladimir Putin has "won certain property" during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and should be expected to take Ukrainian territory as part of a peace deal, U.S. President Donald Trump said in an interview with Fox News that aired Oct. 19. The interview was taped a few days earlier, directly following his phone conversation with Putin on Oct. 16. The call came ahead of Trump's White House meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky — talks that ended in disappointment for the Ukrainian delegation, with no promise of Tomahawk missiles. But in comments to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo, who asked whether Putin would accept a peace deal without territorial concessions, Trump was cavalier about the loss of Ukrainian lands. "I mean, they fought and uh, he has a lot of property. Trump made no mention of Ukraine's sovereignty or international law, taking it as a given that an invading force has a right to "property" it seizes through strength of arms. "You know like we did under President Bush in the Middle East. Following his meeting with Zelensky, Trump echoed these sentiments on social media, writing that Ukraine and Russia should make a peace deal "with property lines being defined by war and guts." In an interview with NBC after his talks with Trump, Zelensky said he took this to mean Ukraine and Russia could freeze the war along the current line of contact, but that Kyiv is not interesting in surrendering "additional" territory to Putin. "We will give nothing to the aggressor," Zelensky later said in his nightly address on Oct. 19. Putin told Trump he was willing to give up parts of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia and Kherson oblasts, both partially occupied by Russian forces, in exchange for the entirety of Donetsk, the Washington Post reported on Oct. 18, citing two senior U.S. officials. The Financial Times (FT) later reported that Trump pushed Zelensky to accept these terms during their meeting. "If (Putin) wants it, he will destroy you," Trump reportedly told Zelensky. Trump also said the Russian economy is "doing great." According to the official, Trump also grew frustrated with Ukraine's battlefield map and tossed it aside, saying he was "sick" of seeing these maps. Reuters reported later on Oct. 19, citing its sources, that Trump suggested providing security guarantees to both warring parties, leaving the Ukrainian delegation taken aback. Later in the evening on Oct. 20 while answering reporter questions on Air Force One, Trump denied telling Zelensky Ukraine would need to cede the Donbas in order to secure a ceasefire. "I think 78% of the land is already taken by Russia. They can negotiate something down the line," Trump added. Putin's latest proposal marks a shift from his earlier position in April, when he insisted that any peace deal must grant Russia full control over Crimea plus the full four regions that are partially occupied now: Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson. While a small concession, it would require Ukraine to hand over territory that Russia has failed to seize after years of fighting despite significant advantages in manpower and military equipment. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Oct. 19 that Ukraine should not be pressured to give up its territory. "We should all put pressure on Russia to stop its aggression. On Oct. 20, U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said that Congress was "hitting the pause button," on a Senate bill that proposes to impose tariffs of up to 500% on countries that buy Russian oil, amid Trump's planned meeting with Putin. Maria Lvova-Belova openly said around 20,000 Ukrainian children have been taken by Russia, Explosions took place at the Petrotel-Lukoil refinery in Ploiești, southern Romania, as well as at Hungary's largest oil refinery in Szazhalombatta.

"I cannot guarantee that an independent Polish court won't order the government to escort such an aircraft down to hand (Putin) over to the court in The Hague," Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said. "According to the military, a massive air attack was repelled last night," Rostov Oblast Governor Yuriy Slyusar said in a social media post.</p>

Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size. The new filings came as part of a legal fight between the administration and federal worker unions, which took emergency action earlier this month to stop the latest wave of terminations. While the unions secured a victory last week in the form of a temporary restraining order against the new firings, the conservative-dominated US Supreme Court has repeatedly proven willing to permit large-scale job cuts that labor unions and legal experts say are patently illegal and dangerous. Tara Zuardo, a senior campaigner at the Center for Biological Diversity, said Monday that the newly revealed administration push to terminate dozens of staffers at the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) is “really sad and troubling.” The court filings show that the administration has proposed eliminating positions at the FWS Migratory Birds Program, Office of Conservation Investment, Fish and Aquatic Conservation, National Wildlife Refuge System, and other areas. It's incredibly cynical to cut programs that help struggling fish and other aquatic animals and assist landowners in conserving endangered species habitats.” More than 150,000 Americans used the public comment process to express opposition to the Trump administration's plan. The Center for Biological Diversity said Monday that the proposed mass elimination of jobs at FWS would “deliver devastating blows to programs put in place to protect, restore, and conserve bird populations and their habitats.” “Court disclosures also report severe cuts to additional agencies including the Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, Office of the Secretary, U.S. Geological Survey, and others,” the group noted. Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ingrassia, Trump's pick to lead the office of special counsel, allegedly described himself as having ‘a Nazi streak' Donald Trump's nomination of a conservative attorney and commentator to oversee federal whistleblower protections appeared to be collapsing after his racist text messages surfaced this week and the Republican Senate leader suggested the White House should withdraw the pick. But the fans were flamed again on Monday after Politico reported text messages in which Ingrassia allegedly described himself as having “a Nazi streak” and suggested Martin Luther King Jr Day should be “tossed into the seventh circle of hell”. “I don't plan on voting for him,” Scott told reporters. “I can't imagine how anybody can be antisemitic in this country”. Democrats are expected to vote unanimously against the confirmation. He labeled them as “self-deprecating” and “satirical humor”, adding that his client is “the furthest thing from a Nazi”. The office of special counsel protects federal employees from retaliation for whistleblowing. While the position can't prosecute crimes, it can pursue disciplinary action against federal workers. Joni Ernst, a senator from Iowa, stopped short of outright opposition but said the nominee faces an “uphill battle”. When asked about her biggest concerns, she replied: “Where do I start?” “They have to decide if he can go through,” Paul said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Talk to any gold bug long enough, and eventually you'll hear the same indignant lament: The Bank of Canada was foolish to sell off its gold holdings over the years, leaving it as the only G7 country without any of the shiny metal in its reserves. The staggering surge in bullion prices—gold topped US$3,815 per ounce in late September, up more than 40% over the past year and double where it was five years ago—has only reinforced that sentiment. Indeed, if the Bank of Canada still held the same amount of gold it did in 1965—around 32.9 million ounces—that stash would now effectively equal the value of all of Canada's international reserves, at roughly US$125.5 billion. By the mid-1990s, roughly 90% of the 1965 gold hoard was gone, replaced with more liquid foreign currency deposits and interest-bearing bonds. “I know this will drive the gold bugs crazy, but gold isn't necessary to conduct modern monetary policy,” says Ian Lee, an associate professor at Carleton University's Sprott School of Business. Yes, the 1965 gold holdings would be worth a lot of money, he says, “but the government's job is not to maximize asset prices.” Here, too, Lee says such fears are overblown. “When you look at the totality of the foreign reserve market, there is no other currency that could replace the U.S. dollar,” he says. We're not going back to the gold standard, Lee adds. © Copyright 2025 The Globe and Mail Inc. All rights reserved.</p>

MOSCOW, October 21. /TASS/. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused Poland of being prepared to carry out terrorist acts.

"The Poles are now ready to commit terrorist acts themselves," Lavrov said following talks with his Ethiopian counterpart, Gedion Timotheos.

"I have recently heard that Mr. [Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw] Sikorski threatened that the security of [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's plane would not be guaranteed in Polish airspace if he flew to Budapest for the proposed summit with [US President Donald] Trump," Lavrov added, explaining his remark.

"So Poland has issued an official court decision that essentially justifies the terrorist attack on Nord Stream, and now the foreign minister is saying that if the Polish court demands it, they will block the free movement of the Russian leader's plane," the foreign minister stated.

He also noted that "right now, [Vladimir] Zelensky and his team are still being provoked by the Poles, who have in fact justified this terrorist act, the attacks on Nord Stream." In his view, "these cases are quite revealing."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The meeting between Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, which had been in the works for the past few days, has been postponed indefinitely, CNN reported, citing its sources in the White House. However, CNN noted that it is unclear why the meeting will not take place this week. On Monday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said that no agreement had been reached on the time and place of the meeting between the two countries' top diplomats, and that everything was still under consideration. In addition, CNN stated that the impact of postponing their meeting indefinitely on the talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart Donald Trump in Budapest is still unclear. After a telephone conversation between the top diplomats, CNN noted that US officials concluded Russia's position on Ukraine had not changed. At this point, Rubio is unlikely to recommend that Putin and Trump meet next week. However, he and Lavrov may speak by phone again this week. The Russian Foreign Ministry previously stated that Lavrov and Rubio discussed potential concrete steps to implement the understandings reached during Putin's October 16 telephone conversation with Trump. Following his conversation with Putin, Trump said they had agreed to meet soon in Budapest. Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov noted that Moscow and Washington would immediately begin preparations for a new meeting between the leaders, which could be held in the Hungarian capital.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. The United States' lead in artificial intelligence might seem unassailable. U.S. companies—Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, and xAI—are out in front across almost all assessments of the technology's general capabilities. American AI models are outperforming doctorate-level scientists on challenging questions in physics, chemistry, and biology. This approach is quite different from those that ushered in past breakthrough technologies. Nuclear weapons and power, space travel, stealth systems, personal computing, and the Internet emerged either directly from U.S. government efforts or on the back of significant public funding. But scaling up AI has been essentially a private-sector activity. To avoid that outcome, Washington will need to embrace new ways of advancing AI development, ones that demand much tighter mutual support between the private sector and the state. Further progress now depends on resources and capabilities that only the government can provide or facilitate: the energy to power ever-larger data centers, a pipeline of international talent, and effective defenses against sophisticated foreign espionage efforts. Past revolutionary technologies, such as nuclear weapons and space flight, did not have immediate commercial applications. But the business case for modern AI is already highly compelling. AI firms have found huge user demand, resulting in skyrocketing revenues, and they have promised to automate myriad valuable tasks, such as coding. As a result, capital markets are funding AI projects at scales that would historically have required government resources. The sufficiency of private-sector capital in enabling AI advances is wonderful for taxpayers, but the limits of this approach are becoming apparent. The vast fleets of computer chips needed to develop and use today's AI require extraordinary amounts of energy, so U.S. companies will need more power to fuel the data centers they plan to build in the coming years. An analysis by Anthropic estimated that the United States will need to produce 50 gigawatts of new power just for AI by 2028—roughly equivalent to what the entire country of Argentina uses today. (One of us, Buchanan, advises AI and cybersecurity companies, including Anthropic.) By then, data centers could consume up to 12 percent of American electricity production. Amazon's CEO, Andy Jassy, for example, has labeled power the “single biggest constraint” to AI progress. And building this level of new infrastructure will require government help. After U.S. President Joe Biden took office, in 2021, and passed a law subsidizing the construction of clean energy infrastructure, the country added more than 100 gigawatts in new capacity. In the last days of his term, he signed an executive order specifically aimed at further expediting the AI and clean energy build-out. He signed an executive order to accelerate federal permitting for data centers, but implementation remains nascent. Worse yet, his signature “One Big Beautiful Bill,” passed in July, and other executive actions gutted key parts of Biden's energy expansion efforts, such as vital transmission projects. An area that could have been a bipartisan success fell prey to politics and has now become a major concern for business and AI competitiveness. Executed well, an AI-fueled energy boom would have benefits far beyond AI development itself. These massive investments can accelerate the domestic development of better energy sources, many of which have bipartisan appeal, such as advanced geothermal power and next-generation nuclear facilities. If the United States does not construct more energy capacity, however, American AI firms will feel pressure to outsource the development of strategically critical facilities—likely to oil-rich regions such as the Gulf that run on dirtier fuel. For Washington, any prospect of offshoring AI should set off alarm bells. An American company shifting advanced AI training to a foreign country, especially an autocratic one, would pose huge risks as AI begins to power more of the U.S. economy and to play an integral role in defense. A failure to build domestic energy capacity would thus echo outsourcing mistakes of past decades in other important industries, such as semiconductors, in which the United States is now dependent on foreign suppliers. These restrictions impose huge delays in interconnection (the process of connecting a new power source or data center to the grid) and require years-long environmental assessments. On top of federal and utility hurdles, state and local policies can be cumbersome, especially for projects that cross multiple states, such as transmission lines. AI progress depends as much on talented people as it does on technology and computing power, which is why the Biden administration acted aggressively to enable people of extraordinary technical ability to come to the United States from all over the world. Here, too, Trump has sometimes said the right things but always fallen short in practice. During his 2024 presidential campaign, he declared that when foreign students graduate from U.S. colleges, they should “automatically” get a green card. Instead, under his leadership, the United States has begun shutting itself off to foreign workers and students, intimidating even those who have visas and are in the country legally. In September, the administration even said it would slap a $100,000 fee on applications for H1-B visas—the visas most commonly given to high-skilled immigrants. For example, preliminary research by NAFSA, a nonprofit association of international educators, suggests that in 2025, American universities will suffer a 30 to 40 percent reduction in international enrollment. If Washington cuts itself off from foreign-born scientists or sends them back home, the consequences will be catastrophic. Sixty-five percent of leading U.S.-based AI companies, as ranked by Forbes, have at least one immigrant co-founder. Historically, the vast majority of these students have stayed, often making critical contributions to American industry and academia. But thanks to Trump's policies, many of today's students might instead return home. Protecting American AI leadership is not just a matter of pride. It is essential to U.S. national security and economic competitiveness. China has been making strides in AI development, and although none of its firms can yet match the best American ones, they do not lack for technical talent. China faces one devastating disadvantage in this competition: its inability to make large quantities of advanced AI chips, a weakness exacerbated by U.S. export controls that began in the first Trump term and that Biden greatly expanded. But after heavy lobbying by industry, the second Trump administration has started dismantling this area of bipartisan consensus. In July, for example, it reversed its April decision to cut China off from newer AI chips, and the president indicated plans to undo other Biden-era controls, as well. Such moves will almost certainly accelerate Chinese AI development. Beijing has acted decisively to ensure that, if it gains access to such chips, the rest of its AI ecosystem will supplant the United States'. AI systems like these have broad utility to military and intelligence agencies: they can support weapons development, cyber-operations, and domestic surveillance, among other tasks. In exchange, the Chinese government has provided technology firms with extensive policy and security support. Historically, this assistance has included defense services and passing along industrial secrets stolen from American businesses. Losing AI leadership to China would also cause tremendous global harm. Today, consumers across the world benefit from the rigor and transparency of U.S. regulations and standard setting, often developed in concert with other democracies, in many technological domains. For example, new technologies such as electric vehicle charging have required global collaboration on standards. AI will require similar partnerships, and it is in Washington's interest to take the lead. Otherwise, there is a risk that autocracies will unilaterally set the standards. If Washington cannot establish more and better relations with its AI sector and secure its global AI leadership, the Chinese national security apparatus might shape global standards to adhere to Chinese censorship rules. To address this deficiency, the government will need a better understanding of what AI is and how it functions. The government can help U.S. industries, but only in sectors it comprehends deeply, and today AI is not among them. The Biden administration hired hundreds of AI experts to bolster their ranks. Washington will have to do a better job of securing AI talent and reverse the trends that Trump has set in motion. AI leaders in Silicon Valley might be reluctant to cooperate more closely with the government, given its technical ignorance and bureaucratic sluggishness and given that they have enjoyed such success flying solo. But executives should remember that collaboration between industry and Washington often works out well for everyone. The Manhattan Project would not have succeeded without DuPont, General Electric, Chrysler, and other corporate stalwarts, all of which profited by providing help. One critical area in which the government can help companies is security assistance. In March 2024, for example, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted Linwei Ding, a Google software engineer, for allegedly passing Google's AI chip designs to China. Beijing has also worked hard to smuggle in advanced American technology products, such as AI chips themselves. Chinese spies will grab whatever AI secrets they can from American businesses. For China, with its severe constraints on computational power, such multipliers are almost certainly incredibly valuable. AI companies bear the primary responsibility for defending their networks and organizations. But despite the recent loss in expertise, the U.S. government has cybersecurity capabilities that businesses cannot match, and it should provide significant assistance, as it does today to firms in the defense industrial base and critical infrastructure sectors. Such aid could include intelligence about foreign hacking attempts, support in vetting international talent, and guidance on security procedures. Time and again throughout military history, states that fail to integrate new technology into their armed forces have wound up suffering. Biden created an outline for how such cooperation might function in October 2024, when he signed a national security memorandum directing the government to bolster its use of AI for national security purposes. Unlike with many of Biden's other executive actions, Trump has not yet repealed it. But the president has made little progress on its many important provisions and has ousted some of the senior nonpolitical experts vital to its implementation. As government and industry develop a better national security partnership, they will need to pay particular attention to how AI can solve pressing problems in Washington's competition with Beijing. The country that more quickly and effectively integrates AI into the cyber-domain will likely prove better able to protect its own networks and penetrate others', unlocking a huge intelligence advantage. But nothing will happen without clear direction from government and meaningful engagement by American AI firms. There is a final reason why the U.S. government and leading AI companies need to build closer ties: together, they will have to weigh tradeoffs between upsides and risks. Within the technology world, almost everyone agrees that although AI could offer tremendous benefits to humanity—curing diseases, advancing clean technology, eliminating grunt work—it could also cause massive harm. Some of these risks, such as the use of AI by authoritarian states to reshape the global order, can be avoided by preserving and expanding Washington's lead over competitors. Several top AI thinkers, for instance, believe it is plausible, or even likely, that a single malicious user could someday harness powerful AI to engineer a deadly novel pathogen. Then there are less fantastical but still dire outcomes, including massive unemployment, acute concentration of economic power, and discrimination in sectors such as health care because of biased models and training data. For example, in a hypothetical world in which a single AI user can cause catastrophic harm, the government will have to consider sweeping regulations on the development and use of sophisticated systems, even if that slows innovation. And if AI automates away a large share of human work, the government may have to spend large sums of money retraining the workforce, or it might have to facilitate a restructured economy. Given the pace of AI progress, policymakers will have to make these consequential decisions under exceptionally tight timelines—all concerning a technology that government is not inventing and about which it knows worryingly little. With a stronger technical foundation, officials can better understand how reliably AI systems follow instructions, how they handle dangerous tasks, in which areas they can replace human labor, and to what extent they favor offense versus defense in security and safety domains. Since its inception, CAISI has brought together government officials and companies to collaborate on safety issues. It has also aided in the development of standardized testing mechanisms for AI. CAISI has worked alongside other agencies with domain-specific expertise to carry out additional voluntary testing on particularly critical topics, such as partnering with the Department of Energy and the AI company Anthropic to assess whether frontier AI models have dangerous knowledge about nuclear weapons. Thanks to CAISI's work and the voluntary commitments that leading AI companies made to the Biden White House, AI firms have already promised to conduct independent safety testing of their models, often based on CAISI guidance. In some cases, companies have even agreed to grant CAISI access to new systems before they are released and have praised the government for the national security–specific expertise it has offered in return. Grand bargains often work better as tag lines than as policy, and getting the right kind of deal when it comes to AI is easier said than done. The technology, after all, is rapidly progressing along an unpredictable path. As AI improves, ever-larger amounts of infrastructure, power, and money will be required; the need for improved security from foreign intelligence threats will increase; and the urgency of collaboration with the defense apparatus will grow. So will the risks of misuse, prompting new policy tradeoffs. Everyone involved in the AI world should prepare for constant renegotiation and rebalancing. U.S. officials, for their part, will almost certainly have to remain agile, experimenting with different AI policies as time goes on. But amid this uncertainty, it is imperative that Washington take a more active role in enabling and shaping the American AI ecosystem. It organized laws and permits for building the infrastructure. It passed carefully calibrated, common-sense government safety requirements—such as standardized track gauges, rules for the use of air brakes, and requirements for car coupling—which all helped make trains both faster and safer. Advanced AI, too, can promote U.S. power and interests, provided it is developed in the right way and under the right set of arrangements.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. On October 28, 2024, a group of South Korean intelligence officials briefed NATO members and the alliance's three other Indo-Pacific partners—Australia, Japan, and New Zealand—on a shocking development in the war in Ukraine: North Korea's deployment of thousands of its troops to Russia's Kursk region to aid Moscow's war effort. The United States' adversaries are coordinating with one another in unprecedented ways, creating a more unified theater of competition in Eurasia. For a few years, the United States led that effort. In 2021, it formed AUKUS, a security arrangement with Australia and the United Kingdom. And in 2024, Japan, South Korea, the United States, and the EU created a coalition to loosen China's grip over pharmaceutical supply chains. In May, Elbridge Colby, the undersecretary of defense for policy, dissuaded British officials from sending an aircraft carrier on a scheduled deployment to the Indo-Pacific. Together, they pose a threat more formidable than any the United States has faced in decades. Otherwise, Washington may find itself on the fringes of a new global order. Since then, every U.S. president—with the exception of Donald Trump—has shared Spykman's conviction. They have also shared a belief that the United States should never again allow the emergence of a powerful Eurasian bloc that could threaten American interests. Any alignment of regional powers, whether as allies or in coordinated opposition to the United States, could pose a threat to U.S. preeminence. Thus, while American leaders firmly committed themselves to both Asian and European security after World War II, they also spent most of the next 50 years trying to keep U.S. adversaries divided and U.S. allies apart. China, the world's largest economy by purchasing power parity, is building a partnership with Russia that is an alliance in all but name. Both countries have formidable militaries and years of experience carrying out hybrid operations, such as cyberattacks, maritime disruptions, and disinformation campaigns. Last year, Russia signed a mutual defense treaty with North Korea. China has conducted joint military exercises with Belarus and Serbia. Meanwhile, China and Russia use institutions such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the BRICS, a group named after its first five members—Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa—to provide a veneer of legitimacy to their plans. Although this loose coalescing of adversaries is driven more by shared grievances than by common interests, the United States cannot ignore it. Washington must unify its alliances by investing in cross-regional ties. With Chinese technologies and North Korean troops aiding Russia's war efforts in Ukraine, European partners know they can't sit on the sidelines of Asian geopolitics. And Indo-Pacific partners understand that what happens in Ukraine today could influence how China approaches Taiwan tomorrow. And according to the Kiel Institute, a German think tank, Japan has sent more bilateral economic and humanitarian aid to Ukraine than have Finland, France, or Poland. In September, Trump said that he was “not concerned at all” about a Chinese-Russian axis forming against the United States. At the 2025 Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia's largest annual defense conference, U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth called for the United States' European allies to “maximize their comparative advantage” on their own continent and reminded them that “the N in NATO stands for ‘North Atlantic. '” Readouts of meetings between Pentagon officials and European allies no longer mention Indo-Pacific security, as they frequently did over the past few years. In June, for the first time in three years, Indo-Pacific leaders were absent from NATO's summit, despite their countries' significant contributions to European defense. U.S. adversaries, however, are sharing their technological and military resources in ways that could wear down individual U.S. allies and prolong regional conflicts. Moreover, China and Russia are deploying cyber, space, and other tools around the globe, reducing the chance that any one crisis will be contained within a single geographic region. Their ability, or lack thereof, to muster a unified front will shape the calculus of leaders in Beijing and Moscow. China and Russia are collaborating in ways that the United States is not prepared for. For instance, China and Russia have tried to intimidate Japan and South Korea by conducting joint air patrols off their coasts. European officials have investigated Chinese- and Russian-linked ships for sabotaging undersea cables in the Baltic Sea. China and Russia are also integrating their capabilities in ways that will shape future wars. Russian President Vladimir Putin's years-long bombardment of Ukraine would not have been possible without access to Chinese, Iranian, and North Korean weapons, technologies, and personnel. The U.S. intelligence community's most recent threat assessment warns that this greater alignment of adversaries “increases the chances of U.S. tensions or conflict with any one of these adversaries drawing in another.” In 2024, a bipartisan congressional commission of former senior civilian and military officials similarly concluded that the United States “should assume that if it enters a direct conflict involving Russia, China, Iran, or North Korea, that country will benefit from economic and military aid from the others.” China and Russia are making themselves more capable of sustaining regional conflicts for a longer time. The United States and its allies will not be prepared to manage this challenge unless they also collaborate militarily. Just as Russia has relied on Chinese and North Korean assistance to keep up its assault on Ukraine, NATO has been able to sustain Ukrainian defenses because Australia, Japan, and South Korea have been quietly backfilling U.S. stocks of 155-millimeter artillery rounds and Patriot missiles. These initiatives are a good start, but the United States and its allies will have to do much more to counter China and Russia. In July, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte warned that, in the event of a crisis over Taiwan, China could ask Russia to keep Washington and its partners “busy in Europe by attacking NATO territory.” Moscow could also distract or dissuade countries from helping Taiwan through nonkinetic means, such as by launching a cyberattack on European power grids. Allied militaries and defense planners will need to address the prospect of a multitheater war collectively. The United States and its partners should begin by expanding real-time information sharing between their capitals, reducing vulnerabilities in their critical infrastructure, planning for shocks to the energy market, and integrating their space and cyber capabilities. The United States and its friends should also coordinate defense industrial production to fill gaps in one another's arsenals. They should aim to double their overall production of long-range strike weapons, munitions, and drones within the next five years. If the United States and its allies don't pool their resources, they could face critical shortages in a future conflict. War games conducted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies have suggested that the United States could run out of munitions within the first eight days of a war with China over Taiwan. Washington should work to build munitions factories across the European and Indo-Pacific theaters, thereby reducing the chance that U.S. adversaries could sever supply lines. It should establish more maintenance, repair, and overhaul facilities for U.S. platforms in allied countries, which would enhance the readiness and preparedness of American forces during a crisis. Washington and its partners also need practice when it comes to surging capabilities across theaters. The United States should, for example, include more European and Indo-Pacific allies in Mobility Guardian, a biennial exercise in which Australia, Canada, France, Japan, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States practice moving troops and weapons over long distances. U.S. allies have already grasped the need to work more closely together. When Washington is unreliable or unpredictable, ties between Asia and Europe tend to strengthen. Standing next to Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto in July, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that “when economic uncertainty meets geopolitical volatility, partners like us must come closer together.” France and the Philippines are considering a similar deal. That same year, Australia became the first non-NATO member of the Movement Coordination Centre Europe, a logistics organization that allows its members to pool military ships and planes for transport. In November 2024, the EU signed new security and defense partnerships with both Japan and South Korea, the first time Brussels has done so with Asian partners. Rather than resisting or dismissing this cooperation, Washington should shape it. European leaders have already signaled their interest in eventually joining Asia's Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, a move that could leave Washington outside a trade bloc representing roughly 30 percent of global GDP. The United States can still steer the direction of international trade by offering attractive alternatives or harmonizing standards with partners and allies, such as for data-privacy rules or AI regulation. Its allies are finally stepping up to share international burdens. And Australian troops have trained Ukrainian military recruits in the United Kingdom. But other forms of coordination among allies could prove risky for the United States. Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom are jointly designing a new fighter plane—a test bed for future projects. For decades, allied interoperability has centered on American technologies. If Asian and European allies make their own, such integration could become more difficult. And without American expertise, allied assets could be less competitive. If the United States abstains from new groups or institutions formed by its allies, it will lose its chance to set the terms for international trade and security. Countries in Asia and Europe could create more permissive environments for Chinese investments and technologies, halt their nascent cooperation with Taiwan, or temper their support of Ukraine. They could also adopt Chinese telecommunications infrastructure, such as for 5G and 6G networks, that would make them vulnerable to Chinese espionage or create leverage for Beijing. At the meeting, which was attended by more than 20 world leaders and the UN secretary-general, Chinese leader Xi Jinping made clear that his government is unwilling to let “the house rules of a few countries” dominate global affairs. SCO countries announced the formation of a new development bank, which will join the ranks of a similar BRICS-led institution and also China's Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, as well as new regional centers to coordinate law enforcement, counterterrorism, and antidrug campaigns. Central Asian member states are hesitant to rely too much on either Beijing or Moscow. India and Pakistan, for example, both belong to the SCO but remain bitter rivals. Both the SCO and the BRICS have brought on new dialogue partners in recent years that allow China and Russia to claim leadership and influence not only throughout Eurasia but also across the so-called global South. The practical effects of these institutions can sometimes be hard to see. Beijing has gained tremendous influence by directing development spending across Africa, Asia, and Europe. Their members are swapping currencies and signing cross-border payment agreements. Following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, NATO deepened its relationships with Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea. The G-7 Plus, an intergovernmental organization of conflict-affected countries, could become a forum for cooperation on securing critical minerals or countering drug traffickers. U.S. allies will continue to work with one another whether or not the United States joins them. But they can't reach their full potential without Washington's involvement. Eighty years ago, it took bold U.S. leadership and diplomacy to create the global order. Trump has shown little interest in revitalizing or redesigning alliances beyond pushing partners to spend more on defense. Without U.S. leadership, allied coalitions might not have the muscle to successfully counter Beijing and Moscow. On its own, the United States cannot manage Chinese-Russian alignment. But neither can Washington ignore any conflict in Eurasia that comes from it. American allies are rapidly transforming their relationships whether Washington likes it or not; these networks can either serve or undermine U.S. interests depending on how Washington engages with them. If the United States fails to reset ties with Asian and European partners, it risks being left on the sidelines of a rapidly changing world order.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>George Springer reacts after hitting a three-run home run against the Seattle Mariners.David J. Phillip/The Associated Press When the Toronto Blue Jays signed former Houston Astro George Springer as a free agent in 2021, it was a big moment for the club. It showed they were finally getting serious about winning. It may have been less of one for Springer. He was leaving the best team in baseball to join one that perpetually failed to get over the hump. Then he pushed the Jays over it himself. His seventh-inning three-run blast on Monday night fits somewhere between Jose Bautista's bat-flip effort and Joe Carter's 1993 game-ender in the taxonomy of greatest-ever Jays home runs. He put it near to where Carter's landed in the left-field bleachers, to the same sort of hysterical reaction. Springer will never pay for a drink in Toronto again. Blue Jays players celebrated for hours on the field at Rogers Centre and in a beer-and-champagne-soaked party in their clubhouse. That hit propelled his team to a 4-3 win, and into their first World Series in over 30 years. It started with Vladimir Guerrero Jr. being filmed entering the building in a Toronto Maple Leafs jersey. Don't these people talk to each other? They rattled again in the third when Julio Rodriguez hit a solo home run. Then Seattle made the sort of small error that has turned games in this series. They sent Bryan Woo, one of their cult heroes and a repurposed starter, out to pitch the fifth. I'm sure Eduard Bazardo is a nice guy, but he's the new Mitch Williams around these parts. The reaction wasn't pandemonium because that word suggests disorder. What's your favourite piece of Toronto Blue Jays memorabilia? This was three decades of expecting the worst and usually getting it being released. Whatever the Jays end up accomplishing in the next week and a bit, they have already shed their reputation as a team that doesn't quite measure up. For the foreseeable future, they will be automatically considered a force in Major League Baseball. At that point, it was a matter of turning things over to a series of fill-in starters, ending in closer Jeff Hoffman. Hoffman has been a wild ride all season long, but not on Monday. It was the first time he'd done that in two months. Los Angeles Dodgers two-way player Shohei Ohtani awaits in the World Series, which starts Friday in Toronto. Ohtani is coming off of a Game 4 win against Milwaukee in the NLCS that may have been the greatest individual performance ever in a baseball game.Ashley Landis/The Associated Press The Dodgers aren't a mountain to climb. They're a cliff that peels away backward once you start trying to pull yourself up it. They've played 10 playoff games and lost only one. In their most recent series, against Milwaukee, they gave up four runs total. The Blue Jays won't be underdogs in this World Series. They'll be whatever you'd find under an underdog. That didn't feel like it mattered as the Jays took their victory lap after Monday's game. They wanted to make sure they got at least one proper celebration in before things get hard. The fans who remained – every single one of them – lapped it up. L.A.'s line-up features a front three who've all won MVP awards. Thousands of Blue Jays fans poured into the streets of Toronto on Monday night celebrating the team's first World Series berth in more than thirty years. Toronto has proven that they are more than the sum of their parts, though the parts are increasingly formidable. They lost one of their best players, Bo Bichette, to injury and got better. This team wins when events suggest it should not. He'd been a World Series MVP in 2017. But the Jays couldn't get anywhere in October, and Springer, 36, started to slow down. This year, he was asked to play less in the field, and had a resurgence at the plate as a result. Still, you would have said that his contract – at one point the largest in team history – was a minor bust. If he never plays again, his place in Toronto sports lore is assured.

NEW YORK (AP) — When slugger Joe Carter hit the last World Series pitch thrown in Canada over the left-field wall to win the Toronto Blue Jays' second consecutive title, it was 8 1/2 months before Shohei Ohtani was born. When the World Series was last north of the border, the Steroids Era was just starting, advanced analytics were science fiction and complete games were thrown about twice a month. “You always feel the weight of the world in decisions you make but when you're kind of feeling a country, it kind of gets a little dicey at times,” Toronto manager John Schneider said early in the postseason. “Sixth inning with the bases loaded and nobody out and Aaron Judge hitting, you feel like people in Nova Scotia want to come murder you.” They're scoring seven, eight runs, 10 runs a game, so that's tough to slow down,” Los Angeles shortstop Mookie Betts said. “They're doing all three facets of the game.” Ohtani is starring at the plate and on the mound, a performance that would be deemed CGI if not witnessed by thousands in person. “Sometimes you've got to check yourself and touch him to make sure he's not just made of steel,” teammate Freddie Freeman said. Before his three-homer at the plate and 10-strikeouts, six-scoreless innings mound show Friday night, Ohtani's bat had been slumping. He's hitting .220 with five homers and nine RBIs in the postseason and is 2-0 with a 2.25 ERA in a pair of pitching starts, striking out 19 and walking four in 12 innings. No team has won consecutive titles since the Yankees took three in a row from 1998-2000. “Trying to get back-to-back is even more special.” Toronto pitcher Max Scherzer was on the 2021 Dodgers team that fell short, losing to Atlanta in the National League Championship Series. Hall of Famers Rickey Henderson and Fred McGriff also played for both franchises, along with Justin Turner. Dodgers first baseman Freddie Freeman has dual American-Canadian citizenship — his parents were born in Canada. Los Angeles entered the postseason with a big league-high $341.5 million payroll, according to Major League Baseball's latest tabulation, and is projected to pay nearly $168 million in luxury tax, easily a record. “Before this season started, they said the Dodgers are ruining baseball,” manager Dave Roberts shouted to the crowd after Friday night's National League pennant clincher. “Let's get four more wins and really ruin baseball!” Los Angeles pitchers are 9-1 with a 2.45 ERA in 10 postseason games, including 7-1 with 1.40 ERA for starting pitchers totaling 64 1/3 of 82 innings. Led by Blake Snell and Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Dodgers starters were 3-0 with a 0.63 ERA in the NLCS and their staff held the Milwaukee Brewers to a .118 batting average during the four-game sweep, lowest in a postseason series of at least three games. LA's four postseason starters totaled 73 starts and 372 1/3 innings during the regular season. That's because Snell, Tyler Glasnow and Sasaki all hurt their pitching shoulders and Ohtani didn't return to the mound until June 16 after recovering from elbow surgery in 2023. That would be more than Cleveland, the New York Mets and Philadelphia, teams that have been around much longer.
