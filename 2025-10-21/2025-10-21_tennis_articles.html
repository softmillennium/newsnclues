There was no bluffing for the poker enthusiast.“I felt like I just wasn't ready,” he tells TENNIS.com when reflecting on his decision not to turn pro at 18 and instead pursue an NCAA pathway at Columbia University.Just over three years later, his gut has all but paid off. “I felt like I just wasn't ready,” he tells TENNIS.com when reflecting on his decision not to turn pro at 18 and instead pursue an NCAA pathway at Columbia University.Just over three years later, his gut has all but paid off. Just over three years later, his gut has all but paid off. 🖥️📲 Stream Zheng's bid to win the Sioux Falls Challenger live on the Tennis Channel app!Coming into mid-October, Zheng is riding a 15-match win streak on the ATP Challenger Tour. Having captured his maiden title at Chicago in August, the 21-year-old picked up two more hard-court crowns in Columbus and Tiburon after winning a round of qualifying at the US Open.“I feel like my serve has gotten a lot better, so I'm getting a few more free points. I think just a little bit of everything has been kind of clicking and just playing with confidence. I think that was something I struggled with before the last couple of years, but I've been doing a better job with that.”Howard “Howie” Endelman, head coach of Columbia's men's tennis program, attributes Zheng's progression to making the most of the overall college experience.“I just think that he's really embraced the opportunity to be a college tennis player and to work on his game. At the same time, he's also furthering his academic career, and meeting new people, and kind of using tennis as a vehicle to create opportunities in all parts of his life,” believes Endelman.“He's always been really tough from the ground, with terrific defense and excellent hands. I think tennis-wise, his serve has improved tremendously. Coming into mid-October, Zheng is riding a 15-match win streak on the ATP Challenger Tour.

Endelman first became aware of Zheng's potential when, as a young high schooler, he faced Columbia's Shawn Hadavi at an open tournament in New York City. He had faith in me that I could be a really good player and I trusted that,” recalls Zheng. “I worked with that belief of having your family behind you. It wasn't that hard.“Both my parents, I know they had a much tougher life than me for sure.”As Endelman learned more about Zheng's backstory, it only captivated him more.

In his freshman campaign, Zheng nabbed Player of the Year and Rookie of the Year honors in a breakout season that earned him a trip to the NCAA championships. As a junior, he entered the history books as Columbia's first NCAA singles champion of the modern era, ending a program drought dating back to 1906.“He has an even keeled personality. He has a way of busting my chops a little bit, and the other guys on the team. I just like how he's got kind of a quiet confidence and composure, and how respectful he is to everyone.”The trajectory seems even more impressive when considering the push and pull of being on court and in the classroom at an Ivy League school. People think it's super hard, but I think it actually makes you better, I think, when you have to kind of balance everything together at the same time,” he says. “It's when you're traveling for these events, you have so much downtime, so something to take your mind off the tennis, I think, just helps you perform better on court.” He has a way of busting my chops a little bit, and the other guys on the team.

They're just very special, kind, compassionate, unselfish, and caring people,” he states.“Then to his credit, Michael's just quietly gone out and does his work every day. And he won the Rafael Osuna National Sportsmanship Award. I don't think that triple crown has ever happened. So he's just a really impressive young man, and he's made all of us at Columbia University incredibly proud.”When asked to sum up a personal scouting report, Zheng responds, “I don't try to overplay too much, but when chances come, I take them.”As one might say in those key moments, he's all in.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>2 Jannik Sinner headlines the draw and will open his title bid against Daniel Altmaier, a player he recently defeated at the Rolex Shanghai Masters.Sinner first played in Vienna in 2019, when, ranked No. 119, he needed a wild card to enter the main draw. But even then, tournament director Herwig Straka recognized his potential.“It's only a matter of time before Jannik Sinner breaks into the Top 100. In 2022 he advanced to the quarterfinals, before crowning his fifth and most recent Vienna campaign in 2023 with a dramatic final victory over Daniil Medvedev. The three-set battle, lasting three hours and four minutes, went down as one of the tournament's greatest matches.The Erste Bank Open has long held a special place in Sinner's heart. At the 2021 trophy ceremony, after thanking his team in English, he charmed the sold-out Stadthalle by switching to his unmistakable South Tyrolean dialect: “Jetzt red ma amoi deitsch.” (“Now let's speak German.”)Sinner has often emphasized the special bond he feels with Vienna: “This is a great tournament that helped me with wild cards when I wasn't high enough in the rankings to enter directly,” he said in 2023. “People in Vienna have always looked after me very well. I feel very comfortable here, so the Erste Bank Open will continue to be very important for me in the coming years.” 119, he needed a wild card to enter the main draw.

Local favorite Jurij Rodionov reacted with a smile to his opening-round challenge during the main draw ceremony on Saturday.The 25-year-old Austrian, currently ranked World No. 155, received a wild card into his home event and faced world No. De Minaur on a fast hard court is probably not ideal. But you have to take what Niavarani drew,” joked Rodionov, referring to the draw made by Austrian comedian Michael Niavarani.Rodionov defeated de Minaur in their only previous meeting, four years ago on grass in Stuttgart, but fell this time at home, 6-4, 6-1.Another Austrian hopeful, Filip Misolic, entered the tournament with a wild card and a winnable first-round match against world No. He now leads Ugo Carabelli in their head-to-head, 2-1.“Physically, I feel great, which is the most important thing,” Misolic said.Though home fans were denied an all-Austrian clash in the round of 16—Rodionov and Misolic would have faced off, had they both won—there will be no shortage of must-see matches at the Erste Bank Open. 155, received a wild card into his home event and faced world No. De Minaur on a fast hard court is probably not ideal.
