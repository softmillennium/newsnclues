Endelman first became aware of Zheng's potential when, as a young high schooler, he faced Columbia's Shawn Hadavi at an open tournament in New York City. He had faith in me that I could be a really good player and I trusted that,‚Äù recalls Zheng. ‚ÄúI worked with that belief of having your family behind you. It wasn't that hard.‚ÄúBoth my parents, I know they had a much tougher life than me for sure.‚ÄùAs Endelman learned more about Zheng's backstory, it only captivated him more.

In his freshman campaign, Zheng nabbed Player of the Year and Rookie of the Year honors in a breakout season that earned him a trip to the NCAA championships. As a junior, he entered the history books as Columbia's first NCAA singles champion of the modern era, ending a program drought dating back to 1906.‚ÄúHe has an even keeled personality. He has a way of busting my chops a little bit, and the other guys on the team. I just like how he's got kind of a quiet confidence and composure, and how respectful he is to everyone.‚ÄùThe trajectory seems even more impressive when considering the push and pull of being on court and in the classroom at an Ivy League school. People think it's super hard, but I think it actually makes you better, I think, when you have to kind of balance everything together at the same time,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt's when you're traveling for these events, you have so much downtime, so something to take your mind off the tennis, I think, just helps you perform better on court.‚Äù He has a way of busting my chops a little bit, and the other guys on the team.

By this point, nothing Zheng accomplishes surprises Endelman. Emotions trickle into his voice when thinking about sharing this chapter together, one where Zheng's historic NCAA title came weeks after Endelman lost his father. They're just very special, kind, compassionate, unselfish, and caring people,‚Äù he states.‚ÄúThen to his credit, Michael's just quietly gone out and does his work every day. And he won the Rafael Osuna National Sportsmanship Award. I don't think that triple crown has ever happened.
