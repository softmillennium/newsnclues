                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United Airlines logo can be seen on a rope line at O'Hare International Airport, May 17, 2011. A United Airlines plane appears to have collided with a weather balloon while cruising over Utah at 36,000 feet last week, fracturing layers of its windshield and forcing an emergency landing. A California company called Windborne Systems said it started looking into the situation Sunday, not long after the National Transportation Safety Board said it was investigating. Windborne quickly concluded that the Boeing 737 Max very likely ran into one of its balloons, despite the company's best efforts to prevent such collisions. The plane, which was flying from Denver to Los Angeles, did not lose cabin pressure and landed safely in Salt Lake City last Thursday. United said 134 passengers and six crew members were aboard. Windborne CEO John Dean said he was surprised at the extent of the damage to the plane's windshield because Windborne's balloons weigh only 2.4 pounds at takeoff with a simple bag of sand serving as ballast. The company said it follows all Federal Aviation Administration rules for the size and design of its balloons that gather data to help improve weather forecasts. “I find this extremely concerning, and unacceptable in the case of a collision, regardless of what the official regulations are, It resulted in injury to a pilot, which I'm simply not okay with whatsoever,” Dean said in a post on X. ▶ Stay up to date with the latest U.S. news by signing up to our WhatsApp channel. The NTSB statement didn't mention any injuries. Windborne forwarded all of its data to the NTSB, which will ultimately determine what happened. Windborne has launched more than 4,000 balloons, and the company said it coordinates with the FAA each time, filing notices for pilots and sharing live updates on balloon positions with the FAA. It's also looking at different ballast designs to reduce the force of any future collisions and minimize the potential for damage or injuries. NTSB investigators will release a preliminary report in a few weeks, but the full report might not come for more than a year.</p>

Stockton Mayor Christina Fugazi's home was hit by a bullet from a nearby shooting early Saturday morning, the mayor's office said Monday. A California mayor's home was struck by gunfire over the weekend during a nearby shooting that police believe was gang-related, according to Stockton Mayor Christina Fugazi's office. Authorities told Fox News Digital it does not appear to be a targeted or politically motivated incident. A spokesperson for the Stockton Police Department said officers responded just before 2 a.m. on Oct. 18 after reports of gunfire in the area. A 17-year-old and an 18-year-old were both found to have non-life-threatening gunshot wounds. Detectives later determined that a bullet from the same shooting hit a nearby home, identified as the mayor's residence. Police also confirmed that no arrests have been made and the case remains under investigation. California mayor Christina Fugazi's home was hit by a stray bullet during what her office said is believed to be a "gang-related" shooting. "This could have killed somebody in my household, even myself," Fugazi told KCRA. "It wasn't until I got the notification from the police department that, no, indeed, it was a shooting." Stockton mayor Christina Fugazi was unharmed after a bullet hit her California home during a weekend shooting. "Then later on, we also found a number of shell casings." In a written statement, Fugazi thanked the Stockton Police Department for its quick response. "First, I want to thank the men and women of the Stockton Police Department for their swift response and diligent work apprehending one of the suspects," she said. "Their dedication to protecting and serving the people of Stockton is a major reason we've seen significant reductions in crime this year." A bullet struck Stockton Mayor Christina Fugazi's home while she slept during what her office is calling a nearby gang-related shooting. Fugazi noted that Stockton has seen nearly a 50% drop in crime this year, crediting the Police Department, the Office of Violence Prevention and city leadership for the progress. "I never thought that there would be a bullet, a random bullet coming into my house, into the bedroom," she said. This incident only strengthens my commitment to ensuring every neighborhood in Stockton is safe and livable for all our residents." The Stockton Police Department said it cannot confirm any victim identity due to victim confidentiality, even though the mayor publicly identified herself as the resident. Anyone with information about the shooting can contact the Stockton Police Department's Investigation Division at (209) 937-8377 or Stockton Crime Stoppers at (209) 946-0600.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump is leaning on a new appeals court ruling that endorsed his deployment of the National Guard to Portland, Oregon, as he urges the Supreme Court to let his administration carry out a similar effort in Chicago. In one of the most significant emergency cases involving the second Trump administration to reach the Supreme Court so far, the justices are reviewing whether lower federal courts were correct to block Trump from deploying hundreds of guard members to an ICE facility in Chicago's suburbs. The Supreme Court is likely to hand down a decision in the Chicago case quickly, potentially within a few days. Trump's broader campaign to deploy the guard on US soil was buoyed this week when a divided three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit said the president was entitled to deference when making decisions about when such deployments are necessary. The full 9th Circuit is weighing whether to reconsider that decision. In its latest filing, the Department of Justice framed Trump's decision to send the Guard into Illinois as a response to what it described as a broader national threat. “That is especially so where, as here, the events in Chicago are not occurring in a vacuum, as violent riots have occurred in Los Angeles and Portland, a shooter tried to murder federal agents in Dallas, and Mexican cartels are offering bounties on DHS personnel.” Perry, nominated by former President Joe Biden, pointed to what she described as a “troubling trend” of the administration of “equating protests with riots.” The Chicago-based 7th Circuit largely upheld Perry's temporary order. To make its case for the deployments, the Department of Justice has relied on a Supreme Court decision from 1827 – Martin v. Mott. The case dealt with Jacob Mott, a member of the New York militia who disobeyed President James Madison's order to mobilize during the War of 1812. Chicago officials have balked at the notion that the protests against ICE agents are akin to an invading foreign army. “State and local law enforcement officers have handled isolated protest activities in Illinois, and there is no credible evidence to the contrary,” Illinois officials told the Supreme Court in their own set of written arguments this week.</p>

Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich joins 'The Faulkner Focus' to discuss the ongoing government shutdown and his take on Operation Arctic Frost that reportedly targeted Republican lawmakers' phone records. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said that both he and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., reached out to Trump on Tuesday to set up a confab with the president. The top Senate Democrat said the duo "urged" Trump to meet with them, and that they were open to setting up "an appointment with him any time, any place." Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, left, and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries update reporters following their meeting with President Donald Trump and Republican leaders on the government funding crisis, at the Capitol in Washington, Sept. 29, 2025. Congressional Democrats, particularly Schumer and his Democratic caucus, have remained steadfast in their demands for an extension to expiring Obamacare subsidies. Should Trump relent to their request, it would mark the first meeting among the trio since Schumer, Jeffries, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., met in the Oval Office a day before the shutdown began. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (Nathan Posner/Anadolu via Getty Images) Lawmakers left that meeting with no agreement to avert the shutdown, which has now dragged on for 21 days. Senate Democrats have also blocked Thune and Republicans' attempts to reopen the government 11 times. Another vote on the House-passed continuing resolution, which would reopen the government until Nov. 21, is expected on Wednesday. And like the many attempts before, that latest effort is expected to fail. Meanwhile, Senate Republicans met with Trump for lunch at the White House Tuesday afternoon. President Donald Trump listens as Senate Majority Leader John Thune speaks during a lunch with Republican senators on the Rose Garden patio at the White House in Washington, Oct. 21, 2025. Speaking to reporters afterward, Thune reiterated that Senate Republicans were united in their war of attrition strategy to continue putting the same bill on the floor again and again. He noted that Trump would likely agree to meet with Schumer and Jeffries, but only after Senate Democrats unlocked the votes needed to reopen the government. I don't know what there is to negotiate. This is about opening up the government," Thune said. Now, the Democrats want something that's totally untenable. I mean, they want $1.5 trillion in new spending. They want free healthcare for people who are noncitizens in this country. It won't be signed into law by the president."

This image from Senate Television shows Christopher Moynihan looking at his mobile device as he sits in the Senate Chamber at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Jan. 6, 2021. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., speaks to reporters on day 17 of the government shutdown, at the Capitol in Washington, Friday, Oct. 17, 2025. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., speaks during a news conference as the government shutdown enters its third week, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, Oct. 14, 2025. WASHINGTON (AP) — A man whose convictions for storming the U.S. Capitol were erased by President Donald Trump's mass pardons has been arrested on a charge that he threatened to kill House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. “I cannot allow this terrorist to live,” Moynihan wrote, according to a report by a state police investigator. Moynihan also wrote that Jeffries “must be eliminated” and texted, “I will kill him for the future,” the police report says. Moynihan who's 34, was sentenced to 21 months in prison for joining a mob's Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. In January, he was among hundreds of convicted Capitol rioters who received a pardon from Trump on the Republican president's first day back in the White House. Jeffries thanked investigators “for their swift and decisive action to apprehend a dangerous individual who made a credible death threat against me with every intention to carry it out.” “Unfortunately, our brave men and women in law enforcement are being forced to spend their time keeping our communities safe from these violent individuals who should never have been pardoned,” Jeffries said in a statement. House Speaker Mike Johnson was asked about the case during a news conference on Tuesday and said he did not know any details of the threat against Jeffries. Those people should be arrested and tried,” said Johnson, a Louisiana Republican. He is due back in the Town of Clinton Court on Thursday. Dutchess County District Attorney Anthony Parisi said his office is reviewing the case “for legal and factual sufficiency.” “Threats made against elected officials and members of the public will not be tolerated,” Parisi said in a statement Tuesday. Moynihan's arrest was first reported by CBS News. He entered the Senate chamber, rifled through a notebook on a senator's desk and joined other rioters in shouting and chanting at the Senate dais, prosecutors said. “Moynihan did not leave the Senate Chamber until he was forced out by police,” they wrote. In 2022, U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper convicted Moynihan of a felony for obstructing the Jan. 6 joint session of Congress for certifying Democrat Joe Biden's victory over Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Moynihan also pleaded guilty to five other riot-related counts. Associated Press writer Stephen Groves contributed to this report.

Sentinel Action Fund President Jessica Anderson and '#Walkaway' campaign founder Brandon Straka join 'Fox News @ Night' reacting to comments by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., about masculinity and  a rise in political violence from the left. Labor Union leader Dan Osborn, a candidate for U.S. Senate in Nebraska, has campaigned on being an "Independent," going as far as saying he has no plans to caucus with either major party if elected, but his recent FEC filings paint a different picture. Osborn has not only been endorsed by leaders of the Nebraska Democratic Party and mobilized fundraising on ActBlue, the Democratic Party's main fundraising platform. He has also accepted donations from several prominent Washington Democrats and Democrat political action committees. Democracy Summer, a leadership PAC founded by Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, also donated $2,000. The latest FEC filings, released last week, also show Osborn continues to accept fundraising support from The People United, a left-wing super PAC that has supported Democrat ‘Squad' members like Jamaal Bowman, Cori Bush, Summer Lee and Ilhan Omar. (Leigh Vogel/Wire Image and Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) "As an independent, I'll be uniquely positioned to bring together a majority to get it done," Osborn's "Where I Stand" webpage on his campaign website states in reference to securing the border from illegal immigration. But those "partisans" in Washington, at least some, appear to be helping fund his campaign against former Nebraska GOP governor and current junior Nebraska Sen. Pete Ricketts. "Dan Osborn is bought and paid for by his liberal, out-of-state, coastal donors," a Ricketts campaign spokesman previously said after Osborn announced he would be fighting to get a seat in the Senate for the second election in a row. In 2024, Osborn came within single digits of defeating Sen. Deb Fischer. Fischer's campaign made similar claims that Osborn was really a Democrat disguising himself as an Independent. Warren's Senate campaign also donated another $2,000 to Osborn last year. Dan Osborn, independent candidate for U.S. Senate, speaks during a news conference announcing he will not accept any party or political endorsements May 15, 2024, at his Omaha, Neb., home. "Elizabeth Warren is rated as the most far-left politician in Washington," Ricketts told Fox News Digital. "She supports the Green New Deal, taxpayer benefits for illegals and abolishing private healthcare. By accepting campaign funds from Elizabeth Warren, Chuck Schumer and Bob Kerrey, Dan Osborn has shown Nebraska voters exactly who he will side with in the Senate: The same Democrats funding his fake independent campaign." Fox News Digital reached out to campaign representatives for Osborn but did not receive a response. The donations Osborn received recently from folks like Warren, Kerrey, Tester, Raskin and other Washington Democrats amounted to around $15,000 this quarter; however, just days ahead of his race against Fischer in November 2024, Osborn received a big infusion from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) amounting to close to $60,000. Senate Majority PAC, the main super PAC of Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats, spent $3.85 million supporting Dan Osborn's 2024 campaign as well, records show. Senators Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., have donated to Nebraska Senate candidate Dan Osborn's campaign. Fight Agency was founded by a group of Democratic Party strategists, including consultants for Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign and the winning Senate bid for Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman and Arizona Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego. The agency has worked with left-wing Democrats like New York City socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani, Bernie Sanders and progressive Democrat Rep. Greg Casar.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEW YORK (AP) — A former Amazon delivery driver has filed a lawsuit accusing a federal civil right agency of abruptly and unlawfully abandoning her sex discrimination case and others like it following an executive order from President Donald Trump. The lawsuit filed by the former Colorado driver demands that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission resume investigating her claims that Amazon discriminates against female drivers by failing to provide adequate bathroom breaks. The lawsuit is the latest example of workers and others scrambling to find recourse as federal agencies abandon their cases in response to Trump's shake-up of the country's civil rights enforcement infrastructure. The EEOC, which enforces civil rights laws in the workplace, decided last month to discharge any complaints based on “disparate impact liability,” which holds that policies that are neutral on their face can be discriminatory if they impose unnecessary barriers that disadvantage different demographic groups. The EEOC's decision came in response to an executive order in April directing federal agencies to deprioritize the use of disparate impact liability. The Trump administration argues that disparate impact assumes any racial or gender imbalance in workplaces is the result of discrimination and leads to practices that undermine meritocracy. The EEOC has already dropped its sole lawsuit arising from a disparate impact liability charge, a case alleging that the Sheetz convenience store chain's background check practices discriminated against Black, Native American and multiracial job applicants. Separately, the agency has dropped lawsuits on behalf of transgender workers and subjected new complaints to a higher level of scrutiny, following Trump's executive order declaring that the government would only recognize two unchangeable sexes. It's unclear how many worker complaints involving disparate impact liability or LGBTQ+ workers have been sidelined by the EEOC. In her lawsuit, Cross demanded that the EEOC, which handled more than 88,000 discrimination charges in 2024, give the court a list of the disparate impact liability charges it has shut down. Cross, who worked as a driver from August to November 2022, filed her EEOC charge two years ago, arguing that the company's delivery schedules make it nearly impossible for drivers to find time to use bathrooms. An EEOC investigator told her lawyers last month it was closing her case because of the disparate impact rule, according to the lawsuit. Amazon declined to comment on Cross' case but referred The AP to its policies around its drivers, who deliver packages in Amazon-branded vehicles but work indirectly for the company through third-party companies called Delivery Service Partners. Amazon says its technology builds routes that ensure time for two 15-minute rest breaks and a 30-minute meal break. The company also said its Amazon Delivery app provides a list for drivers to see nearby restroom facilities and gas stations. But in an interview with The AP, Cross said it was so hard for to her stop for breaks that she had to pack a Shewee — a portable urination device for women — as well as a change of pants “in case I ended up accidentally urinating on myself.” Gilbride was the EEOC's general counsel until she was fired in January along with two Democratic commissioners in a purge that cleared the way for the Trump administration to root out diversity and inclusion programs, roll back protections for transgender workers and elevate religious rights.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We're on Day 21, and if it lingers into early November, Congress could surpass the current record of 35 days – from, as it happens, the first Trump administration. There is a premium in these debates on appearing resolute. But there are also a number of dynamics pushing us toward an especially prolonged shutdown right now. But plainly: History suggests it's Democrats who would eventually back down. People overwhelmingly say they don't like using shutdowns as leverage – by massive margins, in fact. But public opinion on this shutdown hasn't gone that way. President Donald Trump claimed Tuesday that Democrats were “getting killed in the polls.” This does not appear at all accurate. In fact, every quality public poll has shown Trump and Republicans continue to shoulder more blame than Democrats. In a Reuters-Ipsos poll conducted October 15-20, Americans blamed congressional Republicans more than Democrats, 50%-43%. The gap was larger in a CNBC poll conducted October 8-12. It showed Americans blamed Trump and the Republicans over Democrats, 53%-37%. The other longest shutdowns on record were in 1995-96 (21 days) and 2018-19 (35 days), both of which involved Republicans making the policy demand. In 1995-96, an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll before the shutdown showed people were prepared to blame Republicans by 11 points. In 2018-19, pre-shutdown polling showed Americans were predisposed to blame Trump and the Republicans by 14-15 points. Most quality polls after it began showed Americans blaming the GOP by 20 or more points. In both cases, the GOP was arguably fighting a losing battle before things even got started, and then it became clear they weren't winning either politically or policy-wise. That's been flipped on its head now. A big reason appears to be that what Democrats are demanding is actually popular – unlike, for instance, the GOP's demand of building Trump's border wall in 2018-2019. The new Reuters-Ipsos poll shows 72% of Americans and even 51% of Republicans want health care subsidies to be extended. That could be a tougher ask, especially as some key impacts of the shutdown set in. Federal employees will miss their first full paycheck later this week, for example. Aid to low-income Americans like food stamps could soon be halted. But the looming impacts cut both ways. November 1 is as an especially important deadline for Democrats' policy demand. It's when open enrollment for the Obamacare plans begins. At that point, many Americans would begin to see the significantly higher premiums caused by letting the subsidies lapse – in most cases doubling or close to doubling, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research organization. There is a school of thought that Democrats could give up at that point, believing they had forced Republicans to own the premium hikes and that they had cast a spotlight on the fact that the GOP stood in the way of renewing them. What if Republicans really get scared about owning those premium hikes – like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and even Trump's own pollster have warned them – and suddenly feel compelled to come to the table? Democrats haven't had many wins since the November election, and this situation presents at least the possibility of a very significant one. Perhaps as significantly, how would a Democratic base that has sharply criticized their party's leaders for their lack of fight react to their side throwing in the towel when it looked like they were on the winning side of the issue? Plenty will play out over the next 10 days. But the plot is significantly thicker than in past shutdowns.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk lashed out at Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy in a series of insulting posts on his social media platform X on Tuesday, after Duffy suggested NASA may sideline SpaceX from its moon mission. Musk, SpaceX's CEO, called Duffy “Sean Dummy,” accused him of having a “2 digit IQ” and posted sophomoric memes aimed at Duffy. “Should someone whose biggest claim to fame is climbing trees be running America's space program?” Musk asked in a post Tuesday morning, which he pinned to his X profile. On Monday, Duffy said in an interview with CNBC that he believes SpaceX, which has a $2.9 billion contract to provide the lunar lander astronauts would ride to the moon's surface, is lagging behind schedule, potentially thwarting NASA's efforts to return humans to the moon before China amid a new space race. I'm going to let other space companies compete with SpaceX,” he said. “They do remarkable things,” Duffy told Fox News about SpaceX on Monday, “but they're behind schedule.” NASA's pivotal moon-landing mission, called Artemis III, is planned for as soon as mid-2027. Musk spent Tuesday morning posting about how SpaceX is “the only company to successfully human-certify a new orbital space vehicle in the US” and resposting criticisms of Duffy. Trump had pulled Isaacman's nomination for NASA administrator earlier this year – the same week Musk departed his role in Washington. Though Trump cited Isaacman's “prior associations” as the reason for pulling the nomination, CNN previously reported that a faction of people in Trump's inner circle advocated against Isaacman after Musk left Washington and shortly before Musk's very public falling out with the President. Isaacman told CNN he has “never expressed confidence about renomination at any point” and that he has “a lot of respect for Secretary Duffy and I have always enjoyed the time I've spent with him.” In a statement, a spokesperson for Duffy said that the transportation secretary “never said he wants to keep the (NASA) job himself.” The spokesperson added that Duffy has suggested NASA “might benefit from being part of the Cabinet, maybe even within the Department of Transportation,” but reiterated he has not said he would like to become NASA's permanent leader. “The President asked him to talk with potential candidates for Administrator, and he's been happy to help by vetting people and giving his honest feedback,” the spokesperson said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? But the case is now before a Supreme Court dominated by six Republican justices who rarely part ways with the leader of their political party. Trump's arguments in the Illinois case, moreover, are quite aggressive. His lawyers claim that the question of when the president may exercise his power to take control of National Guard members, who are ordinarily under the command of state officials, “is committed exclusively to the president” and cannot be reviewed by federal courts. Thus, if the justices embrace this argument, Trump could potentially gain unchecked authority to call up the National Guard and order armed guardsmen to “protect” voting precincts in Democratic regions of the country. The case arises out of Trump's decision to place several hundred members of the Illinois and Texas National Guard under his control and order them to an immigration detention facility in Broadview, Illinois, about 12 miles west of Chicago. Some people have also been arrested for violent crimes, such as aggravated battery. According to Judge April Perry, a federal district judge who temporarily blocked this deployment, “the typical number of protestors is fewer than fifty,” and “the crowd has never exceeded 200.” Trump, in other words, claims that a small crowd that ranges from a few dozen people to a couple hundred has so overwhelmed the United States' capacity to enforce its own laws that it justifies using the military against US citizens on US soil. If Trump is allowed to use military personnel to suppress a tiny group of protesters and vandals, then it is unlikely that this Court will place any meaningful limits whatsoever on his ability to deploy the US military against Americans. The framers were quite fearful that military power would be directed against a nation's own citizens or against state governments that were out of step with whoever ran the federal government. This is why the Constitution prohibits Congress from appropriating any money to the army that does not expire after two years. The framers did, however, contemplate that each state would maintain a militia — which could, under conditions established by Congress, be called into federal service “to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions.” The relevant statute permits such use of the National Guard only to repel a foreign invasion, to suppress a rebellion, or when the president is “unable” to otherwise execute US law. Trump's first argument arises out of a single line from the Court's decision in Martin v. Mott (1827) that, if read in isolation, does seem to support his broad claim of authority over the National Guard. But, as both federal courts that heard the Illinois case concluded, Trump's lawyers read this line out of context. Martin involved a member of the New York militia who refused President James Madison's order to report for federal service during the War of 1812. Thus, Martin doesn't stand for the proposition that courts may never review whether a president's decision to call up the National Guard complies with federal law. It simply held that members of the militia can't decide on their own whether to report for duty or not. The latter claim is risible on its face. As Judge Perry noted, “federal immigration officials have seen huge increases in arrests and deportations,” despite the fact that several dozen people have been protesting outside of a single immigration detention facility in Illinois. So, the government appears to be executing its laws just fine. Similarly, Judge Perry defines the term “rebellion” to mean “a deliberate, organized resistance, openly and avowedly opposing the laws and authority of the government as a whole by means of armed opposition and violence.” Thus, mere lawbreaking, or even lawbreaking that seeks to prevent federal officials from carrying out their duties, is not enough. So, it makes sense that the word “rebellion” should be read to encompass similar threats to national security or US stability. Will that be enough to persuade this Supreme Court? But a decision authorizing Trump to use the National Guard to suppress a minor protest would be a sharp departure from the nation's history of caution regarding domestic use of the armed forces. They claim that “federal law enforcement agencies have been forced to operate under the constant threat of mob violence and to divert resources from enforcement efforts to protect federal agents and property.” Meanwhile, the Trump administration says, “local forces have failed to respond, or unaccountably delayed their response, even when federal agents face life-threatening violence.” In their view, while protesters have sometimes engaged in criminal activity, state and local police have been responsive to the federal government's needs, and much of the violence near the facility was provoked by bad policing from federal officials. Judge Perry summarized the Broadview Police Department's position, saying they believe that the “tone of the protesters” changed for the worse after federal officials made a show of force; “twenty to thirty federal agents parked across the street and walked toward the ICE Processing Center in camouflage tactical gear with masks covering their faces.” Broadview Police also complained that federal officials' “use of chemical agents against protestors ‘has often been arbitrary and indiscriminate,' at times being used on crowds as small as ten people.” Among other things, she noted that some of the Trump administration's declarations to her court contain factual errors or otherwise dubious claims. Two of Trump's witnesses, for example, “refer to arrests made on September 27, 2025 of individuals who were carrying weapons and assaulting federal agents,” but “neither declaration discloses that federal grand juries have refused to return an indictment against at least three of those individuals, which equates to a finding of a lack of probable cause that any crime occurred.” Judge Perry's determination that the Trump administration is not credible, and that the state and local police's version of events is, matters, because appellate courts are only supposed to second guess a trial judge's factual findings if they are “clearly erroneous.” So, the Supreme Court should presume that the Trump administration's portrait of widespread chaos outside of the Broadview facility is wrong. But many of the Republican justices are openly hostile toward district judges who do not share their views. So, there's a real chance that the Republican justices will resolve the Illinois case by simply assuming that order has broken down in Broadview and then interpreting the law as if Trump's claims are gospel. Paul Ingrassia quizzed FBI officials on their voting history. Now his extreme group chat comments have leaked. In his second term, Trump's rhetoric and policies regarding the trans community have become far more menacing. Leading right-wing figures are debating: Has blatant antisemitism become worryingly normalized among the young right? Broadly, there are 5 ways to constrain rogue federal law enforcement agents.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? But there's another problem that no one's talking about. BAY OF RANOBE, Madagascar — The coral reef itself was exquisite. The coral pieces, each a colony of living animals, took on a range of unusual forms, from cake platters and pencil shavings to antlers and brains. But there was one obvious thing missing: fish. Like a city without people, the reef was mostly empty — not only of fish, but also of crabs, eels, and other typical marine life on a coral reef. It was a sunny morning in September, and I was diving on a coral reef in southwest Madagascar, an island nation that sits east of continental Africa. Overfishing has emptied the ocean here of fish, which over time will allow algae to take over and outcompete the corals. This is a major problem for people along the coast of southwest Madagascar. Over the next few weeks, Vox is publishing a three-part series on conservation in Madagascar, supported by the BAND Foundation. This tension between human and wildlife survival is not unique to the coasts of southwest Madagascar. The government, meanwhile, has failed to provide even the most basic services like reliable electricity and water, let alone a pathway out of poverty and dependency on exploitation. That failure fueled weeks of youth-led protests this fall in Madagascar, where the median age is around 20. Under the sheer weight of human need, it's no surprise, then, that many of the country's iconic ecosystems are failing, too. Research suggests that since the turn of the century the country has lost as much as half of its live coral cover, and a similar extent of native forest. Nearly every species of lemur, a type of animal that you can only find in Madagascar, is now threatened with extinction. The government and nonprofit groups have spent decades — and hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign aid — trying to address these challenges, often relying on traditional environmental approaches, like setting up reserves that restrict fishing. But what Madagascar shows is that conservation projects don't usually work when they make it harder for desperately poor people to make a living. That may seem obvious, but it's one reason why many environmental projects have failed in the world's biodiversity hotspots, which are commonly found in poor nations. Places like Madagascar underscore the need for a different conservation approach — one that truly centers people, and what they need to live healthy and fulfilling lives. That's what ultimately brought me to the Bay of Ranobe, where I spent a week in September. Guided by fishers and a team of international researchers, a small organization is trying to restore the fishery and the food it provides, without actually restricting fishing. The sails — often made of discarded rice bags stitched together — propelled fishermen to shore in wooden canoes known as pirogues. Others had a bin filled up halfway with reef fish like triggerfish, lionfish, parrotfish, and baby barracudas. The tentacles were tangled together and partially submerged in ink. As someone from the US who doesn't fish, I felt unsettled in the face of so many dead and dying creatures. I normally encounter reef fish and octopuses in aquariums, on snorkel trips, or in the marketing materials for conservation groups. In the Bay of Ranobe, fishing is the primary source of income and a vital source of nutrition in coastal villages, according to Aroniaina “Aro” Manampitahiana Falinirina, a doctoral researcher who studies fisheries at the University of Toliara's marine research institute, IHSM. It's how people pay for food, school supplies, and transportation. And among certain communities — namely, the Vezo, an ethnic group with deep ancestral ties to the sea — fishing has been a way of life for generations. Speaking through an interpreter, Nambokely, one of the fishermen I met on the beach, told me that if he doesn't fish, he doesn't eat. It was as if we were riding on fairy dust. Once we were farther offshore, beams of light appeared below the waves, moving erratically in all directions — night fishermen. The fishermen spot their prey using waterproof torches, sometimes made by wrapping ordinary flashlights in a few condoms. After surfacing with an eel on his spear, one fisherman, a Vezo man named Jean Batiste, told me he fishes at night because he can catch more compared to during the day. “I'm worried,” Batiste told me that night on the water. The fishery in the Bay of Ranobe, and across much of southwest Madagascar, is in decline, and perhaps even collapsing. A number of studies from the region show that fishermen are catching fewer fish, and fewer fish species, compared to three or four decades ago. Some species — including certain kinds of parrotfish, which can help limit the growth of coral-harming algae — have disappeared altogether from some areas. “It's decreasing at a rate that has never been seen before,” said Gildas Todinanahary, a marine researcher and the director of IHSM. The fish people are catching are also smaller, indicating that fishermen may be netting more juveniles — a clear sign of overfishing. “People can't get enough food in one day.” A single fisherman was once able to earn, on a good day, around $10 or $15 in one outing, Nambokely told me. But today, groups of four or five fishermen will spend several hours on the water and might only catch enough to fill half a plastic wash basin with fish. A dozen small octopuses, meanwhile, are worth only around $2. “People can't get enough food in one day,” said Marcel Sebastian, an elderly fisherman I met in the village. He's been fishing in southwest Madagascar for more than 50 years. But now they only have dinner due to the scarcity of fish.” There are simply too many people fishing for the same fish. Meanwhile, widespread deforestation — which removes trees that stabilize the soil and help water seep underground — means that when it does rain, flooding can bury farmland under sediment. Faced with failing crops inland, farmers in southern Madagascar are increasingly migrating to the coasts in search of income from fishing instead. (Inland deforestation is also sending dirt into the ocean, which can smother coral reefs.) It's hard to find reliable population estimates for the Bay of Ranobe, but a dissertation from 2019 estimated that villages here were growing at an average rate of about 4.5 percent per year, meaning the local population would roughly double in 15 years. The global average population growth rate is around 1 percent. “A lot of the time, people who are coming from inland don't want to be here,” said Quinn Mitsuko Parker, a doctoral researcher at Stanford who studies fishing communities in the Bay of Ranobe. One morning, around the new moon, I went out on the water with a few fishermen at low tide. The water got deeper at first, but as we motored farther out, it became shallow again — until it was so shallow we could walk. We were on top of the barrier reef. It was a bizarre image: Here we were, in what felt like the middle of the ocean, standing in just a few inches of water. During especially low tides, part of the reef here is exposed, and fishers — in this case, mainly women — take advantage of these conditions. They search the reef by foot for octopuses, urchins, and other critters to eat or sell, an approach known as gleaning. At least a dozen women were gleaning when we arrived, their eyes fixed downward as they paced around. Some of them wielded spears, to stab octopuses, or large conch-like snail shells, which they use to crack open urchins. As we talked, she poked a spear under rocks in search of octopuses, occasionally pausing to grab a snail and put it in her bag. And while she knows gleaning can damage the coral — most of the exposed reef is already dead, in part because fishers sometimes crush corals under their feet or break them to grab hiding octopuses — she doesn't have a choice, she said. Doseline is the sole provider for her son, who's in school, she said. “My income [from fishing] is not enough,” she told me. For more than an hour, I watched Doseline search the reef. I found discarded shells occupied by crabs that looked like creatures from another world. Doseline, who wore her hair in pigtails, didn't have much luck. Over the last three decades, Madagascar has attracted an enormous amount of attention from international environmental groups and foreign donors. The island's wildlife is not only charismatic — lemurs! Because Madagascar has been isolated from other land masses for millions of years, animals there have had plenty of time to evolve into new species. Today, around 90 percent of the country's plants and animals are found nowhere else on Earth. Yet those threats are still getting worse, not better. But there are also serious problems with the traditional approach to conservation in Madagascar and other developing nations. In early September, just before political protests rocked Madagascar and the government collapsed, I flew from New York City to the capital, Antananarivo. Cripps and I stayed in the Bay of Ranobe for about a week, where we spent most of our time talking with fishers. They showed us a range of different fishing approaches, from spear fishing at night to “gleaning” — collecting sea creatures in the shallows at low tide. Drugged up on Dramamine, I saw a pretty incredible amount of sea life, though most of it was dead. Toward the end of our trip, we met University of Toliara's marine research institute (IHSM) director Gildas Todinanahary in Sarodrano — a coastal village built atop a sandbar — and went snorkeling to see some natural reefs. Todinanahary then took us to IHSM's field station, nearby, where we talked about what is (and is not) working in marine conservation. Much of our reporting was made possible thanks to a handful of Madagascar-based translators and ground support from Reef Doctor and staff at IHSM. Historically, environmental groups, foreign scientists, and the government in Madagascar bet big on protected areas as a means to safeguard nature, such as parks, marine protected areas, and nature reserves. But as research shows, those protection schemes have done little to stop environmental harm. “The conservation of our biodiversity through Madagascar protected areas' system for 30 years was a failure,” Madagascar's former environmental minister, Baomiavotse Vahinala Raharinirina, said in 2020. According to several environmental and development researchers I spoke to, that's because parks often don't address the reasons why people exploit nature in the first place. In some cases, they also disproportionately burden women fishers by restricting access to areas for gleaning, as Merrill Baker-Médard wrote in her book, Feminist Conservation: Politics and Power in Madagascar's Marine Commons. Another challenge is that NGOs in Madagascar, and to an extent worldwide, are often more accountable to their donors than they are to the local community, according to Emma Gibbons, who runs Reef Doctor, a small nonprofit in the Bay of Ranobe. Donors tend to fund short-term projects and they face few consequences if projects don't actually help people or ecosystems, Gibbons said. These issues are especially pronounced in southern Madagascar, nicknamed the “cemetery of projects,” because so many of those projects — from establishing solar water pumps to beekeeping — have failed. If there's a chance of conservation working, it has to be owned or guided by the community, rooted in a deep understanding of the local culture, and aligned with what people want, said Gibbons, a British national who's lived in Madagascar for two decades. “You can't tell people not to eat,” Gibbons said. It's this perspective that's informed the approach Gibbons is taking now. And to do that, they're essentially building new coral reefs from scratch in the Bay of Ranobe. Building artificial reefs is simpler than it sounds: She and her collaborators sink massive chunks of limestone offshore, forming long underwater rows of rocks that are each about 57 meters. That's roughly the length of a commercial airplane. They then “seed” those rocks with life using smaller constructions called autonomous reef monitoring structures (ARMS) that have spent several months accumulating corals, sponges, and other marine organisms on a natural reef. Those structures, made of stacked stone plates, are basically coral reef starter packs. So far, Reef Doctor has finished building two artificial reefs that cover about half an acre. The sea was calm and more green than blue when I arrived by boat above one of the artificial reefs, about a mile from shore, with marine biologist Mark Little. But we strapped on tanks and plunged in. As I sank down, the rows of rocks appeared dramatically through my foggy mask, as if I was descending on ruins of a lost city. Box fish, lionfish, and even young parrotfish — named for their bird-like beaks — crowded around them. At one point, a stingray appeared out of the murky beyond and passed right in front of me, before vanishing again. At least in this case, that approach seems to be working. “It's doing its job,” said Little, a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard University and Scripps Institute of Oceanography, when we were back in the boat. The purpose of this study is “to understand whether or not stewarding natural resources in this way can simultaneously benefit the ecosystem and benefit human nutrition and food security and human health,” Golden said. “We want to quantify the way that interventions like this — an environmental intervention — could be viewed as a public health intervention.” I can't help but feel like it's just nowhere near enough. “Within the broader situation, it's not going to work,” said Todinanahary, who works closely with Gibbons. Truly sustaining the reef and the fishery means providing coastal communities with other sources of income, Todinanahary told me. That means investing in education so people can learn new skills, like climate-resilient farming, and building out other non-exploitative industries. The country needs enormous, systemic change for conservation to really work. That requires good governance, and right now Madagascar hardly has a government. But as Todinanahary points out, NGOs and aid groups have poured millions of dollars into Madagascar for environmental projects. What if those groups had, instead, put all of that money toward education or health care? At times, it felt like watching an environmental and human crisis unfold in real time. Nonetheless, people like Gibbons, Todinanahary, and a growing number of smart Malagasy scientists are still determined to restore the fishery — because the stakes are just so high. That makes the consequences of doing nothing hard to stomach. Several years ago, Reef Doctor built a smaller artificial reef close to Vatosoa for people to fish on, and in exchange, local fishermen agreed to avoid this one, Gibbons told me. My expectations were still low, especially after diving reefs here that had no fish. The reef was formed by a species that grows thin, curved sheets of coral in layers around each other, like petals of a rose. And there were dozens of these living structures packed in together, so it felt like we were swimming over a bouquet. As I swam toward it, the cuttlefish reversed slowly. “The potential for recovery is still there,” Gibbons told me one evening, as we walked the beach at sunset, careful to avoid stepping on discarded spiny shells. Consumers are finally pushing back on AI-driven data expansion. Clean energy expansion could destroy this crucial climate solution. This technology could feed a world of 10 billion. What the climate movement is getting dead wrong.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Last month, in Tina Turner's hometown of Brownsville, Tennessee, a bronze statue honoring the late singer was erected. A statue goes up, and people start remembering. Thankfully, some noted, Turner was not alive to see it. The rest of us were not as fortunate. Back in 2009, the town of Celoron, New York, witnessed the unveiling of a statue known colloquially as “Scary Lucy,” a figure that was supposed to honor Lucille Ball but ended up looking more like a villain from a Bavarian fairy tale whose primary purpose is to scare children. There's also the infamously crooked Cristiano Ronaldo bust from 2017 that looks like it was made by a scorned rival, rather than an admiring fan. NBA star Dwyane Wade has one too, as does the late actor James Dean. Is there a larger conspiracy at hand, perhaps a cabal of sculptors who hate Lucille Ball and Dwyane Wade? Why haven't we freed ourselves from the chokehold of ugly bronze statues? The Tina Turner in their minds — shaped by performances, music videos, photos, interviews, and their own experiences — did not match up with the foreboding, bronze effigy that was also supposed to be Tina Turner. What appears to be Turner's hair is too big, too bulbous — it bears a resemblance to the orange Looney Tunes villain known as Gossamer. Why does statue Tina Turner have claw-like hands and bony digits? This type of scrutiny is what happens when you commission a hyper-realistic monument, says Alex Ungprateeb Flynn, a professor of art and anthropology at UCLA. Flynn said that because so many people are so familiar and have so many reference points with celebrities like Turner, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Lucille Ball, it's an uphill battle when a sculptor attempts a realistic depiction of their subject. It's even more difficult when someone's created a statue of Tina Turner, and the main question people have is whether or not said artist has ever even seen Tina Turner. Flynn said there are various factors that create what he kindly calls “uncanny results.” Making photo-realism the end goal is a strong instigator, mainly because that isn't what sculptors often seek to do. What critics think of as “good” sculpture is based on capturing the essence of a subject while also playing with depth and positioning — things that are often incompatible with wanting to sculpt a true-to-life model of a person. “Sometimes the truest portrait, it's not one that really is trying to be hyper accurate like this,” Flynn says. “If you want that, just go with photography.” Flynn also notes that while bronze can be a great material for sculpture, “deadline bronze” and putting a time limit on sculpture (e.g., an unveiling date) is where things can start to go wrong. Wouldn't you want someone to take their time with a piece that will live for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years? Yet, as Flynn explains, there's a growing immediacy when it comes to honoring people we deem legendary. “Before, people had the decency to wait until these people were dead,” Flynn says, pointing out various bronze statues in the sports world. If a sculptor really wanted to capture the thrill of Tina Turner's presence, they also probably wouldn't subject themselves to guidelines, or deadlines from an approval committee, says Mark Tribe, the MFA fine arts chair at the School of Visual Arts. People and committees commissioning these statues are just looking for something realistic and are choosing from a pool of artists who are willing to relinquish at least a little bit of their artistic freedom. The end result is that instead of a conversation about Turner's enduring legacy or her impact on music or the particular thrill of watching her perform “Proud Mary,” the only thing that anyone wants to talk about when they see this memorial is whether or not this statue looks like her. Theoretically, someone could come in and make a better statue of Tina Turner that's more flattering, but it would still spur the same, worn-out conversation. In speaking to experts like Tribe and Flynn about horrendous statues, I quickly understood that I needed to be more precise in tossing around words like “bad” and “horrific.” There's bad as in: The statue of Tina Turner looks like an ugly version of her. And there is bad as in: The monument was only created for resemblance's sake (and even then it failed). There didn't seem to be an attempt at capturing anything about her beyond the superficial. “If you want to create something and the worst thing people are going to do is roll their eyes and yawn, you make a bronze statue,” Tribe tells me. Tribe cites the Vietnam Veterans Memorial designed by Maya Lin. It wasn't an obvious bronze statue of a soldier. Yet, Lin's design, Tribe says, captured the complexity, the loss, and immensity in ways that many of us can now see and appreciate. Flynn, the UCLA professor, made a similar comparison when citing Auguste Rodin's “Monument to Balzac.” At the end of the 19th century, the Société des Gens de Lettres commissioned Rodin to create a sculpture to pay homage to novelist Honoré de Balzac. After seven years, Rodin created a sculpture that was more abstract and represented his interpretation of the writer's work, rather than a literal interpretation of Balzac's physique. “It was just this kind of looming presence in a robe. Contemporary people at the time, they called it just a sack of plaster,” Flynn says, detailing why the Société des Gens de Lettres absolutely hated it and ultimately rejected the piece — Rodin ended up taking it home. Rodin's model was eventually cast in bronze, many years after he died. While Rodin, Balzac, and the Vietnam War couldn't be more different than the Queen of Rock and Roll's legacy, these debates are all part of the bigger conversation about how we want to remember people and make sure that other people do, too. Should we remind people that these subjects existed — or make bold attempts to show people what they meant to us? The Tina Turner statue's fault is rooted in that it's too lifelike. They wanted something spectators would recognize, not one artist's idea of another person's essence. Of course, there's a chance that criticism will flip-flop, like it did with Rodin. This technology could feed a world of 10 billion. Why A House of Dynamite is so damn scary. The retro, cryptofascist aesthetic of all those ICE recruitment ads, explained. Experts created a coding scheme for kids' media quality. It's not millennial cringe to wonder if you can enjoy the work of problematic artists.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What the man who has Trump's ear learned in prison The adult-education program at Federal Correctional Institution Danbury needed a civics teacher. And that is how Steve Bannon, the man who stood accused of helping orchestrate an effort to undermine American democracy and to overturn a presidential election, found himself on the federal payroll making 25 cents an hour teaching civics to fellow convicts. Bannon's class met up to five days a week, with as many as 50 inmates showing up for the sessions. Whether that impressive attendance had more to do with Bannon's lectures or the sweltering summer heat is anyone's guess—the classes were held in one of the only buildings at Danbury with air-conditioning. For four months, he would be housed in a two-story cellblock with 83 other men, all of whom shared two showers. Bannon's willingness to serve time rather than cave to Nancy Pelosi cemented his status as a towering figure in the MAGA movement. Danbury is not the kind of prison where you would typically find someone like Bannon. Bannon wants you to know that he was locked up with hardened criminals in a real prison. Just a couple of weeks after his release, I sat down with Bannon in the cluttered living room of his townhouse on Capitol Hill. We spoke for nearly three hours about his time in prison. It was a dialogue that started with a phone call the day he was released, in late October 2024, and continued over dozens of telephone interviews as the former inmate resumed his role as one of Trump's most important outside advisers. “I wasn't in a camp like that pussy Cohen,” Bannon told me, referring to Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen. Danbury is, in Bannon's words, “a rough place”—“a fucking low-medium security with gangbangers and fucking drugs and stabbings.” Soon after he arrived, he told me he saw a group of inmates “take a shiv out and fucking rip a guy.” There was “blood everywhere.” When police officers asked Bannon what he'd seen, he refused to tell them anything. One evening in July, all three were tuned to the same channel, to the reports from a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Bannon had been in the computer room when a guy raced down to get him: “Hey, boss,” the inmate said. Bannon had long feared that something like this would happen. I had spoken to him weeks before his prison sentence began, and he told me the only way Trump wouldn't return to the White House was if the election was stolen or he was assassinated. The Democrats, the media, “they're giving moral justification that whoever takes [Trump] out is a hero.” In a speech that summer, he warned a crowd in Detroit, at a conference sponsored by Charlie Kirk's Turning Point USA, that “between now and Election Day, they're going to try to take out so many people.” It was, he predicted, “victory or death!” The Secret Service had failed to protect Trump. Bannon watched as a blood-flecked Trump stood up and shouted, “Fight! He used his post as “chief strategist” in the first Trump presidency to go after Republicans inside and outside the White House who were unwilling to do what was necessary for Trump to transform Washington. After seven months, only a few items were checked off, and Bannon was fired. The truly radical Trump presidency would come later. Bannon wasn't out of Trump's good graces for long, though. And unlike many of Trump's allies, he did not waver in his support after the failed attempt to overturn the election. In fact, he became even more devoted, building his video podcast, War Room—the twice-daily dose of resentment and retribution for Trump supporters—into the center of the MAGA-media ecosystem. At least once, Bannon interrupted an interview to answer his phone. Bannon lined up an eclectic group of about 20 guest hosts—including his daughter Maureen, Rudy Giuliani's son, and Osama Bin Laden's niece—to keep the podcast going while he was behind bars. I'm not in the media,” Bannon said shortly before going to prison. If Trump had shown up to the convention declaring, “‘Fuck them, they tried to kill me,' I think the country would have been on fire,” I told Bannon. “But you would have been fanning the flames.” “I would have revved that thing up to a 10.” In prison, Bannon spent as much time as he could in the computer room, using one of the four PCs—equipped with a two-decade-old Windows operating system—that were shared by the 84 prisoners in his cellblock. He would sign up to use the computers for an hour, and then, after a 15-minute break, sign up again. Bannon was cognizant of “prison etiquette” about not hogging the computers, but said that he would sometimes spend 10 hours a day “working on campaign stuff.” David A. Graham: What to cheer about in the sentencing of Steve Bannon The devices were not connected to the internet, but he could communicate via email with a few dozen preapproved individuals. His daughter Maureen, whom he calls Mo, and his chief financial officer, Grace Chong, helped him keep up with the news. “They had a system of sending me, first off, all polling data, everything like that, analytics,” he remembered. “They would send it to me, and I'd be able to comment and ask questions.” They also sent him images of various news websites so he could see what stories were online even though he didn't have direct access to the internet. Bannon claims that an investigative officer at Danbury—an official he described as “pure MAGA”—had warned him that his communications were being reviewed by “Main Justice,” otherwise known as the Biden administration. “I don't—the Bureau of Prisons could go back through it. We had a way that they could get to him.” And in the days following the assassination attempt, Bannon let campaign officials know that he believed they were making a huge mistake by trying to reduce tensions rather than raise them. You're not going to have that ‘unity,'” he remembered saying. And quite frankly, throw down harder that they tried to assassinate him. As Bannon watched speaker after speaker at the convention praise Trump's message of unity, he found himself growing angrier and angrier. “If I had been around, that would have never happened,” he said. Though much of Bannon's attention for those four months was focused on the world outside Danbury, he said he learned a lot in prison. “You can actually get a sense of where the country is in prison,” he told me. These mass incarcerations are out of control for nonviolent drug charges.” Bannon wanted me to know he didn't hang out just with the other nonviolent offenders. One of his closest prison buddies was an Italian guy named Vito—”the single biggest Trump fan you've ever seen,” Bannon told me. He had been locked up for nearly three decades after pleading guilty to five murders and several other crimes, including arson, racketeering, and attempted murder. When he pleaded guilty in 1998, the judge asked him to describe his crimes. “I killed Ralph Sciulla by shooting him in the head,” he said, reading from a piece of paper. Vito has been a free man since April. Bannon helped him get an early release—after serving 26 years of his 38-year sentence—through the First Step Act, the criminal-justice-reform bill signed into law by Trump in 2018. A friend captured on video the moment Vito walked out of Danbury—swaggering in a white Sergio Tacchini tracksuit, pristine tennis shoes, and dark sunglasses, his hair slicked back. “Come on,” Vito can be heard saying as he gives his girlfriend a hug. Vito's girlfriend sent the video to Bannon, who watched with gleeful pride at his friend's composure. “That guy is so impressive,” Bannon told me. Bannon had been a critic of the First Step Act—it was one of the only things he disagreed with Trump about. The initiative, which sought to improve conditions in prison and to give inmates more opportunities for education and early release, had been pushed by Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, whom Bannon often clashed with. It is our ticket to a massive coalition,” Bannon told me. He had only praise for the Trump administration for flying two planeloads of alleged Venezuelan gang members, without the benefit of a hearing or reasonable notice, to the CECOT prison in El Salvador—a place that actually resembles hell on Earth. Hey, tough break for a swell guy,” Bannon said on War Room in March.) Read: No one was supposed to leave alive Bannon's time in Danbury convinced him that Trump was going to win again. “No Black or Hispanic men are going to vote for Kamala Harris, because of the mass incarcerations,” he told me. Directionally, though, Bannon's broader point stands: Joe Biden did 35 percentage points better than Harris among both groups in 2020.) But the main thing Bannon learned in prison is that he doesn't want to go back there. He was released on October 29, at 3 a.m.—because prison authorities wanted to avoid the commotion of a press conference. As he walked out of the prison gate, he was met by Maureen, who ran over and gave him a hug. It was exactly one week before the 2024 election, and within hours of his release—before 6 a.m.—Bannon's phone lit up. My Steeeeeve!” Trump said as they both laughed. “You're a convict.” The former president had lots of questions for Bannon about his life behind bars. If Trump lost the election the following week, there was a very real chance that he would end up in prison. He has put his personal legal team in charge of the Justice Department, squeezed top law firms to do his bidding, and upended a half century's worth of ethics and anti-corruption reforms by mixing family business deals with government business. He is attempting to use the Federal Communications Commission to police and punish television networks that he says treat him unfairly and is pressuring U.S. attorney's offices to prosecute his political enemies. From his powerful post on War Room, Bannon is pushing the aggrieved president to use his power to not just defeat his enemies but destroy them, and Trump is pursuing that agenda to a much greater degree than he did the first time around. The unity talk Bannon so despises is gone completely. Two days after the killing of Charlie Kirk, Bannon attacked Republicans who were calling for people to turn down the partisan rhetoric. Bannon hated it when Governor Spencer Cox stepped forward the day Kirk was killed and said we had to “stop hating our fellow Americans.” “We're not gonna say it's a time to bring people together,” Bannon told the foot soldiers of the MAGA movement. At times, Trump still turns to Bannon for guidance, as if he were working down the hall from the Oval Office. On Monday of that week, President Trump convened his top national security advisers in his dining room adjacent to the Oval Office. French President Emmanuel Macron had just met with Trump, and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer was due soon. Both were pleading with Trump to continue military support for Ukraine and its president. Zelensky himself would be coming to Washington in a few days, though the visit had not yet been announced. Trump's advisers had worked out an agreement with their Ukrainian counterparts whereby, in exchange for continued military support, Ukraine would promise the United States a share in the development of its natural resources, including its deposits of rare-earth minerals. He looked out at the most important officials in his administration: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and Vice President J. D. Vance. Bannon saw Waltz calling and sent him to voicemail with a text: “The show is live. I'll call you at noon.” A few minutes later, his phone rang again. This time he could see it was Trump calling from his personal cellphone. “Hey, Steve, I've got the boys here,” Trump said. “I hear you don't love this deal,” Trump said. But the deal “ties us to Ukraine.” Bannon, who knew there had been talk of a Zelensky meeting, referred to the Ukrainian president as “that punk”: “If that punk comes here, he's going to want a security guarantee,” Bannon said. You can't trust any of the Europeans. You can't trust Putin either, but these guys are really slippery.” Read: A man who actually stands up to Trump “You're not in a good position,” Trump told Zelensky, his voice rising. “You don't have the cards right now.” “You're gambling with World War III,” Trump repeated. “And what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country that's backed you far more than a lot of people said they should have.” It was the kind of tough-guy language that would make a mob hitman proud. For nearly a century, America had helped keep peace in Europe, standing shoulder to shoulder with our allies against aggressors. But there in the Oval Office, Trump was doing more than berating an American ally; he was declaring to the world that America was no longer the country that, in John F. Kennedy's words, would “pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.” Now a U.S. president was showing an ally the true meaning of “America First.” Trump's final words before the cameras left the Oval Office made clear that, although Trump was angry, he was also enjoying himself. Great television, perhaps, but, thanks in part to Trump's favorite convict, Trump is now doing far more than playing to the television cameras. He's changing America in ways that will long outlive his presidency. This article has been adapted from Jonathan Karl's book, Retribution: Donald Trump and the Campaign That Changed America.</p>

He announced the start of the ballroom construction in a post on Truth Social on Monday evening. “I am pleased to announce that ground has been broken on the White House grounds to build the new, big, beautiful White House Ballroom,” Trump posted. “Completely separate from the White House itself, the East Wing is being fully modernized as part of this process, and will be more beautiful than ever when it is complete!” The ballroom will be 90,000 square feet and accommodate up to 650 guests. The renovation will cost over $200 million and is being funded by private donations, including personal contributions from the president. “President Trump, and other patriot donors, have generously committed to donating the funds necessary to build this approximately $200 million structure,” the White House announced in July. “For more than 150 years, every President has dreamt about having a Ballroom at the White House to accommodate people for grand parties, State Visits, etc,” the president said. The White House Ballroom is being privately funded by many generous Patriots, Great American Companies, and, yours truly. This Ballroom will be happily used for Generations to come!”</p>

Rep. Mary Miller (R-IL) condemned the protester's words in a statement on X. “A staff member at Wilbur Wright College is calling for ICE agents to get ‘shot' and ‘wiped out. “This is a criminal threat that should be investigated,” she added. A DOJ spokesperson told Fox News that protesters should “think twice” before “inciting violence.” “Any official encouraging reckless behavior should think twice before inciting further violence and putting federal agents in harm's way.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump's nominee to lead the Office of Special Counsel, Paul Ingrassia, was accused of making several provocative remarks in a group chat with fellow Republicans, including denigrating Martin Luther King Jr. and saying that he had a “Nazi streak,” in a disputed context. In response, Thune and several Senate Republicans called on the president to recall Ingrassia, saying he wouldn't be approved. Ingrassia is scheduled to testify in front of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Thursday. Rick Scott (R-FL), Ron Johnson (R-WI), and James Lankford (R-OK) also came out against the nominee. “I can't imagine how anybody can be antisemitic in this country. “I have tons of questions for him,” Lankford said, adding he “can't imagine supporting that.” Ingrassia's future was put into question after several alleged inflammatory messages were leaked to Politico, most coming from discussions throughout 2024 in group chats with Republican operatives. Among the alleged remarks were a few in which he denigrated King and several black holidays. “MLK Jr. was the 1960s George Floyd and his ‘holiday' should be ended and tossed into the seventh circle of hell where it belongs,” one message read. A message provided by one leaker showed Ingrassia allegedly saying, “Blacks behave that way because that's their natural state … You can't change them,” during a discussion around why some Republicans believe Democrats make black people into victims. Perhaps the most controversial was one where he responded to a participant mocking him, saying he “belongs in the Hitler Youth with Ubergruppenfuhrer Steve Bannon,” to which he responded, “I do have a Nazi streak in me from time to time, I will admit it.” Ingrassia's lawyer, Edward Andrew Paltzik, argued that all the messages could have been edited or taken out of context, but alluded to the “Nazi streak” comment specifically in suggesting it was self-deprecating humor. “Looks like these texts could be manipulated or are being provided with material context omitted. “In reality, Mr. Ingrassia has incredible support from the Jewish community because Jews know that Mr. Ingrassia is the furthest thing from a Nazi,” he added. “In this age of AI, authentication of allegedly leaked messages, which could be outright falsehoods, doctored, or manipulated, or lacking critical context, is extremely difficult,” he said. “What is certain, though, is that there are individuals who cloak themselves in anonymity while executing their underhanded personal agendas to harm Mr. Ingrassia at all costs.</p>
