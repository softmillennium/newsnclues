Arsenal thumped Atletico Madrid 4-0 in a hugely impressive Champions League outing on Tuesday, as Gabriel Magalhaes scored and assisted while Viktor Gyokeres netted a confidence-boosting brace. Three of the Gunners' four goals came directly from set-pieces, as Mikel Arteta's side became the second English side to beat Atletico in Europe this season, after Liverpool. 

Arsenal had an opening within the first five minutes, as Eberechi Eze took aim from outside the area, and his shot took a looping deflection before crashing against the crossbar. Midway through the half, meanwhile, David Raya made a terrible mistake, as he attempted to shepherd the ball out of play, only to lose possession, and after Atletico took their throw-in quickly, Julian Alvarez could only shoot narrowly wide of the far post. 

After the half-hour mark, Arsenal thought they had the lead, as Martin Zubimendi won the ball high and fed Bukayo Saka; his shot was tapped in by Gabriel Martinelli, but VAR correctly ruled the Brazil international offside. 

After the resumption in the second half, Atletico also hit the bar, as Alvarez shot from the edge of the box and sent Raya scrambling, only for the Spaniard to be saved by the woodwork. But it was Arsenal who took the lead, four minutes before the hour, with Gabriel heading home a fine free-kick delivery from Declan Rice. 

Martinelli added a second just after the 60-minute mark, as he ran onto a fine Myles Lewis-Skelly through ball and found the bottom corner, before Viktor Gyokeres all but ended the game as a contest with a scrappy finish from the edge of the six-yard box. 

Gyokeres added his second, and Arsenal's fourth, on 70 minutes, after another exceptional Rice delivery found Gabriel at the back post, marking the end of a whirlwind 13-minute period in which the north London side marked themselves out as genuine European contenders this season.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brooklyn Football Club on Tuesday announced the appointment of former U.S. men's international Brian McBride as general manager as the club builds toward its USL Championship debut in 2026. BROOKLYN, N.Y. — Brooklyn Football Club on Tuesday announced the appointment of former U.S. men's international Brian McBride as general manager as the club builds toward its USL Championship debut in 2026. McBride will oversee all sporting operations for the men's and women's teams, including roster construction, technical staffing, performance analytics, and long-term player development. Brooklyn FC's men's team will kick off its inaugural USL Championship season in March 2026. In the months ahead, the club will unveil a head coach, technical staff, and initial player signings, alongside new community initiatives and sponsor partnerships. “Brooklyn is a place that moves with intent. “We're not just putting players on the pitch. After his playing career, he served as USMNT general manager from 2020-23. He played in Major League Soccer and the English Premier League, where he became a Fulham FC standout and two-time club player of the year. In 2014, he was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame. “This is a major moment for the club and the borough,” Brooklyn Football Club president David Barry said in a statement. “Brian brings a rare blend of experience, leadership, and vision; from his elite playing career to his experience with the next generation of American soccer stars. He understands what it means to build something that reflects this community, hardwork and determination. Brooklyn FC is planning a community event at Industry City on Oct. 29, where supporters will have a first chance to meet McBride and hear more about the men's team. The event is being developed in partnership with the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, Brooklyn Made, and Fort Hamilton Distillery, with participation from local youth soccer clubs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tickets for next summer's FIFA World Cup have only recently went on sale but already there are real question marks over how the process is being handled. FIFA's use of dynamic pricing has been widely criticized, with NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani among those who have had their say on the matter. Mamdani told The Athletic: “These kinds of policies from FIFA are ones that threaten to price out the very people that make this game so special. In our fight for making the most expensive city in America affordable, it's a fight that is not limited just to housing, childcare and public transit. He continued: “I've spoken to a number of New Yorkers who tried to buy tickets, and it wasn't only an issue of just how unaffordable the tickets were, but also just the mess of that system. So far, however, there has been no indication that FIFA are likely to make any significant changes. Heimo Schirgi, FIFA's World Cup 2026 chief operating officer, advised supporters to buy their tickets as soon as possible, to avoid getting stung by the price increases. “So that's the message: ‘Get your tickets early,' because anything could happen.” Whether you're into NFL touchdowns, NBA buzzer-beaters, world-class soccer goals, or MLB home runs, our app has it all.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump hosts a Rose Garden Club Lunch with Senate Republicans at the White House Tim Howard and Landon Donovan disagree with AC Milan over their reported frustration with U.S. Soccer for playing Christian Pulisic vs Australia. In the wake of the injury, reports surfaced suggesting that AC Milan, Pulisic's club team, was upset with U.S. Soccer for playing him at all in a game that they viewed as being of relatively low importance. “They haven't had their team together for a major tournament like the Gold Cup. They don't have a World Cup qualifying [campaign]. So actually, this was essentially... a World Cup qualifier for us. Donovan echoed Howard's sentiments and noted that Milan's frustration is particularly vexing considering the ways in which U.S. Soccer has helped them previously. He didn't bring him in this summer to the Gold Cup. Additionally, during his first window as USMNT Manager in October of 2024, Pochettino allowed Pulisic to fly back to Italy early, missing a match vs arch-rival Mexico in the process. Howard did suggest that there are certain situations where a player might be feeling the effects of overuse and could be at greater risk for injury, but this did not appear to be one of those situations. I think it's crazy for Milan to suggest that he shouldn't have played.” Pulisic will now likely miss the USMNT's next two friendlies in mid-November against South American opponents, Paraguay and Uruguay.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Before Real Madrid can look ahead to El Clásico at the weekend, they must first take on Juventus in a heavyweight Champions League encounter at the Santiago Bernabéu. Barring one lopsided defeat to Atlético Madrid, Los Blancos have executed a near-flawless start to their first season under Xabi Alonso. The Spanish giants are hoping to remain perfect on Europe's biggest stage when they host Juventus on Wednesday evening. Three months later, Alonso's XI will look different, especially given Los Blancos' current injury list. David Alaba, Antonio Rüdiger, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Dani Carvajal, Dean Huijsen, Ferland Mendy and Dani Ceballos are all unavailable for the clash. Here's what Real Madrid's XI could look like against Juventus. Sign Up to Get Informed With SI FC. GK: Thibaut Courtois—The Belgian will hope to replicate his Club World Cup quarterfinals performance and make it two clean sheets in two matches against Juventus. RB: Federico Valverde—Carvajal and Alexander-Arnold are back in training, but the right flank will belong to Valverde until either player regains full match fitness. CB: Raúl Asencio—A disappointing summer is a thing of the past for Asencio, who has filled in admirably in times of emergency this season. CB: Éder Militão—The Brazil international is the leader of Real Madrid's backline, but must not take any risks with the Clásico just days away. LB: Álvaro Carreras—Carreras has quietly delivered solid performance after solid performance since his struggles in the Madrid derby, but he is in for a large test against Francisco Conceição. CM: Arda Güler—The 20-year-old has gone from barely playing last season to becoming a key member of Alonso's XI. Güler already has eight goal contributions in 2025–26. RW: Franco Mastantuono—What Mastantuono lacks in production he makes up for with his dribbling ability and creativity on the right wing. Mbappé already has 15 goals to his name this campaign. LW: Vinícius Júnior—The 25-year-old returns to the XI as he continues his pursuit of his first European goal contribution this season.

Tennessee soccer player Reese Mattern was called up to the U.S. Under-20 Women's National Team training camp on Monday.

Mattern, a sophomore forward for the Lady Vols, is one of 24 players set to participate in training camp, which will be held Wednesday through Oct. 30 at the University of Kansas Health System Training Center in Overland Park, Kansas, home of the 2025 NWSL Shield winner Kansas City Current.

Training camp Oct. 27-29 will be held concurrently with the senior USWNT's visit to Kanas City for its match against New Zealand at CPKC Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri.

Training camp will be the first for head coach Vicky Jepson. She is with US Soccer after a stint with Tottenham Hotspur, serving as the club's first-team senior assistant head coach. Jepson also served as interim head coach.

Mattern also participated in two under-19 camps in 2025.

She has started 14 matches for the Lady Vols in 2025, totaling two goals and two assists in 16 matches. Mattern scored a game-winning goal in the Lady Vols', 1-0, victory over TexasA&M on Sept. 26.

For Real Madrid and Endrick, the start of the new season has brought more questions than answers.

After arriving with immense expectation and wearing the club's iconic No.9 shirt, the Brazilian teenager has spent the first months of Xabi Alonso's reign watching from the sidelines.

He has been named in several matchday squads but his wait for a first appearance of the season goes on.

It was not meant to be this way with Endrick ending his debut campaign with seven goals in just 847 minutes but a hamstring injury suffered in May did halt that momentum and forced him to miss the Club World Cup where academy graduate Gonzalo Garcia stole the spotlight with four goals in six matches.

Since then, the 21-year-old Spaniard has become a trusted deputy to Kylian Mbappe whose blistering start of 15 goals in 11 games has made him the first name on Alonso's teamsheet.

And now according to Fabrizio Romano, Madrid now expect Endrick to leave on loan in January and the player himself wants minutes to boost his chances of making Brazil's 2026 World Cup squad.

According to the French outlet L'Equipe - Marseille remain interested in signing Endrick on loan when the window opens and with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Amine Gouiri set to leave for the Africa Cup of Nations, the French side are searching for attacking depth.

Endrick is believed to be open to the move, viewing it as an opportunity to play consistently and strengthen his World Cup ambitions while gaining valuable experience in European football.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gremio forward, Francis Amuzu has dismissed claims that his renewed desire to play for the Black Stars is driven by Ghana's qualification for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. The 26-year-old, who previously turned down a national team invitation in 2022, recently declared his readiness to wear the Ghana jersey, a decision that has stirred mixed reactions among fans and pundits. Many believe Amuzu's timing is no coincidence, coming just days after Ghana qualified for the next World Cup. Francis Amuzu declares readiness to play for Ghana at the 2026 World Cup But speaking to Asempa FM, the Belgium-born winger stressed that his choice stems from a deep sense of pride and a promise to his father that he will play for Ghana. “To be honest, it is not for the World Cup. Two years ago, I made my Ghanaian passport. He further revealed that preparations for his switch to represent Ghana started long before the World Cup qualification was secured. They told me let's make the passport ready and everything. I am proud of it because it can help me for many things, not only for the national team,” he added. His father, Theophilus Amuzu, is a former Hearts of Oak player who also represented Ghana at the U20 level.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Football Manager 26 will have a revamped international management module later in its cycle complete with a FIFA license, on top of the Premier League license at launch. FM26 will be the latest entry into the iconic Football Manager series with a brand new game engine, UI (user interface) and loads of other new features such as licenses never before seen in the franchise. "We took international management out of FM25 because only five per cent of people were playing it and the reason for that wasn't because they didn't want to play it, it's just because it wasn't very good," Sports Interactive studio director Miles Jacobson OBE openly told indy100. Miles Jacobson speaking at the Soccerex Global Convention in 2016  Getty Images The FIFA license means FM26 will include the official licenses for the World Cup, Women's World Cup and Club World Cup with further tournaments, such as the Youth World Cups across men's and women's football, to follow. As well as that, there will be a completely revamped international management module in a content update. Jacobson revealed it all came about because the studio has been working with FIFA on the World Cup of Football Manager - and that Sports Interactive actually previously turned down the chance to work with FIFA before that. "We actually said 'international management isn't great inside the game, so, no'. "But doing FIFAe, we got to know that team better and started talking to them about what our plans were and it makes total sense going into a World Cup year to be an official part of the tournament. The new FIFA World Cup license will have all the details and graphics expected - which is exactly why it's not available at launch. "They're not going to have those assets until January time so we can't make it look like the real tournament until those are in place. Argentina are the defending FIFA World Cup champions / Getty Images The international management module will release as part of a content update later in the year and Jacobson said there are plans to release fresh content throughout each game's cycle more frequently. He said: "We'll gradually add new features instead of just patching it. The advanced access beta on PC through Steam and Epic Games launches on 23 October and can be accessed be pre-purchasing the game. How to join the indy100's free WhatsApp channel</p>

Sports Interactive has signed a multi-yeaer partnership with FIFA to bring more licenses to Football Manager games. 

The deal grants the Football Manager series official licences for FIFA's major tournaments, including the FIFA World Cup 2026 in Canada, Mexico, and the USA.

Starting with Football Manager 26, the series will feature officially branded FIFA tournaments, including the FIFA World Cup, FIFA Women's World Cup, and FIFA Club World Cup.

Getting set for launch 

The partnership also coincides with a revamped, playable International Management mode coming in a 2026 content update for FM26 across all platforms ahead of the FIFA World Cup 26.

Full details are yet to be shared, but Sports Interactive confirmed that FM26 will include official kits for all 48 FIFA World Cup 26 teams, along with authentic broadcast graphics and tournament branding for next year's edition.

The new FIFA deal comes after Sega and Sports Interactive cancelled FM25 across all platforms due to development challenges, marking the first time the series has skipped a release since 2004. 

The title, which was set to deliver the series' biggest technical and visual leap through a switch to the Unity engine, faced setbacks related to player experience and interface design. FM26 will now launch globally on November 4th, 2025. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Next summer's tournament will feature 48 countries and will be jointly hosted by the United States of America, Canada, Mexico. Other home nations Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland still have a chance of making it, but will likely need to go through the play-offs. In Africa, Algeria, Cape Verde, Ivory Coast, Egypt, Ghana, Morocco, Senegal, South Africa and Tunisia have all secured qualification automatically. While Cameroon, DR Congo, Gabon and Nigeria will battle it out in two semi-finals and a final next month for the continent's final spot. But one African territory that will not be heading to the World Cup is Western Sahara. Western Sahara covers a huge stretch of North-West Africa, with a total area of 272,000 km2, compared to the UK at 244,376 km2. But it is far more sparsely populated, with a population of approximately 560,000, while the UK is home to an estimated 69 million people. But because they are not a member of CAF or FIFA, the team cannot compete in World Cup qualifiers or the tournament itself. Instead, Western Sahara are members of World Unity Football Allegiance, an international body for football teams not affiliated with FIFA. WUFA only has 19 members, including the Chagos Islands, Yorkshire and Kashmir. In February, Cas upheld an appeal by the Algerian Football Federation after Moroccan club RS Berkane were allowed to wear a kit showing an extended map of the country. It caused a row that led to both games between RS Berkane and Algeria's USM Alger being called off. James is a sports journalist who specialises in football and Formula 1.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Zohran Mamdani is smiling, but this time his cause for excitement has little to do with the New York City mayoral race. Mamdani, the Democrat nominee, is two weeks out from the ballot which will determine whether he sees off competition from independent candidate Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat who lost out to him in the primary, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. He is pleased with Amorim, the head coach of Manchester United, because they unexpectedly won 2-1 away to reigning champions and arch-rivals Liverpool earlier in the day. “Four defeats in a row for Liverpool,” he grins. Unusually for a New York City mayoral candidate, Mamdani has chosen to ingrain soccer issues into his campaign. On Sunday night, he attended a community soccer tournament his campaign called the ‘Cost of Living Classic', with his fans sporting campaign-issued blue, white and orange scarves. In September, he launched a “Game Over Greed” petition. This called on FIFA, soccer's world governing body, to reverse its dynamic pricing policy for the 2026 men's World Cup, which will be hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico next June and July. It also asked FIFA to reinstate a cap on ticket resales for the tournament, and set aside 15 per cent of tickets for local residents at a discount. But most New Yorkers will be priced out of watching it live. Sign our petition calling on @FIFAWorldCup to put game over greed. FIFA's first batch of tickets went on sale over the past month, with prices ranging from $60 for the cheapest group-stage seats to $6,730 (just over £5,000) for the most expensive tickets for the final at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, a few miles west of New York City. However, those prices were subject to variable pricing, meaning they adjust based on demand. FIFA raised ticket prices for nine World Cup games within the first day of tickets going on sale. His speechwriter Julian Gerson says references to other leading soccer players in one address were replaced by Mamdani, who wanted to include Bukayo Saka and William Saliba because they are among his favorites in the Arsenal squad. In a diverse city, Mamdani's personal love of soccer also plays well with younger cohorts, who are key to his support, as well as being another tool to connect with immigrant communities across New York's five boroughs. Born in the east African country of Uganda, Mamdani moved with his family to New York at the age of seven, and then fell in love with Arsene Wenger's Arsenal side, which won three Premier League titles between 1998 and 2004. I grew up with Kolo Toure, Kanu, Alex Song, Lauren and Emmanuel Eboue. I loved David Seaman, Sylvain Wiltord, all these guys. I've gone to a few Arsenal games, many with my uncle. In the context of the mayoral race, soccer and its ticket pricing are relevant to New York because eight World Cup matches will take place at MetLife Stadium, even if FIFA's host city agreement is with both New York City and neighboring New Jersey. It is also becoming an increasingly political matter, with U.S. President Donald Trump twice floating the possibility of moving already-scheduled tournament games to different cities. And with his campaign against FIFA's pricing, Mamdani has identified a political opportunity to tie his affordability and cost-of-living platform to an event that will dominate next summer across the United States and beyond. “As a lifelong soccer fan, I have grown up with memories of the World Cup; whether watching on TV or being there myself,” he says. “Yet these kinds of policies from FIFA are ones that threaten to price out the very people that make this game so special. In our fight for making the most expensive city in America affordable, it's a fight that is not limited just to housing, childcare and public transit. Mamdani acknowledges that he is facing an uphill battle to influence FIFA's policy, although he points out the organization has now confirmed it will retain ring-fenced allocations set aside for specific fan categories at a fixed price. FIFA has not, however, clarified how many tickets will be set aside or what the fixed price point may be. “That is only part of what we are demanding,” he says. “I've spoken to a number of New Yorkers who tried to buy tickets, and it wasn't only an issue of just how unaffordable the tickets were, but also just the mess of that system. He describes some of the more extreme resale prices as “absurd”. He adds: “FIFA is clearly trying to pursue its initial goal of maximising revenue and looking to take every step such that they could do so.” FIFA might argue that revenues from the World Cup are redistributed across the global game, funding soccer federations which require this financial support to function. Mamdani counters: “I don't think a stable future for soccer can be built upon the denial of working-class fans being able to watch the game themselves. What about those who question whether it is the place of politicians to involve themselves in sporting matters? He bristles: “Sport has been so commercialized and corporatized that fans have become viewed as a commodity. It is the place of leaders to step up when we see profit as the only motive, to an extent where so many who used to attend these very events can now not even conceive of doing so. “What I'm asking for in my petition is all precedented. This is how FIFA has operated in the past. We have become numb to the continued commodification of the game, where asking FIFA to just do what they're doing in Mexico (where ticket resale is prohibited) is seen as an audacious request.” When I tried to buy tickets to the Cricket World Cup last year, which was taking place on Long Island, it was unbelievable how difficult it was and how much you had to engage with scalping as a fact of life.” This is a vision of a city where New Yorkers can do more than just struggle, where they can also enjoy themselves and do so without having to mortgage their dreams in order to be a spectator. “We've seen a number of artists respond to the backlash of dynamic pricing by ending it for their own concerts. “I can tell you I've had a number of New Yorkers reach out to me, some of whom don't share my politics on many other issues, who've been heartened by the understanding that it is actually a political question whether we price New Yorkers out of sporting events, out of cultural events. “There's been this growing sense of resignation that when your favorite team or your favorite artist comes to town, you will either have to put the money you would have spent on rent towards that ticket, or you will have to watch online.” The U.S. president has called him a communist — Mamdani describes himself as a democratic socialist — warning that New York may see federal funding cuts if he becomes mayor. We've seen this president's policies are ones that not only endanger the ability of anyone looking to plan out their visit to this city but they're also ones that have led many to question whether they would be safe in the city, specifically regarding ICE (the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency). Yet I've had many reach out to me to ask if there will be ICE agents outside of the stadium or, ‘Will I have to carry my documentation on me at all times?' During this summer's Club World Cup in the U.S., FIFA received complaints from fans about alleged sightings of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and ICE officials at stadiums hosting matches. In a statement to The Athletic in September, a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson said that despite the reports made to FIFA, neither ICE nor CPB conducted enforcement, describing it as “another case of fear-mongering.” Mamdani has also urged the Trump administration to facilitate access for those seeking to attend next year's World Cup and make clear that visitors are welcome. He says that New York City is anticipating a $4billion drop in tourism revenues “this year alone.” He says: “I am running to lead this city to make clear that this is a city not just of the world, where 40 percent of us were born outside of this country, myself included, but one that welcomes the world. Should Mamdani win power, he says he will appoint a World Cup czar in the Mayor's office to assist the New York/New Jersey host committee and FIFA. “That means using this as an opportunity to expedite permitting reform that we have here in New York City, so we can have more outdoor events and live streaming of these matches, and bring the tournament to schoolchildren across the five boroughs. Now we know how he wants to fix FIFA and New York City, is there anything Mamdani would change about soccer itself? “I've become a hater of VAR (video assistant referees),” he sighs. Is this finally going to be his team's year after three consecutive years of second-placed finishes in the Premier League? “There were a lot of jokes when we won the (Democrat) primary about how unexpected a feeling it must be for an Arsenal fan,” he says.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Concord-Carlisle High School junior Emmy O'Donnell was recently named to the U.S. Under-19 Women's National Soccer Team and U.S. Under-18 Youth National Team International Training Camp roster, according to a community announcement. "I am beyond excited for this opportunity and the special chance I have to play with these players," O'Donnell said in a statement. "Representing your country internationally is truly an honor and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity." Emmy is a standout soccer player for Concord-Carlisle High School and plays for FC Stars Blue in Lancaster, an elite-level premier soccer program, according to the announcement. At Concord-Carlisle, O'Donnell's coaches place her as a forward or midfielder, depending on strategy. With the FC Stars, she often plays wingback. In her freshman year, she scored six goals and had seven assists. Last season, she scored eight goals and added three assists, earning All-State honors. She is also a two-time Dual County All-League, First Team Eastern Massachusetts All-Star, an Elite Clubs National League New England Conference Player of the Year and was named to the ECNL Girls U-16 2023-24 All America Team. "Emmy is the best player in Massachusetts," Concord-Carlisle High School girls soccer coach Peter Fischelis said in a statement. The U.S. will face the Republic of Ireland's U-19s on Oct. 25 and Portugal's U-19s on Oct. 28, with both games taking place in Portugal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After a successful 2024/25 season with Chelsea, Enzo Maresca's stock in the game has grown massively. Since then, it has been claimed that Juventus have an interest in Maresca, and if the Italian wants to join them or another big club one day, it may not be too difficult for him to get a move. According to The Telegraph, Maresca has just signed up with Gestifute, an agency that is run by super-agent Jorge Mendes. Mendes is widely regarded as the most powerful agent in football, and his client list of managers includes the likes of former Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho and Aston Villa's Unai Emery. Ultimately, with Mendes behind him, it will not be hard for Maresca to find another club if he ever wants a new challenge, especially after his recent success at Stamford Bridge. However, Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali would be silly to let the former Leicester manager go so easily. Again, Maresca has done a magnificent job in west London after winning the Club World Cup and Conference League trophies and securing Champions League qualification. Maresca has been doing that at Chelsea while getting results. For example, it was recently reported that Maresca promised to give Marc Guiu an opportunity if he kept working hard in training. Maresca delivered on that promise and ended up getting a very promising performance from Guiu in Chelsea's 3-0 victory over Nottingham Forest last Saturday. One option that Chelsea would surely have to consider is Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola. Based on his style and Premier League experience, Iraola would be ideal for Chelsea. The World Cup winner is doing an excellent job at Como right now, recently leading them to a 2-0 victory against Juventus in Serie A.</p>
