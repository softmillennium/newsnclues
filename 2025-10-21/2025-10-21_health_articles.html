                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brain connectivity patterns and environmental factors predict which older adults will successfully increase physical activity after receiving a cardiovascular diagnosis. Nagashree Thovinakere and colleagues studied 295 cognitively healthy but physically inactive older adults from the UK Biobank who received cardiovascular diagnoses during a roughly four-year period. The authors used machine learning to identify key predictive factors for physical activity behavior change, finding that a combined model incorporating brain imaging, behavioral, and contextual features achieved the strongest predictive performance. Important predictors included access to green spaces, social support from friends and family, executive function abilities, and specific patterns of brain connectivity between networks involved in self-control and planning. Participants who increased physical activity showed cognitive benefits, particularly in working memory and executive function. According to the authors, a multimodal brain-behavior fingerprint can help predict physical activity adherence, which could help clinicians. In addition, the importance of factors such as green space and social support can help guide policy to increase heart health at the population level. Individual motivation helps but structural and contextual factors also determine whether a person sticks with a heart-healthy exercise routine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Experiments demonstrate that gut bacteria can produce the important substance serotonin. The finding may lead to new future treatments. IBS, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, is a common gastrointestinal disorder, more common, in women, with symptoms such as abdominal pain, constipation or diarrhea. Previous research has shown that the bacteria in the gut, the gut microbiota, affects how much serotonin is produced by the host, but until now it has been unclear whether gut bacteria themselves can form biologically active serotonin. In the current study, published in the journal Cell Reports, the researchers have identified two bacteria that together can produce serotonin: Limosilactobacillus mucosae and Ligilactobacillus ruminis. "It is incredibly fascinating how the gut bacteria can produce bioactive signaling molecules that affect health", says Fredrik Bäckhed, Professor of molecular medicine at Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, and one of the leading authors of the study. The researchers were also able to see that people with IBS had lower levels of one of the bacteria (L. mucosae) in their stool compared to healthy individuals, and that this bacterium also has the enzyme required for serotonin production. Our results indicate that certain intestinal bacteria can produce bioactive serotonin and thus play an important role in intestinal health and open new avenues for the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders such as IBS." "Our findings indicate that intestinal bacteria can form signaling substances such as serotonin, which may be the key to understanding how the intestine and its inhabitants can affect our brain and the behavior," concludes Fredrik Bäckhed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A research team from the University of Zurich and the University Children's Hospital Zurich has developed a new approach for treating children with malignant tumors of the nervous system. By combining an approved drug with a specialized diet, they were able to slow down tumor growth and stimulate cancer cells to mature into normal nerve cells. Neuroblastomas are malignant tumors of the nervous system and rank among the most common and aggressive solid tumors in children. Most affected children are younger than five years of age. Particularly in high-risk neuroblastoma, the prognosis remains poor despite intensive treatment, with only half of children being cured. A research team led by Raphael Morscher, research group leader and attending physician at the University of Zurich (UZH) and the University Children's Hospital Zurich, has now developed a novel therapeutic approach together with international partners. DFMO inhibits the production of so-called polyamines, which play a key role in tumor cell growth in children. We discovered that the effectiveness of DFMO can be more than doubled in mice when a targeted, proline- and arginine-free diet is applied under controlled conditions." Raphael Morscher, research group leader and attending physician at the University of Zurich (UZH) and the University Children's Hospital Zurich This puts a stop to the tumor's unrestrained cell division, and the cells begin to transform into more mature nerve cells - a natural process that is blocked in neuroblastoma. It targets protein production in cancer cells by preventing specific genetic blueprints from being correctly read and translated. Raphael Morscher's research team is now collaborating with international partners at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Princeton University to prepare the therapy for clinical application. "To bring this innovative approach into clinical trials, we are using an enzyme that replaces the diet in children. Our goal is to offer affected children a new and gentler treatment option in the future," says Morscher.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An international research team led by the Medical University of Vienna has demonstrated for the first time that thyroid hormone plays a key role in the development and progression of prostate cancer. By blocking a specific thyroid hormone receptor, cancer growth was inhibited in both animal models and tumor cell cultures. The research team led by Olaf Merkel, Brigitte Hantusch and Lukas Kenner (all from the Clinical Department of Pathology at MedUni Vienna) and first author Aleksandra Fesiuk (Department of Biomedical Imaging and Image-guided Therapy at MedUni Vienna) focused on the role of the thyroid hormone receptor TRβ (thyroid hormone receptor beta) in tumor development. However, when TRβ was inhibited with NH-3, an active substance currently used only in research for the targeted blocking of TRβ, the growth of cancer cells decreased significantly. This effect was confirmed in animal models: tumors treated with NH-3 remained smaller or developed significantly more slowly. NH-3 proved particularly effective in models of so-called castration-resistant prostate cancer - a form that continues to grow despite hormone deprivation therapy and is currently difficult to treat. Blocking TRβ also led to a loss of the androgen receptor signal, which is normally activated by male sex hormones and plays a central role in the progression of the disease. Data from patient cohorts support these findings: tissue samples showed increased levels of TRβ in prostate tumours compared to healthy tissue. Furthermore, genetic analyses show that mutations in many prostate cancer patients alter thyroid hormone signalling pathways. However, most patients develop resistance to these therapies. Effective treatment options are currently limited at this stage. The latest findings have identified a previously unknown mechanism that opens up new perspectives: "Our results suggest that TRβ is not only a driver of tumor growth, but could also serve as a potential target for new drugs," says study leader Lukas Kenner. The study found that combining NH-3 with established androgen receptor inhibitors was particularly interesting, as it showed increased efficacy in preclinical experiments. Thyroid hormone receptor beta signaling is a targetable driver of prostate cancer growth.

Despite its prevalence, the disease physiology of endometriosis remains poorly understood and treatment options remain limited. Until now, drug development strategies to treat endometriosis have focused on intracellular mechanisms, failing to target the interaction between cells and the ECM, and have resulted in sub-optimal treatment efficacy. The Company is focused on building whole tissue models of disease, harnessing menstrual fluid, received from donations from an observational clinical trial, and lab-based modelling to uncover early biomarkers of disease and identify novel targets for drug development. Initially focused on endometriosis, Cyclana Bio's whole tissue-based methodology represents a promising approach to address other underserved chronic inflammatory diseases that share similar tissue-level mechanisms. Our mission at Cyclana is not just to close the gender health gap but propel women to the forefront of drug discovery. "Our goal is not just to develop new treatments, but to change the framework of biomedical discovery itself," Prof. Kevin Chalut, CSO and Co-Founder, Cyclana Bio, added. "By starting with women's health, we're addressing one of the greatest unmet needs in medicine. In doing so, we will not only cure a debilitating disease many women suffer from, we will also set the stage for a broader transformation in how we understand and treat chronic disease."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>By teaching artificial intelligence to spot every bite a child takes, scientists are revealing hidden eating patterns that could transform how we prevent obesity from the dinner table outward. Eating behaviors shed light on the risk for overconsumption and obesity. A new study published in the journal Frontiers in Nutrition presents a deep learning system to analyze bite behavior among children, using videos that record children's meals. Meal microstructure describes the various behaviors that occur during a bout of eating: bites, chews, bite rate, and bite size. Children who develop obesity are more likely to take larger bites and eat faster, both of which increase the amount of food consumed. Preventive interventions could be tailored using observed meal microstructure, providing a novel means of curbing this epidemic. The gold standard for analyzing bite and microstructure is manual observational coding, which involves manually viewing video recordings of children's eating behaviors and annotating them with timestamps. Though very reliable and accurate, this method is labor-intensive and requires large amounts of time, in addition to being costly. Compared to manual coding, automated bite detection systems could be much more efficient and scalable. However, these mostly use adult data from acoustic sensors and accelerometers, based on preset motion limits. Such sensors may misinterpret drinking, or gesturing, for instance, as bites. Again, various methods of eating (with spoons, chopsticks, or by hand) could cause issues with detection by increasing the difficulty of the act. Moreover, the wide variability of the act itself makes it difficult to automate its detection across different settings. These platforms may use location-based criteria (hand-face distance, mouth opening) or optical flow methods to track movements across successive frames. However, they cannot reliably distinguish eating behavior from other movements that are especially common in children. This has prompted interest in deep learning methods using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), mostly trained and tested on tightly controlled video recordings of eating, often by adults. In the real world, such videos are uncommon; the norm is poor lighting and differences in eating movements. Deep learning technology could help overcome interpretation difficulties caused by such artefacts. ByteTrack is a deep learning system that uses video-recorded child meals to find the bite count and bite rate. It was trained on 242 videos (1440 minutes) recorded from 94 children aged 7-9, who each completed four meal sessions one week apart. Two systems were used for this purpose, one focusing on rapid face recognition and the other on recognition in challenging situations when the face is partly blocked. The combination thus aims to achieve efficient and accurate face detection. The second uses this clean data to distinguish bite activity from other movements. For this purpose, an EfficientNet convolutional neural network (CNN) was combined with a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent network. ByteTrack testing showed high accuracy of recall and precision, at >98%. The second stage showed moderate performance in bite detection, achieving on average 79% precision, 68% recall, and an F1 score of ~71%. The reasons include rapid biting and falsely increasing bite detection. Later, children begin to lose interest in the food, which could produce more movement, including those that block the mouth, reducing bite detection. It had an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.66 with the gold-standard coding, though videos where the child moved too much or where hands or utensils blocked the mouth were less reliable. Even so, ByteTrack reflects real-world situations more accurately, with other people present while the child ate (around 80% of the recorded meals included additional people to simulate natural mealtime environments). It is less intrusive than other wearable sensors mounted on eyeglasses or bite counter watches that must be switched on and off, potentially disrupting the natural flow of the eating process. Though ByteTrack must be started and stopped manually, it is not yet optimized for real-time bite detection. Still, it remains less intrusive and closer to naturalistic observations than wearable systems. Smartphone cameras could be used for natural recording in the future, and combined with platforms like ByteTrack, provided data privacy can be ensured. The time and effort saved by such technological applications is enormous, indicating a vast need for their development. In addition, these eliminate sources of human error like fatigue, inexperience, and misinterpretation by using the same criteria to interpret all videos. Further enhancement is needed before such platforms are available for real-time use. This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of a scalable, automated tool for bite detection in children's meals.” ByteTrack is the first automated system specifically developed to analyze pediatric eating behavior, and its moderate success is encouraging. The limitations of this method were apparent, and newer techniques need to be devised to increase reliability in the presence of occlusions or with high movement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) released a new clinical practice guideline on the surveillance of Barrett's esophagus, the only known precursor to esophageal cancer (adenocarcinoma), a highly lethal cancer whose incidence has risen substantially over recent decades. The guideline provides eight evidence-based recommendations and several key implementation statements to help clinicians monitor patients after a diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus, a condition associated with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). What's novel here is our move away from a one-size-fits-all approach. The guideline emphasizes the need for regular monitoring in many patients with Barrett's esophagus who do not exhibit dysplasia or cancerous changes, while noting situations where monitoring isn't necessary (such as very small segments measuring less than 1 cm). It also provides clear recommendations on when monitoring can be safely stopped, considering age, overall health, and potential benefits. For patients who merit surveillance, AGA strongly recommends using high-definition white-light endoscopy in combination with chromoendoscopy to improve detection of Barrett 's-related neoplasia, paired with structured sampling protocols and expert pathology review of abnormal cells, called neoplasia. The panel also suggests daily proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy as the preferred preventive strategy over no PPI therapy and over anti-reflux surgery. Key implementation statements have focused on tailoring surveillance intervals based on the length of the Barrett's segment, and surveillance strategies for patients with Barrett's esophagus diagnosed with indefinite dysplasia or low-grade dysplasia. To address emerging but still evolving technologies, the guideline makes no recommendation for or against the routine use of advanced sampling techniques or biomarkers. Instead, it provides practical guidance for clinicians who choose to use these tests, while highlighting ongoing studies that will define their future role. "We believe these are exciting technologies that will, in the future, significantly impact how we manage patients with Barrett's esophagus," said guideline author Perica Davitkov, MD. "Our guideline provides, for the first time, direction on how these tools might be applied in both community and academic centers. Patients with Barrett's esophagus-related dysplasia or cancer should be referred to specialized centers for management. The guideline panel does not expect any impacts on cost or access, as chromoendoscopy is already integrated into modern endoscopic systems and PPIs are widely available. Training and implementation remain essential to ensure that the benefits of these recommendations are realized in practice. In patients undergoing surveillance endoscopy for Barrett's esophagus, AGA makes no recommendation for or against the use of wide-area transepithelial sampling as an adjunctive sampling technique to a structured biopsy protocol. In patients diagnosed with nondysplastic Barrett's esophagus, Barrett's esophagus with indefinite for dysplasia, or Barrett's esophagus with low-grade dysplasia, AGA makes no recommendation for or against the routine use of p53 assessment as an adjunct test to histopathology to predict progression to high-grade dysplasia or esophageal adenocarcinoma. In patients diagnosed with nondysplastic Barrett's esophagus, Barrett's esophagus with indefinite for dysplasia, or Barrett's esophagus with low-grade dysplasia, AGA makes no recommendation for or against the routine use of Tissue Cypher testing as an adjunct test to histopathology. In patients with Barrett's esophagus, AGA suggests the use of PPIs over surgery for the prevention of neoplastic progression to high-grade dysplasia or esophageal adenocarcinoma. These changes happen in a small number of patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Barrett's esophagus is a change in the type of cell that occurs in the esophagus and does not typically cause any symptoms. Tobacco use and being overweight are important risks for developing Barrett's esophagus. Most people with Barrett's esophagus do not get cancer, but because the risk is higher than for people without Barrett's esophagus, it is recommended to monitor for changes over time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Women are significantly more likely than men to develop Alzheimer's disease. Earlier age at menopause is associated with a greater risk for late-life cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. A new study suggests that this risk is even higher in women who carry the APOE e4 gene variant or who have systemic inflammation. There are a number of reasons why women are more likely than men to develop Alzheimer's disease, including women's longer life expectancy, hormonal changes and genetic predispositions like the APOE4 gene. In a new study involving nearly 2600 women, researchers investigated whether the association between age at menopause and memory decline was modified by the APOE e4 genotype and/or systemic inflammatory markers. They found that APOE e4 carriers showed the strongest association between earlier menopause and faster memory decline. In more than 250 participants with available data for inflammatory markers, higher levels of inflammation exacerbated the effect of earlier menopause on memory decline. As a result, the researchers concluded that the presence of APOE e4 and age-related inflammation strengthened the link between earlier age at menopause and faster memory decline, suggesting that these factors may be especially salient contributors to Alzheimer's disease dementia risk in women with earlier menopause. Approximately 20% of Alzheimer's therapeutics in development target genetic and inflammatory factors. Yet, sex differences and female-specific risk factors like menopause are often overlooked in clinical trials. "Given that women are at greater risk for Alzheimer's disease than men, understanding the nuanced sex- and gender-specific mechanisms underlying these differences is essential for the development of targeted, individualized preventive and treatment strategies," says Dr. Stephanie Faubion, medical director for The Menopause Society.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new cancer clinical trial by the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group (ECOG-ACRIN) shows that a drug that utilizes the body's immune system to target and eliminate cancer cells appeared to reduce the risk of distant metastases for an aggressive form of skin cancer when given immediately after surgery, but did not significantly reduce the overall risk of recurrence, which was a co-primary endpoint of the trial. The STAMP trial found that after two years, 73% of patients receiving pembrolizumab showed no cancer recurrence, compared with 66% among those who did not receive the drug. Although this difference did not reach statistical significance, patients receiving pembrolizumab had a 42% lower risk of developing distant metastases-cancer spreading to organs such as the liver, lungs, or bones – which was a secondary objective of the study. "The STAMP trial provides the first evidence that immunotherapy with pembrolizumab after surgery may help people with Merkel cell carcinoma by preventing their cancer from returning in organs considered distant from the site of the original disease," said lead investigator Janice M. Mehnert, MD, co-chair of the ECOG-ACRIN Melanoma Committee and director of Melanoma and Cutaneous Medical Oncology at NYU Langone Health's Perlmutter Cancer Center. Merkel cell carcinoma is a fast-growing cancer that begins in the skin's sensory cells, often appearing as a single, painless bump on sun-exposed areas. Although skin cancer is by far the most common type of cancer in the United States, Merkel cell carcinoma, also called neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin, is highly uncommon, occurring in no more than three out of one million people annually. It is extremely aggressive, with fewer than half of patients surviving 5 years after diagnosis. The phase 3 multicenter study (NCT03712605) was conducted from 2018 to 2023 and involved 293 patients whose tumors had been surgically removed. Some participants also received radiation as advised by their physicians. Because Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare tumor, Mehnert emphasized that national collaboration is essential for recruiting patients for a trial of this scale. Its mechanism of action involves blocking the PD-1 protein receptor, which cancer cells exploit to evade immune attack. Pembrolizumab allows immune cells to detect and attack tumors more effectively. It is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (brand name KEYTRUDA®) for treating recurrent locally advanced or metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pre-eclampsia is one of the most serious complications in pregnancy, affecting millions of women and newborns worldwide and potentially life-threatening. Now, a research team led by the Medical University of Vienna has discovered a previously unknown mechanism that plays a decisive role in the development of pre-eclampsia. The results, currently published in the journal Nature Communications, could open up new possibilities for diagnosis and treatment. Led by Claudia Gundacker, Sebastian Granitzer and Raimund Widhalm (all from the Institute of Medical Genetics at MedUni Vienna), the research team investigated why the so-called sFlt-1/PlGF ratio - a blood value that is considered the most important indicator of impending pre-eclampsia - becomes unbalanced in affected pregnant women. These two molecules work together to control angiogenesis, and to protect cells from oxidative stress - i.e., from an excess of harmful oxygen compounds. Even more significant is the finding that this mechanism is dysregulated in pre-eclampsia," explains study leader Claudia Gundacker. A better understanding of these mechanisms opens up new possibilities for the diagnosis and treatment of pre-eclampsia - and thus for the health of mothers and children." Pre-eclampsia usually occurs in the second or third trimester of pregnancy. The disease is characterised by high blood pressure and increased protein excretion in the urine and, without timely treatment, can lead to serious complications for both mother and child. Often, the only option is early delivery. Women and children affected by pre-eclampsia also have an increased risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases later in life. The new findings from MedUni Vienna help to better understand the disease at a molecular level and could, in the long term, help to develop new approaches to diagnosis and treatment.

The research, led by Murdoch Children's Research Institute (MCRI) and the University of Melbourne, found that sex-specific blood proteins in transgender women shifted significantly after six months of gender-affirming hormone therapy, resembling those of cisgender women. MCRI Associate Professor Boris Novakovic said remarkably the therapy reduced protein biomarkers related to male reproduction and fertility and increased those that drive body fat, breast development, immune function and good heart health. Published in Nature Medicine, the study involved 40 adult trans women recruited from the Austin Hospital who had more than 5,000 blood proteins examined. The research team also compared the protein changes to those seen in cisgender women by using samples from 55,000 people stored in a UK biobank. It found gender-affirming hormone therapy changed seven of the 10 key proteins that are normally different between males and females, proving that sex hormones strongly influence blood biomarkers to help better align with a person's gender identity. The changes reflected those seen in women undergoing hormone replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms. Associate Professor Novakovic said the findings showed changes to sex hormones induced by gender-affirming hormone therapy could have a big influence on reshaping key blood biomarkers that were linked to certain health conditions. "For transgender women we found gender affirming hormone therapy alters the levels of many protein biomarkers that reflect what happens clinically," he said. This may go onto impact the risk of allergic and autoimmune diseases, which tend to affect more females, but decrease the risk of heart disease, more commonly seen in males. Associate Professor Novakovic said the findings stressed the need for more nuanced approaches to long-term health monitoring for those undergoing gender-affirming hormone therapy. Additionally, healthcare providers should consider the similarities to cisgender women's health risks and the unique aspects of trans women's health, he said. "We need to improve the way gender-affirming hormone therapy is managed. This study gives us a glimpse into how personalised treatment may work as technology advances."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A tiny wireless chip implanted in the back of the eye and a pair of high-tech glasses have partially restored vision to people with an advanced form of age-related macular degeneration. In a clinical trial led by Stanford Medicine researchers and international collaborators, 27 out of 32 participants had regained the ability to read a year after receiving the device. With digital enhancements enabled by the device, such as zoom and higher contrast, some participants could read with acuity equivalent to 20/42 vision. The device, called PRIMA, developed at Stanford Medicine, is the first eye prosthesis to restore functional sight to patients with incurable vision loss, giving them the ability to perceive shapes and patterns - also known as form vision. "All previous attempts to provide vision with prosthetic devices resulted in basically light sensitivity, not really form vision," said Daniel Palanker, PhD, a professor of ophthalmology and a co-senior author of the paper. "We are the first to provide form vision." The lead author is Frank Holz, MD, professor of ophthalmology at the University of Bonn in Germany. The two-part device consists of a small camera, mounted on a pair of glasses, that captures images and projects them in real time via infrared light to a wireless chip in the eye. Palanker first imagined such a device 20 years ago, when he was working with ophthalmic lasers used to treat eye conditions. "I realized we should use the fact that the eye is transparent and deliver information by light," he said. Daniel Palanker, PhD, Professor, Ophthalmology, Stanford Medicine Participants in the new trial had an advanced form of age-related macular degeneration, known as geographic atrophy, that gradually erodes central vision. But most patients retain some photoreceptor cells that allow peripheral vision as well as the retinal neurons that relay information from photoreceptors. The new device takes advantage of what is preserved. The chip is sensitive to infrared light projected from the glasses, unlike real photoreceptors that respond only to visible light. The design means patients can use their natural peripheral vision along with the prosthetic central vision, which helps with orientation and navigation. "The fact that they see simultaneously prosthetic and peripheral vision is important because they can merge and use vision to its fullest," Palanker said. Because the chip is photovoltaic, meaning it needs only light to generate electric current, it can operate wirelessly and be implanted under the retina. The new trial included 38 patients older than 60 who had geographic atrophy due to age-related macular degeneration and worse than 20/320 vision in at least one eye. Four to five weeks after implantation of the chip in one eye, patients began using the glasses. Though some patients could make out patterns immediately, all patients' visual acuity improved over months of training. Of the 32 patients who completed the one-year trial, 27 could read and 26 demonstrated clinically meaningful improvement in visual acuity, which was defined as the ability to read at least two additional lines on a standard eye chart. The participants used the prosthesis in their daily lives to read books, food labels and subway signs. Two-thirds reported medium to high user satisfaction with the device. None were life-threatening, and almost all resolved within two months. For now, the PRIMA device provides only black-and-white vision, with no shades in between, but Palanker is developing software that will soon enable the full range of grayscale. "Number one on the patients' wish list is reading, but number two, very close behind, is face recognition," he said. He is also engineering chips that will offer higher resolution vision. The new version, already tested in rats, may have pixels as small as 20 microns wide, with 10,000 pixels on each chip. Palanker also wants to test the device for other types of blindness caused by lost photoreceptors. "The next generation of the chip, with smaller pixels, will have better resolution and be paired with sleeker-looking glasses." "But with electronic zoom, they could get close to 20/20."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a city, coworking hubs bring people and ideas together. Inside cancer cells, similar hubs form-but instead of fueling progress, they supercharge disease. Their new study, published in Nature Communications, shows how RNA-normally just a messenger-gets hijacked to build liquid-like "droplet hubs" in the nucleus. These hubs act as command centers, switching on growth-promoting genes. The cancer they're investigating, called translocation renal cell carcinoma (tRCC), affects children and young adults and currently has almost no effective therapies. It is caused by TFE3 oncofusions-hybrid genes formed when chromosomes swap and fuse in the wrong places. Until now, how these fusion proteins drove such aggressive tumors remained unclear. The Texas A&M team found that these fusions enlist RNA as structural scaffolds. These droplets become transcriptional hubs-hotspots that switch on cancer-promoting genes. "RNA itself is not just a passive messenger, but an active player that helps build these condensates," said Yun Huang, PhD, professor at the Texas A&M Health Institute of Biosciences and Technology and senior author. The researchers also discovered that an RNA-binding protein called PSPC1 acts as a stabilizer, reinforcing the droplets and making them even more powerful engines for tumor growth. To untangle this hidden process, the team leaned on some of today's most advanced tools in molecular biology: Tumor growth ground to a halt in both lab-grown cancer cells and mouse models. "This is exciting because tRCC has very few effective treatment options today," said Yubin Zhou, MD, PhD, professor and director of the Center for Translational Cancer Research. "Targeting condensate formation gives us a brand-new angle to attack the cancer, one that traditional drugs have not addressed. It opens the door to therapies that are much more precise and potentially less toxic." "By mapping how these fusion proteins interact with RNA and other cellular partners, we are not only explaining why this cancer is so aggressive but also revealing weak spots that can be therapeutically exploited," said Lei Guo, PhD, research assistant professor at the Institute of Biosciences and Technology. Because many pediatric cancers are also driven by fusion proteins, the implications extend far beyond tRCC. This research not only explains how the cancer organizes its growth machinery but also offers a tangible way to stop it. This research highlights the power of fundamental science to generate new hope for young patients facing devastating diseases." Yun Huang, PhD, Professor, Institute of Biosciences and Technology, Texas A&M Health Just like cutting power to a coworking hub halts all the activity inside, dissolving cancer's "droplet hubs" could shut down its ability to grow. Guo, L., et al. (2025) RNA-mediated condensation of TFE3 oncofusions facilitates transcriptional hub formation to promote translocation renal cell carcinoma.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study led by Rice University's Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede has revealed that protein clumps, or plaques that clog the brain, associated with Parkinson's disease are not merely waste; they can actively drain energy from brain cells. These clumps, composed of a protein called alpha-synuclein, were found to break down adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the molecule responsible for powering nearly all cellular activities. This unexpected finding could change scientists' understanding of the damage caused by these clumps, which are hallmarks of diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. "We were astonished to see that amyloids, long thought to be inert waste, can actively cleave ATP," said Wittung-Stafshede, professor and the Charles W. Duncan Jr.-Welch Chair in Chemistry and Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas Scholar. They first tested whether these clumps, which contain ordered protein aggregates that adopt amyloid shapes, could break down simple chemical compounds before progressing to the actual biological substrate, ATP. To understand this process, the research team employed advanced imaging techniques, specifically cryo-electron microscopy, collaborating with specialists in Switzerland. This pocket is lined with positive charges that facilitate the breakdown of ATP. Wittung-Stafshede, Professor and the Charles W. Duncan Jr.-Welch Chair in Chemistry, Rice University This research suggests that protein clumps in the brain may cause more harm than previously believed. By breaking down ATP, these clumps could disrupt essential cellular functions, including the systems responsible for clearing them away. Given the ability of the protein clumps to change shape upon binding to specific molecules, scientists see potential for developing treatments. If small molecule drugs can lock these clumps into harmless shapes, it could help mitigate their harmful effects. The study also implies that natural substances in the brain may influence the shapes of protein clumps in patients, possibly explaining why distinct clump shapes are found in different neurodegenerative diseases. To test if amyloid chemical reactivity occurs in mixtures of components from real brain cells, the researchers exposed extracts from neuronal cells to the protein clumps. They found that many compounds in the mixture underwent chemical changes, indicating that the clumps act on several molecules present in cells in addition to ATP. If the findings are confirmed within living cells, this discovery could help explain why brain cells in diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's face energy shortages, DNA damage and other forms of chemical stress that ultimately lead to cell death. As these diseases become more prevalent with an aging global population, identifying new underlying mechanisms such as this enzymatic activity could lead to improved treatments or even prevention. "We want to learn how to stop neurodegenerative diseases at the source, directly detoxifying damaging species, instead of just treating symptoms as we do today," Wittung‑Stafshede said. Co-authors of this study include Lukas Frey and Roland Riek from ETH Zürich and Fiamma Ayelen Buratti, Istvan Horvath, Shraddha Parate and Ranjeet Kumar from Chalmers University of Technology.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new benchtop analyzer from Siemens Healthineers is making quality drug testing easier to perform, to help prevent inaccurate results no matter where, or by whom, testing is conducted. It also offers automated specimen validity testing to detect substitution, adulteration, and dilution of urine samples, to flag suspicious samples early and prevent the bottleneck that delays results when creative methods to cover up recreational or illegal drug use are attempted. While drug testing is commonly known for determining whether harmful substances are present in one's system or being misused, it also provides important information that helps doctors care for their patients. Determining potential drug interactions, ensuring prescribed medications are metabolized within therapeutic ranges, and optimizing medication dosing are all important drug testing needs that depend upon reliable results. Quality should be non-negotiable when the stakes for drug testing are so high. We engineered an easy-to-use, reliable, and highly productive instrument that offers flexible testing capabilities to match individual drug testing needs and reduce operational costs that are top of program directors' minds." Duncan Porter, head of Syva, Immulite, and Plasma Proteins for Siemens Healthineers The Atellica DT 250 Analyzer, which is now widely available globally, streamlines drug testing capabilities previously limited to larger, floor-standing models onto one benchtop analyzer. It can process 225 test results per hour, a 69% increase in productivity over the legacy Viva-ProE drug testing system from Siemens Healthineers, with first results provided in as soon as eight minutes. The instrument relies on widely validated reagents, the trusted Syva EMIT technology, and offers an immunoassay menu of more than 65 assays for use with urine, serum, and plasma (blood) samples.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trachoma, a neglected tropical disease (NTD) and the world's leading infectious cause of blindness, no longer poses a public health threat in the country. Trachoma is the first NTD to be eliminated in Fiji. Fiji is the 26th country to eliminate trachoma as a public health problem and the 58th country globally to eliminate at least one NTD. Future generations of Fijians have been given a precious gift in being set free from the suffering that trachoma has inflicted on their ancestors." Trachoma is caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis and spreads through personal contact, interactions with contaminated surfaces and on flies that have been in contact with eye or nose discharge of an infected person. Repeated infections can lead to scarring, in-turning of the eyelids, and ultimately blindness. Globally, the disease remains endemic in many vulnerable communities where access to clean water and sanitation is limited. "Fiji's success in eliminating trachoma is a beacon of what's possible when communities, governments, and partners unite behind a shared goal", said Dr Saia Ma'u Piukala, WHO Regional Director for the Western Pacific. WHO congratulates Fiji and is committed to supporting countries across the Region in advancing health for all so that no one is left behind." Trachoma was once a significant public health problem in Fiji, with medical reports from the 1930s and community-based surveys in the 1950s documenting widespread disease and risk of blindness. Concern however was renewed in the 2000s, when rapid assessments suggested high levels of active trachoma in children, prompting the Ministry of Health and Medical Services to launch a comprehensive programme to better understand the situation and take necessary action. Since 2012, Fiji has undertaken a series of robust, internationally supported surveys and studies, including population-based prevalence surveys and laboratory testing, to understand the local epidemiology of trachoma and distinguish it from other causes of eye disease. "This achievement reflects years of coordinated action – across villages, health facilities and regional platforms – demonstrating unwavering commitment of our health- care workers, communities leading the change. As we celebrate this milestone, we call on our donors and partners in the Pacific and beyond to continue supporting accelerated action of neglected tropical diseases to address other diseases not only in Fiji, but across the Pacific". They are mainly prevalent mostly among impoverished communities in tropical areas. WHO estimates that NTDs affect more than 1 billion people. Since 2016, 13 Member States in the Western Pacific Region, which covers 38 countries and areas, have been validated by WHO for eliminating at least one NTD. Of these, six (Cambodia, China, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and Viet Nam) have successfully eliminated trachoma as a public health problem. WHO continues to support countries in their efforts to eliminate trachoma and other NTDs, ensuring healthier lives for all, particularly the most disadvantaged.
